Integrative Body-Mind-Spirit Social Work,Mo Yee Lee,Oxford University Press,2009-03-25,"In recent years, interest in non-Western curative techniques among Americans has grown by leaps and bounds. Integrative Body-Mind-Spirit Social Work is the first book to strongly connect Western therapeutic techniques with Eastern philosophy and practices, while also providing a comprehensive and pragmatic agenda for social work, and mental health professionals. This breakthrough text, written by a cast of highly regarded researchers from both Asia and America, presents a holistic, therapeutic approach that ties Eastern philosophy and practical techniques to Western forms of therapy in order to help bring about positive, transformative changes in individuals and families.Integrative therapy focuses on the mind-body-spirit relationship, recognizes spirituality as a fundamental domain of human existence, acknowledges and utilizes the mind's power as well as the body's, and reaches beyond self-actualization or symptom reduction to broaden a perception of self that connects individuals to a larger sense of themselves and to their communities. Here, the authors provide a pragmatic, step-by-step description of assessment and treatment techniques that employ an integrative, holistic perspective. They begin by establishing the conceptual framework of integrative body-mind-spirit social work, then expertly describe, step-by-step, assessment and treatment techniques that utilize integrative and holistic perspectives. Several case studies demonstrate the approach in action, such as one with breast cancer patients who participated in body-mind-spirit and social support groups and another in which trauma survivors used meditation to get onto a path of healing. These examples provide solid empirical evidence that integrative body-mind-spirit social work is indeed a practical therapeutic approach in bringing about tangible changes in clients. The authors also discuss ethical issues and give tips for learning integrative body-mind-spirit social work.Professionals in social work, psychology, counseling, and nursing, as well as graduate students in courses on integral, alternative, or complementary clinical practice will find this a much-needed resource that complements the growing interest in alternatives to traditional Western psychotherapy.",Political Science,417,N/A,0,en

Amplify the voice of Witches of Color by reading their stories."" —Juliet Diaz, author of Witchery and Plant Witchery There is a new kind of witch emerging in our cultural consciousness: the bruja. Witchcraft has made a comeback in popular culture, especially among feminists. A growing subculture of BIPOC witches, led by Afro-Caribbean immigrants, Indigenous Americans, and other witches of color, is reclaiming their ancestral traditions and contributing their voices to the feminist witchcraft of today. Brujas chronicles the magical lives of these practitioners as they develop their healing arts, express their progressive politics, and extend their personal rituals into community activism. They are destigmatizing the ""witch"" of their ancestries and bringing persecuted traditions to the open to challenge cultural appropriation and spiritual consumerism.

The Answer Is . . .,Alex Trebek,Simon & Schuster,2020-07-21,"A RECOMMENDED SUMMER READ BY THE NEW YORK TIMES, USA TODAY, TIME, AND NEWSWEEK Longtime Jeopardy! host and television icon Alex Trebek reflects on his life and career. Since debuting as the host of Jeopardy! in 1984, Alex Trebek has been something like a family member to millions of television viewers, bringing entertainment and education into their homes five nights a week. Last year, he made the stunning announcement that he had been diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer. What followed was an incredible outpouring of love and kindness. Social media was flooded with messages of support, and the Jeopardy! studio received boxes of cards and letters offering guidance, encouragement, and prayers. For over three decades, Trebek had resisted countless appeals to write a book about his life. Yet he was moved so much by all the goodwill, he felt compelled to finally share his story. “I want people to know a little more about the person they have been cheering on for the past year,” he writes in The Answer Is…: Reflections on My Life. The book combines illuminating personal anecdotes with Trebek’s thoughts on a range of topics, including marriage, parenthood, education, success, spirituality, and philanthropy. Trebek also addresses the questions he gets asked most often by Jeopardy! fans, such as what prompted him to shave his signature mustache, his insights on legendary players like Ken Jennings and James Holzhauer, and his opinion of Will Ferrell’s Saturday Night Live impersonation. The book uses a novel structure inspired by Jeopardy!, with each chapter title in the form of a question, and features dozens of never-before-seen photos that candidly capture Trebek over the years. This wise, charming, and inspiring book is further evidence why Trebek has long been considered one of the most beloved and respected figures in entertainment.",Biography & Autobiography,304,N/A,0,en

A full ninety percent of the patients who seek out my services are so stressed it's taking a toll on their health--they're experiencing lack of sleep, irritability, anxiety, and even actual medical conditions such as autoimmune diseases, infertility, digestive issues, diabetes, migraines, and cardiovascular illness. Most of them have already been to their primary care physician and left with a prescription for Lexapro, hoping that will help. When Lexapro didn't work, they moved on to Zoloft, then Celexa. But they don't get the sense of relief they're craving. In fact, what they've gotten is a new set of side effects that they now have to manage. They're looking for a different way, and that's why they call me. Maybe they heard me speak on mindfulness at a health conference, or they took one of my yoga classes that I teach every week. Many find me by searching for ""stress relief"" on the Psychology Today website.

Oathbringer,Brandon Sanderson,Stormlight Archive,2018-10-04,"'Brandon Sanderson is one of the greatest fantasy writers' FANTASY BOOK REVIEW From the bestselling author who completed Robert Jordan's epic Wheel of Time series comes a new, original creation that matches anything else in modern fantasy for epic scope, thrilling imagination, superb characters and sheer addictiveness. In Oathbringer, the third volume of the New York Times bestselling Stormlight Archive series, humanity faces a new Desolation with the return of the Voidbringers, a foe whose numbers are as great as their thirst for vengeance. The Alethi armies commanded by Dalinar Kholin won a fleeting victory at a terrible cost: The enemy Parshendi summoned the violent Everstorm, and now its destruction sweeps the world and its passing awakens the once peaceful and subservient parshmen to the true horror of their millennia-long enslavement by humans. While on a desperate flight to warn his family of the threat, Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with the fact that their newly kindled anger may be wholly justified. Nestled in the mountains high above the storms, in the tower city of Urithiru, Shallan Davar investigates the wonders of the ancient stronghold of the Knights Radiant and unearths the dark secrets lurking in its depths. And Dalinar realizes that his holy mission to unite his homeland of Alethkar was too narrow in scope. Unless all the nations of Roshar can put Dalinar's blood-soaked past aside and stand together - and unless Dalinar himself can confront that past - even the restoration of the Knights Radiant will not avert the end of civilization.

Fortunately, as this engrossing book demonstrates, the damage is not irreparable. Today, patients voice their desires to be seen not just as bodies, but as whole people. Though not willing to give up scientific progress and all it has to offer, they sense the need for more. Patients want a form of medicine that can heal them in body and soul. This movement is reflected in medical school curricula, in which courses in spirituality and health care are taught alongside anatomy and physiology. But how can health care workers translate these concepts into practice? How can they strike an appropriate balance, integrating and affirming spirituality without abandoning centuries of science or unwittingly adopting pseudoscience? Physician and philosopher Daniel Sulmasy is uniquely qualified to guide readers through this terrain. At the outset of this accessible, engaging volume, he explores the nature of illness and healing, focusing on health care's rich history as a spiritual practice and on the human dignity of the patient. Combining sound theological reflection with doses of healthy skepticism, he goes on to describe empirical research on the effects of spirituality on health, including scientific studies of the healing power of prayer, emphasizing that there are reasons beyond even promising research data to attend to the souls of patients. Finally, Sulmasy devotes special attention and compassion to the care of people at the end of life, incorporating the stories of several of his patients. Throughout, the author never strays from the theme that, for physicians, attending to the spiritual needs of patients should not be a moral option, but a moral obligation. This book is an essential resource for scholars and students of medicine and medical ethics and especially medical students and health care professionals.",Medical,268,N/A,0,en

Rebel Witch,Kelly-Ann Maddox,Watkins Media Limited,2021-04-13,"A truly contemporary take on how to be a witch, Rebel Witch is an antidote to the cookie-cutter witchcraft agenda that gives a new perspective on the craft, asking each reader to create a powerful, personalized practice that taps into the current mood of female empowerment and spiritual rebellion. Rebel Witch reminds witches of the wondrous opportunity to jump into experimentation and invent something wild and individual, a practice shaped by their individual personality and life journey, rather than allowing themselves to be spoon-fed. It challenges witches to design a nurturing practice that is truly theirs. There's information about all the elements of the craft, from energy raising, sacred space creation and receiving signs to casting spells, holding rituals, scrying, potions and much more … crucially, in each case the topic is discussed from an exciting contemporary perspective. So, when Kelly-Ann talks about sacred texts, she stresses that you can choose the texts that resonate with you – so why not Alice in Wonderland or Narnia? Maybe you want to move away from the traditional Wheel of the Year and create your own divisions? Instead of honouring a traditional deity, why not construct your own, choosing elements from rock stars, movie icons or fictional heroes? Or embody magical signs in your clothing and jewellery? Creativity and experimentation are encouraged, with tips to help the reader to be inventive. A curious reader with a desire to create an inspired, deeply personal path and free themselves from conformity will finish the book ready to take action and make magick happen!","Body, Mind & Spirit",291,N/A,0,en

You're practically getting 3 books in 1 and, it's one of those books that will undoubtedly end up with many dog-eared pages and which you will refer to again and again! It goes beyond personality type! You'll find: A radically compassionate and spacious approach to recognizing the roots of inner struggle; How your Enneagram type's personality patterns present specific obstacles to real presence; Your unique pathways for liberating yourself from inner confines--one size does not fit all; Ways to cultivate a strong core foundation and your innate capacity for wholeness; The connection of your personal well-being to global well-being; and, Full acceptance of both your human nature and the eternal, divine spark within. Deep Living reveals how we unknowingly avoid vulnerable aspects of ourselves, relying instead on familiar personality patterns that distance us from our deepest nature. As a result, rather than experiencing ourselves as whole and integral to the fabric of life we feel separate, even from ourselves. Drawing on the sacred psychology of the Enneagram and the power of presence, this book guides us in recovering more of who we really are. With compassion, wisdom, and practical insight, the author helps us cultivate our innate capacities for wholeness, leading to an intimate, transformed relationship with ourselves. This is clearly a must-have book for healing the roots of struggle.

In our pursuit of success, we often struggle to balance the world’s demands with our own dreams. Some of us pursue Outer Success, wanting to be liked and loved, supported and promoted. But in our quest for worldly glory, we may ignore the subtle stirring of our spirit, waking up one day to realize just how far we have drifted from our personal ideals. Others among us seek Inner Success, wanting the freedom to pursue our own calling. But in our quest to be true to ourselves, we may end up hurting, disappointing, or antagonizing others, straining relationships and being sidelined. It seems that our drives for Outer and Inner Success are destined to clash. But perhaps that’s only because we’ve been searching for success in the wrong places. We can pursue from the place where our greatest potential is held, our Inner Core, by activating Five Core Energies: Purpose, Wisdom, Growth, Love, and Self-Realization. Through extensive scientific research and masterful storytelling about exemplary figures like Mahatma Gandhi, Abraham Lincoln, Mother Theresa, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Nelson Mandela—and everyday heroes drawn from Dr. Hitendra Wadhwa’s class at Columbia Business School and client workshops at Mentora Institute—readers arrive at timeless principles of success in life and leadership. Empowered by your Five Core Energies, you discover how to create outer impact from a place of inner mastery.

The Ancient Language of Sacred Sound,David Elkington,Simon and Schuster,2021-04-06,"• Details how sacred sites resonate at the same frequencies as both the Earth and the alpha waves of the human brain • Shows how human writing in its original hieroglyphic form was a direct response to the divine sound patterns of sacred sites • Explains how ancient hero myths from around the world relate to divine acoustic science and formed the source of religion The Earth resonates at an extremely low frequency. Known as “the Schumann Resonance,” this natural rhythm of the Earth precisely corresponds with the human brain’s alpha wave frequencies--the frequency at which we enter into and come out of sleep as well as the frequency of deep meditation, inspiration, and problem solving. Sound experiments reveal that sacred sites and structures like stupas, pyramids, and cathedrals also resonate at these special frequencies when activated by chanting and singing. Did our ancestors build their sacred sites according to the rhythms of the Earth? Exploring the acoustic connections between the Earth, the human brain, and sacred spaces, David Elkington shows how humanity maintained a direct line of communication with Mother Earth and the Divine through the construction of sacred sites, such as Stonehenge, Newgrange, Machu Picchu, Chartres Cathedral, and the pyramids of both Egypt and Mexico. He reveals how human writing in its original hieroglyphic form was a direct response to the divine sound patterns of sacred sites, showing how, for example, recognizable hieroglyphs appear in sand patterns when the sacred frequencies of the Great Pyramid are activated. Looking at ancient hero legends--those about the bringers of important knowledge or language--Elkington explains how these myths form the source of ancient religion and have a unique mythological resonance, as do the sites associated with them. The author then reveals how religion, including Christianity, is an ancient language of acoustic science given expression by the world’s sacred sites and shows that power places played a profound role in the development of human civilization.","Body, Mind & Spirit",583,N/A,0,en
Sacred Contracts,Caroline Myss,Harmony,2013-09-04,"Caroline Myss, author of the New York Times bestsellers Anatomy of the Spirit and Why People Don’t Heal and How They Can, presents an exciting, highly original program in this long-awaited book. Based on her internationally popular workshop of the same name, Sacred Contracts is a brilliant synthesis of psychology, healing guidance, and spiritual insight. As a medical intuitive, Myss has found that people often don’t understand their purpose in life, which has led to a spiritual malaise of epidemic proportions. This metaphysical disease in turn leads to depression, anxiety, fatigue, and eventually physical illness. But our purpose—our individual Sacred Contract—is often difficult to apprehend. For this reason, Myss developed an enjoyable and ingenious process for deciphering your own Contract using a new theory of archetypes that builds on the works of Jung, Plato, and contemporary thinkers. She first recounts how the concept of Sacred Contracts took form in myths and other cultural traditions through the ages. She then examines the lives of the spiritual masters and prophets—Abraham, Jesus, the Buddha, and Muhammad—whose archetypal journeys illustrate the four stages of a Sacred Contract and provide clues for discovering your own. With her signature motivational style and stories, Myss explains how you can identify your particular spiritual energies, or archetypes—the gatekeepers of your higher purpose—and use them to help you find out what you are here on earth to learn and whom you are meant to meet.

Intended Evolution,"Dongxun Zhang, Bob Zhang",Greenleaf Book Group,2015-05-05,"Discover a new outlook on the process of life—and improve your health as a result In Intended Evolution, authors Dongxun and Bob Zhang introduce a different perspective on the theory of evolution: Life is not only selected by nature but intentionally interacts with it, learning how to better its future. They explain that applying this idea to generally accepted principles of biology can have startling results in your ability to affect your own health—and even your evolution. According to the theory of intended evolution, organisms gather information through sensory experience and use that knowledge to effect change in themselves and their environments. The authors propose that organisms use this saved information to make choices projected to enhance their survival. It is through experience, choices, and action, within a given environment, that life changes itself from moment to moment and determines what changes are needed for future generations. Because of humans’ unique ability to understand how our own evolution functions, we can effect changes within ourselves to influence and enhance our health and fitness, even to lengthen our lifespan.",Science,183,N/A,0,en

As a child, Carissa Schumacher was told by an angelic presence that she would be a channel for Yeshua of Nazareth. She did not know what that meant at the time nor the impact it would eventually have on her life and countless others. After devoting much of her life to service as an intuitive guide and spirit medium, in late 2019, Yeshua's Divine Presence suddenly came through her channel for the first time. Over the next months, Yeshua shared his timely, universal, and revelatory messages. The Freedom Transmissions is the result. This singular book offers a pathway to peace by following the Four Elements of Balance: Simplicity, Stability, Surrender, and Stillness. When we embody these four energies, we create and attract the most abundance, nourishment, joy, and flow to our lives. The Freedom Transmissions unburdens us from unnecessary suffering, strengthens our faith and sense of wholeness, and restores balance and peace, reminding us that we are One with the Divine. The joy of these Transmissions is that they are for all people and not just some people on the basis of beliefs or dogma. Yeshua welcomes in all people who come in humility and a genuine desire to find and know self as One with God. This essential text encourages us to choose Faith over Fear, Forgiveness over Blame, Freedom over Suppression, and ushers us from the era of division and polarity to an era of co-creation, transparency, compassion, and equality.","Body, Mind & Spirit",457,N/A,0,en

The Immunotype Breakthrough,Heather Moday,Hachette UK,2021-12-21,"A respected immunologist, allergist, and functional medicine doctor breaks down the latest science on immunity, offering “the most important guide available” (Mark Hyman, MD) to balancing your system for optimal health and longevity. To most of us, the immune system is seemingly unknowable—it's an invisible, complex network of cells, receptors, and messengers, and there's no standard way to see if it's functioning as it should. Yet in spite of this, it affects every aspect of our health, influencing (and sometimes even causing) nearly every disease known to humanity. Much has been made about “boosting” immunity, but what exactly does that mean, and what if boosting isn't really what your unique system needs? In The Immunotype Breakthrough, Dr. Heather Moday explains that for most, immune system balance is key. Drawing on a wealth of cutting edge research and fascinating case studies, Dr. Moday explains that the immune system is fluid and significantly influenced by our behaviors, diet, habits, and environment. She identifies four primary Immunotypes—Smoldering, Weak, Hyperactive, and Misguided—that underlie the immune imbalances that commonly lead to disease, chronic inflammation, infection, allergies, and autoimmunity. By identifying your personal immunotype—where you fall on this immunity spectrum—you can intervene by making focused, individualized, natural lifestyle changes to ensure it functions optimally Featuring engaging and accessible science, practical and customizable takeaways, and interactive quizzes to help you zero in on your specific needs, The Immunotype Breakthrough is a revolutionary program for creating an individualized lifestyle and diet that will lead to immune resilience, vitality, and longevity.",Health & Fitness,229,N/A,0,en

Sheol Know!,Dirk Waren,Soaring Eagle Press,2024-02-07,"What happens to the soul & spirit of unsaved people when they die? This refers to anyone who has not experienced spiritual regeneration through the gospel, which includes Old Testament saints. The Bible shows that the souls of these people go to Sheol at the point of physical decease. Sheol in the Old Testament is synonymous with Hades in the New Testament. These souls will be resurrected from Sheol/Hades one day, according to Revelation 20:11-15, which is why Sheol is described as the ""intermediate state"" by theologians since it refers to the condition of unredeemed souls between physical death and later resurrection. So what's the state of souls in Sheol/Hades? Jesus Christ's Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus, if taken literally, suggests a conscious state wherein people either hang out in bliss with father Abraham or suffer constant fiery torment hoping for a mere drop of water for relief. SHEOL KNOW is an honest and thorough examination of the Scriptures to determine the precise nature of Sheol/Hades. Once you see what the God-breathed Scriptures fully say on the subject from Genesis to Revelation, and not just a single parable the Messiah told, you'll see the truth and ""the truth shall set you FREE.""

Recent studies have shown that a keto diet not only produces significant--and rapid--weight loss, but also has many other benefits for long-term health. But it must be done the right way. In 21-Day Keto Magic, Dr. Mosley presents the latest science on the ketogenic diet--a diet high in fat and protein and very low in carbs--explaining how it works and why it is so good for you. The aim of a keto regime is to kickstart a process called ketosis, whereby your body goes from burning sugar to burning fat for fuel. Flipping this metabolic switch has the added advantage of making you feel less hungry, which makes the diet highly motivating and relatively easy to sustain. 21-Day Keto Magic offers a detailed, step-by-step program, along with easy tips and clear advice on which foods support ketosis and which ones stop it, how to tell if you are producing ketones, and how to ensure that you're following the diet safely.

Eat Like a Human,Dr. Bill Schindler,Hachette UK,2021-11-16,"An archaeologist and chef explains how to follow our ancestors' lead when it comes to dietary choices and cooking techniques for optimum health and vitality. ""Read this book!"" (Mark Hyman, MD, author of Food) Our relationship with food is filled with confusion and insecurity. Vegan or carnivore? Vegetarian or gluten-free? Keto or Mediterranean? Fasting or Paleo? Every day we hear about a new ingredient that is good or bad, a new diet that promises everything. But the secret to becoming healthier, losing weight, living an energetic life, and healing the planet has nothing to do with counting calories or feeling deprived—the key is re‑learning how to eat like a human. This means finding food that is as nutrient-dense as possible, and preparing that food using methods that release those nutrients and make them bioavailable to our bodies, which is exactly what allowed our ancestors to not only live but thrive. In Eat Like a Human, archaeologist and chef Dr. Bill Schindler draws on cutting-edge science and a lifetime of research to explain how nutrient density and bioavailability are the cornerstones of a healthy diet. He shows readers how to live like modern “hunter-gatherers” by using the same strategies our ancestors used—as well as techniques still practiced by many cultures around the world—to make food as safe, nutritious, bioavailable, and delicious as possible. With each chapter dedicated to a specific food group, in‑depth explanations of different foods and cooking techniques, and concrete takeaways, as well as 75+ recipes, Eat Like a Human will permanently change the way you think about food, and help you live a happier, healthier, and more connected life.",Health & Fitness,308,N/A,0,en
Culturally Alert Counseling,Garrett McAuliffe,SAGE,2008,"A comprehensive, readable introduction to the cultural dimensions of counseling and psychotherapy is now available. National leaders in each topic have been selected to provide an accessible, yet thorough, presentation of culturally alert counseling. An introduction to the nature of counseling and culture begins the book, followed by chapters on Social Inequality, Race, and Ethnicity. The succeeding chapters reveal the characteristics, histories, mental health issues, and appropriate counseling strategies for each of eleven cultural groupings. The book ends with a thorough presentation of actual culturally alert counseling practice, Seven dimensions combine to make the book unique, namely thoroughness, inclusiveness, theoretical foundations, practicality, readability, activity, and modeling. In the first case, this book broadens the discussion of culture from ethnicity and race to include social class, religion, gender, and sexual orientation. Of particular note, in the area of ethnicity, all five of the major U.S. pan-ethnic groupings are presented, as well as Middle Eastern and South Asian people. The book is also inclusive of all people, including both those in dominant and non-dominant cultural groups. The assumption is that everyone has culture. Culturally alert counseling is also theoretically grounded in the first few chapters of the book, which lay out a guiding developmental vision of culturally alert counseling. Further conceptual foundations are laid in discussions of social inequality, social justice, social diversity, and critical consciousness. The practical dimension of the book is underscored by the inclusion of a chapter devoted to actual culturally alert counseling skills, an area that is needed by practitioners in this important work. Readability and interest are enhanced by the interweaving of case vignettes and experiential activities throughout the book. Finally, culturally alert counseling skills are modeled in an accessible, vital demonstration video that accompanies the book. Ultimately, readers will leave informed, moved, and changed by the encounters with culture that lie in these pages. They will also be ready to begin practice equipped with both a vision of the work and practical skills in implementing it.",Juvenile Nonfiction,689,N/A,0,en

Beginning with theoretical chapters, the Personal System is described as body, mind, and spirit. Using both Systems encourages readers to see the whole person as they practice. The book incorporates how relational practice improves care in topics such as grief, end-of-life care, stress, and burnout, giving bad news and resolving conflict. Each chapter includes case studies, reflective questions, and prompts for critical thinking to help the reader embed their learning. This practice-changing textbook will be useful to a range of health practitioners, including nurses, Physician Assistants, physicians, and more. It can be used as a supplemental reading for medical interviewing and communications courses.",Medical,142,N/A,0,en

Those seriously seeking to understand spirituality and its myriad aspects will find answers to questions they have been pondering over for years, such as: · Is God only in the mind? · Is reality the same for all of us? · How do we go beyond the limitations of the body and the mind to attain a higher plane of consciousness and awareness? · What is self-realization? · What kind of entity is the soul? The author defines spiritual power as ‘that inner awareness and the capability to awaken our mind from the ignorance that we are not solely body and mind, but something more’. He goes to explain in detail that ‘something more’. The author contends that acquiring spiritual bliss may not be within everybody’s reach, but those who are keen and sincere can achieve this objective by delving deep into their inner selves to find out their shortcomings and how to overcome them so that they can lead complete and wholesome lives.",Self-Help,265,N/A,0,en

Indigenous Concepts of Health and Healing in Andean Populations,"Elizabeth Currie, John Schofield",Taylor & Francis,2024-08-29,"This book uses archaeology and ethnohistory to explore the evidence for the survival of ancestral beliefs and practices related to health and healing in Indigenous Andean communities. The authors argue that through determining the nature of the survival of beliefs around health and healing, important insights are gained into how people develop adaptive strategies for survival in a way that allows a continuity of identity and integrity. The book works through various stages of research to arrive at its conclusions. Firstly, through archaeology and ethnohistory, it establishes a ‘baseline’ of key ancestral (pre-European) Indigenous Andean beliefs related to health, illness and healing. It then proceeds to review the evidence for the survival of these ancestral beliefs and practices related to Indigenous pre-European Andean epistemologies and ontologies. Analysing the results of the first two sections, the final part reflects on the narratives around ancestral beliefs and practices and how they influence lived experience in the contemporary world. In essence, this book deals with the question 'How do people manage change?', a universal question relevant to humanity at any time, and stresses the need to recognise the significance of cultural diversity, intangible heritage and plurality. This interdisciplinary study is for researchers in ethnohistory, anthropology, medical anthropology, archaeology, history, heritage and Indigenous studies.",Social Science,320,N/A,0,en

I think that Dr. Goodwin has hit the 'button on the head', and has loosened it's thread with his insightful, caring explanation of our 'Buttons' and how to deal with them. I find myself referring to it regularly in my business. Thanks Lloyd, I am happier, my clients are happier and we all understand others and ourselves better now that we have read your book.

Suzanne Osborne, Ph.D., Clinical Psychologist, Forensic Psychologist, Criminal Profiler, Counselor from North Myrtle Beach, SC A Model for Personal and Spiritual Growth The Button Therapy Book is a creative synthesis of Eastern and Western models for personal and spiritual growth. An incredible compilation and synthesis of psychological self-help techniques. You would have to read 10 books to get the information and number of self-help techniques presented in this book. I've personally benefited from applying this practical six-step self-help model to some of my Buttons. The chapter titled ""30 Seeds for Your Mind's Garden"" is worth the price of this book alone.

Button Therapy I was excited to see three decades of counseling theories, approaches, and strategies in mind-body therapy, brought together in one resource that is readable and accessible for either the lay-reader or counseling professional. This book is unique because it combines psychological research with very usable self-assessments and self-help techniques that can be applied in the ""real world"".

Learn to be a happier, healthier and hopefully a better person all around. Ned Petrak, Financial Advisor, Goldsboro, NC CONGRATULATIONS!!! Congratulations Dr. Goodwin! You've done a wonderful job. I like the holistic nature of this cognitive behavior therapy model. The vast majority of clients I have worked with, see themselves as pawns in this world being blown from one situation to the other with minimal control. They often experience their emotions and actions as responsive to external forces rather than behavioral choices over which they have control. The Button Therapy Book teaches that the locus of most situations is internal and therefore, under our control. Most of us are spiritually empty. I am very positive that they will be able to fill that spiritual void by reading The Button Therapy Book. I will recommend this book to any mental health professional I know. Agyenim A-Boateng, M.S., CRC, CCAS, LPC, Mental Health Professional from Pinehurst, NC An Excellent Guide To Feeling Good! The Button Therapy Book provides techniques that will immediately lift your spirits and help you develop a positive outlook on life. Everyone has Buttons and Button-Pushers. Dr. Goodwin provides a framework to recognize the cognitions (i.e. thoughts, beliefs, etc.) attached to Buttons that produce negative results. Through the 21 Button removal strategies described in the book empowerment is accessible. A great ""tool box"" for those working in the mental health field as well as for anyone seeking personal growth. If you have the desire to dance to the music of the universe instead of dancing every time somebody pushes your Buttons, buy it, read it, you deserve it! Sharon Williams from Washington, NC Tired of Getting Your Buttons Pushed? The Button Therapy Book is an excellent 'life enhancement manual'. I highly recommend it. Its foundations are based on the teachings of Buddha, Jesus Christ and Ken Keyes Jr. The Button Therapy Book also nicely wraps up the 'best of the best' literature from prominent psychologists, philosophers, and modern day shamans.

Somatic Psychology,Linda Hartley,John Wiley & Sons,2004-08-13,"This book brings attention to the interface of psychotherapy and psychological theory with the somatic practices of bodywork and movement therapy. To offer a client only psychotherapy, or only bodywork may subtly or directly reinforce the body-mind split from which so many of us suffer; in some cases this will be a reinforcement of a dilemma central to the client's problems. Hartley views body psychotherapy and transpersonal psychotherapy as building bridges between the once separated processes of psyche, soma, and spirit. Today the emerging field of somatic psychology is also contributing to the expanded field of psychology a subtle differentiation of bodymind process, developed through almost a century and a half of research and practice in somatic therapy and education. Originally trained as a dancer, movement therapist and bodywork practitioner, Hartley continues to use movement and somatic process as an important foundation for her own work.

Dialogical Social Theory,Donald N. Levine,Routledge,2018-02-02,"In his final work, Donald N. Levine, one of the great late-twentieth-century sociological theorists, brings together diverse social thinkers. Simmel, Weber, Durkheim, Parsons, and Merton are set into a dialogue with philosophers such as Hobbes, Smith, Montesquieu, Comte, Kant, and Hegel and pragmatists such as Peirce, James, Dewey, and McKeon to describe and analyze dialogical social theory. This volume is one of Levine’s most important contributions to social theory and a worthy summation of his life’s work. Levine demonstrates that approaching social theory with a cooperative, peaceful dialogue is a superior tactic in theorizing about society. He illustrates the advantages of the dialogical model with case studies drawn from the French Philosophes, the Russian Intelligentsia, Freudian psychology, Ushiba’s aikido, and Levine’s own ethnographic work in Ethiopia. Incorporating themes that run through his lifetime’s work, such as conflict resolution, ambiguity, and varying forms of social knowledge, Levine suggests that while dialogue is an important basis for sociological theorizing, it still vies with more combative forms of discourse that lend themselves to controversy rather than cooperation, often giving theory a sense of standing still as the world moves forward. The book was nearly finished when Levine died in April 2015, but it has been brought to thoughtful and thought-provoking completion by his friend and colleague Howard G. Schneiderman. This volume will be of great interest to students and teachers of social theory and philosophy.",Social Science,283,N/A,0,en

Handbook of Faith and Spirituality in the Workplace,Judi Neal,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-09,"While the field of management has developed as a research discipline over the last century, until the early 1990s there was essentially no acknowledgement that the human spirit plays an important role in the workplace. Over the past twenty years, the tide has begun to turn, as evidenced by the growing number of courses in academia and in corporate training, and an exponential increase in the publications emerging through creative interaction of scholars and practitioners in organizational behaviour, workplace diversity, sustainability, innovation, corporate governance, leadership, and corporate wellness, as well as contributions by psychotherapists, theologians, anthropologists, educators, philosophers, and artists. This Handbook is the most comprehensive collection to date of essays by the preeminent researchers and practitioners in faith and spirituality in the workplace, featuring not only the most current research and case examples, but visions of what will be, or should be, emerging over the horizon. It includes essays by the people who helped to pioneer the field as well as essays by up and coming young scholars. Among the questions and issues addressed: · What does it mean to be a “spiritual” organization? How does this perspective challenge traditional approaches to the firm as a purely rational, profit-maximizing enterprise? · Is faith and spirituality in the workplace a passing fad, or is there a substantial shift occurring in the business paradigm? · How does this field inform emerging management disciplines such as sustainability, diversity, and social responsibility? · In what ways are faith and spirituality in the workplace similar to progressive and innovative human resource practices. Does faith and spirituality in the workplace bring something additional to the conversation, and if so, what? The aim of The Handbook of Faith and Spirituality in the Workplace is to provide researchers, faculty, students, and practitioners with a broad overview of the field from a research perspective, while keeping an eye on building a bridge between scholarship and practice.",Business & Economics,753,5,1,en

The Cygnus Key,Andrew Collins,Simon and Schuster,2018-05-15,"New evidence showing that the earliest origins of human culture, religion, and technology derive from the lost world of the Denisovans • Explains how Göbekli Tepe and the Giza pyramids are aligned with the constellation of Cygnus and show evidence of enhanced sound-acoustic technology • Traces the origins of Göbekli Tepe and the Giza pyramids to the Denisovans, a previously unknown human population remembered in myth as a race of giants • Shows how the ancient belief in Cygnus as the origin point for the human soul is as much as 45,000 years old and originally came from southern Siberia Built at the end of the last ice age around 9600 BCE, Göbekli Tepe in southeast Turkey was designed to align with the constellation of the celestial swan, Cygnus--a fact confirmed by the discovery at the site of a tiny bone plaque carved with the three key stars of Cygnus. Remarkably, the three main pyramids at Giza in Egypt, including the Great Pyramid, align with the same three stars. But where did this ancient veneration of Cygnus come from? Showing that Cygnus was once seen as a portal to the sky-world, Andrew Collins reveals how, at both sites, the attention toward this star group is linked with sound acoustics and the use of musical intervals “discovered” thousands of years later by the Greek mathematician Pythagoras. Collins traces these ideas as well as early advances in human technology and cosmology back to the Altai-Baikal region of Russian Siberia, where the cult of the swan flourished as much as 20,000 years ago. He shows how these concepts, including a complex numeric system based on long-term eclipse cycles, are derived from an extinct human population known as the Denisovans. Not only were they of exceptional size--the ancient giants of myth--but archaeological discoveries show that this previously unrecognized human population achieved an advanced level of culture, including the use of high-speed drilling techniques and the creation of musical instruments. The author explains how the stars of Cygnus coincided with the turning point of the heavens at the moment the Denisovan legacy was handed to the first human societies in southern Siberia 45,000 years ago, catalyzing beliefs in swan ancestry and an understanding of Cygnus as the source of cosmic creation. It also led to powerful ideas involving the Milky Way’s Dark Rift, viewed as the Path of Souls and the sky-road shamans travel to reach the sky-world. He explores how their sound technology and ancient cosmologies were carried into the West, flowering first at Göbekli Tepe and then later in Egypt’s Nile Valley. Collins shows how the ancient belief in Cygnus as the source of creation can also be found in many other cultures around the world, further confirming the role played by the Denisovan legacy in the genesis of human civilization.","Body, Mind & Spirit",462,N/A,0,en

Lay Spirituality,Pierre Hegy,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2017-10-03,"Laypeople have a special mission in the church the way they have a special mission in society. In popular devotions the laity created a form of spirituality that lasted for over a millennium. Popular religiosity is alive in Latin America and in US ethnic subcultures. Vatican II redirected lay spirituality toward the liturgy as “the source and summit.” We will visit a parish where this ideal is put into practice, but in the wider church the role of the laity came to be restricted to ecclesial ministries. There are at least four new forms of spirituality in the making. I will first describe a vibrant evangelical church attended by many former Catholics. Next, we will visit a Guatemalan parish where over a thousand parishioners meet weekly in homes and witness to the gospel in their neighborhoods. The charismatic renewal is a major force of renewal in Latin America and among US Latinos. Finally, the spirituality of social justice is alive and well in south Chicago. In sum, this book will introduce you to six or seven major forms of spirituality alive today. Each of them defines a special place and mission for the laity in the church.",Religion,237,N/A,0,en

In 1990, three college students spent a long Wisconsin winter experimenting with a Ouija board; it turned out to be the deadliest mistake of their lives. The board brought them into contact with a psychic serial killer, known only as the Bye Bye Man. Learning his name makes you vulnerable, but thinking about it draws the Bye Bye Man to you.

He might turn up outside your bedroom door, speaking in the voice of a trusted friend, someone who would never hurt you… Here is the authentically terrifying, true-life story recounted by historian Robert Damon Schneck in a chapter of his classic underground collection of weird Americana, which formed the basis for the major motion picture, The Bye Bye Man.

Revival,Martyn Lloyd-Jones,Crossway,1987-02-01,"In every era the church needs revival—certainly today as much as ever. And in the heart of every committed Christian there is the longing for personal revival—to know the quality and depths of spiritual reality, and the presence of God in one's personal life. This was the deepest desire of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones, one of the great 20th-century Bible expositors. It was also the purpose behind this series of messages which were first given on the 100th anniversary of the Great Revival which started in Wales, and swept across England and throughout the United States and to the far corners of the world. As Dr. Lloyd-Jones recognized, it is a rare time in the history of the church when there is a great outpouring of the Holy Spirit— and a time of special interest of every Christian who longs for revival today. As Dr. J. I. Packer writes in his foreword, Dr. Lloyd-Jones believed in ""the necessity of revival—that is, a quickening divine visitation—as the only vent that can avert ultimate spiritual disaster. The thrustful urgency of the sermons in this book testifies to the depth of his conviction that without revival in the church there is really no hope for the Western world at all."" Dr. Lloyd-Jones deftly draws principles from the lives of Old and New Testament characters as well as expounding some of the great prayers of the Bible. Clearly and forcefully, he presents a masterful exposition of the circumstances accompanying revival in the past, why each generation needs it, and how it will come about today. We must come to the sovereign God, forsake our sin, and wait upon Him for this special, essential outpouring. God, bring us revival!",Religion,322,N/A,0,en

First the Spirit,Tommy Hays,Independently Published,2021-05,"From a Biblical perspective of our human nature, we are ""spirit and soul and body"" (1 Thessalonians 5:23). Understanding each dimension of our being and how each is to relate to the others, according to God's created order, is a strategic key of the Kingdom of God. Come take hold of this key that will revolutionize and revitalize your spiritual journey! Our human spirit should abide in deep communion with God's Holy Spirit. Then our human spirit-infused and led by the Holy Spirit-should direct the mind, will, and emotions of our human soul, which should manifest in the health and well-being of our human bodies.All is well with my soul when all is well with my spirit. All is well with my body when all is well with my soul. But for all to be well, we must learn to allow the Holy Spirit to correctly align our spirit and soul and body: First the spirit. Then the soul. Then the body. As we'll discover, looking more deeply into these three dimensions of our being, when we're correctly aligned with the human spirit first, we will live out our daily journey with more spiritual health and growing maturity, fulfilled with more peace and joy, walking in the wisdom of God instead of the ways of the world.In right alignment, my human spirit which is receiving my sense of guidance and discernment by abiding in communion with God's Holy Spirit, directs my soul. My soul is my mind, will, and emotions. So my spirit should direct my mind and how I think, my will and the choices I make, my emotions and how I sense and feel and experience the world around me. Then then my soul should direct my body.In right alignment, my body manifests what's going on in my soul and my soul manifests what's going on in my spirit, and my spirit manifests my abiding relationship with God's Holy Spirit. First the spirit. Then then the soul. Then the body. This is what I call ""Spiritual Alignment"" or walking out my spiritual journey as a ""Spiritual Christian."" But the trouble is that much of the time we tend to live out our daily lives in a different order than God's created order. Instead of living in right alignment, we're living out of alignment. First the soul, instead of first the spirit. First the soul. Then the spirit. Then the body. This is what I call ""Soulish Alignment"" or walking out my spiritual journey as a ""Soulish Christian."" In that wrong order, when I'm out of proper alignment, I am more ""soulish"" than ""spiritual"" and all will not be well with my soul. In the ""soulish"" alignment, I'll be driven more by my own desires in the mind, will, and emotions of my soul rather than humbling myself to be led by God's Holy Spirit directing my human spirit. When I'm in a ""soulish"" alignment, my mind will insist on my own thoughts instead of yielding to God's thoughts. My human freewill will insist on my own will instead of yielding to God's will. And my emotions will insist on driving my actions by reacting from my soul instead of responding by the leading of my spirit being led by God's Holy Spirit."" Whether my spirit is ""on top"" and in charge, directing my soul, or whether my soul is ""on top"" and in charge, suppressing my spirit, makes all the difference. And as we'll see, alignment is everything.The good news is that by the grace of God we can recognize it when we're being more ""soulish"" than ""spiritual"" and make a choice to humble our souls to come back into right alignment of spirit, soul, and body. By far, this has become one of the most revolutionary insights of my spiritual journey.And as I've shared these principles of this book through the years, I've heard so many testimonies of these simple insights becoming life-changing for men and women at all stages of their spiritual journey to Christ-like maturity. That's why I'm thrilled to share them with you!",,106,N/A,0,en
The Other Side,Dan Ginzburg,N/A,2021-09,"This is not a spiritual personal development book, it is a guide to a balanced life, where you effortlessly flow to your dreams and desires while exploring infinite happiness. When you're balanced and flowing, happiness, money, health, wealth, youth, relationships, love and success all become attainable to you with ease. It's not about doing more, but rather less. Right now, right at this moment we are being exposed to more information than ever before. It is truly a phenomenon. We live in the age of knowing anything and knowing nothing; we may feel connected to everybody and be disconnected from everyone; we may feel like we know ourselves but have no idea who we are. While all of this doesn't help us deal with life, this book does. Here is what you can expect from this book: since 2009 I have been collecting lessons taught by the most influential people of the 21st century: spiritual leaders that shaped history and the most successful individuals of the world. This content is extracted from over fifty books in spiritual and personal development, numerous courses, and over hundreds of videos from leading self-advancement influencers. I compiled everything into a tightly packed piece of work treated by my own realizations and tested by my clients who I've mentored and consulted over the years. I also included insights that helped me get through tough times in my own human experience in the hopes that you can relate. The next 180 pages incorporate practical spirituality, quantum physics, psychology, philosophy and science to deliver a different category of personal development. The structure of this book is simple. There are three parts: spirit, mind and body. Everything in those parts is written to help you accomplish two things: to let go of everything preventing you from ascending and to have a clear understanding of HOW to be eternally happy, independently of anything or anyone. The good news is you don't have to undergo intense training, do lots of work, change yourself, your place of living, your friend circle, job, hobbies, or anything else except for one thing-your perspective. All I do is invite you to see the other side. I wrote this book not because I wanted to positively influence the world; I am too small and insignificant for that. I wrote this book to positively influence just YOUR world, my friend. You picked up this book for a reason and it is probably because you want to self-improve. If you have a desire for that, you are already doing great! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. But why not do better? Why not be limitless?",Self-Help,192,N/A,0,en

Mind/Body Integration,"S. Ancoli, Erik Peper, M. Quinn",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Biofeedback training is a research methodology and training procedure through which people can learn voluntary control over their internal physiological systems. It is a merger of mUltiple disciplines with interest deriving from many sources-from basic understanding of psychophysiology to a desire for enhanced self-awareness. The goals of biofeedback are to develop an increased awareness of relevant internal physiological functions, to establish control over these functions, to generalize control from an experimental or clinical setting to everyday life, and to focus attention on mind/body integration. Biofeedback is explored in many different settings. In the university, biofeed back equipment and applications can be found in the departments of experi mental and clinical psychology, counseling, physiology, biology, education, and the theater arts, as well as in the health service (student infirmary). Outside the university, biofeedback may be found in different departments of hospitals (such as physical medicine), private clinics, education and self-awareness groups, psychotherapy practices, and elsewhere. Its growth is still expanding, and excite ment is still rising as a result of biofeedback's demonstration that autonomic functions can be brought under voluntary control and that the long-standing arti ficial separation between mind, body, and consciousness can be disproven.",Psychology,578,N/A,0,en
The Power of Now,Eckhart Tolle,New World Library,2010-10-06,"Celebrating 25 Years as a New York Times Bestseller — Over 16 Million Copies Sold It’s no wonder that The Power of Now has sold over 16 million copies worldwide and has been translated into over 30 foreign languages. Much more than simple principles and platitudes, the book takes readers on an inspiring spiritual journey to find their true and deepest self and reach the ultimate in personal growth and spirituality: the discovery of truth and light. In the first chapter, Tolle introduces readers to enlightenment and its natural enemy, the mind. He awakens readers to their role as a creator of pain and shows them how to have a pain-free identity by living fully in the present. The journey is thrilling, and along the way, the author shows how to connect to the indestructible essence of our Being, “the eternal, ever-present One Life beyond the myriad forms of life that are subject to birth and death.” Featuring a new preface by the author, this paperback shows that only after regaining awareness of Being, liberated from Mind and intensely in the Now, is there Enlightenment.","Body, Mind & Spirit",258,4,97,en

The Mystic,John E. Knight,iUniverse,2010,"Ted Gregory is a stock-broker barely hanging in with the flow of life. A morning ride to work turns into a trip that takes Ted back in time to visit an old diner which he had not been in for decades. The diner still exists, almost as in a time warp. A series of impulsive decisions sends Ted off on a new journey, both physically and metaphorically. The Mystic is a stranger sitting alone in a coffee shop waiting for Ted, or anyone, to engage him in conversation. The mystic who teaches others has to be a master of using metaphor and parable to explain concepts. Mystery surrounds mysticism, but in reality, it can help provide a practical guide for positive transformation in any person's life. Mysticism has room for sceptics and scientists. In fact, the scientists with great new ideas and theories have to walk the mystic's path into the realms of the metaphysical.","Body, Mind & Spirit",319,N/A,0,en
"Psychology of Body, Soul, and Spirit",Rudolf Steiner,SteinerBooks,1999,"12 lectures, Berlin, Oct. 23, 1909-Dec. 16, 1911 (CW 115) This series of lectures provides the basis for an entirely new psychology. The first four lectures give a precise, dynamic understanding of the human soul in relation to the activity of the senses and to the subtle processes that make up the human being on Earth. The next four lectures focus on what we can know of the human soul based on direct observation alone. No theorizing takes place. To show what we can know of soul life through the immediacy of engaged observation of oneself and others, Rudolf Steiner refrains from using his own higher capacities of clairvoyance to form a picture of our soul life. The concluding lectures portray the relationship of soul life to spirit life, showing us how to awaken individual spirit life and how to distinguish between illusory and genuine spiritual experiences. Presented more than a century ago, we might be tempted to think that, insofar as psychology is concerned, the content of these lectures are outdated. It is also tempting to think that, because Steiner is not usually associated with the founders of modern psychology, his efforts must be considered, at best, an interesting aside. On the contrary, these lectures are actually a wellspring for the true stream of psychology, as the term itself means ""soul study."" A Psychology of Body, Soul, and Spirit should be read by anyone interested in psychology as well as by those interested in inner development. Whether we are involved in education, medicine, art, drama, economics, or business, the perspectives contained in this book have the potential to restore the frequently missing element of soul in psychology today. Robert Sardello's in-depth introduction places Steiner's lectures in the context of modern life and psychology and provides insights into how to read and use this text for inner development and a deeper understanding of spiritual science. Contents: Introduction by Robert Sardello Part 1 -- ""Anthroposophy"" The Human being and the Senses Supersensible Processes in the Human Senses The Higher Senses, inner Forces, and Creative Principles in the Human Organism Supersensible Currents, Group Soul, and the I in Human Beings and Animals Part 2 -- ""Psychosophy"" Aspects of Soul Life The Activities of Human Soul Forces The Senses, Feeling, and Aesthetic Judging Consciousness and Soul Life Part 3 -- ""Pneumatosophy"" Franz Brentano and Aristotle's Doctrine of the Spirit Truth and Error in Light of the Spiritual World Imagination-Imagination; Inspiration-Self-Fulfillment; Intuition-Conscience Nature, the Evolution of Consciousness, and Reincarnation ""Steiner does not talk about soul; he speaks from soul. That is the entire method. There is, however, an entrance fee for doing psychology. The fee is that you need to leave behind your well-known-to-you self-identity. You must suffer the experience of leaving behind not only what you know, but also what you think you know of yourself. This requirement qualifies psychology as integral to the work of initiation. --Robert Sardello, from his introduction A previous translation of these lectures were published as Anthroposophy, Psychosophy, Pneumatosophy and as Wisdom of Man, of the Soul, and of the Spirit.

That book “rivaled Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring” (the Cincinnati Enquirer), was “an absolute must-read for parents” (the Boston Globe), and “an inch-thick caution against raising the fully automated child” (the New York Times).

Visual Meditations,Jo-Anne Taraba,Balboa Press,2013-05-15,"Tragedy visits every life. Loss inflicts its toll on every human soul. Grief shatters the very beauty of one’s existence. But as deep and as final as these moments seem, somehow, somewhere, hope takes hold. The emergence of hope is small at first, almost imperceptible—a tiny pinprick of light in the fabric of suffocating darkness. Then slowly but surely, there are more moments that string together like stars lighting up the night sky, and darkness gives way to light as the rising sun bursts forth to bring light and hope to the soul. Once again, there is reason to look up. Visual artist Jo-Anne Taraba takes you on a painterly journey through the stages of grief into hope. Beginning with the hollow echo chambers of despair, her images and words trace the delicate but necessary pilgrimage we all must make to return to a place of spiritual peace and inner balance following a tragedy. Included in this book are quotes, words of hope, and a journal for recording your own personal story. Take time to reflect on the images and words, and express your own fears and hopes as you document your unique journey through the darkness and into the light. You have chosen the triumphant moment of your return. It is the book of hope.","Body, Mind & Spirit",68,N/A,0,en

In Miserably Happy, you will discover a new definition of happiness based in the physical, mental, and spiritual properties of being human.

The Blackwell Companion to Substance Dualism,"Jonathan J. Loose, Angus J. L. Menuge, J. P. Moreland",John Wiley & Sons,2018-03-13,"THE BLACKWELL COMPANION TO SUBSTANCE DUALISM “This is a terrific volume ... by a long way, the best currently available anthology on dualism, and a worthy addition to Blackwell’s distinguished series of Companions.” Tim Crane, Central European University “A major contribution to an ongoing transformation of analytic philosophy of mind.” Howard Robinson, Central European University “This high quality volume offers a rich variety of perspectives on substance dualism and will be a valuable resource for students and researchers in philosophy of mind and philosophy of religion.” John Cottingham, University of Reading “Thorough and fair ... the quality of the essays is high. This will certainly be the book on substance dualism.” Michael Tye, University of Texas at Austin Substance dualism has for some time been dismissed as an archaic and defeated position in philosophy of mind, but in recent years, the topic has experienced a resurgence of scholarly interest and has been restored to contemporary prominence by a growing minority of philosophers prepared to interrogate the core principles upon which past objections and misunderstandings rest. As the first book of its kind to bring together a collection of contemporary writing from top proponents and critics in a pro-contra format, the Blackwell Companion to Substance Dualism captures this ongoing dialogue and sets the stage for rigorous and lively discourse around dualist and physicalist accounts of human persons in philosophy. Chapters explore emergent, Thomistic, Cartesian, and other forms of substance dualism — broadly conceived — in dialogue with leading varieties of physicalism, including animalism, non-reductive physicalism, and constitution theory. Loose, Menuge, and Moreland pair essays from dualist advocates with astute criticism from physicalist opponents and vice versa, highlighting points of contrast for readers in thematic sections while showcasing today’s leading minds engaged in direct debate. Taken together, essays provide nuanced paths of introduction for students, and capture the imagination of professional philosophers looking to expand their understanding of the subject. Skillfully curated and in touch with contemporary science as well as analytic theology, the Blackwell Companion to Substance Dualism strikes a measured balanced between advocacy and criticism, and is a first-rate resource for researchers, scholars, and students of philosophy, theology, and neuroscience.",Philosophy,530,N/A,0,en

After You Believe,N. T. Wright,Harper Collins,2010-03-02,"From the author of the acclaimed Simply Christian and Surprised by Hope comes a book that addresses the question that has plagued humans for centuries—what is our purpose? As Christians, what are we to do with that ambiguous time between baptism and the funeral? It's easy to become preoccupied with who gets into heaven; the real challenge is how we are going to live in the here and now. Wright dispels the common misconception that Christian living is nothing more than a checklist of dos and don'ts. Nor is it a prescription to ""follow your heart"" wherever it may lead. Instead, After You Believe reveals the Bible's call for a revolution—a transformation of character that takes us beyond our earthly pursuit of money, sex, and power into a virtuous state of living that allows us to reflect God and live more worshipful, fulfilling lives. We are all spiritual seekers, intuitively knowing there is more to life than we suspect. This is a book for anyone who is hoping there is something more while we're here on Earth. There is. We are being called to join the revolution, and Wright insightfully encourages readers to find new purpose and clarity by taking us on an eye-opening journey through key biblical passages that promise to radically alter the work of the church and the direction of our lives.",Religion,326,N/A,0,en

Currently emerging as a middle ground between warring fundamentalisms of religion andscience, an expanded science-based understanding of nature finally accommodates empirical realities of spiritual sorts while also rejecting rationally untenable overbeliefs. The vision sketched here provides an antidote to the prevailing postmodern disenchantment of the world and demeaning of human possibilities. It not only more accurately and fully reflects our human condition but engenders hope and encourages ego-surpassing forms of human flourishing. It offers reasons for us to believe that freedom is real, that our human choices matter, and that we have barely scratched the surface of our human potentials. It also addresses the urgent need for a greater sense of worldwide community and interdependence - a sustainable ethos - by demonstrating that under the surface we and the world are much more extensively interconnected than previously recognized.",Philosophy,531,5,1,en

Resilience in Aging,"Barbara Resnick, Lisa P. Gwyther, Karen A. Roberto",Springer Science & Business Media,2010-10-14,"The many significant technological and medical advances of the 21st century cannot overcome the escalating risk posed to older adults by such stressors as pain, weakness, fatigue, depression, anxiety, memory and other cognitive deficits, hearing loss, visual impairment, isolation, marginalization, and physical and mental illness. In order to overcome these and other challenges, and to maintain as high a quality of life as possible, older adults and the professionals who treat them need to promote and develop the capacity for resilience, which is innate in all of us to some degree. The purpose of this book is to provide the current scientific theory, clinical guidelines, and real-world interventions with regard to resilience as a clinical tool. To that end, the book addresses such issues as concepts and operationalization of resilience; relevance of resilience to successful aging; impact of personality and genetics on resilience; relationship between resilience and motivation; relationship between resilience and survival; promoting resilience in long-term care; and the lifespan approach to resilience. By addressing ways in which the hypothetical and theoretical concepts of resilience can be applied in geriatric practice, Resilience in Aging provides inroads to the current knowledge and practice of resilience from the perspectives of physiology, psychology, culture, creativity, and economics. In addition, the book considers the impact of resilience on critical aspects of life for older adults such as policy issues (e.g., nursing home policies, Medicare guidelines), health and wellness, motivation, spirituality, and survival. Following these discussions, the book focuses on interventions that increase resilience. The intervention chapters include case studies and are intended to be useful at the clinical level. The book concludes with a discussion of future directions in optimizing resilience in the elderly and the importance of a lifespan approach to aging.",Medical,372,N/A,0,en

Spirituality in Social Work and Education,"Janet Groen, Diana Coholic, John R. Graham",Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press,2013-01-24,"Over the past ten years, the fields of social work and education have grappled separately with definitions of spirituality, ways to integrate spirituality into the classroom, and the rendering of spirituality as a meaningful concept for practitioners, students, and researchers. Social work and education have many commonalities in areas of engagement with children, families, and communities. For the first time, this book brings together these two professional disciplines for interdisciplinary discussions that advance our knowledge in the broad area of “spirituality.” The book’s three sections reflect broad topic areas created to facilitate dialogue between the contributors, all of whom have established expertise in exploring spirituality in education or social work. The first section of the book explores the historical and theoretical underpinnings of spirituality in education and social work. Examination of our respective heritages uncovers the religious roots within our professions and reveals a present understanding of spirituality that calls for active engagement in challenging oppression and working toward social justice. The second section shifts the focus to the pedagogical implications of incorporating spirituality into higher-education classrooms. The varied level of acceptance and the tensions that come from including spirituality, implicitly or explicitly, in the programs and coursework in our respective faculties are illuminated by authors in both professions. The final section explores issues related to practising and teaching in the field from a spiritually sensitive perspective.",Social Science,282,N/A,0,en

Splendor Solis,"Dr. Stephen Skinner, Dr. Rafal T.

Includes up-to-date commentary from experts in the field and a modern translation of the 16th-century text. A magnificent edition of the Splendor Solis for all those interested in alchemy, magic and mysterious manuscripts. Popularly attributed to the legendary figure Salomon Trismosin, the Splendor Solis ('Splendour of the Sun') is the most beautiful alchemical manuscript ever made, with 22 fabulous illustrations rich in allegorical and mystical symbolism. The paintings are given a fitting showcase in this new Watkins edition, which accompanies them with Joscelyn Godwin's excellent contemporary translation of the original 16th-century German text, as well as interpretation from alchemical experts Stephen Skinner and Georgiana Hedesan, and from Rafal T. Prinke, an authority in central and Eastern European esoteric manuscripts. Stephen Skinner explains the symbolism of both the text and the illustrations, suggesting that together they describe the physical process of the alchemical transmutation of base metal into gold. Rafal T. Prinke explains the theories about the authorship of both text and illustrations, discussing Splendor Solis as the turning point in alchemical iconography passing from the medieval tradition to that of the Baroque and the reasons for the misattribution of Splendor Solis to Poysel and Trismosin. Georgiana Hedesan looks at the legendary figure of Salomon Trismosin and his creation by followers of Theophrastus Paracelsus as part of an attempt to integrate their master in a lineage of ancient alchemical philosophers. The images are taken from the British Library manuscript Harley 3469, the finest example of the Splendor Solis to survive.","Body, Mind & Spirit",219,N/A,0,en

The Journey Toward Complete Recovery,Michael Picucci,North Atlantic Books,1998-09-25,"Founder of the Institute for Staged Recovery in New York City and creator of ""Authentic Process Therapy,"" Picucci is an addictions counselor who bases his methods primarily on personal experience. In this updated edition of his self-published Complete Recovery, Picucci describes a ""Stage Two"" recovery program for evolving beyond freedom from addictions to ""holism,"" which encompasses joy, bliss, love, empowerment, creativity, respect for all life, and peace. Picucci makes an interesting distinction between recovery from addictions and childhood traumas"" and ""recovery of fulfillment, wisdom, serenity, and emotional, spiritual and sexual wholeness. Using a structure of 12 stations, which can be visited and revisited in any order as often as needed, he guides readers through six fundamental and six emergent modules of this process for healing the ""spiritual-sexual split"" and the ""cultural pain... of oppressed minorities,"" and ultimately achieving the ""shame-free presentation of self."" Picucci says he offers ""nothing less than a re-birthing process"" through a combination of one-on-one psychotherapy, support groups and spirituality. His own life experiences as a gay man, once married, now HIV positive, surviving AIDS, cancer, a heart attack, triple-bypass surgery and drug and alcohol addictions give him a uniquely credible perspective on healing and wholeness. In his cogent, well-organized handbook, Picucci functions a bit like the gay shamans who had a special place in North American Indian tribes.

Health Care Economics,"John B. Davis, Robert McMaster",Routledge,2017-06-01,"The analytical approach of standard health economics has so far failed to sufficiently account for the nature of care. This has important ramifications for the analysis and valuation of care, and therefore for the pattern of health and medical care provision. This book sets out an alternative approach, which places care at the center of an economics of health, showing how essential it is that care is appropriately recognized in policy as a means of enhancing the dignity of the individual. Whereas traditional health economics has tended to eschew value issues, this book embraces them, introducing care as a normative element at the center of theoretical analysis. Drawing upon care theory from feminist works, philosophy, nursing and medicine, and political economy, the authors develop a health care economics with a moral basis in health care systems. In providing deeper insights into the nature of care and caring, this book seeks to redress the shortcomings of the standard approach and contribute to the development of a more person-based approach to health and medical care in economics. Health Care Economics will be of interest to researchers and postgraduate students in health economics, heterodox economists, and those interested in health and medical care.",Business & Economics,225,N/A,0,en

Quantum Leadership,"Frederick Chavalit Tsao, Chris Laszlo",Stanford University Press,2019-07-30,"In this new book, Frederick Chavalit Tsao and Chris Laszlo argue that current approaches to leadership fail to produce positive outcomes for either businesses or the communities they serve. Employee disengagement and customer fickleness remain high, resulting in a lack of creativity and collaboration at all levels of entrepreneurial activity. Investor demand for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) continues to be poorly integrated into profit strategies. Drawing on extensive research, this book shows how changing a person's consciousness is the most powerful lever for unlocking his or her leadership potential to create wealth and serve humankind. A wide range of practices of connectedness provide the keys. The journey to higher consciousness changes people at a deep intuitive level, combining embodied experience with analytic-cognitive skill development. Tsao and Laszlo show how leaders who pursue this journey are more likely to flourish with significant benefits to both business and society. These include greater creativity and collaboration along with an increased capability to inspire people and produce lasting change. Readers will come away with a deep understanding of quantum leadership and the day-to-day practices that can help them achieve greater effectiveness and wellbeing at work.",Business & Economics,292,N/A,0,en

Surprised by Hope,N. T. Wright,Zondervan,2008-02-05,"For years Christians have been asking, ""If you died tonight, do you know where you would go?"" It turns out that many believers have been giving the wrong answer. It is not heaven. Award-winning author N. T. Wright outlines the present confusion about a Christian's future hope and shows how it is deeply intertwined with how we live today. Wright, who is one of today's premier Bible scholars, asserts that Christianity's most distinctive idea is bodily resurrection. He provides a magisterial defense for a literal resurrection of Jesus and shows how this became the cornerstone for the Christian community's hope in the bodily resurrection of all people at the end of the age. Wright then explores our expectation of ""new heavens and a new earth,"" revealing what happens to the dead until then and what will happen with the ""second coming"" of Jesus. For many, including many Christians, all this will come as a great surprise. Wright convincingly argues that what we believe about life after death directly affects what we believe about life before death. For if God intends to renew the whole creation—and if this has already begun in Jesus's resurrection—the church cannot stop at ""saving souls"" but must anticipate the eventual renewal by working for God's kingdom in the wider world, bringing healing and hope in the present life. Lively and accessible, this book will surprise and excite all who are interested in the meaning of life, not only after death but before it.",Religion,356,N/A,0,en

Ancient Greek Cosmogony,Andrew Gregory,A&amp;C Black,2008-01-03,"Ancient Greek Cosmogony is the first detailed, comprehensive account of ancient Greek theories of the origins of the world. It covers the period from 800 BC to 600 AD, beginning with myths concerning the creation of the world; the cosmogonies of all the major Greek and Roman thinkers; and the debate between Greek philosophical cosmogony and early Christian views. It argues that Greeks formulated many of the perennial problems of philosophical cosmogony and produced philosophically and scientifically interesting answers. The atomists argued that our world was one among many worlds, and came about by chance. Plato argued that it is unique, and the product of design. Empedocles and the Stoics, in quite different ways, argued that there was an unending cycle whereby the world is generated, destroyed and generated again. Aristotle on the other hand argued that there was no such thing as cosmogony, and the world has always existed. Reactions to, and developments of, these ideas are traced through Hellenistic philosophy and the debates in early Christianity on whether God created the world from nothing or from some pre-existing chaos. The book examines issues of the origins of life and the elements for the ancient Greeks, and how the cosmos will come to an end. It argues that there were several interesting debates between Greek philosophers on the fundamental principles of cosmogony, and that these debates were influential on the development of Greek philosophy and science.",History,327,N/A,0,en

Biomedical and anthropological data on the use of ayahuasca for treating depression, PTSD, and substance dependence in different settings, such as indigenous contexts, neo-shamanic rituals, contemporary therapeutic circles, and in ayahuasca religions, in both South and North America, are presented and critiqued. Though multiple anecdotal reports on the therapeutic use of ayahuasca exist, there has been no systematic and dense reflection on the topic thus far. The book brings the therapeutic use of ayahuasca to a new level of public examination and academic debate.

Experimental Research Designs in Social Work,Bruce A. Thyer,Columbia University Press,2023-08-22,"Experimental research is of great value to social work. Well-designed studies help social workers understand which approaches are most effective, with implications for both practice with individual clients and social policy more broadly. Many social work practitioners conduct studies that randomly assign clients to specific interventions and various control groups in order to assess policy outcomes. However, social work programs often do not teach experimental methods. Critics continue to assert that true experiments are impractical, unethical, or simply too blunt a tool to evaluate the effects of social work practices and policies. This book presents a comprehensive overview of the theory and practice of experimental research in the field of social work. Bruce A. Thyer describes the logic and design of experimental methods, helping readers understand the basics and then exploring increasingly complex and sophisticated research. He illustrates key principles through examples of how social workers have evaluated real-world practice approaches. The book considers recruitment and representation of marginalized groups, the ethical issues involved in the design and conduct of experiments, and how social work researchers can ensure that all participants in an experimental study benefit from effective care. An appendix contains a chronological listing of published studies authored by social workers who conducted experimental research. Accessible to social work undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral students alike and valuable for professionals from clinical workers to policy analysts, this book demonstrates the utility of experimental research across the entire spectrum of social work practice.",Social Science,429,N/A,0,en

A Lutheran minister, no believer in Purgatory, is the puzzled recipient of repeated visitations from ""demons"" who come to him seeking prayer, consolation, and refuge in his little German church. But pity for the poor spirits overcomes the man's skepticism, and he marvels at what kind of departed souls could belong to Christ and yet suffer still... Hungry Souls recounts these stories and many others trustworthy, Church-verified accounts of earthly visitations from the dead in Purgatory. Accompanying these accounts are images from the ""Museum of Purgatory"" in Rome, which contains relics of encounters with the Holy Souls, including numerous evidences of hand prints burned into clothing and books; burn marks that cannot be explained by natural means or duplicated by artificial ones.

Daring Greatly,Brené Brown,Penguin UK,2013-01-17,"**Now on Netflix as The Call to Courage** 'She's so good, Brené Brown, at finding the language to articulate collective feeling' Dolly Alderton Every time we are faced with change, no matter how great or small, we also face risk. We feel uncertain and exposed. We feel vulnerable. Most of us try to fight those feelings - or feel guilt for feeling them in the first place. In a powerful new vision Dr Brené Brown challenges everything we think we know about vulnerability, and dispels the widely accepted myth that it's a weakness. She argues that, in truth, vulnerability is strength and when we shut ourselves off from vulnerability - from revealing our true selves - we distance ourselves from the experiences that bring purpose and meaning to our lives. Daring Greatly is the culmination of 12 years of groundbreaking social research, across every area of our lives including home, relationships, work, and parenting.

Beyond the Indigo Children,P. M. H. Atwater,Simon and Schuster,2005-09-29,"Connects the arrival of a new type of children with the fulfillment of the Fifth World of the Mayan Calendar and other great prophecies • Provides detailed information about the world changes that will take place before and after December 21, 2012 • Explores the seven ""root races"" representing the genetic gene pool of the human family and the phenomenon of soaring intelligence • Explains the grand sweep of human evolution and the worldwide ascension of energy now occurring, which will take humanity to the next level of development According to prophecy, the fifth sun or fifth world of the Mayan calendar moves into a higher octave of vibration, or ascension, on December 21, 2012. This date represents a ""gateway"" of planetary development that will open humanity to new ways of living and new worlds of opportunity. Ancient traditions have foretold that our successful passage through this gateway depends on the ""fifth root race""--new stock in the human gene pool--destined to help us through the exciting and massive changes ahead. In Beyond the Indigo Children P. M. H. Atwater illuminates the characteristics of the fifth root race, the capstone being the extraordinary ""new children,"" those brilliant and irreverent kids born since 1982. She explores the relationship of the new children to the prophecies in the Mayan calendar and other traditions, providing extensive background information about the seven root races (the sixth and seventh of which haven’t yet appeared) and the great shifting of consciousness already underway. She reveals the connection of the seven root races to the seven chakras, and how the fifth chakra--the chakra of willpower--will be opened for humankind as the new children grow to maturity. She also discusses the phenomenon of soaring intelligence and undeveloped potential and provides concrete guidance and tools for those who seek to understand and help the new children achieve their full potential. Beyond the Indigo Children is the first major study of today’s children, and their place in our rapidly changing world, that combines objective research with mystical revelation and prophecy.",Family & Relationships,226,N/A,0,en

Everybody: A Book about Freedom,Olivia Laing,W. W. Norton & Company,2021-05-04,"""Astute and consistently surprising critic"" (NPR) Olivia Laing investigates the body and its discontents through the great freedom movements of the twentieth century. The body is a source of pleasure and of pain, at once hopelessly vulnerable and radiant with power. In her ambitious, brilliant sixth book, Olivia Laing charts an electrifying course through the long struggle for bodily freedom, using the life of the renegade psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich to explore gay rights and sexual liberation, feminism, and the civil rights movement. Drawing on her own experiences in protest and alternative medicine, and traveling from Weimar Berlin to the prisons of McCarthy-era America, Laing grapples with some of the most significant and complicated figures of the past century—among them Nina Simone, Christopher Isherwood, Andrea Dworkin, Sigmund Freud, Susan Sontag, and Malcolm X. Despite its many burdens, the body remains a source of power, even in an era as technologized and automated as our own. Arriving at a moment in which basic bodily rights are once again imperiled, Everybody is an investigation into the forces arranged against freedom and a celebration of how ordinary human bodies can resist oppression and reshape the world.",Philosophy,311,N/A,0,en

The Language of Mediums and Psychics,Robin Wooffitt,Routledge,2017-03-02,"Every week thousands of people in Europe and the USA consult psychic practitioners. Communication is crucial to the performance of psychic powers in a range of settings. Psychic practitioners use language to demonstrate their powers, whether they are reporting the words of their spirit contacts or interpreting the spread of Tarot cards. Their clients also accept or reject this information through talk. This book presents the first sustained study of the verbal interaction between the various kinds of psychic practitioners and their clients. Using conversation analysis, Robin Wooffitt examines the structure of the interaction, focusing on the ways in which psychic practitioners and their clients establish the authenticity of the claimed paranormal powers. Adopting a neutral standpoint towards the status of the claims of psychic practitioners, the book raises important issues about the role of social science in understanding the activities of psychic practitioners and other kinds of parapsychological phenomena. This highly original study will appeal to students and scholars of discourse studies, and to sociologists interested in conversation analysis. It is written in a style accessible to non-specialists, and will also interest parapsychologists and social scientists studying psychic phenomena and the paranormal.",Social Science,178,N/A,0,en

Connect,Ilchi Lee,Best Life Media,2019-07-15,"The solution to your problems starts with connecting to yourself. An inspirational guide to a powerful meditation method for greater clarity, consciousness, and spiritual growth by New York Times bestselling author and world-renowned meditation teacher Ilchi Lee. Are you feeling stuck in your current situation or your life in general? Are you having trouble managing stress? Have you sought answers at spiritual retreats without getting the clarity you need? Relief can be closer than you think if you reframe how you look at your problems. New York Times bestselling author Ilchi Lee proposes there is one root cause to all the troubles plaguing us—separation. We put up walls in every aspect of our lives, isolating ourselves. Those walls keep us from forming healthy relationships with others, with nature, and even with ourselves. But separation has a simple cure—finding a way to connect. In Connect: How to Find Clarity and Expand Your Consciousness with Pineal Gland Meditation, Lee shows how to connect to your authentic self through the pineal gland in your brain. Activate your pineal gland through the meditations rooted in an ancient Korean tradition that Ilchi Lee describes in this book. You’ll experience clarity instead of emotion, compassion rather than judgment, and wholeness in place of separation. This book will help you find the solutions you seek by opening the inner eye that leads to greater clarity regarding the health of your body, the dreams of your soul, and the wisdom of your spirit.

Modernity and Subjectivity,Harvie Ferguson,University of Virginia Press,2000,"Few concepts have come to dominate the human sciences as much as modernity, yet there is very little agreement over what the term actually means. Every aspect of contemporary human reality--modern society, modern life, modern times, modern art, modern science, modern music, the modern world--has been cited as a part of modernity's distinctive and all-embracing presence. But what is the exact nature of the reality to which the term modern refers? Has not such a promiscuous, ill-defined concept come to obscure and confuse rather than clarify a genuine understanding of our experience? Harvie Ferguson proposes a new view of modernity, arguing that, although it may variously be associated with the Renaissance, the European discovery of the New World, the Reformation, the Industrial Revolution, and many other significant ruptures with primitive or premodern society, modernity fails as an idea if it only defines itself against what it replaced. Instead, he writes, modernity finds its clearest definition through an exploration of subjectivity. For the modern world there is no higher authority than experience. No longer is the human world subordinate to a divine reality beyond the capacity of its own senses. This idea finds its greatest expression in the philosophy of doubt originated by Descartes. Doubt seemed the radical starting point from which to found a wholly modern philosophy that makes the distinction between subject and object, but those who came after Descartes soon reached the limits of self-discovery and became trapped in deepening levels of despair. This despair in turn found expression in the concepts of self and other, and eventually in a dialectic of ego and world, which distinguishes and links together the most important social, cultural, and psychological aspects of modernity. Moving beyond these dualities of subject and object, mind and body, ego and world, and replacing them with the triad of body, soul, and spirit, Ferguson redraws the map of contemporary experience, finding links with the premodern world that modernity's self-founding concealed.",Philosophy,236,N/A,0,en

Haunted Bauhaus,Elizabeth Otto,MIT Press,2023-12-20,"An investigation of the irrational and the unconventional currents swirling behind the Bauhaus's signature sleek surfaces and austere structures. The Bauhaus (1919–1933) is widely regarded as the twentieth century's most influential art, architecture, and design school, celebrated as the archetypal movement of rational modernism and famous for bringing functional and elegant design to the masses. In Haunted Bauhaus, art historian Elizabeth Otto liberates Bauhaus history, uncovering a movement that is vastly more diverse and paradoxical than previously assumed. Otto traces the surprising trajectories of the school's engagement with occult spirituality, gender fluidity, queer identities, and radical politics. The Bauhaus, she shows us, is haunted by these untold stories. The Bauhaus is most often associated with a handful of famous artists, architects, and designers—notably Paul Klee, Walter Gropius, László Moholy-Nagy, and Marcel Breuer. Otto enlarges this narrow focus by reclaiming the historically marginalized lives and accomplishments of many of the more than 1,200 Bauhaus teachers and students (the so-called Bauhäusler), arguing that they are central to our understanding of this movement. Otto reveals Bauhaus members' spiritual experimentation, expressed in double-exposed “spirit photographs” and enacted in breathing exercises and nude gymnastics; their explorations of the dark sides of masculinity and emerging female identities; the “queer hauntology” of certain Bauhaus works; and the role of radical politics on both the left and the right—during the school's Communist period, when some of the Bauhäusler put their skills to work for the revolution, and, later, into the service of the Nazis. With Haunted Bauhaus, Otto not only expands our knowledge of a foundational movement of modern art, architecture, and design, she also provides the first sustained investigation of the irrational and the unconventional currents swirling behind the Bauhaus's signature sleek surfaces and austere structures. This is a fresh, wild ride through the Bauhaus you thought you knew.",Social Science,324,N/A,0,en

Integrative Body-Mind-Spirit Social Work,"Mo Yee Lee, Celia C. H. Y. Chan, Cecilia L. W. Chan, Siu-man Ng, Pamela P. Y. Leung",Oxford University Press,2018-03-09,"Integrative therapy focuses on the mind-body-spirit relationship, recognizes spirituality as a fundamental domain of human existence, acknowledges and utilizes the mind's power as well as the body's, and reaches beyond self-actualization or symptom reduction to broaden a perception of self that connects individuals to a larger sense of themselves and to their communities. When it was published in 2009, Integrative Body-Mind-Spirit Social Work was the first book to strongly connect Western therapeutic techniques with Eastern philosophy and practices, while also providing a comprehensive and pragmatic agenda for social work, and mental health professionals. This breakthrough text, written by a cast of highly regarded researchers from both Asia and America, presented a holistic, therapeutic approach that ties Eastern philosophy and practical techniques to Western forms of therapy in order to help bring about positive, transformative changes in individuals and families. This second features a major reorganization of Part III: Applications and Treatment Effectiveness, renamed to ""Evidence-informed Translational Practice and Evidence."" Based on systematic reviews of Integrative body-mind-spirit practices, Part III provides a ""resource guide"" of different types of integrative practices used in diverse health and mental health conditions. A new companion website includes streaming video clips showing demonstrations of the BMS techniques described in the book and worksheets and client resources/handouts. Here, the authors provide a pragmatic, step-by-step description of assessment and treatment techniques that employ an integrative, holistic perspective. They begin by establishing the conceptual framework of integrative body-mind-spirit social work, then expertly describe, step-by-step, assessment and treatment techniques that utilize integrative and holistic perspectives. Numerous case studies demonstrate the approach in action, such as one with breast cancer patients who participated in body-mind-spirit and social support groups and another in which trauma survivors used meditation to get onto a path of healing. These examples provide solid empirical evidence that integrative body-mind-spirit social work is indeed a practical therapeutic approach in bringing about tangible changes in clients. The authors also discuss ethical issues and give tips for learning integrative body-mind-spirit social work. Professionals in social work, psychology, counseling, and nursing, as well as graduate students in courses on integral, alternative, or complementary clinical practice will find this a much-needed resource that complements the growing interest in alternatives to traditional Western psychotherapy.",Social Science,473,N/A,0,en

Genesis Quest,Barry Verdi,WestBow Press,2014-10-21,"Are the stories in Genesis fact, myth, legend, the word of God, philosophy, or something else? Through time, what people think or remember about Genesis has become a mixture of fact and fable. For example, if you were to ask someone what fruit Adam and Eve were tempted by, most people might say, An apple. If you were to ask what color the apple was, most people might state that they think the fruit was red. Are these actual facts? No, people are simply using artistic imagination. The stories in Genesis are multifaceted oral traditions about the human family that originated long before the established interpretations, dogmas, and doctrines of our contemporary world. One thing the stories do indicate is that we are all genetically connected regardless of our outward appearance, yet we are divided due to multiple factors related to our situation in life and personal beliefs.

Rather than patch over differences, the volume invites us to understand historical roots of unresolvable tensions, and live with them.

To Save the Love that Was Lost,"Lyman Allen, Sofia",AuthorHouse,2008-03,"When asked what led him to write To Save the Love That Was Lost. Lyman Allen said, ""I wrote because I had to. It was a matter of passion I should say 'guided passion, ' because I found out that I was guided, and so the book is ours, Sofia's and mine. There was a lid on my passion: I wanted to believe that life made more sense than what we experience every day. We function from day to day, yes, but I think a lot of us live with a gut feeling of how life ought to be, and this is backed up, maybe, by a higher sense of that truth. Well I found that there is that truth, and it's in To Save the Love that Was Lost. In fact it's in the title. So, I'm offering an invitation to people to peek out from under that lid and see what they might find. I found the answer that makes sense. ""Our book is about the original message of Jesus-Christianity before it was taken over by organized faith (is that a contradiction in terms?) It's about what was intended to work for the world, how we must learn to live. I found that Jesus' lost teachings are supported by religious history of 20-even 26-centuries ago. A lot of those teachings were discovered in 1945, hidden for all that time. They never got tampered with. ""The title is from a verse deleted from a famous parable. It's a mission statement about advancing the original Christianity of Jesus-that's the love part-and it relates directly to the fate of our planet.

Muscular Christianity,"Clifford Putney, Assistant Professor of History Clifford Putney",Harvard University Press,2009-06-01,"Dissatisfied with a Victorian culture focused on domesticity and threatened by physical decline in sedentary office jobs, American men in the late nineteenth century sought masculine company in fraternal lodges and engaged in exercise to invigorate their bodies. One form of this new manly culture, developed out of the Protestant churches, was known as muscular Christianity. In this fascinating study, Clifford Putney details how Protestant leaders promoted competitive sports and physical education to create an ideal of Christian manliness.",Religion,320,5,1,en

Foundations for a Humanitarian Economy,William D. Bishop,Routledge,2022-03-17,"The modern global economy and discipline of economics place mathematical calculation above human concern. However, a re-reading of Boethius’ The Consolation of Philosophy can positively highlight the contrast in values and spirit of the early medieval European world with our own scientific age. This book discusses the historical and cultural contexts that influenced Boethius’ writing and explores how Consolation offers a radically different understanding of economic concepts: wealth from inner happiness and virtues, poverty from hoarding outer possessions, self-sufficiency in the greater whole, enlightenment through misfortune, and development as fruition from the Good. These economic considerations resonate with a range of heterodox economic perspectives, such as Ecological and Buddhist Economics. The fundamental revaluations gained through Boethius pose a critique of mainstream neoclassical and neoliberal economics: to consumerism, avarice, growth and technology fetishism, and market rationality. These economic foundations resonate into a time when global crises raise the question of fundamental human priorities, offering alternatives to an ever-expanding industrial market economy designed for profit, and helping to avoid irrevocable socio-ecological disasters. The issues raised and questioned in this book will be of significant interest to readers with concern for pluralist approaches to economics, philosophy, classics, ancient history and theology.",Business & Economics,86,N/A,0,en

Spiritual Diversity in Social Work Practice,"Edward R. Canda, Leola Dyrud Furman, Hwi-Ja Canda",N/A,2019-11-05,"""The first edition of this book (1999, Free Press) provided the first comprehensive framework of knowledge, values, and skills for addressing spiritual diversity in social work at a time when this topic was little known or accepted. The second edition (2010, Oxford University Press) was revised and expanded to reflect the significant growth of interest in spirituality within social work and other helping professions, in the USA and around the world. This third edition builds on that foundation and much expanded multidisciplinary and international work on the topic during the past eight years, including our own. In particular, this edition includes case examples and insights from a new third author, Hwi-Ja Canda, based on her 30 years of experience as a social work practitioner, in order to make the professional applications of our framework even more vivid and practical. The main new features of the third edition are: - Reorganization of content to enhance flow of ideas and guidelines for practice, including expansion of content on assessment and practice with two added chapters in Part III - Twice as many case examples and vignettes from personal and professional experiences, organized into 40 Scenarios throughout the book - Significantly expanded transdisciplinary literature review throughout the book - Increased integration of the strengths perspective throughout - Increase of international perspective, including analysis of worldwide professional codes of ethics - More exercises to engage the reader in personal and professional growth - Significant refinements of sections on human diversity, religious perspectives, and addition of 12 Steps perspective in Part II""--",Political Science,625,N/A,0,en

Hostility to Hospitality,"Michael J. Balboni, Tracy A. Balboni",Oxford University Press,2018-10-12,"Spiritual sickness troubles American medicine. Through a death-denying culture, medicine has gained enormous power-an influence it maintains by distancing itself from religion, which too often reminds us of our mortality. As a result of this separation of medicine and religion, patients facing serious illness infrequently receive adequate spiritual care, despite the large body of empirical data demonstrating its importance to patient decision-making, quality of life, and medical utilization. This secular-sacred divide also unleashes depersonalizing, social forces through the market, technology, and legal-bureaucratic powers that reduce clinicians to tiny cogs in an unstoppable machine. Hostility to Hospitality is one of the first books of its kind to explore these hostilities threatening medicine and offer a path forward for the partnership of modern medicine and spirituality. Drawing from interdisciplinary scholarship including empirical studies, interviews, history and sociology, theology, and public policy, the authors argue for structural pluralism as the key to changing hostility to hospitality.",Medical,353,N/A,0,en

Gratitude is the simple, scientifically proven way to increase happiness and encourage greater joy, love, peace, and optimism into our lives.

The Mountain of Silence,Kyriacos C. Markides,Image,2002-11-19,"An acclaimed expert in Christian mysticism travels to a monastery high in the Trodos Mountains of Cyprus and offers a fascinating look at the Greek Orthodox approach to spirituality that will appeal to readers of Carlos Castaneda. In an engaging combination of dialogues, reflections, conversations, history, and travel information, Kyriacos C. Markides continues the exploration of a spiritual tradition and practice little known in the West he began in Riding with the Lion. His earlier book took readers to the isolated peninsula of Mount Athos in northern Greece and into the group of ancient monasteries. There, in what might be called a “Christian Tibet,” two thousand monks and hermits practice the spiritual arts to attain a oneness with God. In his new book, Markides follows Father Maximos, one of Mount Athos’s monks, to the troubled island of Cyprus. As Father Maximos establishes churches, convents, and monasteries in this deeply divided land, Markides is awakened anew to the magnificent spirituality of the Greek Orthodox Church. Images of the land and the people of Cyprus and details of its tragic history enrich the Mountain of Silence. Like the writings of Castaneda, the book brilliantly evokes the confluence of an inner and outer journey. The depth and richness of its spiritual message echo the thoughts and writings of Saint Francis of Assisi and other great saints of the Church as well. The result is a remarkable work–a moving, profoundly human examination of the role and the power of spirituality in a complex and confusing world.",Religion,274,4.5,2,en

Wellness Tourism,"Cornelia Voigt, Christof Pforr",Routledge,2013-11-20,"Core values of society, health and wellbeing impact today on all aspects of our lives, and have also increasingly influenced patterns of tourism consumption and production. In this context wellness has developed into a significant dimension of tourism in a number of new and long established destinations. However, although it is consistently referred to as one of the most rapidly growing forms of tourism worldwide there still remains a dearth of academic literature on this topic. This book uniquely focuses on the supply side of wellness tourism from a destination perspective in terms of the generation and delivery of products and services for tourists who seek to maintain and improve their health. This approach provides a better understanding of how wellness tourism destinations develop and explores the specific drivers of that growth in a destination context and how destinations successfully compete against each other in globalised market place. A range of wellness destination development and management issues are examined including the importance of authenticity, an appropriate policy framework, delivery of high quality goods and services, participation of a broad range of stakeholders and the development of networks and clusters as well as collaborative strategies essential for a successful development and management of a wellness tourism destination. International case studies and examples from established and new wellness tourism destinations are integrated throughout.

Compassionate Love in Intimate Relationships,Josiane M. Apollon,Routledge,2021-12-29,"Drawing on interviews conducted with Black couples in the United States, this book explores relational resilience and identifies unique adaptation strategies that enable couples to overcome the multigenerational effects of violence and sexual mass trauma from slavery and activates compassionate love in flourishing relationships. By applying Appreciative Inquiry (AI) methodology and family systems theory, the book captures the spiritual, emotional, and sexual dimensions in Black couple systems that gives meaning to their resilient relationships in the context of contemporary America.

Embodiment and the Arts: Views from South Africa,Jenni Lauwrens,Pretoria University Law Press,2022-11-21,"About the publication Embodiment and the Arts: Views from South Africa presents a diversity of views on the nature and status of the body in relation to acting, advertisements, designs, films, installations, music, photographs, performance, typography, and video works. Applying the methodologies of phenomenology, hermeneutic phenomenology, embodied perception, ecological psychology, and sense-based research, the authors place the body at the centre of their analyses. The cornerstone of the research presented here is the view that aesthetic experience is active and engaged rather than passive and disinterested.

Jung and the Alchemical Imagination,Jeffrey Raff,"Nicolas-Hays, Inc.",2000-11-15,"Jung and the Alchemical Imagination illustrates the spiritual nature of Jungian psychology and the debt it owes to the tradition of esoteric religion. Unlike other books on Jung and alchemy which contain a psychological interpretation of alchemical material, this work uses alchemy to understand the three cornerstones of Jungian spirituality--the self, the transcendent function, and active imagination. Through the interpretation of alchemical imagery, Raff explains the nature of these three concepts and illustrates how together they form a new model of contemporary Western spirituality. This book is also unique in selecting alchemical texts for analysis that are relatively unknown and which, for the most part, have never been interpreted. In addition, he presents two new concepts--the ally and the psychoid realm. Through the addition of these ideas, and the new understanding that they offer, it is possible to apply alchemical imagery to transpsychic experience/ that is, to a world of spirits which may not be reduced to psychological concepts. By including this realm in the study of alchemy and Jungian thought, it is possible to gain insights into the nature of visionary and ecstatic experiences that form part of the path of individuation--the road to completion.","Body, Mind & Spirit",346,N/A,0,en

Promoting Health and Well-being in Social Work Education,"Beth R. Crisp, Liz Beddoe",Routledge,2013-10-18,"Social work educators can play an important part in ensuring that the promotion of health and well-being is firmly on the social work agenda for service users, as well as for students and educators. Nevertheless, this has not been a priority within social work education and presents a challenge which requires some re-thinking in terms of curriculum content, pedagogy, and how social workers respond to social problems. Furthermore, if the promotion of health and well-being is not considered a priority for social workers, this raises important questions about the role and relevance of social work in health, and thus poses challenges to social work education, both now and in the future. This book contains contributions from social work educators from Australia, America, Canada, New Zealand and the UK. They reflect on how best to prepare students to put health and well-being to the forefront of practice, drawing on research on quality of life, subjective well-being, student well-being, community participation and social connectedness, religion and spirituality, mindful practices, trauma and health inequalities.

When the Whales Leave,Yuri Rytkheu,Milkweed Editions,2019-12-05,"This fable of an indigenous Arctic people “offers profound considerations about stewardship of and people’s relationships to the natural world” (Publishers Weekly). Nau cannot remember a time when she was not one with the world around her: with the fast breeze, the green grass, the high clouds, and the endless blue sky above the Shingled Spit. But her greatest joy is to visit the sea, where whales gather every morning to gaily spout rainbows. Then one day, she finds a man in the mist where a whale should be: Reu, who has taken human form out of his Great Love for her. Together these first humans become parents to two whales, and then to mankind. Even after Reu dies, Nau continues on, sharing her story of brotherhood between the two species. But as these origins grow distant, the old woman’s tales are subsumed into myth—and her descendants are increasingly bent on parading their dominance over the natural world. Buoyantly translated into English for the first time by Ilona Yazhbin Chavasse, this new entry in the Seedbank series is at once a vibrant retelling of the origin story of the Chukchi, a timely parable about the destructive power of human ego—and another unforgettable work of fiction from Yuri Rytkheu, “arguably the foremost writer to emerge from the minority peoples of Russia’s far north” (New York Review of Books). “We have so little intimate information about these Arctic people, and the writer’s deep emotional attachment to this landscape of ice (today melting away under global warming forces) makes every sentence seem a poetic revelation.” —Annie Proulx",Fiction,96,N/A,0,en

Managing Pain in the Older Adult,"Michaelene P. Jansen, PhD, RN-C, GNP-BC, NP-C",Springer Publishing Company,2008-03-20,"Our elderly population is the fastest-growing segment of society, and pain, particularly chronic pain, is one of the most common problems this group faces. In Managing Pain in the Older Adult, Dr. Jansen provides treatment options designed for older adults. Controlling pain can be challenging as the elderly, in addition to the common physiologic changes of aging, often have multiple health problems and take many medications. Furthermore, drugs are only rarely tested on older adults, so pharmaceutical intervention often relies on a slow trial and error regime. Drawing on her experience in critical care and neuroscience nursing as well as work as a GNP, Dr. Jansen adopts a multimodality approach to focus on the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of acute and chronic pain among older adults with interventional, non-interventional, pharmacotherapeutic, and nonpharmacotherapeutic methods. Managing Pain in the Older Adult addresses a myriad of factors pertaining exclusively to pain management among the elderly, including: The importance of early recognition of pain symptoms Environmental factors that influence pain and its perception Specific issues involved when treating the elderly Non-pharmaceutical treatments: physical therapy, acupuncture, and other complementary techniques Lack of resources for treating pain in the aged The book will serve as an invaluable reference for a wide range of health care providers working with our aging population.",Medical,245,N/A,0,en

A Vindication of the Rights of Men,Mary Wollstonecraft,Jazzybee Verlag,2017,"In 1790 came that ""extraordinary outburst of passionate intelligence,"" Mary Wollstonecraft's reply to Edmund Burke's attack on the principles of the French Revolution entitled a ""Vindication of the Rights of Men."" In this pamphlet she held up to scorn Burke's defence of monarch and nobility, his merciless sentimentality. ""It is one of the most dashing political polemics in the language,"" Mr. Taylor writes enthusiastically, ""and has not had the attention it deserves. . . . For sheer virility and grip of her verbal instruments it is probably the finest of her works. Some of her sentences have the quality of a sword-edge, and they flash with the rapidity of a practised duellist. It was written at a white heat of indignation; yet it is altogether typical of the writer that, in the midst of the work, quite suddenly, she had one of her fits of callousness and morbid temper, and declared she would not go on. With great skill Johnson persuaded her to take it up again; and with equal suddenness her eagerness returned, and the book was finished and published before any one else could answer Burke.""",Social Science,88,N/A,0,en

Innovative Skills to Increase Cohesion and Communication in Couples,"Julie Anne Laser-Maira, Nicole Nicotera",Oxford University Press,2019-04-16,"Couples who enter therapy often view the endeavor as a last-ditch effort before seeking legal services, filing for divorce, and parting ways for good. Given this mentality at the outset, couples therapy is not always successful or enjoyable-for either the client or the therapist. It is also an area of practice that is often given short shrift in training programs that predominantly focus on clinical skills in work with children and adolescents, group work, practice in specific settings, and assessment and treatment of mental disorders. Innovative Skills to Increase Cohesion and Communication in Couples discusses evidence-based clinical techniques and skills that support and nurture couples in their relationship. Each chapter begins with a succinct overview of a technique, evidence that supports it, and ideas for assessment to ensure it is appropriate for the couple. Subsequent sections of each chapter provide clear examples of approaches so that new or seasoned clinicians will have requisite knowledge for effective implementation, required materials, suitable locations for use, and personal preparation. The text serves as an essential resource for clinicians, as well as social work, counseling, and psychology students and professors.",Psychology,153,N/A,0,en

Social Work Diagnosis in Contemporary Practice,Francis J. Turner,Oxford University Press,2005-02-10,"The unifying theme of this broad-reaching volume is that responsible, ethical, and effective social work practice rests on the diagnostic skills of the practitioner. Social work diagnosis refers to the conscious formulation of an ongoing set of decisions about the client and his or her situation, which serve as the basis for intervention-decisions for which the practitioner must be prepared to take responsibility. Diagnostic skill development is an ongoing process principally enhanced by a continuous commitment to remain at the cutting edge of the profession's body of knowledge, but one of the challenges for today's practitioner is keeping abreast of the rapidly expanding body of knowledge contained in some 200 important social work periodicals in circulation. Francis J. Turner, a preeminent clinical scholar, brings together in one volume some of the best work published since 2000, each reflecting new insights into understanding psychosocial situations and innovative methods of applying knowledge and skills in an increasingly effective manner. Each of the 78 articles in this volume highlights some of the critical dimensions of contemporary social work practice, guiding clinicians to address four key aspects in order to craft an accurate diagnosis. The first section presents articles covering the developmental spectrum, each of which fully explains various ages and stages of development. The second section focuses on a range of specific situations, helping practitioners and students enrich their understanding of different types of problems they meet in contemporary practice, whether they are based in mental illness, psychosocial issues, or physical ailments. The third section addresses the crucial component of diversity, demonstrating the complexity and critical importance of truly understanding clients and their lives. The last section of the book discusses innovative approaches to practice, selected to offer practitioners easy access to the latest interventions for a host of contemporary challenges facing clients and their therapists. Broad in scope and tightly focused on the goal of providing the most up-to-date information necessary for accuracy in the diagnostic process, this volume represents some of the best research available to today's social workers.",Social Science,849,N/A,0,en

A Better Way to Pray,Andrew Wommack,Harrison House Publishers,2007,"After nearly four decades of ministry, Andrew Wommack has discovered some important truths about prayer. His prayer life is much different than it was thirty years ago and the results have dramatically improved! You may be asking many of the same questions Andrew once did. Is prayer my Christian duty? Is prayer primarily about asking God to meet my needs and the needs of others? Is God's answer to my prayer based on the degree of my humility and sincerity? Is answered prayer a sovereign decision of God or do I have the ability to influence Him? Clear, scriptural answers to these questions and more could significantly change the way you pray. These principles may not be the only way to pray, but if you're not getting the results you desire, consider changing directions; maybe there is A Better Way to Pray.",Religion,193,5,3,en

Secret Teachings of Moses,Aunel Va Daath,Glorian Pub,2010-11-01,"Moses, the great patriarch in the heart of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, wrote the first five books of the Bible or Tanakh, perhaps the most influential books in Western history. Yet, because they were written in Hebrew, a highly symbolic and deeply mystical language, few have revealed the true meanings of the stories and events he described. When you know the Hebrew letters and the structures of Kabbalah, the secret teachings of Moses radiate with stark clarity, and echo throughout the entire range of Jewish and Christian scriptures, especially in the Gospels of Jesus. This book focuses on the second chapter of Genesis (Bereshit), which establishes the foundation of the Jewish and Christian religions. With this knowledge you can understand the true meaning of Adam and Eve, the Garden of Eden, the presence of the serpent, and all of the rest of the teachings that follow these symbols. Yet, this is not merely scholarly theology: by understanding what Moses actually wrote, anyone can see the true basis of human suffering and how to change it.","Body, Mind & Spirit",343,N/A,0,en

Within each of us, whether female or male, lies a holographic blueprint of this Womb of Creation, connecting us to the Web of Life. By awakening your spiritual Womb, the holy of holies within the temple of your body, you can reconnect to the transformative energy of Womb Consciousness and reclaim your sacred powers of creation and love. Drawing on mythical and spiritual traditions from almost every culture, Dr. Azra and Seren Bertrand reconstruct the moon-based feminine mystery teachings of a lost global Womb religion, tracing the tradition all the way back to the Neanderthals and beyond. They explore how these teachings were encoded in the symbolism of folk and fairy tales; the legends of the Holy Grail; the traditions of Mary Magdalene and Sophia; the maiden, queen, and crone archetypes; and the teachings of alchemy and the chakras. They show how sages and shamans across the globe all secretly spoke of the Cosmic Womb and the sacred creative powers of Moon Blood. The authors look at the power of the Moon and its connection to sacred Womb Consciousness, offering meditations and practices to help awaken your spiritual Womb and activate its sacred magic of creation and manifestation. They explain how to activate the energetic gateways of the Womb and merge the heart and Womb to make sexual union the highest sacrament of love. Revealing how we must reconnect with the Divine Feminine to rebirth the Divine Masculine and restore balance to our world, they show how, as we reawaken the powerful ancient path of the Womb Mysteries, we help return our world to harmony with the wild, untamed creative flows and cyclical rhythms of the cosmos.","Body, Mind & Spirit",649,5,2,en

Alchemy & Mysticism,Alexander Roob,Taschen America Llc,2006,"A classic, prize-winning novel about an epic migration and a lone woman haunted by the past in frontier Waipu. In the 1850s, a group of settlers established a community at Waipu in the northern part of New Zealand. They were led there by a stern preacher, Norman McLeod. The community had followed him from Scotland in 1817 to found a settlement in Nova Scotia, then subsequently to New Zealand via Australia. Their incredible journeys actually happened, and in this winner of the New Zealand Book Awards, Fiona Kidman breathes life and contemporary relevance into the facts by creating a remarkable fictional story of three women entangled in the migrations - Isabella, her daughter Annie and granddaughter Maria. McLeod's harsh leadership meant that anyone who ran counter to him had to live a life of secrets. The 'secrets' encapsulated the spirit of these women in their varied reactions to McLeod's strict edicts and connect the past to the present and future.",Art,575,5,1,en

The Marriage of Sense and Soul,Ken Wilber,Random House,2011-08-03,"There is arguably no more critical and pressing topic than the relation of science and religion in the modern world. Science has given us the methods for discovering truth, while religion remains the single greatest force for generating meaning. Yet the two are seen as mutually exclusive, with wrenching consequences for humanity. In The Marriage of Sense and Soul, one of today's most important philosophers brilliantly articulates how we might begin to think about science and religion in ways that allow for their reconciliation and union, on terms that will be acceptable to both camps. Ken Wilber is widely acclaimed as the foremost thinker in integrating Western psychology and the Eastern spiritual traditions. His many books have reached across disciplines and synthesized the teachings of religion, psychology, physics, mysticism, sociology, and anthropology, earning him a devoted international following. The Marriage of Sense and Soul is his most accessible work yet, aimed at guiding a general audience to the mutual accord between the spiritual, subjective world of ancient wisdom and the objective, empirical world of modern knowledge. Wilber clearly and succinctly explores the schism between science and religion, and the impact of this ""philosophical Cold War"" on the fate of humanity. He systematically reviews previous attempts at integration, explaining why romantic, idealistic, and postmodern theories failed. And he demonstrates how science is compatible with certain deep features common to all of the world's major religious traditions. In pointing the way to a union between truth and meaning, Ken Wilber has created an elegant and accessible book that is breathtaking in its scope.",Science,261,N/A,0,en

Mary Magdalene Revealed,Meggan Watterson,"Hay House, Inc",2019-07-09,"--WALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLER-- The Gospel of Mary Magdalene reveals a very different love story from the one we've come to refer to as Christianity. Harvard-trained theologian Meggan Watterson leads us verse by verse through Mary's gospel to illuminate the powerful teachings it contains. A gospel, as ancient and authentic as any of the gospels that the Christian bible contains, was buried deep in the Egyptian desert after an edict was sent out in the 4th century to have all copies of it destroyed. Fortunately, some rebel monks were wise enough to refuse-and thanks to their disobedience and spiritual bravery, we have several manuscripts of the only gospel that was written in the name of a woman: The Gospel of Mary Magdalene. Mary's gospel reveals a radical love that sits at the heart of the Christian story. Her gospel says that we are not sinful; we are not to feel ashamed or unworthy for being human. In fact, our purpose is to be fully human, to be a ""true human being""- that is, a person who has remembered that, yes, we are a messy, limited ego, and we are also a limitless soul. And all we need to do is to turn inward (again and again); to meditate, like Mary Magdalene, in the way her gospel directs us, so that we can see past the ego of our own little lives to what's more real, and lasting, and infinite, and already here, within. With searing clarity, Watterson explains how and why Mary Magdalene came to be portrayed as the penitent prostitute and relates a more historically and theologically accurate depiction of who Mary was within the early Christ movement. And she shares how this discovery of Mary's gospel has allowed her to practice, and to experience, a love that never ends, a love that transforms everything.","Body, Mind & Spirit",265,N/A,0,en

Out of Body Experiences,Robert Peterson,Hampton Roads Publishing,2013-05-01,"Broaden your horizons by learning astral projection and experiencing its profoundly positive impact on your thoughts about life, death, and spirituality. Throughout history, people have reported spiritual experiences that we now identify as out-of-body experiences or OBEs. In recent times, modern researchers like Robert Monroe have pioneered the scientific study and practice of OBEs. Increasingly, people are remembering spontaneous OBEs, especially from early childhood. Also, OBEs are a typical feature of near-death experiences and have been described as beautiful, painless, and ecstatic. This is the comprehensive manual for inducing out of body experiences and managing the experience. Peterson not only explores the stages of his own development, but also concludes each chapter with a specific exercise that takes you to the next level. From wiggling out of your body for the first time (the author did a back flip his first time) to traveling through other realms and dealing with your “encounters,” this is one of the most practical, step-by-step guides to OBEs available. He clearly demonstrates how this consciousness-expanding experience is accessible to anyone willing to make the leap into the great beyond.

The House of the Spirits,Isabel Allende,Everyman's Library,2005-04-19,"Chilean writer Isabel Allende’s classic novel is both a richly symbolic family saga and the riveting story of an unnamed Latin American country’s turbulent history. In a triumph of magic realism, Allende constructs a spirit-ridden world and fills it with colorful and all-too-human inhabitants. The Trueba family’s passions, struggles, and secrets span three generations and a century of violent social change, culminating in a crisis that brings the proud and tyrannical patriarch and his beloved granddaughter to opposite sides of the barricades. Against a backdrop of revolution and counterrevolution, Allende brings to life a family whose private bonds of love and hatred are more complex and enduring than the political allegiances that set them at odds.

Irreducible Mind,"Edward F. Kelly, Emily Williams Kelly, Adam Crabtree",Rowman & Littlefield,2010,"Current mainstream opinion in psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy of mind holds that all aspects of human mind and consciousness are generated by physical processes occurring in brains. Views of this sort have dominated recent scholarly publication. The present volume, however, demonstrates empirically that this reductive materialism is not only incomplete but false. The authors systematically marshal evidence for a variety of psychological phenomena that are extremely difficult, and in some cases clearly impossible, to account for in conventional physicalist terms. Topics addressed include phenomena of extreme psychophysical influence, memory, psychological automatisms and secondary personality, near-death experiences and allied phenomena, genius-level creativity, and 'mystical' states of consciousness both spontaneous and drug-induced. The authors further show that these rogue phenomena are more readily accommodated by an alternative 'transmission' or 'filter' theory of mind/brain relations advanced over a century ago by a largely forgotten genius, F. W. H. Myers, and developed further by his friend and colleague William James. This theory, moreover, ratifies the commonsense conception of human beings as causally effective conscious agents, and is fully compatible with leading-edge physics and neuroscience. The book should command the attention of all open-minded persons concerned with the still-unsolved mysteries of the mind.",Philosophy,836,5,1,en

The Guiding Philosophy for the Future of Healthcare,Nancy Gordon,John Hunt Publishing,2012-05-25,"This book is for both practitioners and lay people, alike. That is anyone who currently occupies a body and wants to be healthy and whole. The time has come to create a new philosophy that focuses on a more holistic approach to healthcare—one that is built on the concept that the body-mind-spirit is one thing—fully connected. We must shift our focus from treatment to prevention in a way that puts all of us back in the driver’s seat of our own health and well-being. This shift will only happen when we clearly understand how to use our thoughts, emotions, and beliefs as tools to help create health and wellness. All 60,000 thoughts we have in a day create something…either moving us towards health and wholeness, or not. We must broaden the scope of Western medicine to incorporate this concept into how we provide and participate in healthcare. Until we are willing to step outside the traditional medical box to understand and incorporate this phenomenon of the connection of body-mind-spirit, we are going to continue to struggle in our healthcare. ,","Body, Mind & Spirit",106,N/A,0,en

This guide treats healing as it truly is, an “art” that flows with the patient as needs fluctuate and shift to the ever-changing circumstances despite today’s corporate-dictated healthcare system. A nurse is someone who delivers direct patient care and acts as an advocate and health educator for patients and families. To most, this sounds like more than just tender loving care. To others, it may create fear causing them to struggle and ignore their inherent healing power of self-love. You see, most people don’t realize that a deep love for themselves is essential to the healing process . . . a most radical concept. As a professional nurse for more than 30 years, Mary Joosten Lopata, RN, not only assisted with patient care, she also observed patients and wondered why the same treatment often resulted in vastly different outcomes. Then one day her perspective changed when she was unexpectedly stricken with illness. Mary now became the patient and her life was suddenly under the microscope. Had Mary’s training as a Holistic nurse betrayed her? Or was she now learning to restore wellness from a new source? In The Art of Radical Self-Love, Mary Joosten Lopata shares her healing journey from the wisdom of a nurse and the heart of a vulnerable patient to someone with a life that now overflows with newfound self-love.

"Genesis: Your Journey Home, 2Nd Edition",Terry L. Newbegin,BalboaPress,2011-04-21,"Genesis: Your Journey Home is a groundbreaking book that goes far beyond the usual levels of biblical interpretations, and the ideas taught by religion that are difficult to understand. It bypasses word definition, root studies, historical explanations, and the ideas taught by religion that are difficult to understand but are important. This book examines the first twenty-five chapters, verse by verse, exploring and revealing the deeper metaphysical (beyond the literal) meaning of the text. Most people know that there are multiple levels of truth contained within the Bible, but until now none have brought forth the ultimate Truth hidden within the mundane, semi-historical writings. Rather than creating new doctrines, this book gently peels back ALL levels of dogmatic views to reveal the true core essence of God, humanity, and the nature of reality. Deep within the ancient biblical text is found the true story (record) of creation, the reason for our very existence, and the history of All That IS. This book is for those that are searching for authenticity, purpose, and a sense that truth lies somewhere beyond religious teachings but who are reluctant to discard the inherent value of scripture. This book brings comfort, personal empowerment, a new understanding of God, and fosters a renewed sense of responsibility for life. It is a book whose time has come at last, as it brings humanity to a deeper understanding of God and a realization of their ultimate purpose.",Religion,705,N/A,0,en

We’ve been taught to believe we have a single identity, and to feel fear or shame when we can’t control the inner voices that don’t match the ideal of who we think we should be. Yet Dr. Richard Schwartz’s research now challenges this “mono-mind” theory. “All of us are born with many sub-minds—or parts,” says Dr. Schwartz. “These parts are not imaginary or symbolic. They are individuals who exist as an internal family within us—and the key to health and happiness is to honor, understand, and love every part.” Dr. Schwartz’s Internal Family Systems (IFS) model has been transforming psychology for decades. With No Bad Parts, you’ll learn why IFS has been so effective in areas such as trauma recovery, addiction therapy, and depression treatment—and how this new understanding of consciousness has the potential to radically change our lives. Here you’ll explore: • The IFS revolution—how honoring and communicating with our parts changes our approach to mental wellness • Overturning the cultural, scientific, and spiritual assumptions that reinforce an outdated mono-mind model • The ego, the inner critic, the saboteur—making these often-maligned parts into powerful allies • Burdens—why our parts become distorted and stuck in childhood traumas and cultural beliefs • How IFS demonstrates human goodness by revealing that there are no bad parts • The Self—discover your wise, compassionate essence of goodness that is the source of healing and harmony • Exercises for mapping your parts, accessing the Self, working with a challenging protector, identifying each part’s triggers, and more IFS is a paradigm-changing model because it gives us a powerful approach for healing ourselves, our culture, and our planet. As Dr. Schwartz teaches, “Our parts can sometimes be disruptive or harmful, but once they’re unburdened, they return to their essential goodness. When we learn to love all our parts, we can learn to love all people—and that will contribute to healing the world.”",Psychology,127,N/A,0,en
"Eastern Body, Western Mind",Anodea Judith,Celestial Arts,2011-03-16,"A revised edition of the groundbreaking New Age book that seamlessly merges Western psychology and science with spirituality, creating a compelling interpretation of the Eastern chakra system and its relevance for Westerners today “A useful tool for contemplating our strengths, weaknesses, and appropriate approaches to growth.”—Yoga Journal In Eastern Body, Western Mind, chakra authority Anodea Judith brought a fresh approach to the yoga-based Eastern chakra system, adapting it to the Western framework of Jungian psychology, somatic therapy, childhood developmental theory, and metaphysics and applying the chakra system to important modern social realities and issues such as addiction, codependence, family dynamics, sexuality, and personal empowerment. Arranged schematically, the book uses the inherent structure of the chakra system as a map upon which to chart our Western understanding of individual development. Each chapter focuses on a single chakra, starting with a description of its characteristics and then exploring its particular childhood developmental patterns, traumas and abuses, and how to heal and maintain balance.","Body, Mind & Spirit",506,N/A,0,en

Tasting Grace,Melissa d'Arabian,WaterBrook,2019-09-10,"The winner of The Next Food Network Star season five and New York Times best-selling author of Ten Dollar Dinners shares how God used food to invite her into His love. It wasn't until Melissa d'Arabian evaluated her relationship with food in light of her relationship with God that she began to appreciate food as not only a gift from him but also as a deeper invitation into his love. As she prayed, studied Scripture, and reflected on the stories from her own life, Melissa saw how God had used food to draw her into community, to redeem her moments of greatest tragedy, and ultimately to connect her more to him. In Tasting Grace, Melissa shares sixteen invitations that will transform your perception of food and the role it plays in your own life, from equality to connection to hospitality to stewardship and more. She explains how through her experiences, she learned to trust the ingredients--in recipes and in life--and join God in the act of creation. Whether you are a mom struggling to throw together a healthy meal for your family each night or a single woman longing for fellowship around your table, you will draw encouragement and inspiration from Melissa's reminder that all food, first and foremost, is a gift from God. When you return to him as the source, you will find the freedom to enjoy his beautiful and delicious creation. Advance praise for Tasting Grace “What a beautiful book. Using stories of her own triumphs and pain, Melissa digs past the surface layers of food as we see it on television, in cookbooks, and on social media. Rather, she helps us think about it in a whole new way—as nothing short of a spiritual force, a vessel through which we can experience (and extend) compassion, comfort, fellowship, love, enjoyment, and grace. It has given me a brand-new lens with which to examine the deeper significance of the food I cook, eat, and share.”—Ree Drummond, author of The Pioneer Woman Cooks “The intersection between faith and food is endlessly interesting to me, and Melissa articulates the significance and beauty of that intersection so well. Melissa is a great storyteller, and she invites us into her story and gives us a seat at her table with graciousness and wisdom. This is a lovely, meaningful book.”—Shauna Niequist, New York Times best-selling author of Present Over Perfect and Bread and Wine “This is a beautifully written book. These aren’t just words on pages; they are an invitation to a feast, to hospitality, and to finding lasting purpose in your life. Melissa has set a table fit for a King, pulled our chairs, and reminded us there’s a place for us here. This is a book that will not only feed your imagination but also your soul.” —Bob Goff, author of New York Times bestsellers Love Does and Everybody Always",Religion,226,N/A,0,en

Footprints To Heaven,Kathryn Draper,"Christian Faith Publishing, Inc.",2019-04-26,"Would one agree that their past may have influenced their primary decisions in life? Does one wonder what life would have been like under different choices or circumstances? For the record, the author answers yes to both questions. Regardless, a person can only imagine the alternative because the future is known to God alone. In Footprints to Heaven, Kathryn takes the reader on an interesting, detailed, and eventful journey into her childhood and adult life. In addition, she mentions certain unfortunate events that had impacted her life for years. Therefore, specific details may be alarming to the reader. In spite of it all, Kathryn had developed courage, strength, and determination to overcome the adversity that tried to divert a meaningful and productive existence. The book will also divulge the author's choice to live a lesbian lifestyle, provide explanations, and hopefully answer any concerning questions for the reader. Kathryn's condensed history will invite the reader to consider a profound decision, accepting Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior of their life. The author's personal relationship with Jesus Christ is the main basis for the book. Kathryn outlines her lifesaving decision to follow Jesus Christ, the transformation and deliverance process, the free choice to live in her car for several years, and the humbleness and joy from the whole experience. Most importantly, Kathryn learned to be less independent. Instead, she has learned to depend and trust God in all things.",Religion,154,N/A,0,en

It combines facts about melasma backed up by science with a holistic treatment approach. Find out how a damaged environment and a stressed society contribute to this skin condition. Become empowered to heal yourself. Regain balance within your body, create harmony in your environment and fall in love with yourself while healing your skin. After working as an aesthetician for many years, Janett Juwien noticed that clients with melasma have risen to an alarming number. To her own and her clients’ frustration, she had to tolerate the fact that professional treatments and cosmetics do not give the desired results. The information she has gathered from her clients’ personal melasma stories revealed to her that this is more than just sun-induced or pregnancy-related hyperpigmentation. She decided to start the search on a medical database for answers and felt a responsibility to pass on the findings. Melasma is a hyperpigmentary skin condition that is still not 100% understood. Worldwide, thousands of people suffer from it and the numbers seem to rise. Different melasma support groups on social media hold up to 75k members. In these groups, women share skincare tips but also discuss their grief and even voice suicidal thoughts caused by the daily distress they feel by the appearance of their skin. The Truth About Melasma is a well-researched educational resource that is backed up by clinical research with over 250 references. The author Janett Juwien dedicated uncountable hours to examining the clinical studies about melasma and packed the findings into bite-sized and easy-to-understand segments presented in just under 200 pages. This book offers cutting-edge information and a renegade view of the root causes, which Janett identifies as imbalances in the body's internal systems.

From Science to God,Peter Russell,New World Library,2010-02-08,"From Science to God offers a crash course in the nature of reality. It is the story of Peter Russell's lifelong exploration into the nature of consciousness — how he went from being a strict atheist, studying mathematics and physics at Cambridge University, to realizing a profound personal synthesis of the mystical and scientific. Using his own tale of curiosity and exploration as the book’s backbone, Russell blends physics, psychology, and philosophy to reach a new worldview in which consciousness is a fundamental quality of creation. He shows how all the ingredients for this worldview are in place; nothing new needs to be discovered. We have only to put the pieces together and explore the new picture of reality that emerges. From Science to God is as much a personal story of an open-minded skeptic as it is a tour de force of scientific and religious paradigm shifts. Russell takes us from Galileo’s den to the lecture halls of Cambridge where he studied with Stephen Hawking. “If you had asked me then if there was a God,” says the best-selling author of his scientific beginnings, “I would have pointed to mathematics.” But no matter what empirical truths science offered Russell, one thorny question remained: How can something as immaterial as consciousness, ever arise from something as unconscious as matter?",Religion,146,4,1,en
Art that Tells the Truth,"Reinekke Lengelle, Deirdre Hughes, Liane Hambly",Taylor & Francis,2024-06-28,"Creative Methods are a shortcut to what we didn’t know we knew. In working from a student’s or client’s own imagination and psychological material, a person discovers who they are and what they need to expand and move forward. This enriching and inspiring book on creative methods demonstrates the power and effectiveness of the creative approach in guidance and counselling settings. The twenty chapters in this volume focus on the importance and joys of play, creative expression, and imagination in effective learning: as we develop, observe, and interact with our own creations we can arrive at fresh insights by tapping into the wisdom of the unconscious mind. Creative methods often provide a new perspective on difficult emotions and allow us to perceive what they’re trying to tell us.

Dancers Amongst the Stars,Janny Juddly The Therapist n my Pocket,Balboa Press,2015-01-09,"This is a very particular kind of self-help book. It is a book of remembering. Our journey is a spiritual one even if we do not always realise it. We humans spend a lot of time trying to work out who we are, looking for meaning, searching for the big picture. Through a series of beautifully evocative and moving stories, uplifting poems, and insightful observational pieces, you are invited to rediscover the truth of who you really are. As a lecturer in Dynamic Therapy, the authors particular area of research and expertise has been the mind-body-soul connection, as underpinned by the latest research in neuroscience and quantum physics. As a therapist, mindfulness coach, and energy worker in private practice, her work has involved integrating this knowledge with leading edge thinking on spirituality, the workings of the human psyche, the impact of our developmental history, and the power of intention and the unconscious mind upon our experienced reality. Her goal is to incorporate this into her own understanding of the spiritual journey as an awakening woman. The stories, poems, and real life vignettes in this book are an invitation to you, as a fellow traveler and spiritual seeker, to see through compassionate eyes where you have come from, the amazing path you are embarked upon, and to view your experience of living this life, which is unique to you alone, from the perspective of who you really are: a magnificent spiritual being of light and love and power living a purposeful human experience.","Body, Mind & Spirit",227,N/A,0,en

"Shadow, Self, Spirit - Revised Edition",Michael Daniels,Andrews UK Limited,2021-09-28,"New and enlarged edition. Transpersonal Psychology concerns the study of those states and processes in which people experience a deeper sense of who they are, or a greater sense of connectedness with others, with nature, or the spiritual dimension. Pioneered by respected researchers such as Jung, Maslow and Tart, it has nonetheless struggled to find recognition among mainstream scientists. Now that is starting to change. Dr. Michael Daniels teaches the subject as part of a broadly-based psychology curriculum, and this new and enlarged edition of his book brings together the fruits of his studies over recent years.

Little Drops of Water,"Lola-Peach Martins, PhD",Balboa Press,2013-08,"Wisdom fuel is a positive stimulant for the mind, body, and soul.

Spiritual Well-Being of Chinese Older Adults,Vivian W. Q. Lou,Springer,2015-02-04,"There are several unique features of this book on the spiritual well-being of Chinese older adults. First, based on qualitative methodology, a conceptual model of spiritual well-being was proposed. Besides, through a Delphi study, different dimensions of spiritual well-being were identified. Conceptually, such effort is important because there is a general lack of well-articulated models of spiritual well-being for Chinese people. Although Western models can be “transplanted” to Chinese contexts, indigenous concepts are needed. As such, this is a pioneer conceptual contribution. Second, the author developed and validated the Spiritual Scale for Chinese Elders. In view of the lack of related measurement tools in the field, this is a pioneer attempt which is important for social work education, research and practice. Third, a Spiritual Enhancement Group for Chinese Elders was developed and its effectiveness was evaluated. In contrast to ordinary elderly programs, this program was based on solid theoretical grounds. In addition, process evaluation and outcome evaluation were conducted. The intervention program is a beautiful link between theory and practice whereas the evaluation is a good outgrowth of practice. The present project is especially valuable because evidence-based practice is at its infancy in different Chinese communities.",Social Science,104,N/A,0,en

Christina Anstead, star of HGTV’s Flip or Flop and Christina on the Coast, is known for her boundless energy, positive attitude, and radiant looks. But what was hidden from fans of her popular television shows was a very real health crisis, including a diagnosis of autoimmune disease, infertility, and the emotional and physical exhaustion of going through a divorce with two young children—all in the public eye.

Nature is Nurture,Megan E. Delaney,N/A,2020,"""From foraging and hunting for food to (more recently) finding solace and peace in a beautiful vista, humans have long interacted with the natural world. Though a connection to nature runs deep in our DNA, however, people of the modern age are indoors almost 93% of the day. With that said, there is a growing evidence suggests that the natural world promotes mental and physical well-being, including stress relief, improved mood, and neurological benefits. Ecotherapy, a steadily developing but lesser-known construct in mental health, explores the reciprocal relationship humans have with nature and its capacity to build strength and provide healing. Nature Is Nurture provides an overview of the theoretical concepts and empirical bases of ecotherapy via historical considerations and recent research within the discipline. Chapters share practical ways to incorporate ecotherapy with children, adults, and veteran populations; within schools; and in group work. Descriptions of modalities such as animal-assisted, equine-assisted, horticultural, forest-bathing, green-exercise, and adventure-based therapy are also included alongside case examples, techniques, and practical and ethical considerations. In examining the impact of improved physical and mental wellness for all clients, this book provides counselors, therapists, social workers, and psychologists with the knowledge and techniques to infuse ecotherapy into everyday practice.""",Psychology,281,N/A,0,en

The Application of the Third Generation of Cognitive-Behavioral Approaches to Parenting,"Helena Moreira, Eva S. Potharst, Maria Cristina Canavarro",Frontiers Media SA,2019-12-10,"In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding how the third generation of cognitive-behavioral approaches, particularly mindfulness-, compassion-, and acceptance-based approaches, can contribute to the design of more efficacious parenting interventions and to a better understanding of parenting behaviors and the parent-child relationship. However, the application of third-generation cognitive-behavioral therapies and concepts to parenting is still in its infancy, and further research is needed to explore the potential of these approaches to enhance existing parenting interventions or to inform the development of new parenting interventions targeting different groups of parents and their children. More research is also needed to understand how mindfulness, (self-)compassion, acceptance and other related psychological processes may influence parenting practices, the parent-child relationship, and the child’s socioemotional development. With this e-book, presenting state-of-the-art research articles on third generation cognitive-behavioral approaches, a new step is taken in 1) exploring relations between parenting-related issues and concepts from the third generation cognitive-behavioral framework, and 2) examining parenting-interventions informed by third-generation cognitive-behavioral therapies.",,207,N/A,0,en

Nursing Our Healer's Heart,Lorre Laws,John Hunt Publishing,2024-12-10,"The nursing profession is in crisis. Within a decade, the world will have just over half the number of nurses it needs. The global nursing workforce has experienced mass, complex trauma secondary to healthcare system inadequacies and a global pandemic. Traumatized and burned out nurses are leaving their roles or the profession in unprecedented numbers. Those who remain are stretched to or beyond their capacity. While system-level strategies aim to address this crisis, none of them consider nurse traumatization and its impact upon patient safety, outcomes, and quality of care. We cannot wait for health systems to prioritize nurse safety. Nurses can and must come together as a global community to heal through avoidable and unavoidable nurse-specific traumatization while partnering with healthcare leaders to usher in a new era of nursing. This book, through an actionable framework, guides nurses in healing the traumas and hardships they've endured as individuals and nursing communities. Grounded in the sciences of unitary caring, integrative nursing, neurophysiology, and transpersonal neurobiology, this book supports nurses in restoring their healers' heart as they come together to address the deep trauma, burnout, attrition, and presenteeism that are central to the nursing crisis. Nurses will learn the language of their nervous system and how to navigate it as a foundational practice to support professional wellbeing. Each nurse will discover their unique innate care plan, which will guide their healing and co-healing with other nurses. By embracing the healing and practices offered in this book, nurses will learn how to support their nervous system regulation so they can thrive instead of survive in practice. Working from their healed scars instead of their open wounds, nurses can effectively lead sustainable organizational change and health care reforms that prioritize nurse safety and professional wellbeing.",Medical,263,N/A,0,en

Words of Radiance,Brandon Sanderson,Tor Books,2014-03-04,"From #1 New York Times bestselling author Brandon Sanderson, Words of Radiance, Book Two of the Stormlight Archive, continues the immersive fantasy epic that The Way of Kings began. Expected by his enemies to die the miserable death of a military slave, Kaladin survived to be given command of the royal bodyguards, a controversial first for a low-status ""darkeyes."" Now he must protect the king and Dalinar from every common peril as well as the distinctly uncommon threat of the Assassin, all while secretly struggling to master remarkable new powers that are somehow linked to his honorspren, Syl. The Assassin, Szeth, is active again, murdering rulers all over the world of Roshar, using his baffling powers to thwart every bodyguard and elude all pursuers. Among his prime targets is Highprince Dalinar, widely considered the power behind the Alethi throne. His leading role in the war would seem reason enough, but the Assassin's master has much deeper motives. Brilliant but troubled Shallan strives along a parallel path. Despite being broken in ways she refuses to acknowledge, she bears a terrible burden: to somehow prevent the return of the legendary Voidbringers and the civilization-ending Desolation that will follow. The secrets she needs can be found at the Shattered Plains, but just arriving there proves more difficult than she could have imagined. Meanwhile, at the heart of the Shattered Plains, the Parshendi are making an epochal decision. Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks, their numbers ever shrinking, they are convinced by their war leader, Eshonai, to risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled. The possible consequences for Parshendi and humans alike, indeed, for Roshar itself, are as dangerous as they are incalculable.

Precognitive Dreamwork and the Long Self,Eric Wargo,Simon and Schuster,2021-03-02,"• Outlines a set of clear principles to help guide dreamworkers, illustrated through real precognitive dream experiences • Shows how to detect precognitive dreams through their characteristic features, explaining how dreams relate to memory and why dreams about future experiences are often symbolic or distorted • Explores the mind-blowing implications of precognition for our lives, including how our present thoughts actually shape--or shaped--our past Once only the stuff of science fiction, evidence has grown that precognition--glimpses of your future in dreams and visions and being influenced subtly in waking life by what is to come--is real. Your future thoughts and feelings shape who you are now. And your present thoughts and feelings shape--or shaped--your past. In this accessible exploration of precognition, precognitive dreamwork, and a radically new biographical sensibility, the Long Self, that precognition awakens us to, Eric Wargo shows how dreamworkers can play the role of citizen scientists, adding to our understanding of this fascinating, almost unexplored dimension of human life. Wargo outlines a set of clear principles to guide dreamworkers, each illustrated through real dreamers’ experiences. Drawing on psychoanalysis and contemporary sleep science, he explores how precognition relates to memory, explaining why dreams of future experiences are often distorted and what those distortions probably mean. He discusses never-before-described dream features, including “time gimmicks” (symbols hinting at time distortion) and “calendrical resonance” (the tendency of dreams to foretell experiences exactly a year or years later). He describes why an understanding of precognition augments Jung’s theory of synchronicity by highlighting our own role in producing meaningful coincidences in our waking lives. He also shows how precognition manifests in other states of consciousness like lucid dreams, out-of-body experiences, trance states, sleep paralysis, meditation, and hypnagogia. We are at a major turning point in science’s understanding of time, causality, and the self. We are more than who we think we are from moment to moment--we are our past, present, and future simultaneously. When we understand this, a dream journal becomes a personal time machine, with mind-blowing discoveries in store for the traveler.","Body, Mind & Spirit",320,N/A,0,en
Carry This Message,Joe McQ,august house,2002,"As an internationally respected teacher and lecturer on the Twelve Step method introduced by Alcoholics Anonymous, Joe McQ knows that sponsorship is a key construct for the success of the program because it involves moving a person through the Twelve Step process to recovery. In the early days of AA, sponsors would come to the alcoholic's home and talk him through Steps 1 and 2, and when they were thoroughly convinced he was ready, they would start him on the program. Step 12 is the foundation of sponsorships: ""Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, to practice these principles in all our affairs."" Carry This Message addresses McQ's concern that sponsors have lost some skills in working with alcoholics. AA sponsors need to refocus on the Big Book, on the Twelve Steps, and on their message, urges McQ, to recognize the value of the program and to return to its roots and essence.

The Handbook of Yoruba Religious Concepts,Baba Ifa Karade,Weiser Books,2020-04-01,"An introduction to the spiritual source of the beliefs and practices that have so profoundly shaped African American religious traditions. Most of the Africans who were enslaved and brought to the Americas were from the Yoruba nation of West Africa, an ancient and vast civilization. In the diaspora caused by the slave trade, the guiding concepts of the Yoruba spiritual tradition took root in Haiti, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Brazil, and the United States. In this accessible introduction, Baba Ifa Karade provides an overview of the Yoruba tradition and its influence in the West. He describes the sixteen Orisha, or spirit gods, and shows us how to work with divination, use the energy centers of the body to internalize the teachings of Yoruba, and create a sacred place of worship. The book also includes prayers, dances, songs, offerings, and sacrifices to honor the Orisha.","Body, Mind & Spirit",162,N/A,0,en

Stand,Marian Jordan Ellis,David C Cook,2017-08-01,"Your Darkest Moment Isn’t Your Destiny In a frightening world, it’s tempting to question the promises of God. Yet one word rings out in Scripture as a call to God’s people: stand. From Moses at the Red Sea to Jesus with His disciples, stand is the call to believe God and hold fast to His promises. In Stand, Marian Jordan Ellis explores what it looks like to be faithful in a crumbling world. She addresses questions like these: How do Christian leaders share God’s good news in a culture that wants to silence their voices? How do parents hold on to hope when their children are more in love with the world than with Jesus? How do Christians battle the voices of shame and insecurity? Stand looks at the stories of real people—from Scripture and from today—who chose to stand firm and “win life.” Jesus promises that the evil of this present world is not our future reality. Stand offers inspiration and practical tools to stand in your faith, your convictions, and your trust in a God who never fails.",Religion,219,N/A,0,en

A Human Design chart offers an astonishingly accurate guide to your personality, as well as direction and counsel on how each individual can deal with challenges in their life.

Every day she watches her novels fly off the shelves—along with dozens of unauthorized sequels, spin-offs, and adaptations. Jane may be undead, but her books have taken on a life of their own. To make matters worse, the manuscript she finished just before being turned into a vampire has been rejected by publishers—116 times. Jane longs to let the world know who she is, but when a sudden twist of fate thrusts her back into the spotlight, she must hide her real identity—and fend off a dark man from her past while juggling two modern suitors.

Weight Loss Surgery Does Not Treat Food Addiction,"Connie Stapleton, Ph.d.",Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2017-06-20,"Food addiction is an extremely difficult disease that is misunderstood by the general public and by many medical and mental health professionals. Weight regain following extreme weight loss through medically supervised diet programs, fad diets, or weight loss (bariatric) surgery is all too often followed by weight regain. Regain is largely attributed to failing to following through with ""behavior modifications,"" which are the focus in most weight loss programs. Behavior modifications include ""eating less and moving more."" Those whose weight has gone up and down over time attribute their regain to ""going back to old habits."" Understanding food addiction educates us about why it is so difficult for vast numbers of people to follow through with the behavior modification tools that actually do help the patients lose weight to begin with, and if practiced over time help in keeping the weight off. Food addiction takes our brains ""hostage"" and makes it seem impossible for intelligent, well-meaning people who sincerely want to lose weight to avoid foods they realize will result in added pounds. Food addiction ""hijacks"" our rational minds and leads us to making decisions that will defy our weight loss efforts and goals. Those who choose to have weight loss surgery often view it as ""a last resort"" for losing weight. They hope the surgery will result in dramatic weight loss, and will also help in sustaining that weight loss. It is a tragedy when patients who have elected to undergo a surgical weight loss procedure regain dreaded pounds in spite of having had good intentions to follow through with the behaviors necessary to keep the weight off. A hallmark of addiction is knowing there are physical and/or emotional problems caused, or made worse by a substance, and continuing to use the substance anyway. If food consumption is leading to excess weight and physical comorbidities, such as high blood pressure, sleep apnea, high cholesterol and/or diabetes, and the patient is informed they need to lose weight in order to improve these medical conditions, but they are unable to change their eating habits, food addiction may be a reason. If people are depressed because of their weight and the limitations it places on their lives and the friction it causes in their relationships, and they want to lose weight but cannot seem to stop eating unhealthy foods, again, food addiction may be a reason. If a person has both the disease of obesity and the disease of addiction (in this case, food addiction), treating only the disease of obesity will most likely not result in long-term weight loss. Food addiction is a powerful disease that needs treatment concurrently when treating obesity. Attempts to continue to ""eat less"" will fail if a person is a food addict and does not treat their addiction. The result will ultimately be weight regain, frustration and discouragement. Weight Loss Surgery Does NOT Treat Food Addiction is for people who have had bariatric surgery, are considering bariatric surgery, or for anyone who struggles with weight loss and keeping weight off. In this book, I explain what food addiction is and why it must be addressed in addition to working on weight loss and weight maintenance. I also share tips and steps to take in order to address food addiction, as well as what it means to be in recovery from food addiction. Get ready to learn. Get ready to grow as a person by learning more about yourself in this educational, engaging and down-to-earth book. Join me online and on Facebook as well for more helpful information and tools. And finally, please share this book with anyone you know who may be struggling with food addiction, whether or not they are a bariatric surgery patient. Food addiction can be treated!

The Consciousness Revolution,"Stanislav Grof, Peter Russell","Element Books, Limited",1999,"AS WE ENTER THE 21ST CENTURY faced with current global and human crises, society is being questioned as never before. In The Consciousness Revolution three pioneers at the cutting-edge of Western thought reflect on the chances of peace in the world, on how society is changing, and on the changes we can make in ourselves. They consider the roles of art, science, education, goals and values, world views, religion, spirituality and, above all, consciousness -- for the state of our consciousness is the key issue underlying almost everything else. As Ken Wilber asks in his Foreword, what does it all finally come down to? Peter Russell put it like this: 'Each little bit counts ... we are all part of the same ground-swell. The most important question we need to ask is how can I put my own life in greater alignment with that ground-swell? How can I do my little one-hundred-thousandth worth to facilitate that shift a bit further?

Psychological Trauma,Bessel A. Van der Kolk,American Psychiatric Pub,2003-05-01,"How many of your psychiatric patients have a history of severe physical or psychological abuse or other psychological trauma? These patients often present diagnostic dilemmas, get a variety of diagnoses, and frequently prove difficult-to-treat. They may have syndromes that are reminiscent of the post-traumatic sequelae in adults, such as physiological hyperactivity, a sense of loss of control, passivity alternating with uncontrolled violence, and sleep disturbances including nightmares. Investigating the impact of the traumatic event in connection with the development of the disorder is essential to an effective treatment approach. Psychological Trauma provides a basis for understanding human response to trauma. The consequences of specific traumas have usually been described as separate entities. This is the first book to examine human response to trauma as a whole. In this thorough study of the biologic, psychodynamic and social consequences of trauma, separate chapters explore: * The impact of separation from the parental figure on a child's development, including cognitive and neurological disturbances* The psychobiology of traumatic response* Traumatic antecedents of borderline personality disorder* The effect of trauma on the family unit* Amnesia and dissociation as response to trauma* A stress management approach that can be incorporated into the treatment of patients",Medical,260,N/A,0,en

Think,John Piper,Inter-Varsity Press,2013-04-23,"This is a book to help Christians to think about thinking. Focusing on the life of the mind helps us to know God better, love him more, and care for the world. Along with an emphasis on emotions and the experience of God, we also need to practise careful thinking about God. Piper contends that 'thinking is indispensable on the path to passion for God'. So how are we to maintain a healthy balance of mind and heart, thinking and feeling? Piper urges us to think for the glory of God. He demonstrates from Scripture that glorifying God with our minds and hearts is not either-or, but both-and. Thinking carefully about God fuels passion and affections for God. Likewise, Christ-exalting emotion leads to disciplined thinking. Readers will be reminded that 'the mind serves to know the truth that fuels the fires of the heart'.",Religion,170,N/A,0,en

The Holistic Home is based on an original lifestyle concept focused on creating a dynamic, healthy, and thoughtful space within yourself and your home by combining three planes of action—mind, body, and spirit—that result in profound change. The condition of the mind affects the psychology of how you dwell: subconscious influences, decorating with intention, and allowing your emotional issues and challenges to manifest in your space. The physical aspects of your design space, such as furniture positioning, design elements, sustainability, wellness, and organization, are representative of your relationship with your body. And finally, the spirit refers to all the invisible energies within you and your home—feng shui, atmosphere, and the soul of your home. Years ago, author and holistic feng shui expert Laura Benko was diagnosed with a rare cancer. Around that time, a book serendipitously fell on her head. She took this as a much-needed sign to devote the next decade of her life to research and hundreds of transformative holistic design consultations. Her clients’ real-life, inspiring stories, along with specific actions and tips, have become the foundation for The Holistic Home.

Perfecting Ourselves,Aaron Hoopes,N/A,2002,"Can we achieve perfection? While true perfection is fleeting, we often achieve a moment of perfection: a state of mind that is just right, a time when we are fully attuned to the needs of our body, mind and spirit. It is the potential for achieving this type of integration that Perfecting Ourselves: Coordinating Body, Mind and Spirit seeks to tap into. Author Aaron Hoopes explores the basic threads of the self-body, mind and spirit-and demonstrates simple methods of integrating the three through breathing exercises, meditation, focused quietism and conscious living. He considers the body and how we can become more fully aware of it by examining detrimental behaviors, exploring the effect they have and suggesting ways to counter them. In particular, he shows how deep breathing exercises and conscious awareness of the breath constitute a major pathway to physical health and well-being. He then looks the mind and how we can gain more control over our thoughts and feelings. In particular, he focuses on ""Quietism"" an approach that includes exercises for calming the mind and gaining clarity of thought. Finally, he discusses the spirit, which manifests itself when we have integrated a healthy, connected body with a calm, clear mind. When integration occurs, every moment of life becomes ""perfect."" We can live in balance with our self and the world around us. Through breathing and quietism, the quality of life improves. We get sick less often and recover faster. Things that bothered us before become insignificant. Feelings of well-being invade us, and we feel ready to tackle any task or obstacle in our path. Follow along as Aaron leads you through simple exercises that will help you: * Develop healthy habits one step at a time * Holistically heal and strengthen your body * Reduce tension and stress through mindful breathing * Increase your connection between mind and body * Get in touch with your ""Universal Mind"" * Discover the joys of quietism * Achieve internal balance",Health & Fitness,224,N/A,0,en
Deva,Jacquelyn E. Lane,Simon and Schuster,2020-06-16,"An in-depth introduction to the Deva Kingdom and our relationship with Deva • Explores how we partner with Deva in our everyday lives to evolve both our kingdom and theirs • Explains the hierarchy of the Deva kingdom, from elementals and nature spirits to higher angelic Deva and every level in between • Offers suggestions on how to communicate with the Deva of trees and plants as well as the angelic kingdom • Shares the author’s personal experiences with Deva around the world Nature spirits, faeries, gnomes, and their higher angelic counterparts who overlight landscapes, mountains, rivers, and plants have held a fascination for people worldwide for countless generations. The Deva kingdom is essentially the world’s form builders, the symphony at the heart of Creation, yet Deva is so much more than the joyful beings that animate what we call Nature. We each have a very personal and direct relationship with Deva via our physical, astral, emotional, and mental elementals, but this connection has been forgotten or, at the very least, overlooked. When we partner with Deva in our everyday lives, we can help evolve both our kingdom and aspects of theirs. Exploring the realm of Deva and our relationship with them, Jacquelyn E. Lane introduces us to the hierarchy of the Deva kingdom, from elementals and nature spirits to higher Deva and the levels in between. She examines the metaphysics that underlie their existence and how the energy of Deva is intrinsic to all that we experience. Deva is a Sanskrit word meaning “Being of Light,” an appropriate name as Deva sing light out of the primordial darkness to create forms for Being. Sharing her personal experiences with Deva in many lands over four decades, the author investigates our relationship with Deva, in particular via the elementals of our human constitution, and how we can communicate with the Deva of trees and plants as well as the angelic kingdom. Through scientific discoveries and cultural traditions, we discover the impact we have on Deva and how we use and even “create” new forms of Deva via our inventions and collective activity. Jacquelyn also looks at the orchestrating function of higher Deva and the wider implications of our understanding of Deva, including the role of Deva in Pan consciousness--our increasing realization of the intricate matrix of life within and between all the kingdoms on Earth. Offering not only an in-depth introduction to the world of Deva but also a glimpse of their wisdom, humor, and joy, this book reveals how we can begin to hear their complex song, find our own song, and work with the appropriate subtle layers of the Deva kingdom to grow and evolve.","Body, Mind & Spirit",405,N/A,0,en

Broad's LECTURES ON PSYCHICAL RESEARCH, written nearly twenty years earlier. The author clearly defines the categories of psychic phenomena, surveys the most compelling experimental data, and traces their implications for the philosophy of science and the philosophy of mind. He considers carefully the abstract presuppositions underlying leading theories of psychic phenomena, and he offers bold criticisms of both mechanistic analyses of communication and psychophysical identity theories. In addition, he challenges the received view that experimental repeatability is the paramount criterion for evaluating parapsychological research, and he exposes the deep confusions underlying Jung's concept of synchronicity.","Body, Mind & Spirit",234,5,1,en

Reciprocity and Its Practice in Social Research,"Chowdhury, Jahid Siraz, Wahab, Haris Abd, Saad, Rashid Mohd, Reza, Hasan, Ahmad, Mokbul Morshed",IGI Global,2022-05-27,"Reciprocity has been critical in the philosophy and social sciences of the 20th century. Over the last seven decades, several countries settled by European powers have become autonomous, and returning has become a challenge. Consequently, writing on reciprocity as a central theme requires time and implies a deep dedication to the community. There is a need to explore the factors and policies behind the study agendas and secret philosophies before and after European involvement. Reciprocity and Its Practice in Social Research aims to open the controlled consciousness of self as a human being and then as a scholar to the community via the methodological lens. It analyzes reciprocity from the Greek tradition to Medeabale Arab to the early colonial or pre-colonial period. It specifically addresses the benefit of social research on the community and seeks ways to revolutionize and improve current research and academic processes.

Spiritual Intelligence and the Neuroplastic Brain,"Charles W. Mark Ph. D., Charles W. Mark",AuthorHouse,2010,"Our brains are getting wired differently in the world of digital technology, information revolution, and in the inter-cultural world of global society. Think of the new vocabulary: Global brain, collective intelligence, global village, and cyberspace. That should tell us something about the neural rewiring that is taking place inside of our brains, whether or not we are aware of it. The fact that the human brain changes throughout a person's life in response to intellectual stimulation, physical exercise, exposure to new cultural environments, learning opportunities, and challenges is a revolutionary discovery. Till twenty years ago neuroscientists believed in the conventional theory that the brain's ability at making new neural connections stopped before a child entered adolescence. That is the old dogma. There is a ""Second Copernican Revolution"" taking place inside of our brains, writes the author, quoting Carl Zimmer. Some experts are suggesting that we are already living in what Richard Restack calls the ""neurosociety."" Ray Kurzweil, the futurist, is predicting that by 2045 A.D., human beings will be living in an era of ""singularity,"" when non biological machines invented by human brains and human ingenuity are going to outsmart human intelligence billions of times. What is going to be the fate of the human spirit, human spirituality, the feeling of connection to a force and power that is greater than us (God), our ability to use spiritual imagination and our intelligence? Are we progressively moving away from religion and community-based spirituality into the ""spirituality of different strokes for different folks?""

Our energy levels, inflammation levels, capacity to focus, and even our immunity all fluctuate naturally based on this internal seven-day cycle, scientifically known as the circaseptan rhythm. Now, Dr. Olivia Audrey reveals how we can tap into the power of this seven-day cycle to transform our health and overhaul our mind and mood. The key to understanding your own circaseptan rhythm is, remarkably, from the day of the week on which you were born. The birth experience is like a hormonal storm that inflames the body, one that is repeated week after week with an ebb and flow of inflammation and repair that lasts seven days. This cycle has a measurable impact on mood, energy, and all the facets of physical health. Dr. Audrey’s protocol provides instructions for aligning your health goals with your body’s natural circaseptan rhythm, unlocking extraordinary benefits. With her accessible writing and actionable advice, Dr. Audrey reveals the secret to harnessing your body’s natural rhythm in order to heal whatever ails you and boost how you look, feel, and live. This plan can be effective for losing weight, gaining focus, fighting specific diseases, or simply feeling more in tune with your life. A Week to Change Your Life is the ultimate program to “show us a different way of looking at the problems, reminding us to keep practicing and to feel joy,” (Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York) so you can create a life of radiant health and energy.",Health & Fitness,240,N/A,0,en

"God, Suffering, and Pentecostals",Marius Nel,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2022-02-04,"Pentecostals emphasize that God is still the Healer of all illnesses, implying that God answers all prayers. What about those who are not healed? How do we explain suffering? Why does a good God allow suffering? Is God not powerful enough to prevent it? In this publication, the author reconsiders these questions from a Pentecostal hermeneutical perspective to develop a novel way to think about God's involvement with suffering among people. His experimental theology speculates how a Pentecostal ethos accommodates a theodicy that acknowledges suffering and God's involvement in people's lives. Although the book is a theologically constituted attempt, anyone can follow and understand its arguments. It concludes with alternative views of suffering, evil, God's loving attention to people, the doctrine of original sin, and Satan. The author also suggests some ways to respond to suffering.",Religion,254,N/A,0,en

Somatic Movement Dance Therapy,Amanda Williamson,Intellect Books,2023-04-20,"This book focuses on Somatic Movement Dance Therapy and the importance of self-regulation and co-regulation. The chapters attend to self-regulating different tissues through movement, breath, sound and the imagination. Throughout the book the author shares processes and practices that support participants to balance their living tissues, moving from sympathetic arousal into parasympathetic ease and release. The study of the autonomic nervous system and how to innervate the parasympathetic through breath awareness, heart-sensing and intero-ception is the central through-line in the book. Uniquely, Williamson attends to the anatomical and physiological complexity underlying the apparent simplicity of somatic movement dance practice. How to sense-perceive and move with attuned awareness of specific body tissues, such the skeletal-muscular and craniosacral system invites the reader into a deep anatomical and physiological excavation of self-regulation. The interconnectivity of fascia, and the importance of cardio-ception, breath awareness and gravity lie at the heart of this book. Sensory-perceptual awareness of the heart is foregrounded as the most important ingredient in the efficacy of practice, as well as gravi-ception, soft-tissue-rolling and fascial unwinding.

Health Care Economics,"John B. Davis, Robert McMaster",Taylor & Francis,2017-06-01,"The analytical approach of standard health economics has so far failed to sufficiently account for the nature of care. This has important ramifications for the analysis and valuation of care, and therefore for the pattern of health and medical care provision. This book sets out an alternative approach, which places care at the center of an economics of health, showing how essential it is that care is appropriately recognized in policy as a means of enhancing the dignity of the individual. Whereas traditional health economics has tended to eschew value issues, this book embraces them, introducing care as a normative element at the center of theoretical analysis. Drawing upon care theory from feminist works, philosophy, nursing and medicine, and political economy, the authors develop a health care economics with a moral basis in health care systems. In providing deeper insights into the nature of care and caring, this book seeks to redress the shortcomings of the standard approach and contribute to the development of a more person-based approach to health and medical care in economics. Health Care Economics will be of interest to researchers and postgraduate students in health economics, heterodox economists, and those interested in health and medical care.",Business & Economics,235,N/A,0,en

Durant (1861-1947), the flamboyant businessman who made deals at warp speed to build General Motors and the automotive industry. Now in paperback, The Deal Maker brings Durant, a self-starter obsessed with making it and being seen as making it, to thrilling life. Thriving on the art of the deal, Durant was buying companies at the rate of one every thirty days at the height of his career. By 1910, he had brought together twenty-five automobile firms into what would become the General Motors empire. Then, gambling on a run on GM stock, Durant was forced into a buyout, which unseated him from GM, leaving him without the financial wherewithal to ever succeed again. Featuring some of the most important figures in the history of the automotive industry and American business, including Henry Ford, David Buick, Albert Champion, Louis Chevrolet, Alfred P. Sloan, and Pierre Du Pont, The Deal Maker is a fast-paced, rousing tale of Durant's dizzying success and abject failure.","Body, Mind & Spirit",249,N/A,0,en

The Awakened Brain,Lisa Miller,Random House,2021-08-17,"A groundbreaking exploration of the neuroscience of spirituality and a bold new paradigm for health, healing, and resilience—from a New York Times bestselling author and award-winning researcher “A new revolution of health and well-being and a testament to, and celebration of, the power within.”—Deepak Chopra, MD Whether it’s meditation or a walk in nature, reading a sacred text or saying a prayer, there are many ways to tap into a heightened awareness of the world around you and your place in it. In The Awakened Brain, psychologist Dr. Lisa Miller shows you how. Weaving her own deeply personal journey of awakening with her groundbreaking research, Dr. Miller’s book reveals that humans are universally equipped with a capacity for spirituality, and that our brains become more resilient and robust as a result of it. For leaders in business and government, truth-seekers, parents, healers, educators, and any person confronting life’s biggest questions, The Awakened Brain combines cutting-edge science (from MRI studies to genetic research, epidemiology, and more) with on-the-ground application for people of all ages and from all walks of life, illuminating the surprising science of spirituality and how to engage it in our lives: • The awakened decision is the better decision. With an awakened perception, we are more creative, collaborative, ethical, and innovative. • The awakened brain is the healthier brain. An engaged spiritual life enhances grit, optimism, and resilience while providing insulation against addiction, trauma, and depression. • The awakened life is the inspired life. Loss, uncertainty, and even trauma are the gateways by which we are invited to move beyond merely coping with hardship to transcend into a life of renewal, healing, joy, and fulfillment. Absorbing, uplifting, and ultimately enlightening, The Awakened Brain is a conversation-starting saga of scientific discovery packed with counterintuitive findings and practical advice on concrete ways to access your innate spirituality and build a life of meaning and contribution.",Psychology,289,N/A,0,en
Renewal,Sandeep Nath,Notion Press,2020-06-03,"Is the human race conclusively set for self-annihilation? As futurists prophesize, are we only decades away from extinguishing the planet? Or are we capable of changing this trajectory because of what YOU start today? Renewal is about how each one of us can: Renew ourselves at a body-mind-spirit level Renew our society and our environment and Renew the systems we operate with As of 2020, Renewal is critical, because it is our laxity that has led to the current state of rising personal illness, mindless lifestyles, social degeneration, environmental degradation, and overall moral decay. Written to serve as a practical guide for everyone’s day-to-day ‘karma,’ Renewal is set in the lives of a modern-day family. It is strung together by the charismatic Guru Pranachandra, whose discourse drives home the vital message: that the world is a mere 30 habits away from Renewal. Adopters of these habits will be the future Renewalists, who could well outnumber the Vegans, Buddhists, Technologists and Catholics in times to come.

The Hidden Key takes the high road to understanding Harry Potter's success through an exploration of the series' structure, themes, and symbolism.

But Tao cannot fully be explained in words; it can only felt and experienced. Tao is something you live, day by day, moment by moment. It's the omnipresent oneness beyond ephemeral phenomena that expresses itself in everything. New York Times bestselling author Ilchi Lee, an enlightened Tao master from South Korea, has laid out a path to living Tao every day. Along this path, he guides you to an understanding of the meaning of birth, death, and everything in between, building a foundation for living a complete and whole life. The universal principles contained in ""Living Tao: Timeless Principles for Everyday Enlightenment"" stem from the Korean practice of Sundo, an ancient tradition of mind-body training, as well as Lee's own life experience. With these tangible principles, Ilchi Lee makes this profound topic simple and accessible.

Yoga and the Quest for the True Self,Stephen Cope,Bantam,2018-04-17,"More than 100,000 copies sold! Millions of Americans know yoga as a superb form of exercise and as a potent source of calm in the midst of our stress-filled lives. Far fewer are aware of the full promise of yoga as ""the way of the fully alive human being""--a 4,000-year-old practical path of liberation that fits the needs of modern Western seekers with startling precision. Now one of America's leading scholars of yoga psychology--who is also a Western-trained psychotherapist--offers this marvelously lively and personal account of an ancient tradition that promises ""the soul awake in this lifetime."" Drawing on the vivid stories of practitioners at the largest yoga center in America, where he has lived and taught for more than ten years, Stephen Cope describes the philosophy, psychology, and practice of yoga--a practical science of development that urges us not to transcend or dissolve the self, but rather to encounter it more deeply. In this irreverent modern-day Pilgrim's Progress, Cope introduces us to an unforgettable cast of contemporary seekers--on the road to enlightenment carrying all the baggage of the human condition: confusion, loss, disappointment, addiction, and the eternal conflicts around sex and relationship. As he describes the subtle shifts of energy and consciousness that happen at each stage of the path, we discover that in yoga, ""liberation"" does not require us to leave life in the world for some transcendent spiritual plane. Life itself is the path. Above all, Cope shows how yoga can heal the suffering of self-estrangement that pervades our society, leading us to a new sense of purpose and to a deeper, more satisfying life in the world.","Body, Mind & Spirit",485,N/A,0,en

The dysfunctional family is fueled by shame and chaos, stunting children’s relationships and self-acceptance. Adult children of alcoholics and addicts need encouragement to overcome these childhood deprivations. Days of Healing, Days of Joy models a program of serenity, spirituality, and acceptance through its meditations. “Children of alcoholics are set up for their struggles. You are not sick. You got set up.” —Dr. Jan Woititz Alcoholic or addicted parents may become focused on their compulsion while their children fend for themselves in a dysfunctional household. Without helpful and informative parental guidance, children manage their own personal growth, and their spiritual and emotional health suffers. Children parent themselves, and their innocence dies. Parents with addiction may not have demonstrated healthy connection and love to their children. Adult children of addicts or alcoholics are often shadowed by this disconnect; codependency, self-judgment, and overzealous loyalty darken their doorway.

Rethinking Aging,"Nortin M. Hadler, M.D.",Univ of North Carolina Press,2011-09-12,"For those fortunate enough to reside in the developed world, death before reaching a ripe old age is a tragedy, not a fact of life. Although aging and dying are not diseases, older Americans are subject to the most egregious marketing in the name of ""successful aging"" and ""long life,"" as if both are commodities. In Rethinking Aging, Nortin M. Hadler examines health-care choices offered to aging Americans and argues that too often the choices serve to profit the provider rather than benefit the recipient, leading to the medicalization of everyday ailments and blatant overtreatment. Rethinking Aging forewarns and arms readers with evidence-based insights that facilitate health-promoting decision making. Over the past decades, Hadler has established himself as a leading voice among those who approach the menu of health-care choices with informed skepticism. Only the rigorous demonstration of efficacy is adequate reassurance of a treatment's value, he argues; if it cannot be shown that a particular treatment will benefit the patient, one should proceed with caution. In Rethinking Aging, Hadler offers a doctor's perspective on the medical literature as well as his long clinical experience to help readers assess their health-care options and make informed medical choices in the last decades of life.

Places I've Taken My Body,Molly McCully Brown,National Geographic Books,2021-09-28,"In seventeen intimate essays, poet Molly McCully Brown explores living within and beyond the limits of a body—in her case, one shaped since birth by cerebral palsy, a permanent and often painful movement disorder. In spite of—indeed, in response to—physical constraints, Brown leads a peripatetic life: the essays comprise a vivid travelogue set throughout the United States and Europe, ranging from the rural American South of her childhood to the cobblestoned streets of Bologna, Italy. Moving between these locales and others, Brown constellates the subjects that define her inside and out: a disabled and conspicuous body, a religious conversion, a missing twin, a life in poetry. As she does, she depicts vividly for us not only her own life but a striking array of sites and topics, among them Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and the world’s oldest anatomical theater, the American Eugenics movement, and Jerry Falwell’s Liberty University. Throughout, Brown offers us the gift of her exquisite sentences, woven together in consideration, always, of what it means to be human—flawed, potent, feeling.",Literary Collections,0,N/A,0,en

Community Care in Hong Kong,"Kar-wai TONG, Kenneth Nai-kuen FONG",City University of HK Press,2014-10-16,"Different global healthcare challenges bring threats to the healthcare system. Like other developed countries, Hong Kong is also focusing on how to manage the ageing population, how to meet the rising public expectations, and how to finance the ever increasing medical costs. Strengthening community care services may provide a way out for settling these concerns. Written by a team of renowned scholars and leading practitioners, this book aims at evaluating how different parties can assist in building up local community capacity to achieve sustainable health and wellness. The book is divided into three sections. The first section discusses the different roles and practices of specialised community care that contribute to the relative success of the healthcare system in Hong Kong. The second section makes use of various research practices to extrapolate future healthcare needs and practices in Hong Kong. And the last one addresses the values of health care which underlie the healthcare culture, structure and practice in Hong Kong over time. Apart from pointing out the limitation of the current system, this book will also discusses the future directions of the healthcare system in order to cope with the challenges in a changing society.

Spiritual Physiology,Philip Sarpong,N/A,2020-04-30,"Have you ever wanted to dive deeper into your spiritual life but didn't know how? We spend so much time and energy on our physical life that it is often easy to forget about our spirits. Most people live malnourished spiritual lives at no fault of their own. It's time to wake up your mind by understanding more about our physical body. God left his fingerprints all over the human body; the more we learn about our bodies, the more we find out about him. If you've ever been interested in a human physiology course, this book breaks into the foundation of human physiology but applies it spiritually. We can all grow our spirits in some way. Often, the more we learn about our souls, the more we learn about ourselves. God gave you a fantastic physical human body, a temple, that he created for you. Your mind, heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, all have their functions. You do as well. What's more beautiful than your body is the spirit he gave to you as well. Use this book to get deeper into the spiritual world of the Bible, but also use it to get deeper into yourself. As anatomy is to your physical structure, physiology is the function of different organs. In this book, we dive into the spiritual physiology of your nature. In other words, your spiritual function, purpose, and identity. What is your goal? How is your spirit? Why did God encase our spirits inside of a physical body? All these questions and more will be analyzed and dissected in this book, Spiritual Physiology.",,163,1,1,en

According author Michael Bird the gospel is the fulcrum of Christian doctrine; the gospel is where God meets us and where we introduce the world to God. And as such, an authentically evangelical theology is the working out of the gospel in the various doctrines of Christian theology. The text helps readers learn the essentials of Christian theology through several key features, including: A ""What to Take Home"" section at end of every part that gives readers a run-down on all the important things they need to know. Tables, sidebars, and questions for discussion to help reinforce key ideas and concepts A ""Comic Belief"" section, since reading theology can often be dry and cerebral, so that readers enjoy their learning experience through some theological humor added for good measure.

Psychoanalysis as a Spiritual Discipline,Paul Marcus,Routledge,2021-04-26,"The great existential psychiatrist Ludwig Binswanger famously pointed out to Freud that therapeutic failure could ""only be understood as the result of something which could be called a deficiency of spirit."" Binswanger was surprised when Freud agreed, asserting, ""Yes, spirit is everything."" However, spirit and the spiritual realm have largely been dropped from mainstream psychoanalytic theory and practice. This book seeks to help revitalize a culturally aging psychoanalysis that is in conceptual and clinical disarray in the marketplace of ideas and is viewed as a ""theory in crisis"" no longer regarded as the primary therapy for those who are suffering. The author argues that psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic psychotherapy can be reinvigorated as a discipline if it is animated by the powerfully evocative spiritual, moral, and ethical insights of two dialogical personalist religious philosophers—Martin Buber, a Jew, and Gabriel Marcel, a Catholic—who both initiated a ""Copernican revolution"" in human thought. In chapters that focus on love, work, faith, suffering, and clinical practice, Paul Marcus shows how the spiritual optic of Buber and Marcel can help revive and refresh psychoanalysis, and bring it back into the light by communicating its inherent vitality, power, and relevance to the mental health community and to those who seek psychoanalytic treatment.",Philosophy,221,N/A,0,en
Historical Dictionary of the Bahá'í Faith,Hugh C.

The 2nd edition of the Historical Dictionary of the Bahá'í Faith presents a general historical overview of both Bábí and Bahá'í religions, as well as a theological overview of the Bahá'í Faith, from their inception in the mid 19th century to the middle of 2005.

Fasting the Mind,Jason Gregory,Simon and Schuster,2017-05-25,"Combines cognitive psychology with Zen, Taoist, and Vedic practices to empty the mind • Explains how eliminating external stimulation can alleviate stress and anxiety for a calmer state of mind • Details meditation practices, such as open-awareness meditation, contemplation of Zen koans, and Vipassana meditation, and explores methods of digital detox • Draws on classical yoga, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism as well as cognitive science to explain how and why to fast the mind Stop planning, stop comparing, stop competing, stop thinking, and just breathe deeply for a minute . . . Our undivided attention is something we are rarely able to give for reasons ranging from digital overload to the cultural conditioning of equating busyness with purpose. Just as you might choose a fast from eating to detoxify the body, the best way to overcome this modern mental overload is to periodically fast the mind. Drawing on the spiritual philosophies and meditative practices of classical yoga, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism, Jason Gregory explains how fasting the mind directly impacts your habits and way of being in the world to create peace and calmness in your life as well as allow you to build a firm psychological defense against the increasing bombardment of distractions in our world. Applying psychology and cognitive science to samsara--the cycle of suffering created by our attachment to the impermanent--he explains how overreliance on the rational mind causes imbalances in the autonomic nervous system and suppresses our natural spontaneity, feelings, and intuition. When we are unable to relax the mind deeply, we enter a destabilizing state of stress and anxiety and are unable to liberate the true Self from the impermanence and limitations of the material world. Sharing Zen, Taoist, and Vedic practices to help you empty your mind and gradually restore your natural rhythms, the author shows how to give the mind time to truly relax from stimulation so it can repair itself and come back into equilibrium. He details simple meditation practices that are easy to implement in daily life, such as open-awareness meditation and contemplation of Zen koans, as well as the advanced techniques of Vipassana, a Theravadic Buddhist discipline centered on seclusion from all worldly stimuli. He also offers methods for digital detox and ensuring a good night’s sleep, a major support for healing cognitive impairment and restoring a state of equanimity. By fasting the mind we strip away the distractions and stresses of modern life and return to our original nature as it exists deep within. We become more consciously awake in every moment, allowing us to feel the real beauty of the world and, in turn, to live life more fully, authentically, and peacefully.","Body, Mind & Spirit",201,N/A,0,en

Beginning with the Renaissance's rediscovery of Greek psychology, political philosophy, and ethics, Roger Smith recounts how the human sciences gradually organized themselves around a scientific conception of psychology, and how this trend has continued to the present day in a circle of interactions between science and ordinary life, in which the human sciences have influenced and been influenced by popular culture.",Science,1074,N/A,0,en

Embedded Thinking,Zsuzsanna Kondor,Peter Lang,2008,"The new devices of communication that have recently been emerging have far-reaching effects not only on our everyday lives, but also on our cognitive patterns: they lead us back again into the world of multimodality, and call attention, not incidentally, to the widening gap between everyday experience and the traditional convictions of philosophy. Traditional philosophical inquiries are seen in a new light when viewed from the perspective of communications technology. From that perspective, it becomes clear that a radical turn has become inevitable in the field of metaphysics and epistemology. This volume attempts to provide building-blocks for the new edifice of philosophy towards which that turn is leading.",Computers,188,N/A,0,en

The Shape of the Soul,Paul Marshall,Rowman & Littlefield,2019-03-18,"“An essential read for any true seeker.""—Eben Alexander, MD, Neurosurgeon, author of Proof of Heaven and Living in a Mindful Universe When Paul Marshall began to pay attention to his dreams, he could not have anticipated the transformative experience that would follow. A tremendous expansion of consciousness exposed the insignificance of his everyday self but also revealed unsuspected depths of mind and hinted at a deeper self that holds the universe within. In The Shape of the Soul, Marshall—now a mysticism scholar—draws on personal experiences, along with a wealth of religious, philosophical, and scientific ideas, to explore this deeper self, sometimes experienced in mystical and near-death states as spherical in form. Drawing inspiration from the philosophers Plotinus and Leibniz, Marshall takes mind to be more fundamental than matter and views the basic units of nature as perceptual beings. We ourselves are such beings, striving for fulfilment in a long evolutionary journey of soul-making. Bringing together mysticism, philosophy, biology, and even some physics, The Shape of the Soul offers a deeply integrated vision of the self and the universe. Addressing the mind–body problem, the origin of the world, evolution, reincarnation, suffering, and the nature of God, Marshall delivers what will surely prove an intellectual classic.",Philosophy,448,N/A,0,en
Why People Don't Heal and How They Can,Caroline Myss,Harmony,2013-09-04,"A bold account of the development of human consciousness and spirituality over the ages and an examination of the dynamic global transformation of attitudes about healing. For more than fifteen years, Caroline Myss has studied why some people heal, while others do not. In her previous book, Anatomy of the Spirit, Dr. Myss illuminated the hidden interactions of belief and body, soul and cell to show how, as she inimitably puts it, ""your biography becomes your biology."" In Why People Don't Heal and How They Can, she builds on her earlier teachings of the seven different energy centers of the body to provide a vital self-healing program for physical and spiritual disorders. With her characteristic no-nonsense style and high-voltage storytelling, she exposes and explodes the five myths about healing, explains the cultural and individual contexts in which people become physically and spiritually ill and invested in ""woundology,"" and teaches new methods of working with the challenges that the seven energy centers embody. To help you get and stay on the path to wellness, Dr. Myss provides rituals and prayers for gaining a symbolic perspective on your life issues; for bolstering your personal power; and for connecting with a universal divine energy. Dr. Myss's breakthrough views on energy medicine and her active approach to healing life issues and physical illness will help you overcome the mental blocks that keep you from becoming well.","Body, Mind & Spirit",287,N/A,0,en

We can let them harden us and make us increasingly resentful and afraid, or we can let them soften us and allow our inherent human kindness to shine through.

Off the Hook,Earl Wayne Heflinger,Balboa Press,2018-03-15,"The author uses his own personal storyof being born into a Christian fundamentalist family with extreme beliefsto paint a vivid picture of what life is like in toxic ideologies such as fundamentalist religion. The book has three parts. The first describes the spiritual abuse of his childhood due to stifling rules and restrictions inflicted by his parents, caught up in their churchs teachings, on his thought processes and behavior. The remarkably poignant stories show in painful detail how his self-esteem was crushed, how he was never intended to think for himself, and how he was made to feel different and totally out of place in the worldall by loving but misguided parents. During his school days, his social life was severely stunted because he felt like an outsider everywhere but in church. The second part discusses his lifelong struggle with spiritual healing and his transition from a spoon-fed belief system to a personally chosen worldview. He thoughtfully muses about all the significant elements of religious/spiritual belief systemsGod, Jesus, the Bible, sin, morality, science, life after death, marriage, divorce, and othersand contrasts his evolving beliefs with those of organized religion. This is presented to give the reader a comprehensive illustration of how one particular seeker has constructed a personalized belief system through continual rethinking and updated understanding. The third part calls on the authors advanced education and professional experience in business and government in analyzing and developing systems and procedures. It describeswith a wealth of tips and checkliststhe process by which he escaped a toxic ideology and came to feel intellectually free and off the hook. It ends with heartfelt encouragement for anyone similarly affected by repression to accept all available helpful resources and muster the determination to claim their personal power.",Self-Help,295,N/A,0,en

Disabilities,"Martha E. Banks Ph.D., Mariah S. Gover, Elizabeth Kendall, Catherine A.

These authors teach us what the disabilities are, how common they have become, what challenges people with disabilities face, what treatments are available, and whether new promising efforts for rehabilitation are on the horizon. We also learn, in these volumes, about social actions that have advanced human rights for people with disabilities in countries around the world. Yet, we learn that in these same countries, discriminatory actions against people with disabilities continue to occur. The impact of different cultural beliefs about disability are explored and these beliefs are juxtaposed against legislative responses. In all three volumes, people with disabilities share their personal narratives about events they have faced in society. They provide rich examples of how culture, social interactions, and legislation can impact on people.",Psychology,1023,N/A,0,en

Grow a New Body,Alberto Villoldo,"Hay House, Inc",2019-03-12,"This newly revised edition of the Wall Street Journal bestseller One Spirit Medicine offers an accessible guide to an ancient practice for healing and transformation--including new, cutting-edge science, recipes, and a 7-day Grow a New Body meal plan! Using the principles and practices in this book, you can feel better in a few days, begin to clear your mind and heal your brain in a week, and in six weeks be on your way to growing a new body--one that heals rapidly, retains its youthful vitality, and keeps you connected to Spirit, to the earth, and to a renewed sense of purpose in your life. Our minds, our emotions, our relationships, and our bodies are out of kilter. We know it, but we tend to ignore it until something brings us up short--a worrying diagnosis, a broken relationship, or simply an inability to function harmoniously in everyday life. When things are a little off, we read a self-help book. When they're really bad, we bring in oncologists to address cancer, neurologists to repair the brain, psychologists to help us understand our family of origin. This fragmented approach to health is merely a stopgap. To truly heal, we need to return to the original recipe for wellness discovered by shamans millennia ago. Drawing on more than 25 years of experience as a medical anthropologist--as well as his own journey back from the edge of death--acclaimed shamanic teacher Alberto Villoldo shows you how to detoxify the brain and gut with superfoods; use techniques for working with our luminous energy fields to heal your body; and follow the ancient path of the medicine wheel to shed disempowering stories from the past and pave the way for rebirth.","Body, Mind & Spirit",322,N/A,0,en

Undoing Depression,Richard O'Connor,"Little, Brown Spark",2021-09-28,"The bestselling approachable guide that has inspired thousands of readers to manage or overcome depression — fully revised and updated for life in the 21st century. Depression rates around the world have skyrocketed in the 20‑plus years since Richard O'Connor first published his classic book on living with and overcoming depression. Nearly 40 million American adults suffer from the condition, which affects nearly every aspect of life, from relationships, to job performance, physical health, productivity, and, of course, overall happiness. And in an increasingly stressful and overwhelming world, it's more important than ever to understand the causes and effects of depression, and what we can do to overcome it. In this fully revised and updated edition — which includes updated information on the power of mindfulness, the relationship between depression and other diseases, the risks and side effects of medication, depression’s effect on thinking, and the benefits of exercise — Dr. O'Connor explains that, like heart disease and other physical conditions, depression is fueled by complex and interrelated factors: genetic, biochemical, environmental. But Dr. O'Connor focuses on an additional factor that is often overlooked: our own habits. Unwittingly we get good at depression. We learn how to hide it, and how to work around it. We may even achieve great things, but with constant struggle rather than satisfaction. Relying on these methods to make it through each day, we deprive ourselves of true recovery, of deep joy and healthy emotion. Undoing Depression teaches us how to replace depressive patterns with a new and more effective set of skills. We already know how to ""do"" depression—and we can learn how to undo it. With a truly holistic approach that synthesizes the best of the many schools of thought about this painful disease, and a critical eye toward medications, O'Connor offers new hope—and new life—for sufferers of depression.",Self-Help,382,N/A,0,en

Do animals and other natural objects have a spirit or soul? What is their relationship to humans? In his new book, Graham Harvey explores indigenous and environmentalist spiritualities in which people celebrate relationships with other-than-human beings. He examines present and past animistic beliefs and practices of the Ojibwe, the Maori, Aboriginal Australians, and eco-pagans, revealing the diverse ways of being animist and of living respectfully within natural communities. Drawing on his extensive casework, Harvey considers the linguistic, performative, ecological, and activist implications of animist worldviews and lifeways. He argues that animist beliefs can contribute significantly to contemporary debates about consciousness, cosmology, and environmentalism. In addition, he examines the colonialist ideologies and methodologies that have caused many academics to exclude the term ""animism"" from their critical vocabularies.",Nature,280,N/A,0,en

Their correspondence contains the only known extant philosophical writings by Elisabeth, revealing her mastery of metaphysics, analytic geometry, and moral philosophy, as well as her keen interest in natural philosophy. The letters are essential reading for anyone interested in Descartes’s philosophy, in particular his account of the human being as a union of mind and body, as well as his ethics. They also provide a unique insight into the character of their authors and the way ideas develop through intellectual collaboration. Philosophers have long been familiar with Descartes’s side of the correspondence. Now Elisabeth’s letters—never before available in translation in their entirety—emerge this volume, adding much-needed context and depth both to Descartes’s ideas and the legacy of the princess.

“This Is My Doctrine”: The Development of Mormon Theology,Charles R. Harrell,Greg Kofford Books,2011-08-05,"The principal doctrines defining Mormonism today often bear little resemblance to those it started out with in the early 1830s. This book shows that these doctrines did not originate in a vacuum but were rather prompted and informed by the religious culture from which Mormonism arose. Early Mormons, like their early Christian and even earlier Israelite predecessors, brought with them their own varied culturally conditioned theological presuppositions (a process of convergence) and only later acquired a more distinctive theological outlook (a process of differentiation). In this first-of-its-kind comprehensive treatment of the development of Mormon theology, Charles Harrell traces the history of Latter-day Saint doctrines from the times of the Old Testament to the present. He describes how Mormonism has carried on the tradition of the biblical authors, early Christians, and later Protestants in reinterpreting scripture to accommodate new theological ideas while attempting to uphold the integrity and authority of the scriptures. In the process, he probes three questions: How did Mormon doctrines develop? What are the scriptural underpinnings of these doctrines? And what do critical scholars make of these same scriptures? In this enlightening study, Harrell systematically peels back the doctrinal accretions of time to provide a fresh new look at Mormon theology. “This Is My Doctrine” will provide those already versed in Mormonism’s theological tradition with a new and richer perspective of Mormon theology. Those unacquainted with Mormonism will gain an appreciation for how Mormon theology fits into the larger Jewish and Christian theological traditions.",Religion,598,N/A,0,en

"Cytokines, Stress, and Depression","Robert Dantzer, Emmanuelle E. Wollmann, Raz Yirmiya",Springer Science & Business Media,2007-11-23,"Cytokines had been characterized in the early eighties as communication mole cules between immune cells, and between immunocytes and other peripheral cells, such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells. They play a key role in the regulation of the immune response and the coordination of the host response to infection. Based on these biological properties, nobody would have predicted that one decade later cytokines would burst upon neurosciences and permeate into several avenues of current research. In neurology, the connection between cytokines and inflammation, and the demonstration of a pivotal role of some of these molecules in cell death by apoptosis, prompted the investigation of their involvement in several neurological diseases involving an inflammatory component, including multiple sclerosis, brain trauma, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease. This movement started in the late eighties, and the corresponding field of research, known as neuroimmunology, is presently booming. In psychiatry, however, the relationship between cytokines and mental disorders was much less evident and took longer to materialize. The first indication that cytokines might be involved in psychopathology came from cancerology and internal medicine.",Medical,335,N/A,0,en

Queering Your Craft,Cassandra Snow,Weiser Books,2020-11-01,"“As evident through the pages of this book, Snow holds a vision for the queer aspirant who hears the call to witchery, to find healing, empowerment, strength, and pride through their craft. Through creative and unique journal prompts, introspection, rituals, and spells, Snow achieves this beautifully, and herein lays the perfect guide for the queer witch to stand in their power and stand beside others; truly queering our craft with compassion and pride.” —Mat Auryn, author of Psychic Witch: A Metaphysical Guide to Meditation, Magick, and Manifestation Witchcraft has always belonged to the outsiders and outcasts in society, yet so much of the practice enforces and adheres to the same hierarchy we face in the world at large—a hierarchy that isolates and hurts those living beyond society’s binaries and boundaries. While there are books that address magick for resistance and queer myth, until now there has not been one that specifically addresses the practice of queer magick from an LGBTQ+ standpoint. Queering Your Craft combines queer aesthetic and culture (like DIY culture and an emphasis on chosen family over formal covens) with pagan and metaphysical spiritual practice in a way that is commonplace but has not been written about until now. This book covers the personal, the collective, and the political, and how deeply intertwined all three are in a magickal practice for those who are LGBTQ+. In this introduction to witchcraft, Snow presents why/how each concept is important to a queer craft, or how to approach it from a queer mindset. For example, conventional prayer, words, and symbols have always been problematic in a queer universe: How to make them work and still be true to yourself? The bulk of the book is about learning the craft. The latter portion is a grimoire of spells. While accessible to beginning witches, Queering Your Craft provides new and inspiring information for longtime practitioners interested in a pure and personal approach that avoids the baggage of history and stereotype.","Body, Mind & Spirit",288,5,1,en
Waking Up in 5D,Maureen J. St. Germain,Simon and Schuster,2017-09-12,"Tools and teachings to guide you in the transition from the polarized mindset of the 3rd dimension to the joy and love of 5th dimensional vibrations • Explains how to recognize the 5D experiences you’ve already had, identify the differences between 3D linear thinking and 5D multidimensional thinking, and turn 3D viewpoints around to expand your perception of what is possible • Includes exercises to protect your energies, especially while sleeping, and Sacred Geometry meditations to open yourself to higher frequencies • Reveals how to develop a Higher Self connection, increase your sensitivity to dimensional signatures, and consciously choose 5D, where love is the governing force We are all transitioning from the narrowly-focused and polarized awareness of the Third Dimension and waking up to the higher vibrations and abilities of the Fifth Dimension. Each of us has already experienced 5D: Think about your most memorable and uplifting experiences of the recent past--where everything went well, interactions were harmonious and loving, and all felt blissful and happy--that’s 5D. For some, the shift is sudden and permanent, but for many of us, the change is gradual, coming in fleeting moments and waves. In this ascension manual, spiritual teacher Maureen J. St. Germain explains how to shift your energetic patterns and choose to permanently anchor yourself in the joy, love, and kindness of 5D. Guiding you through the opportunities the Fifth Dimension has to offer, the author reveals how to develop a Higher Self connection, increase your sensitivity to dimensional signatures, and consciously choose 5D, where love is the governing force. She shows how 5D relates to 3D as well as to 4D, the transitional dimension between the two, and explains how to read the energy patterns that distinguish one dimension from the next as well as how to experience multiple dimensions simultaneously. She explores how to identify the differences between “good vs. evil” polarized 3D linear thinking and dynamic 5D multidimensional thinking and how to turn 3D viewpoints around to expand your perception of what is possible. Offering eye-opening stories of 5D experiences from students and inspiring information from her spirit guides, the author also details exercises to protect your energies, especially while sleeping, and provides Sacred Geometry meditations to activate your 8th chakra and open yourself to higher frequencies. She also explores how awakening to 5D allows you to form a strong bond to global consciousness, so your personal transformations will have a more profound impact on the people in your circle, and beyond.","Body, Mind & Spirit",220,N/A,0,en
The Wakeful Body,Willa Blythe Baker,Shambhala Publications,2021-11-23,"Spirituality & Practice ""Best Books of 2021"" Award Winner A highly practical and approachable guide to somatic meditation with easy practices for accessing the body's inherent mindfulness, from an expert in somatic meditation. Tap into the wisdom of the body with down-to-earth practices like ""Surrendering to the Breath"" and ""Befriending Feelings"" that allow the body to become the source of mindfulness. Willa Blythe Baker introduces meditation practice as the cultivation of a way of being, rather than a way of doing. It is a way of being that is self-aware, self-compassionate, and embodied. This way of being is not limited to practice on the cushion or on the yoga mat--somatic mindfulness is available at any moment, activated by attention to the body's wisdom and its teachings. Discover the three layers of embodiment, from the earth body of flesh and blood, the subtle body of sensory experience and emotion, and the awareness body of consciousness. The three parts of this book explore these layers through turning attention to the physical, energetic, and mental dimensions of human experience. By diving deep into the body, readers will find that they already have what they need. Concentration, wisdom, compassion, kindness, and joy are waiting there.","Body, Mind & Spirit",209,N/A,0,en

The comprehensiveness and innovation explored by every author reflects an in depth understanding that reveals true pioneers of integrated health care. Medical Family Therapy: Advances in Application will lead the way for Medical Family Therapists in areas just now being acknowledged and explored.” - Tracy Todd, PhD, LMFT, Executive Director of the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy Integrated, interdisciplinary health care is growing in stature and gaining in numbers. Systems and payers are facilitating it. Patients and providers are benefitting from it. Research is supporting it, and policymakers are demanding it. The emerging field of Medical Family Therapy (MedFT) is contributing greatly to these developments and Medical Family Therapy: Advanced Applications examines its implementation in depth. Leading experts describe MedFT as it is practiced today, the continuum of services provided, the necessary competencies for practitioners, and the biological, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects of health that the specialty works to integrate. Data-rich chapters model core concepts such as the practitioner as scientist, the importance of context in health care settings, collaboration with families and communities, and the centrality of the relational perspective in treatment. And the book's wide-spectrum coverage takes in research, training, financial, and policy issues, among them: Preparing MedFTs for the multiple worlds of health care Extending platforms on how to build relationships in integrated care Offering a primer in program evaluation for MedFTs Ensuring health equity in MedFT research Identifying where policy and practice collide with ethics and integrated care Recognizing the cost-effectiveness of family therapy in health care With its sophisticated insights into the current state – and the future – of healthcare reform, Medical Family Therapy: Advanced Applications is essential reading for researchers and practitioners in the fields of clinical psychology, counseling, family therapy, healthcare policy, psychiatric nursing, psychiatry, public health, and social work.",Psychology,492,N/A,0,en

A Force for Good,Daniel Goleman,Bantam,2015-06-23,"For more than half a century, in such books as The Art of Happiness and The Dalai Lama’s Little Book of Inner Peace, the Dalai Lama has guided us along the path to compassion and taught us how to improve our inner lives. In A Force for Good, with the help of his longtime friend Daniel Goleman, the New York Times bestselling author of Emotional Intelligence, the Dalai Lama explains how to turn our compassionate energy outward. This revelatory and inspiring work provides a singular vision for transforming the world in practical and positive ways. Much more than just the most prominent exponent of Tibetan Buddhism, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama is also a futurist who possesses a profound understanding of current events and a remarkable canniness for modern social issues. When he takes the stage worldwide, people listen. A Force for Good combines the central concepts of the Dalai Lama, empirical evidence that supports them, and true stories of people who are putting his ideas into action—showing how harnessing positive energies and directing them outward has lasting and meaningful effects. Goleman details the science of compassion and how this singular guiding motivation has the power to • break such destructive social forces as corruption, collusion, and bias • heal the planet by refocusing our concerns toward our impact on the systems that support all life • reverse the tendency toward systemic inequity through transparency and accountability • replace violence with dialogue • counter us-and-them thinking by recognizing human oneness • create new economic systems that work for everyone, not just the powerful and rich • design schooling that teaches empathy, self-mastery, and ethics Millions of people have turned to the Dalai Lama for his unparalleled insight into living happier, more purposeful lives. Now, when the world needs his guidance more than ever, he shows how every compassion-driven human act—no matter how small—is integral for a more peaceful, harmonious world, building a force for a better future. Revelatory, motivating, and highly persuasive, A Force for Good is arguably the most important work from one of the world’s most influential spiritual and political figures. Praise for A Force for Good “A Force for Good offers ideas that every individual can work with and build on, ranging from things that help the environment to things that help the less fortunate. [It’s] a long-range, global plan from a brilliant futuristic thinker, so this is a book that can be of value to any human living on Earth. When you’re ready for a jolt of optimism, pick up this book.”—Pop Culture Nerd “Far from being a self-help book, this examines specific ideas espoused by the Dalai Lama, such as emotional hygiene, compassionate economy, and education of the heart that can make the world a better place. An optimistic and thoughtful primer with practical applications.”—Booklist",Philosophy,273,5,1,en

Drop Acid,David Perlmutter,Hachette UK,2022-03-03,"*** NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER *** What do obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, fatty liver disease, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, neurological disorders and premature death have in common? All can be stoked by high uric acid levels. Our most respected scientific literature is bursting with evidence that elevated uric acid levels lie at the root of many pervasive health conditions, but mainstream medicine for the most part remains unaware of this connection. This is especially alarming because many people don't know they are suffering from sky-high levels, putting them at risk for developing or exacerbating potentially life-threatening illnesses. Offering an engaging blend of science and practical advice, Drop Acid exposes the deadly truth about uric acid and teaches invaluable strategies to manage its levels, including: - Simple dietary edits focused on reducing fructose and foods high in 'purines' that can raise uric acid. - Natural hacks that lower levels such as consuming tart cherries, vitamin C, quercetin, and coffee. - Identifying common pharmaceuticals that threaten to increase uric acid. - Lifestyle interventions, like restorative sleep and exercise. - How to easily test your uric acid levels at home - a test routinely performed in your doctor's office during regular check-ups but typically ignored. Featuring the ground-breaking 'LUV' (Lower Uric Values) diet, 35 delicious recipes, self-assessment quizzes and a 21 day program for dropping levels, Drop Acid empowers readers with the information they need to address this hidden danger and live longer, leaner and healthier lives.",Health & Fitness,336,N/A,0,en

On September 23, 1939, Wladyslaw Szpilman played Chopin’s Nocturne in C-sharp minor live on the radio as shells exploded outside—so loudly that he couldn’t hear his piano. It was the last live music broadcast from Warsaw: That day, a German bomb hit the station, and Polish Radio went off the air. Though he lost his entire family, Szpilman survived in hiding. In the end, his life was saved by a German officer who heard him play the same Chopin Nocturne on a piano found among the rubble. Written immediately after the war and suppressed for decades, The Pianist is a stunning testament to human endurance and the redemptive power of fellow feeling. “Szpilman’s memoir of life in the Warsaw ghetto is remarkable not only for the heroism of its protagonists but for the author’s lack of bitterness, even optimism, in recounting the events.” —Library Journal “Employing language that has more in common with the understatement of Primo Levi than with the moral urgency of Elie Wiesel, Szpilman is a remarkably lucid observer and chronicler of how, while his family perished, he survived thanks to a combination of resourcefulness and chance.” —Publishers Weekly “[Szpilman’s] account is hair-raising beyond anything Hollywood could invent . . . an altogether unforgettable book.” —The Daily Telegraph “[Szpilman’s] shock and ensuing numbness become ours, so that acts of ordinary kindness or humanity take on an aura of miracle.” —The Observer",Biography & Autobiography,221,4,1,en

We Tell Ourselves Stories in Order to Live,Joan Didion,Everyman's Library,2006-10-17,"Seven books in one hardcover volume from the bestselling, award-winning author of The Year of Magical Thinking: including the full texts of Slouching Towards Bethlehem; The White Album; Salvador; Miami; After Henry; Political Fictions; and Where I Was From. As featured in the Netflix documentary Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold. Joan Didion’s incomparable and distinctive essays and journalism are admired for their acute, incisive observations and their spare, elegant style. Now the seven books of nonfiction that appeared between 1968 and 2003 have been brought together into one thrilling collection. Slouching Towards Bethlehem captures the counterculture of the sixties, its mood and lifestyle, as symbolized by California, Joan Baez, Haight-Ashbury. The White Album covers the revolutionary politics and the “contemporary wasteland” of the late sixties and early seventies, in pieces on the Manson family, the Black Panthers, and Hollywood. Salvador is a riveting look at the social and political landscape of civil war. Miami exposes the secret role this largely Latin city played in the Cold War, from the Bay of Pigs through Watergate. In After Henry Didion reports on the Reagans, Patty Hearst, and the Central Park jogger case. The eight essays in Political Fictions–on censorship in the media, Gingrich, Clinton, Starr, and “compassionate conservatism,” among others–show us how we got to the political scene of today. And in Where I Was From Didion shows that California was never the land of the golden dream.""

"How to Use Herbs, Nutrients, and Yoga in Mental Health Care","Richard P. Brown, Patricia L. Gerbarg, Philip R. Muskin",W. W. Norton & Company,2012-02-20,"All you need to know about herbs, nutrients, and yoga for enhancing mental health. Many physicians and therapists agree that herbs and mind-body practices enhance health, but many more are reluctant to integrate them into their clinical work because of a lack of training or, given how long it takes to master the use of hundreds of different herbs, a lack of time. But the trend is clear: clients and consumers alike want control over their health care choices, making the time ripe for a practical resource that guides both the clinician and the consumer on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). This book answers that call. Three noted experts in integrative medicine, Drs. Brown, Gerbarg, and Muskin, demystify the complexities of alternative mental health care, giving readers a comprehensive yet accessible guidebook to the best treatment options out there. From mood, memory, and anxiety disorders to ADD, sexual enhancement issues, psychotic disorders, and substance abuse, every chapter covers a major diagnostic category. The authors then present a range of complementary and alternative treatments-including the use of herbs, nutrients, vitamins, nootropics, hormones, and mind-body practices- that they have found to be beneficial for various conditions within each category. For example, B complex vitamins and folate have been shown to help with depression; omega-3 fatty acids can offer relief for bipolar sufferers; coherent and resonant breathing techniques-used by Buddhist monks-induce healthy alpha rhythms in the brain to relieve anxiety; the elderly can boost their memory by taking the ancient medicinal herb Rhodiola rosea; and those with chronic fatigue syndrome can find comfort in acupuncture and yoga. Focusing on evidence-based approaches, the research, the authors' clinical experience, and the potential risks and benefits of each treatment are carefully examined. Brown, Gerbarg, and Muskin have distilled an otherwise daunting field of treatment down to its basics: their overriding approach is to present the CAM methods that are most practical in a clinical setting, easy to administer, and low in side effects. With helpful summary tables at the end of each chapter, clinical pearls, and case vignettes interspersed throughout, this is a must-have resource for all clinicians and consumers who want the best that alternative medicine has to offer.",Medical,465,N/A,0,en

Book Review 1: “I am an “old school” feminist, born out of the consciousness-raising circles of the early 1970’s and shaped by the influence of Betty Friedan, Bella Abzug, and Gloria Steinhem. My doctoral dissertation, written in 1995, was “The Future of Feminism: Where Do We Go From Here”? This book is a collaboration of over 30 women’s stories and points of view that seeks to answer and expand upon that question. What does it mean to be a modern woman and how does one express her “outside the box” needs for expression? Jennifer Ludington has lovingly curated these stories and added her own “Duality Dare” section at the end of each chapter to encourage the reader to dig deep into her own experience and discover herself anew. Roll up your sleeves, reader. You’ve got work to do!” -- Dr. Judith Rich, speaker, trainer, coach, and best-selling author of the book, “Beyond The Box”. Book Review 2: “Jennifer Ludington, through her living example, asks women to step up, stand up, and speak up. Why? So we can lead with powerful voices and create the change we want to see in the world. Her anthology, which features women writing about jealously, beauty, unity, and mom-guilt, sheds light on important cultural aspects we experience during the rise of the Sacred Feminine.” -- Dr. Kathryn Guylay, transformational leader, podcaster, bestselling author, and founder of MakeEverythingFun.com Book Review 3: ""The Duality of the Modern Woman is a must-read. Jen and the powerhouse women featured within the book provide a much-needed illustration of the duality in all women. It invites us all to explore our own duality – our masculine and feminine energy—and highlights real-life examples of how we as women can use both energies to harness anything we want to create in this world. As a type-A attorney, I personally spend a lot of time in the masculine."" -- Christy Westerfeld, Esq. – Attorney & Legal Resource for Online Entrepreneurs Book Review 4: “Inspiring. Raw. and REAL. We are all on our own unique journey, but we are never truly alone. This book taps into your soul and plants a seed of love and light. The stories shared by this collection of inspiring women gift you permission to embrace all parts that make you, you and help you realize that true freedom does exist and is possible.

Soulful Spirituality,David G. PhD Benner,Brazos Press,2011-03-01,"Spirituality has an indispensable role to play in the expression of our humanity. However, spiritual practices can sometimes make us less, not more, authentically human. We may be good Christians, but we aren't good human beings. How can we ensure that our spiritual journey is conducted in a way that allows us to become fully alive and deeply human? David Benner has spent thirty-five years integrating psychology and spirituality. Here he presents an expansive, psychologically informed understanding of spirituality, probing the contrasts between soulful and soulless spirituality, deep and shallow religion, and healthy and unhealthy relationships with God to affirm the vital role of human development in the spiritual journey. Benner then suggests soulful practices for cultivating the Christian spiritual life. This book will appeal to readers seeking depth and substance in their quest for authentic spirituality.

Beyond the Scandals,G. Lloyd Rediger,Fortress Press,N/A,"Recent sexual scandals have rocked the North American religious scene and left the churches concerned about credibility and liability. What are the bounds of clergy sexuality? What constitutes misconduct, and what legal, moral, and religious norms apply? More broadly, what has gone wrong, and how can clergy understand their own sexuality and their lives of service? Lloyd Rediger is a uniquely qualified national expert on all these questions with a strong message for clergy about their sexuality, spirituality, and behavior. In this timely volume, which incorporates material from his earlier volume Ministry and Sexuality, Rediger brings his extensive research, clinical experience, and theological insights to bear on the topic.

The New Testament and Bioethics,R. Dennis Macaleer,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2014-01-01,"Beauchamp and Childress's Principles of Biomedical Ethics is a well-accepted approach to contemporary bioethics. Those principles are based on what Beauchamp and Childress call the common morality. This book employs New Testament theological themes to enhance the meaning of those principles of bioethics. The primary New Testament text for this study is the twin commands from Jesus to love God and love one's neighbor. The three theological themes developed from this study--the image of God, the covenant, and the pursuit of healing--are deeply embedded in the New Testament and in the ministry of Jesus. Three contemporary bioethics principles are used for this dissertation, based on The Belmont Report. They are the principles of respect for persons, justice, and beneficence. In each case, the theological themes are shown to enhance the meaning of these bioethics principles. Each of the three principles, as understood through the three theological themes, is applied to a current bioethics issue to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach. The three current issues addressed are the withdrawal or withholding of life-sustaining treatment, the distribution of health care in the Untied States, and the use of palliative care.",Religion,306,N/A,0,en

The Spiritual Mysteries of Blood,Christopher Vasey,Simon and Schuster,2015-04-17,"Reveals how our blood acts as the bridge between body and spirit • Explains how our blood’s natural radiation connects our bodies to our spirits and serves as a means of communication between the two • Reveals how highly processed diets, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, heavy metal poisoning, medications, drugs, and alcohol negatively affect blood radiation and lead to physical, emotional, and spiritual imbalances • Provides advice on the ideal diet for each individual, whether omnivore, vegetarian, or allergy-prone, to optimize blood radiation Blood does far more than transport oxygen and nutrients, remove metabolic wastes, and convey hormonal messages from one cell to another. Providing medical examples to show how the body actively works to maintain our blood, even becoming seriously ill to save it, Christopher Vasey, N.D., explains how blood’s primary function is to form the bridge between the body and the human spirit. Vasey reveals how the blood, like everything in our world, radiates. The blood’s radiation is what connects body to spirit and serves as a means of communication between the two. Any deficiencies in the blood’s composition directly affect our spirit’s ability to stay connected to our physical body. Every change in the blood induces changes in our state of being and influences our psychic state. Many mental conditions such as loss of drive, unexplained sadness and irritability can be treated by restoring balance to the blood. In fact, the four basic temperaments--sanguine, melancholic, choleric, and phlegmatic--are intimately connected with our blood composition, hence the truth behind describing someone as “hot-blooded” or “cold-blooded.” The author explains how highly processed foods, vitamin deficiencies, heavy metal poisoning, and medications can negatively affect blood radiation and lead to physical, emotional, and spiritual imbalances. Revealing the spiritual purpose of eating, he explores how to improve blood radiation and composition with dietary changes, focusing on food that is organically produced and additive-free to avoid introducing any toxins or artificial ingredients into the bloodstream. Vasey offers advice to find the ideal diet for each individual, whether omnivore, vegetarian, or allergy-prone. He shows that by optimizing our blood composition, we improve our connection to spirit and provide a sound base for our soul to further its development.","Body, Mind & Spirit",117,N/A,0,en

Oathbringer,Brandon Sanderson,Tor Books,2017-11-14,"The eagerly awaited sequel to the #1 New York Times bestselling Words of Radiance, from epic fantasy author Brandon Sanderson at the top of his game. In Oathbringer, the third volume of the New York Times bestselling Stormlight Archive, humanity faces a new Desolation with the return of the Voidbringers, a foe with numbers as great as their thirst for vengeance. Dalinar Kholin’s Alethi armies won a fleeting victory at a terrible cost: The enemy Parshendi summoned the violent Everstorm, which now sweeps the world with destruction, and in its passing awakens the once peaceful and subservient parshmen to the horror of their millennia-long enslavement by humans. While on a desperate flight to warn his family of the threat, Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with the fact that the newly kindled anger of the parshmen may be wholly justified. Nestled in the mountains high above the storms, in the tower city of Urithiru, Shallan Davar investigates the wonders of the ancient stronghold of the Knights Radiant and unearths dark secrets lurking in its depths. And Dalinar realizes that his holy mission to unite his homeland of Alethkar was too narrow in scope. Unless all the nations of Roshar can put aside Dalinar’s blood-soaked past and stand together—and unless Dalinar himself can confront that past—even the restoration of the Knights Radiant will not prevent the end of civilization.

The Healing Gifts of the Spirit,Agnes Sanford,Harper Collins,1984-08-15,"This practical guide to spiritual healing blends insightful spiritual reflection and the wisdom of hard-won experience in a reliable and inspiring handbook for developing our innate capacity for richer living and richer giving through the healing gifts of the Spirit. Many years ago, Agnes Sanford was cured of acute depression by a minister who believed in the healing power of prayer. Subsequently, she herself became very active and successful in healing others of mental and physical ailments by drawing upon the same resources for inner well-being. In The Healing Gifts of the Spirit, she shares the simple, practicable ways of self-help she discovered, and gives step-by-step advice on how to help others. She discusses not only her own cure but also the gift of healing in general and its growing recognition in the contemporary church. She devotes a chapter to the gift of miracles, and another -- especially interesting -- to the gift of tongues. Her exploration of these topics is richly inspiring, offering readers one of the most detailed, informative discussions of the nature, dynamics, and potential rewards of these unique manifestations of God's presence. At the same time, she demonstrates how anyone can draw upon this healing power for good in the world. As evidence of how these gifts can -- and do -- reveal themselves, the author cites many examples from observation and personal encounters with the healing power of the Spirit.",Religion,228,N/A,0,en

A Short History of (Nearly) Everything Paranormal,Terje G. Simonsen,Watkins Media Limited,2020-06-09,"“A superb survey of the paranormal” and a travelogue through the twilight zone of human consciousness—hailed by experts as the best introduction to psychic phenomena (Herbie Brennan, New York Times–bestselling author). This is the most entertaining and broad survey of the paranormal ever made—combining forgotten lore, evidence from parapsychological experiments, and the testimonies of scientists, archaeologists, anthropologists, psychologists, physicists, and philosophers. Exploring the possibility that paranormal phenomena may be objectively real, this travelogue through the twilight zone of human consciousness is both scientifically rigorous and extremely entertaining. Readers may be surprised to learn that reputable scientists, among them several Nobel laureates, have claimed that: • Telepathy is a reality • Cleopatra’s lost palace and Richard III’s burial place were recovered with clairvoyance • The US military set up an espionage program using psychics Could it be that what we usually call “supernatural” is a natural but little understood communication via this mental internet? The winner of the most prestigious award in the field, the Parapsychological Association Book Award, A Short History of (Nearly) Everything Paranormal is an engaging, entertaining and informative analysis of a controversial subject.","Body, Mind & Spirit",452,N/A,0,en

"The Bible, Genesis & Geology",Gaines R. Johnson,Gaines Johnson,2010-05-23,"Does a time gap exist between the first two verses of Genesis? In this book you will learn about a controversial, lesser known literal interpretation of the Genesis narrative that does not contradict the scientific evidence for an Old Earth. Commonly called the ""Gap Theory"" or Ruin-Reconstruction interpretation, it is a theological interpretation much older than Darwin's Theory of Evolution. It is based on the Scriptural fact that in the second verse of Genesis, the Holy Bible simply and clearly states that the planet Earth was already here (but in a ruined state) before the creative process of the seven days even begins. The Bible itself provides insight into a great mystery in Earth's natural history at what is known as the Pleistocene - Holocene boundary. Science remains at a loss to definitively explain the Ice Age and the anomaly of the mysterious mega fauna extinctions across the face of the Earth about 12,000 to 10,000 Radio Carbon years ago. Geologic evidence from that period indicates extraordinary global massive volcanism, gigantic tidal waves, seismic activity on a vast scale, and extreme temperature swings on the Earth over a geologically brief period of time. It is no coincidence that the Bible at Genesis 1:2 describes the Earth as flooded, desolate, and in darkness in the time frame closely corresponding to these catastrophic events in the Earth's natural history. Clearly, these two mysteries are linked. The Earth has an ancient natural history that can be deciphered from the geologic record, but it also has an equally important ancient spiritual history that can only be deciphered from Rightly-Dividing the Holy Bible. Knowledge of both is required to correctly reconcile Geology and the Book of Genesis.",Religion,263,5,1,en

Superhealing,Elaine Ferguson,Simon and Schuster,2013-10-01,"From Hippocrates in ancient Greece to the medical healers of today, the impact that the mind-body connection has had on overall health has been widely recognized. And while advancements in technology are vast, the constraints of conventional medicine are an impediment to successfully preventing, reversing, or addressing the causes of chronic diseases—diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, arthritis, acid reflux, cancer, and more. At times, these advancements have even proven fatal. In Superhealing: Engaging Your Mind, Body, and Spirit to Create Optimal Health and Well-being, Dr. Elaine Ferguson uses an integrative approach to healing as a way of eradicating the physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual limitations—illustrated from the real-life stories she has witnessed throughout her medical career—that lead to chronic diseases and imbalance. Throughout Superhealing, readers will explore the truth about genetics and disease; the central role and significance stress has on the mind-body connection, as well as the distinctions between feelings, thoughts, and emotions and how both positive and negative emotions factor into one's health. Readers will also discover: The power of a plant-based diet and the true dangers of processed food The impact healthy relationships have on the body The significance of vitamin D3, omega 3 fatty acids, antioxidants, critical minerals, and vitamin B complex Why exercise should be the readers' superhealing ""drug"" of choice The superhealing power of touch—particularly massage and reflexology Toxic environmental factors such as the health-damaging chemicals present in most personal care and cleaning products and how to reduce or eliminate them How laughter, meditation, guided imagery, cognitive reprogramming, journaling, forgiveness, and gratitude affects one's health How spiritual beliefs and practices, isolation, and adversarial relationships contribute to physical and psychological decline Once the groundwork is complete, readers will construct an individualized, forty-day, two-part plan using a variety of clinically proven, holistic techniques that will encompass four core steps to a superhealing lifestyle. These steps will guide them on a unique path to better health while bringing the mind, body, and spirit, back into balance.",Health & Fitness,331,N/A,0,en

Ford’s work allows us to abide in the living, breathing essence of the zone, dance in the flow state, and train into it. The book is both a technical as well as intuitive discussion of a new way of contextualizing one’s athletic experience, engaging both left and right brain consciousness, and resulting in nothing less than a satori experience. By engaging in the practice of living in ever-present moment-to-moment awareness, the author creates a non-local consciousness experience that is life-changing. Thus, through Scott’s highly refined work, we enter into the Witness state, a revered state of consciousness that is both unitive and integrated. Sport is the great Western metaphor, a potent medium that teaches us how to realize our sometimes dormant capacities, and at the same time translate the learning into everyday situations. The lessons learned from this book apply directly to all walks of life. Hence, Scott’s discoveries take us into the union of East and West, the spirit and the flesh, through tennis, sport and life. You may never look at a tennis ball in the same way.

In Spirit Medicine, Dr. Wesselman is joined by his wife, transpersonal medical practitioner Jill Kuykendall, RPT., to present us with a cross-cultural consideration of illness, healing, and health care from the ancient wisdom of the traditional peoples. Spirit Medicine opens a window into a universal worldview that will help you: • understand the classic causes of illness—-an essential step in true healing; • work with the four levels of spiritual healing; • expand your connections to inner sources of wisdom and power; and • deepen your contacts with your helping spirits and healing masters. Spirit Medicine will provide you with the singular key to success that energy medicine by itself lacks. It will also provide you with a perspective derived from the Hawaiian kahuna tradition in which knowledge of the soul cluster, as well as the multileveled nature of reality, forms the foundation. Included is an experiential CD of shamanic drumming and rattling to be used with specific exercises and meditations designed to enhance your healing practice for yourself and others. Spirit Medicine reconsiders and reworks the time-tested techniques pioneered by the shamans of the indigenous peoples, providing nontribal Westerners with extraordinarily effective insights into healing and problem solving.","Body, Mind & Spirit",257,N/A,0,en

Mind and Cosmos,Thomas Nagel,Oxford University Press,2012-11-22,"The modern materialist approach to life has conspicuously failed to explain such central mind-related features of our world as consciousness, intentionality, meaning, and value. This failure to account for something so integral to nature as mind, argues philosopher Thomas Nagel, is a major problem, threatening to unravel the entire naturalistic world picture, extending to biology, evolutionary theory, and cosmology. Since minds are features of biological systems that have developed through evolution, the standard materialist version of evolutionary biology is fundamentally incomplete. And the cosmological history that led to the origin of life and the coming into existence of the conditions for evolution cannot be a merely materialist history, either. An adequate conception of nature would have to explain the appearance in the universe of materially irreducible conscious minds, as such. Nagel's skepticism is not based on religious belief or on a belief in any definite alternative. In Mind and Cosmos, he does suggest that if the materialist account is wrong, then principles of a different kind may also be at work in the history of nature, principles of the growth of order that are in their logical form teleological rather than mechanistic. In spite of the great achievements of the physical sciences, reductive materialism is a world view ripe for displacement. Nagel shows that to recognize its limits is the first step in looking for alternatives, or at least in being open to their possibility.",Biography & Autobiography,141,1,1,en

In fact, yoga is a sophisticated system of self-empowerment that is capable of harnessing and activating inner energies in such a way that your body and mind function at their optimal capacity. It is a means to create inner situations exactly the way you want them, turning you into the architect of your own joy. A yogi lives life in this expansive state, and in this transformative book Sadhguru tells the story of his own awakening, from a boy with an unusual affinity for the natural world to a young daredevil who crossed the Indian continent on his motorcycle. He relates the moment of his enlightenment on a mountaintop in southern India, where time stood still and he emerged radically changed. Today, as the founder of Isha, an organization devoted to humanitarian causes, he lights the path for millions. The term guru, he notes, means “dispeller of darkness, someone who opens the door for you. . . . As a guru, I have no doctrine to teach, no philosophy to impart, no belief to propagate. And that is because the only solution for all the ills that plague humanity is self-transformation. Self-transformation means that nothing of the old remains. It is a dimensional shift in the way you perceive and experience life.” The wisdom distilled in this accessible, profound, and engaging book offers readers time-tested tools that are fresh, alive, and radiantly new.

Living Souls in the Spirit Dimension,Chris H. Hardy,Simon and Schuster,2020-06-09,"An examination of our consciousness’s ability to pass between dimensions, both in life and after death, and how to communicate with spirits • Reveals that all beings exist simultaneously in the material dimension and in the soul hyperdimension and that our consciousness transcends death • Provides evidence that the deceased keep in contact with their loved ones and are able to visit them as apparitions, give them advice, and protect them • Offers rigorous scientific analysis of paranormal occurrences, including evidence of life after death, house spirits, near-death and out-of-body experiences, and communication with the souls of the deceased In this exploration of consciousness, after-death communication, and the validity of near-death and out-of-body experiences, Chris H. Hardy, Ph.D., a former researcher at Princeton’s Psychophysical Research Laboratories, reveals that all beings exist simultaneously in the material dimension and in the soul hyperdimension. During life, we can access the soul hyperdimension through heightened states of consciousness and dreams. After death, we cease to physically exist, but our consciousness continues on in the hyperdimension as a living soul, a complete personality able to perceive and even affect the material world. Through rigorous scientific analysis of psi experiences and surveys, the author shows that the deceased keep contact with the living by visiting them as apparitions, protecting them from harm, and even interceding to solve family problems or resolve their own unfinished business. She details her own psi and spiritual experiences, such as interactions with a house spirit, clairvoyance in lucid dreams, and her decades of communication with the souls of the deceased, including her own parents and scientific geniuses, and provides empirical evidence to support their reality. Moreover, Hardy offers tested methods for gaining access to the soul dimension and explores what can be accomplished there, including communicating with those who exist beyond our own matter world. Sharing her breakthrough understanding of the soul dimension as a hyperdimension pervading the universe, where our consciousness lives on after physical death, Hardy shows that we are all transdimensional beings and that the living souls of the spirit dimension welcome our interaction.","Body, Mind & Spirit",459,N/A,0,en

What are the deeper, spiritual realities behind COVID-19 and the global turmoil it has left in its trail? In an effort to answer these queries and many others put to her at the start of the pandemic, Judith von Halle composed two letters in March 2020, based on her own spiritual-scientific research. Published in this book together with an additional essay, she addresses questions such as: Which entities stand behind the virus? How and why does it affect human beings? What measures can be taken for prevention and therapy? What does the crisis mean to individuals and what possibilities does it offer for personal development? The author suggests that, apart from the material havoc triggered by coronavirus, the spiritual causes behind it are extremely serious and – if the present pandemic is not to be the first in a series of catastrophes – humanity is called upon to respond in a radically transformative way. In an additional article von Halle tackles the controversial issues relating to government lockdowns and the protest movements that have sprung up in opposition to them. How do these events point to real questions of individual freedom and, most importantly, how do they relate to the central event of our time – an event that, tragically, remains largely unknown? Revealing unexpected perspectives to the COVID-19 pandemic, Judith von Halle asks urgent and difficult questions and offers shattering insights for humanity’s further development.","Body, Mind & Spirit",120,N/A,0,en

Written by leading experts from seven countries in Europe, America, Africa and Asia, it first discusses the theory of health promotion and vital concepts. It then presents updated evidence-based health promotion approaches in different populations (people with chronic diseases, cancer, heart failure, dementia, mental disorders, long-term ICU patients, elderly individuals, families with newborn babies, palliative care patients) and examines different health promotion approaches integrated into primary care services. This edited scientific anthology provides much-needed knowledge, translating research into guidelines for practice. Today’s medical approaches are highly developed; however, patients are human beings with a wholeness of body-mind-spirit. As such, providing high-quality and effective health care requires a holistic physical-psychological-social-spiritual model of health care is required. A great number of patients, both in hospitals and in primary health care, suffer from the lack of a holistic oriented health approach: Their condition is treated, but they feel scared, helpless and lonely. Health promotion focuses on improving people’s health in spite of illnesses. Accordingly, health care that supports/promotes patients’ health by identifying their health resources will result in better patient outcomes: shorter hospital stays, less re-hospitalization, being better able to cope at home and improved well-being, which in turn lead to lower health-care costs.

Feminism's New Age,Karlyn Crowley,State University of New York Press,2011-06-01,"Finalist for the 2011 ForeWord Book of the Year in the Women's Issues Category Crystals, Reiki, Tarot, Goddess worship—why do these New Age tokens and practices capture the imagination of so many women? How has New Age culture become even more appealing than feminism? And are the two mutually exclusive? By examining New Age practices from macrobiotics to goddess worship to Native rituals, Feminism's New Age: Gender, Appropriation, and the Afterlife of Essentialism seeks to answer these questions by examining white women's participation in this hugely popular spiritual movement. While most feminist approaches to the New Age phenomenon have simply dismissed its adherents for their politically problematic racial appropriation practices, Karyln Crowley looks honestly at the political shortcomings of New Age beliefs and practices while simultaneously reckoning with the affective, political, and cultural motivations which have prompted New Age women's individual and collective spiritualities. New Age spirituality is in fact the dynamic outgrowth of a long-standing tradition of women's social and political power expressed through religious writings, art, and public discourse, and is key to understanding contemporary women's history and religion's role in modern American culture alike. Crowley offers a new and provocative assessment of the significance of the New Age movement, seen through a feminist and critical race studies lens.",Social Science,259,2.5,2,en

The Creation of Man,Dr. Gilbert H. Edwards,AuthorHouse,2010-06-16,"I have focused on the idea of man in creation and have tried to clarify it. Perhaps there is as much confusion and uncertainty here as anywhere today, even in Christian ranks. There is confusion and uncertainty of the beginning of man, was he created as man as of today or did he evolve from an ape? Also, there are other things that confuse and seem uncertain to man that I tried to point out in this study. The idea of God is being attacked in many ways and in many quarters. But there seems to be, also, a growing recognition of man's need of God. Man within himself is helpless in the midst of hostile forces on every hand. God is man's only refuge and help in time of need. I feel that man should know about his total self, and relationship with God. I will try to point out and focus on studies of man before the world was created, the three-folds of man's nature and functional parts, his fall and punishment, and also his renewal stages and his final destiny.",Religion,118,N/A,0,en

Most caregivers confronted with these illnesses in the work of ministry have had no training or accurate information about mental illnesses, so frequently they do nothing, resulting in further harm and damage. Others may operate out of a theological system that does not adequately account for the nature, severity, or treatment of these illnesses.

This is reminiscent of Goliath taunting King Saul and his beleaguered army into accepting submission, until a skinny shepherd boy who understood the covenant sauntered in. This is an end-time call to live a devoted life in the Spirit to establish kingdom authoritya life in the Spirit in which encroaching evil may retreat and victory may be accomplished daily.

Michael Grosso delves into the biography of the saint to explore the many strange phenomena that surrounded his life and develops potential physical explanations for some of the most astounding manifestations of his religious ecstasy. Grosso draws upon contemporary explorations into cognition, the relationship between the human mind and body, and the scientifically recorded effects of meditation and other transcendent practices to reveal the implications of St. Joseph’s experiences and abilities.",Philosophy,265,N/A,0,en

Spirit Junkie,Gabrielle Bernstein,Harmony,2012-09-18,"“So long, Carrie Bradshaw—there’s a new role model for go-getting thirty-somethings. Gabrielle Bernstein is doling out inner peace and self-love for the postmodern spiritual set.”—Elle Foreword by Marianne Williamson Before she became a celebrated teacher and lecturer, Gabrielle Bernstein was going down a dangerous path. For years, Bernstein struggled with eating disorders, drug and alcohol abuse, and constant self-doubt and self-loathing. That all changed when she discovered A Course in Miracles, which taught her that much of what she feared in life was not frightening at all and, in many cases, not even real. Now, Bernstein lives an empowered, healthy, and joyful life. In Spirit Junkie, Bernstein guides readers through the life-changing lessons that shaped her spiritual journey: how we become accustomed to fearful ways of thinking, how to recognize and change those thought patterns to make way for bliss, and how to maintain our happiness and share it with the world. By understanding and changing our perceptions, hang-ups will melt away, resentments will release, and a childlike faith in joy will be reignited. Praise for Spirit Junkie “For those ready to give up their addiction to suffering or who simply need to release the general malaise of a too-busy, too shallow way of life, Spirit Junkie is a soothing balm for the soul.

Self-Construction in a Transcultural Context,Yijia Zuo,Springer Nature,2022-07-16,"This book explores the ways in which individuals construct and integrate self-positions in a transcultural context, by adopting a pluralist theoretical and methodological approach that includes both Western post-modern viewpoints and ancient Chinese philosophical ideas. The book starts with stories of two second-generation Chinese young people and their mothers' life experiences in the UK, which can be seen as an epitome of individuals living in the modern and complex environment of the time. Using social constructionist viewpoints, it then analyzes the overt interaction between the individual and outside environment and interprets the recessive interaction, such as the individual’s psychological response to the outside environment, which might be unknown to him or herself, using the psychodynamic approach based on object relations theory and other psychoanalytic concepts, such as defense mechanisms. The book uses Confucian philosophy to show how Chinese people think about the relation between other people and themselves and also integrates different and even opposing theories and viewpoints from Taoist philosophy. This creative book provides a theoretical and practical approach to explore the conception of “self” and the way in which individuals construct their self-positions in a complex context. Combining cutting-edge Western psycho-social viewpoints and ancient Chinese philosophy, it appeals to readers interested in “self,” psycho-social approaches, psychoanalytic viewpoints and Chinese philosophy.",Psychology,186,N/A,0,en

Promoting Healing and Resilience in People with Cancer: A Nursing Perspective,Mary Grossman,Springer Nature,2022-12-08,"This is the first Nursing book on cancer care designed around a conceptual model of whole person care. Key concepts are stress, healing, resilience and health. As a clinical model, nursing goals, desired outcomes, key concepts and proposed psychosocial interventions with patients and family caregivers, advance the practice of clinical nursing toward a more comprehensive understanding of the whole person with cancer and their loved ones. As a model for teaching nursing students about chronic illness, it provides a scientific basis for students to learn how to assess and care for the whole person and his loved one. As a model for clinical research in the field of cancer care, it serves as a predicate for the development, evaluation and interpretation of clinical interventions. The model is a dynamic framework that both informs and is informed by research findings. It is hoped that future research findings will reveal the optimal combination of interventions to provide comprehensive care across clinical contexts. With a patient-centred humanistic focus anchored by the quality of the nurse patient and family caregiver relationships, it is hoped that the nurse's technical, procedural and medical expertise may complement rather than define the nurse's approach to the whole patient and family. The book is structured to facilitate the reader's easy access to needed information. Each chapter examines a key concept of the model, and is organized around an introduction, learning objectives, definitions, and relevant research findings that serve as the scientific predicate for suggested interventions discussed in Part 4, Nursing approaches. Clinical and personal anecdotes, tables and figures illustrate the concepts under discussion. Nurse practitioners, clinic nurse specialists, nursing professors, graduate students, and nurse researchers may find this book a useful reference for conceptualizing whole person care, and for determining relevant interventions that promote healing, resilience and health. But it is also relevant for family doctors and fourth year students learning to care for the whole person with a chronic illness.",Medical,670,N/A,0,en
"Death, Dying and Bereavement","Cecilia Lai Wan Chan, Amy Yin Man Chow",Hong Kong University Press,2006-01-01,"Fear marks the boundary between the known and the unknown. Some Chinese people believe that talking about death will increase the likelihood of occurrence. Also, by talking about death, evil spirits will be attracted to haunt people. In facing death, individual response is inevitably moulded by the values, attitudes, and beliefs of one's culture. Despite the large Chinese emigrant population in major cities in the world, available material in English on death, dying and bereavement among Chinese people is scarce. As Hong Kong is a place where East meets West, most professionals working in the field of death, dying and bereavement adapt knowledge from the West to their practice with the Chinese population. The intention of this volume is to consolidate and disseminate valuable practical wisdom with professionals in the local and international communities who serve Chinese patients and their family members. Both Editors are from the Department of Social Work and Social Administration, University of Hong Kong. Professor Cecilia Lai Wan Chan has done extensive research in psychosocial oncology, behavioral health, grief, loss and bereavement.

Tourism and Citizenship,"Raoul Bianchi, Marcus Stephenson",Routledge,2014-02-24,"More than sixty years since the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights first enshrined the right to freedom of movement in an international charter of human rights, the issue of mobility and the right to tourism itself have become increasingly significant areas of scholarly interest and political debate. However, despite the fact that cross-border travel implies certain citizenship rights as well as the material capacity to travel, the manifold intersections between tourism and citizenship have not received the attention they deserve in the literature. This book endeavours to fill this gap by being the first to fully examine the role of tourism in wider society through a critically-informed sociological reflection on the unfolding relationships between international tourism and distinct renderings of citizenship, with particular emphasis on the ideological and political alignments between the freedom of movement and the right to travel. The text weaves its analysis of citizenship and travel in the context of addressing large-scale societal transformations engendered by globalization, neoliberalism and the geopolitical realignments between states, as well as comprehending the internal reconfiguring of the relationship between citizens and states themselves. By doing so, it focuses on key themes including: tourism and social citizenship rights; race, culture and minority rights; states, markets and the freedom of movement; tourism, peace and geo-politics; consumerism and class; and, ethical tourism, global citizenship and cosmopolitanism. The book concludes that the advancement of genuinely democratic and just forms of tourism must be commensurate with demands for distributive justice and a democratic politics of mobility encompassing all of humanity. This timely and significant contribution to the sociology and politics of international tourism through the lens of citizenship is a must read for students and scholars in both in the fields of tourism and social science. The royalties received from this book will be donated to the International Porter Protection Group.",Business & Economics,294,N/A,0,en

Resilience and Aging,"Andrew V. Wister, Theodore D. Cosco",Springer Nature,2021-01-04,"Older aged adults face many adversities over the later life course. This edited volume will address the ways in which seniors bounce back from different types and combinations of adversity – termed “resilience”. While research has been accumulating that identifies inherent abilities and external resources needed to adapt and navigate stress-inducing experiences among aging and older adults, gaps remain in understanding the unique elements and processes of resilience. A series of chapters included in this book will address several overarching questions: why do some older individuals/families/communities adapt to adversity better than others; what are modifiable behavioral protective/risk factors related to resilience; and how can we foster resilience at the individual/community level and which approaches show the most promise? The spectrum of aging-related challenges and responses addressed in this book include: mental health; physical/functional health problems; multimorbidity; socio-economic deprivation; social isolation and loneliness; cultural dimensions of loneliness; housing/homelessness problems; and environmental disasters. This book presents cutting-edge science at the conceptual, methodological, empirical and practice levels applied to emerging resilience sub-fields in gerontology. It will also present potential areas of future research, policy and practice linked to these areas. During a period of the most rapid population aging in the US, Canada and many other nations, coupled with heightened global socio-political change, extending our knowledge of resilience will help society to make important adjustments to maximize health and wellness of older individuals. Supporting and enhancing resilience through technological, social and/or community-level advances in geroscience will help those facing adversity to thrive by harnessing, stretching, and leveraging a wide array of potential resources. The promotion of healthier older populations has far-reaching consequences for health care and social/community support systems, both in terms of public health including pandemic response, and the development and implementation of innovations in treatment and practice guidelines.",Family & Relationships,282,N/A,0,en

"Social Work, Mental Health, and Public Policy in Diverse Contexts",Sheying Chen,Springer Nature,2023-09-30,"The discipline of social policy, oftentimes deemed a part of social work as a profession, was born in the West. Unlike social policy that started with the post-war idea of a welfare state in the mid-20th century, social work traces its roots to individual casework pioneered by the Charity Organization Society (COS), early social administration including state-wide poverty relief (an advocacy effort of the COS but with deep roots in the English Poor Laws of the 17th century), and social action emphasizing political activities to improve social conditions (originating from the Settlement House Movement which began in the 1880s). The development of social work is historically intertwined with that of public welfare, philanthropy, and charity and is an inherently international subject. This conception is broader than “international social work” as a discrete field of professional practice, which crosses geopolitical borders and all levels of social and economic organizations with a focus on development. However, each nation has a story of its own in terms of professionalization of social work in the evolution of public welfare and philanthropic/charitable undertaking within its particular economic, political, social, and cultural settings. A wide-ranging and in-depth study of various (especially non-Western) country cases is essential to an adequate, comprehensive understanding of the social work profession, which is also a basic requirement of its value of diversity. China is undoubtedly an important case with the largest population on earth. It’s also unique in view of so-called Chinese characteristics which are sometimes fundamentally different from other (particularly Western) societies. It’s even intriguing given the country’s lengthy, complex history and its recent, rapid rise to a global superpower with a claim of national goals and core values that seem to be rather considerable to social work as a helping profession. Therefore, any significant lessons learned from the Chinese experiences would help with a better international understanding and further advancement of social work and public welfare at a global scale.",Psychology,232,N/A,0,en

Here is also a historical survey, beginning with the Alexandrean Period, of the various esoteric currents such as Christian Kabbalah, Theosophy, Alchemy, Rosicrucianism, and Hermeticism. Common characteristics of these currents are the notion of universal interdependency and the experience of spiritual transformation. The author establishes a rigorous methodology; provides clarifying definitions of such key terms as ""gnosis,"" ""theosophy,"" ""occultism,"" and ""Hermeticism;"" and offers analysis of contemporary esotericism based on three distinct pathways. The second half of the book presents a series of studies on several important figures, works, and movements in Western esotericism—studies devoted to some of the most characteristic and illuminating aspects that this form of thought has taken, such as theosophical speculations on androgyny, rosicrucian literature, and Masonic symbolism.

Psychosocial Oncology and Palliative Care in Hong Kong,"Richard Fielding, Cecilia Lai-wan Chan",Hong Kong University Press,1999-11-01,"As the evidence-base for clinical practice in the management of life-threatening diseases and care at the end of life increases, it is apparent that psychosocial factors play a most profound role, influencing outcomes at every level from quality of life and satisfaction with clinical services through to duration of survival and mortality. This book documents some, but by no means all, of the developments that have occurred in the past decade in the area of psychosocial oncology and palliative care in Hong Kong. Contributions describing interventions by practitioners involved in service development in nursing, social work and clinical psychology, are complemented by chapters describing academic research and theoretical perspectives. The unique cultural mix of Hong Kong is given rich emphasis in the adaptations made by practitioners and academics to the interventions and theoretical issues outlined. As both a documentation of the efforts of some of those who helped psychosocial oncology and palliative care evolve in Hong Kong, and as a reflection of the need to more critically evaluate the impact of intervention efforts in health care, this volume provides a valuable resource. Nurses, social workers, psychologists and doctors involved in delivering or planning cancer treatment or palliative care will find this book useful. This book challenges many attitudes prevalent in Hong Kong and will, we hope, begin to break some of the taboos that continue to generate unnecessary suffering among the people cared for by our health care systems. The valuable experience documented in these pages can help others build the next generation of services to those with life-threatening illness and those at the end of life.",Medical,324,N/A,0,en
Renovation of the Heart,Dallas Willard,Tyndale House,2014-02-27,"As Christians, we know that we are new creations in Jesus. So we try to act differently, hoping this will make us more like Him. But changing our outward behavior doesn’t change our hearts. Only by God’s grace can we be transformed internally. Renovation of the Heart lays a biblical foundation for understanding what best-selling author Dallas Willard calls the “transformation of the spirit”—a divine process that “brings every element in our being, working from inside out, into harmony with the will of God.” This fresh approach to spiritual growth explains the biblical reasons why Christians need to undergo change in six aspects of life: thought, feeling, will, body, social context, and soul. Willard also outlines a general pattern of transformation in each area, not as a sterile formula but as a practical process that you can follow without the guilt or perfectionism so many Christians wrestle with. Don’t settle for complacency. Accept the challenge Renovation of the Heart offers to become an intentional apprentice of Jesus Christ, changing daily as you walk with Him.",Religion,381,N/A,0,en

The Primal Wound,"John Firman, Ann Gila",SUNY Press,1997-04-25,"Argues that a primal wounding of the human spirit occurs in earliest human life that disrupts fundamental relationships and leads to anxiety, loneliness, and alienation; and shows how this wounding can be redeemed through therapy and through living one's life differently. To many of us, modern life is a headlong rush to avoid dark feelings that threaten to disrupt our lives at every turn. In order to block the surging tide of this hidden level of experience, we become enthralled with violence, sex, and mass media and addicted to alcohol, drugs, and power, and we compulsively strive for romance, success, and control. All of this, according to the authors, can be traced to the primal wound--a dark specter of isolation, abandonment, and alienation haunting human life. The primal wound is the result of a violation we all suffer in various ways, beginning in early childhood and continuing throughout life. Because we are treated not as individual, unique human beings but as objects, our intrinsic, authentic sense of self is annihilated. This primal wounding breaks the fundamental relationships that form the fabric of human existence: the relationship to oneself, to other people, to the natural world, and to a sense of transpersonal meaning symbolized in concepts such as the Divine, the Ground of Being, and Ultimate Reality. In this book, Firman and Gila apply object relations theory, self-psychology, transpersonal psychology, and psychosynthesis to the issues of psychological wounding, healing, and growth and show how this wounding can be redeemed through therapy and through changing one's way of living. ""Firman and Gila integrate important material from diverse schools of psychology and then expand it with their personal touch. The Primal Wound presents a scholarly--yet understandable to the educated lay person--description of some of the important dynamics of psychological wounding from a broad perspective, while also going deep into the soul and even exploring our relationship to God. There is little available on this topic and in the area of trauma psychology."" -- Charles Whitfield, M.D., author of Memory and Abuse: Remembering and Healing the Wounds of Trauma ""I believe this book's central thesis to be highly provocative and important. Its strength is that it uses the idea of the 'primal wound' as a focus for a diverse collection of ideas from various sectors of the psychological and transpersonal literature. This kind of integrative scholarly work is very valuable. "" -- John Suler, author of Contemporary Psychoanalysis and Eastern Thought John Firman and Ann Gila are teachers, authors, and psychotherapists in private practice in Palo Alto, California. Both were trained in psychosynthesis in the early 1970s, and Firman trained with its founder, Roberto Assagioli.

21-Day Keto Magic,Dr. Michael Mosley,Hachette UK,2022-04-05,"See results in three weeks, with a revolutionary keto diet program from Dr. Michael Mosley, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Fast Diet. Recent studies have shown that a keto diet not only produces significant—and rapid—weight loss, but also has many other benefits for long-term health. But it must be done the right way. In 21-Day Keto Magic, Dr. Mosley presents the latest science on the ketogenic diet—a diet high in fat and protein and very low in carbs—explaining how it works and why it is so good for you. The aim of a keto regime is to kickstart a process called ketosis, whereby your body goes from burning sugar to burning fat for fuel. Flipping this metabolic switch has the added advantage of making you feel less hungry, which makes the diet highly motivating and relatively easy to sustain. 21-Day Keto Magic offers a detailed, step-by-step program, along with easy tips and clear advice on which foods support ketosis and which ones stop it, how to tell if you are producing ketones, and how to ensure that you're following the diet safely. There are also 50 delicious recipes from Michael's wife, Dr. Clare Bailey, as well as shopping lists, weekly meal planners, and all the other tools you need to ditch stubborn fat and transform your health for life.",Health & Fitness,241,N/A,0,en

Eat Like a Human,Bill Schindler,Hachette UK,2022-01-13,"Vegan or carnivore? Vegetarian or gluten-free? Keto or Mediterranean? Fasting or Paleo? Our relationship to food is filled with confusion and insecurity. Every day we hear about a new ingredient that is good or bad, a new diet that promises everything. But the truth is that none of those labels matter. The secret to becoming healthier, losing weight, living a pain-free and energetic life and healing the planet has nothing to do with counting calories, reducing portion sizes or feeling deprived - the key is re-learning how to eat like a human. This means finding food that is as nutrient-dense as possible, and preparing that food using methods that release those nutrients and make them safe and bioavailable to our bodies, which is exactly what allowed our ancestors, millions of years ago, to not only live but thrive. Archaeologist and primitive technologist Dr Bill Schindler draws on cutting-edge science and a lifetime of research to show readers how to live like modern 'hunter-gatherers' by using the same strategies our ancestors used - as well as techniques still practiced by many cultures around the world - to make food as safe, nutritious, bioavailable and delicious as possible. With each chapter dedicated to a specific food group, in-depth explanations of different foods and cooking techniques and concrete takeaways, as well as 75+ recipes, Eat Like a Human will permanently change the way you think about food, and help you live a happier, healthier, and more connected life.",Health & Fitness,375,N/A,0,en

You Are the Placebo,Dr. Joe Dispenza,"Hay House, Inc",2015-09-08,"Is it possible to heal by thought alone—without drugs or surgery? The truth is that it happens more often than you might expect. In You Are the Placebo, best-selling author, international speaker, chiropractor, and renowned researcher of epigenetics, quantum physics, & neuroscience, Dr. Joe Dispenza shares numerous documented cases of those who reversed cancer, heart disease, depression, crippling arthritis, and even the tremors of Parkinson’s disease by believing in a placebo. Similarly, Dr. Joe tells of how others have gotten sick and even died the victims of a hex or voodoo curse—or after being misdiagnosed with a fatal illness. Belief can be so strong that pharmaceutical companies use double- and triple-blind randomized studies to try to exclude the power of the mind over the body when evaluating new drugs. “In his paradigm-altering book, You Are the Placebo, Dr. Joe Dispenza catapults us beyond thinking of the placebo effect as an anomaly. Through 12 concise chapters that read like a true-life scientific thriller, Dispenza gives us rock-solid reasons to accept the game-changer of our lives: that the placebo effect is actually us, proving to ourselves the greatest possibilities of healing, miracles, and longevity!

He asks the question: ""Is it possible to teach the principles of the placebo, and without relying on any external substance, produce the same internal changes in a person’s health and ultimately in his or her life?"" Then he shares scientific evidence (including color brain scans) of amazing healings from his workshops, in which participants learn his consciousness shifting model of personal transformation, based on practical applications of the so-called placebo effect. The book ends with a ""how-to"" calming meditation for changing limiting beliefs and mental perceptions that hold us back—the first step in healing. You Are the Placebo combines the latest research in neuroscience, biology, psychology, hypnosis, behavioral conditioning, and quantum physics to demystify the workings of the placebo effect . . . and show how the seemingly impossible can become possible. “I discovered that if I could teach people the scientific model of transformation (bringing in a little quantum physics to help them understand the science of possibility); combine it with the latest information in neuroscience, neuroendocrinology, epigenetics, and psychoneuroimmunology; give them the right kind of instruction; and provide the opportunity to apply that information, then they would experience a transformation... This book is about: empowering you to realize that you have all the biological and neurological machinery to do exactly that. My goal is to demystify these concepts with the new science of the way things really are so that it is within the reach of more people to change their internal states in order to create positive changes in their health and in their external world.” — Dr. Joe Dispenza","Body, Mind & Spirit",393,N/A,0,en

Choice Centered Relating and the Tarot,Gail Fairfield,Weiser Books,2000-10-15,"Every aspect of our lives, from the most easily recognizable--relationships, material success, health, security, work--to much more subtle and often seemingly fixed subjects, such as truth, wisdom, spirit, and natural laws, constantly flows through ever-changing patterns and cycles. So, if the universe is flexible and evolving, and if our understanding of it changes with each new theory or model, what is real? How can we guide ourselves through the seeming chaos of living? How do we find a center, or grounding, in the middle of it all? How can we experience this constancy of change from the exciting and positive position of choice instead of the often terrifying helplessness found in the maze of fate? In Choice Centered Relating and the Tarot, Fairfield provides easily identifiable examples of choice centered approaches to life experience. She quickly faces the fact that many events in our lives are beyond our control, or choice, and then leads us to the empowering realization that we can learn the art of conscious action and reaction. Our center of control is not outside--but within--and with deepening understanding and steady practice, we can learn to access this center and nurture its growth. From this choice centered orientation we learn how to frame relationship-related questions and interpret the guidance provided by the symbolism of the tarot. The book is filled with thought-provoking questions and guides to interpretation using a wide variety of sample layouts. Any of the excellent tarot decks currently available can be used to awaken this life-changing approach.","Body, Mind & Spirit",364,N/A,0,en

"Authenticity, Passion, and Advocacy",Thomas E. Malewitz,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2020-07-08,"Adolescence can be best summarized as a time of authenticity, passion, and advocacy. As adolescents start maturing, on a life journey that leads them away from dependence on their parents to becoming an independent adult, they often seek out honest and transparent mentors to learn from and trust for wisdom and guidance. Although Thomas Merton, the celebrated spiritual author and Cistercian monk, is better remembered for his writings on ecumenism, nonviolence, and advocacy, he also had several documented correspondences with adolescents throughout his life. By examining these artifacts, it is clear that Thomas Merton had great insight into the spiritual needs and challenges of adolescents. Throughout his life, Merton’s authentic struggles often parallel the searching nature that defines adolescent spirituality. Through scholarship and practice this book will explore how the life and writings of Thomas Merton may serve as a guide and bridge for ministers of adolescents, and will offer some practical suggestions for minsters, educators, and parents on topics affecting contemporary adolescents, through the lens of Thomas Merton’s life and writings.",Religion,209,N/A,0,en

The Spirit of Project Management,"Judi Neal, Alan Harpham",Routledge,2017-03-02,"Projects have always been essentially human endeavours. Large modern projects are generally highly complex, fraught with technical difficulties and supported by diverse, often apparently conflicted stakeholders. The spirituality that originally defined some of the great construction projects of the classical era surely has a role in project management today. The Spirit of Project Management explains the context for spirituality in projects and explores how it can be used to create a larger sense of purpose and achievement; to help encourage an esprit de corps amongst all those involved; to act as a touchstone for ethical and sustainable decision-making. This is a very pragmatic book. The first part includes an explanation and a variety of useful models for understanding the significance and value of spirituality in projects. Judi Neal and Alan Harpham devote the second part of the book to help you integrate these ideas into your day-to-day management of projects. Thus there are chapters on spirituality from the perspective of the individual, the project team, the project organization and even project management within a sustainable world framework. Read this book, use the ideas to help you articulate your projects; engage and sustain your project team and your stakeholders; and frame how you work in terms of your organisation, society and the environment.",Business & Economics,135,N/A,0,en
Potentiating Health and the Crisis of the Immune System,"S. Fulder, A. Mizrahi, N. Sheinman",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-06-29,"With all the enormous resources that are invested in medicine, it is sometimes a mystery why there is so much sickness still in evidence. Our life span, though higher than at any time in history, has now leveled off and has not significantly increased in the last two generations. There is a one-third increase in long-term illness in the last 20 years and a 44% increase in cancer incidence, which are not related to demographic issues. In some modern countries, the level of morbidity (defined as days off work because of sickness) has increased by two thirds in this time. Despite $1 trillion spent on cancer research in 20 years, the ""War On Cancer"" has recently been pronounced a complete failure by the u. s. President's Cancer Panel. Evidently we still have a long way to go. The goal of ""Health for All by the Year 2000"" as the World Health Organization has put it, is another forgotten dream. As ever, the answer will be found in breaking out of the old philosophical patterns and discovering the new, as yet unacceptable concepts. The problems of medicine today require a Kuhnian breakthrough into new paradigms, and new ways of thinking. And these new ways will not be mere variations of the old, but radical departures. This book, and the conference upon which it was based, is part of a search for these new pathways.",Medical,289,N/A,0,en

Psychotherapy and Aphasia,"Kate Meredith, Giles Yeates",Routledge,2019-12-05,"Psychotherapy and Aphasia: Interventions for Emotional Wellbeing and Relationships is an exciting international collaboration among clinical neuropsychologists, speech and language therapists and family therapists that details a range of innovative psychotherapeutic interventions to enable people with communication disorders and their families to access meaningful support. People with aphasia and other acquired communication disorders can face significant challenges accessing emotional support. Many traditional forms of psychotherapy are based on spoken language, rendering it inaccessible for many people with communication disorders. But the book details a range of techniques that move away from reliance on spoken language, including total communication strategies, the use of meaningful objects, experiential process, group experience and mind-body practices. Featuring clinical examples which cover a range of stroke and neurology service contexts, the book includes contributions from a range of therapeutic models; from speech and language therapy and family therapy to clinical neuropsychology, cognitive-behavioural, systemic, narrative and mind-body traditions. It therefore provides clinicians with a wide-range of practical and theoretical tools to explore when supporting survivors who experience psychological distress during rehabilitation. It is the only book aimed at both speech and language therapists and psychotherapists, and will open up new pathways to support.",Psychology,185,N/A,0,en

"Art Therapy and the Neuroscience of Relationships, Creativity, and Resiliency: Skills and Practices (Norton Series on Interpersonal Neurobiology)","Noah Hass-Cohen, Joanna Clyde Findlay",W. W. Norton & Company,2015-07-06,"Presenting a neuroscientifically aware approach to art therapy. Art Therapy and the Neuroscience of Relationships, Creativity, and Resiliency offers a comprehensive integration of art therapy and interpersonal neurobiology. It showcases the Art Therapy Relational Neuroscience (ATR-N) theoretical and clinical approach, and demonstrates how it can be used to help clients with autobiographical memory, reflecting and creating, touch and space, meaning-making, emotions, and dealing with long-term stress and trauma. The ATR-N approach, first developed by Noah Hass-Cohen, is comprised of six principles: Creative Embodiment, Relational Resonating, Expressive Communicating, Adaptive Responding, Transformative Integrating, and Empathizing and Compassion (CREATE). The chapters in this book are organized around these CREATE principles, demonstrating the dynamic interplay of brain and bodily systems during art therapy. Each chapter begins with an overview of one CREATE principle, which is then richly illustrated with therapeutic artwork and intrapersonal reflections. The subsequent discussion of the related relational neuroscience elucidates how the ATR-N work is grounded in research and evidence-based theory. The last section of each chapter, which is devoted to clinical skills and applications, integrates practices and approaches across all six of the CREATE principles, demonstrating how therapeutic art making can help people decipher the functional mystery of their relational nervous system, enhance their emotive and cognitive abilities, and increase the motivation to learn novel concepts and participate in a meaningful social discourse.",Psychology,501,N/A,0,en

A Pastoral Counselor's Model for Wellness in the Workplace: Psychergonomics takes the concept of ergonomics beyond physical and environmental concerns to include a holistic interconnectedness of mind, body, and spirit. This unique book examines how psychosocial factors like family, conflict, emotional stress, addiction, and financial pressures can impact an employee's health and well-being. It incorporates a new paradigm of health care into wellness in the corporate setting, adding a new dimension to human health and safety. A Pastoral Counselor's Model for Wellness in the Workplace explores the workplace reality that illness and injury are not just the result of simple linear causes. Companies have data to determine how much they spend on insurance and worker's compensation claims but no way to measure the effects absenteeism, productivity, quality of work, and employee morale have on operating expenses. Using a holistic model of understanding, employers may now consider that an injury may be the result of an employee's depression, an accident might be caused by substance abuse, and an illness could be brought on by being worried “sick.” A Pastoral Counselor's Model for Wellness in the Workplace examines how employees—and employers—can be affected by: money troubles marriage problems depression grief stress conflicts addictions alcoholism anger A Pastoral Counselor's Model for Wellness in the Workplace: Psychergonomics is an essential resource for all helping professions, particularly in the areas of mental health and addiction.

Similar in spirit to the Jubilee year described in scripture, retirement can be a time of transformation and exploration, of freedom to try on new versions of yourself and new paths of service. In that spirit, clergy can embrace creative transformation in their relationships, neighborhoods, religious communities, and politics. No longer tethered to the politics and administrative duties of congregational leadership, they can now freely commit themselves to relational, intellectual, and spiritual growth. They can also focus on personal, community, and planetary healing and transformation. Retired clergy can become sages and wisdom givers sharing their insights and energy with seminarians and novice pastors, congregations, and communities. Bringing together the fruits of conversations with more than 100 retired clergy, theological reflection, and spiritual practices, this text provides a way forward for clergy considering retirement and retired clergy.

The volume sets the stage by establishing an overarching framework that positions the philosophy of translation as a distinct subdiscipline within translation studies. It then reviews existing scholarship on translation in light of Henri Bergson's philosophy of time, proposing an expanded conceptualization of translation. Using this foundation, Basalamah explores a variety of topics at the intersection of translation and time from transdisciplinary perspectives, including epistemology, consciousness, mediations through image and art, the mind/body problem, time in phenomenology, and ethical and religious considerations. As a pioneering work on the temporal characteristic of translation, this book will be of interest to students and scholars in translation studies, especially those focused on its philosophical treatment.",Language Arts & Disciplines,257,N/A,0,en

Crowe,2024-07-02,"Historically, martial arta have been regarded as a means of developing both physical and mental capabilities, which is a fundamental aspect of any self-defence system. Discipline, rigorous physical training and, above all, a vision of war and the destruction of the enemy by any means have accompanied the practice of many of the styles. However, new trends have been emerging in the ever-changing world of martial arts. It should be noted that any style of martial art can be bene cial for achieving physical and spiritual growth. However, the martial art known as Aikido is one that has been developing in Puerto Rico and many Latin American countries. This is particularly relevant to those seeking a philosophy of life, as humanity is moving towards new social, political and economic frontiers. Our future aspirations include integration and peaceful social coexistence. These aspirations align with the view that violence should not be used as a mechanism for solving problems between human beings. The social cost of violence is too high for it to represent an answer for the future. Aikido is completely in tune with these aspirations and the times. Aikido is a process by which we achieve a state of harmony, first with ourselves and then with everything around us. We cannot give that which we do not possess.",Sports & Recreation,124,N/A,0,en

Triathlon - It HURTS,Gary Smith & Justin Roberts,Troubador Publishing Ltd,2016-03-28,"Winner of the 2015 Running Awards, voted Best Book 2015. In October 2012, over 1000 people applied to take part in a university research study to assess how normal, recreationally active people cope with the demands of training for their first IRON distance triathlon a 3.8km swim, followed by 180km of cycling and finishing with the mere matter of a 42.2km marathon run. This book is a collection of the tales from the people within the team affectionately known as the HURTS team, an acronym for ‘Hertfordshire University Research Triathlon Study’. Their individual goal was to inspire others to dream big and to live out those dreams, whether it be a triathlon or not. However, as a cohort, they wished to raise awareness and funds to help find a cure for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a debilitating and fatal disorder. Their collective goal was to support Harrison’s Fund, set up in 2012 to support breakthrough research leading to positive interventions and ultimately a cure for muscular dystrophy worldwide. Triathlon – It HURTS is an inspiring story of what normal people can achieve when challenged. This book will appeal to those looking to learn more about the successes and harsh realities of training for a triathlon, as well as those who want an uplifting story of human achievement. “A wonderful book of inspiration from those who participate in the triathlon ...

Sentipensante (Sensing / Thinking) Pedagogy,Laura I. Rendón,Taylor & Francis,2023-07-03,"“Challenging, inspiring, beautifully written, and unusual, this book calls readers to find ways to link mind and heart -- thinking and feeling -- to transform teaching and learning in higher education. Laura Rendón has illustrated how one can unite one's deep beliefs, values, and feelings, with one's keen analytical and intellectual abilities...an important, thought-provoking, and unique addition to the literature on teaching, learning, and the academic life.”—The Review of Higher Education on the first editionThis new and expanded edition of the acclaimed and successful book by nationally-recognized student advocate, activist scholar and contemplative educator, Laura Rendón, will surely find new audiences who are eager to create teaching and learning environments where the learner is fully present and engaged using the full capacities of mind, body and senses; and where the learning experience can be simultaneously subjective and objective, a view which challenges the privileged notion that only reason and objective modes of learning are valid. While the pedagogy can be employed with all students, Rendón provides support for faculty who work with low-income, first-generation, and racially-minoritized learners. Sentipensante Pedagogy benefits all students through holistically meeting their emotional needs and quest for knowledge, and simultaneously fostering their civic sense, critical consciousness, and community engagement.Rendón offers an inspirational and contemplative pedagogy that leverages student assets and addresses the rhythmic balance and interconnection between intellectual, social, emotional, and inner-life skill development. The book blends academic discussions about pedagogy and diverse world views as it inspires a new generation of faculty and staff to develop blueprints for democratic, decolonial teaching and learning environments.The sensing / thinking approach has been successfully adopted and adapted in courses and seminars across many academic disciplines, including STEM, in two- and four-year colleges institutions. Several colleges and universities have created centers around contemplative studies and pedagogy with applications extending to the K-12 education arena.As with adopting any new pedagogical approach, planning and thought needs to be given on how to integrate its reflective and creative elements with course content. This book offers inspiration and guidance for faculty who want to holistically address the needs, aspirations, and individual development of their students",Education,155,N/A,0,en

"Loss, Survive, Thrive",Meryl Hershey Beck,Rowman & Littlefield,2019-11-22,"No one is prepared for the loss of a child. No one. It feels completely unnatural for children to predecease their parents. Although it is not widely known, each year there are over 135,000 under 40-year-old deaths in the U.S. alone. And, according to one study, 19% of parents outlive their children—often carrying the weight of horrendous grief to their own graves. “Isolated and alone” is how parents often describe the grief process. Well-meaning friends and family members usually rush to their side… in the beginning. Once the floral arrangements have wilted, and the dinners from caring friends diminish, there isn’t really much that can be said to bring comfort to a suffering parent, especially if those friends haven’t experienced it themselves. Unfortunately, when these caring friends do bring up the loss, quite often they say the wrong things. Loss, Survive, Thrive offers a lifeline of hope. Each chapter is an inspirational story written by a parent who also experienced the agony of losing a child, reclaimed his/her vitality, and is now living a fulfilling life. Every story is authentic and heartfelt, designed to uplift and inspire. The collective authors reach out through the pages to virtually hold hands with those who are suffering. We, the contributors, have all been there. We know their pain, and we know about survival. And now, through our stories, we offer comfort and support in helping them get through the toughest time of their lives. Bereaved parents share an unspeakable bond. And Loss, Survive, Thrive imparts insight from what’s likely the only voices that grieving parents can hear—others who have walked in their shoes. This book is a giant step toward healing the grieving heart.",Family & Relationships,351,N/A,0,en

In Search of the Healing Spirit,Nass Cannon,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2023-06-29,"The late Dr. Nass Cannon Jr. (MD) was a physician for the indigent poor for over forty years and an internationally renowned scholar of the theologian and monk, Thomas Merton. In Search of the Healing Spirit follows a narrative arc across several essays of Dr. Cannon’s analysis and reflections on life and Thomas Merton’s theological contributions. First articulated by Dr. Cannon at the outset of his journey to serve the poor, the guiding principle of the book is an exploration of what it means to be broken and called to heal each other, ourselves, and the world. As Dr. Cannon writes, “I am a physician who views his root identity as one called to heal. Yet, I experience myself as broken, as one admonished by the phrase, ‘Physician, heal thyself.’ Perhaps you, too . . . experience yourself as a broken healer. Let us together explore some notions regarding the healer as broken, examine the nature of healing, and consider the relationship of the healer to one healed.” From this position as a broken healer, which implicitly embodies Merton’s contemplative spirituality, Dr. Cannon’s meditations over the course of his life of service increasingly weave in Merton’s contributions in search of the true self on such pressing—and universal—topics as grief and loss, the eternal nature and healing power of love, and to do what we can for each other with the time we are given. Dr. Cannon’s writings engage a twenty-first-century audience with insights—drawn from fifty years of study—that can aid lay persons, clergy, and academics to better understand what it means to be a broken person and through that brokenness to heal themselves and the world.",Religion,167,N/A,0,en

"Living Your Life, While Trusting God with Theirs",Mary Lynn Ludwig,Outskirts Press,2014-08-12,"Do you have a teenager or adult child whose difficulties seem to be preventing you from living your life? We are not responsible when they choose the wrong path. We are not responsible to carry them if they take drugs or commit crimes. Even when they have a disease such as mental illness, we cannot carry this load for them. Do you feel guilty as if you can’t do enough to help? Do you question what you didn’t do right or what you did wrong? Are you compelled to somehow make this right? You can be freed from this false belief and start living your life. God does not hold you responsible. Galatians 6:5 says, for each one should carry his own load. Taking on others’ responsibilities is not being a good person; it is enabling the person and preventing them from growing as a person. It is important to know what you are responsible for and what you are not. My son Bradley had paranoid schizophrenia. It was serious and I had to learn new ways to cope and help him. Much of what I needed to learn was to give it to God and then find people to help me. After ten years of Brad in several apartments, group homes and the mental health complex, he passed – my son died due to his medication that ruined his heart. I stand only by the grace of God. In this book, I impart to you what has helped me.",Family & Relationships,217,N/A,0,en

Buddha Nature Now,Henry Landry LSC BGT,Author House,2007-06-25,"From the 1950's onward the Buddhist philosophy has grown in our Western world. This philosophy underlies one of the oldest spiritual practices on earth, the faith of compassion and peaceful means. The reason for its existence is to enable all people to Realize a Personal Way to end suffering. It is complex, yet simple and profound. It offers important principles to the higher Worlds of wisdom and the meaning of enlightenment. While scholars differ on his birth date, it is suggested the historical Buddha of India, Shakyamuni, was an awakened One, almost 3,000 years ago. His time on earth is known as the Former Day of the Law. In the Middle ages the Great Scholar, Teacher and Chinese Priest,Tien Tai ChiI [538 - 597 c.e.] of China, brought together all the various Buddhas Sutra or wisdom teachings and brought them into a encyclopaedic and academic whole. Going beyond the theory and doctrine, he declared the Buddhas highest teachings were to be found in theScripture of the Lotus Blossom of the Fine Dharma. This greatly affected the Mahayana Tradition. He then went on to explain how the universe works, in the concept of NOW, Ichinen Sanzen. This time is known as the Middle Day of the Law. In 1222 c.e. [common era ], a fishermans son was born. His name was Zennichi-maro. Like many first sons of his day, at the age of 12 he was sent off to learn and be the spiritual guide for the family. After attaining status as a Priest he spent many years studying the suffering and plague that was ravishing Japan in his time. He studied all the various Buddhist doctrine and theology realizing that Shakyamuni of India, Tien Tai of China and Dengyo Daishi [767-822 c.e.] of his own country were correct in their predictions that a time would arrive when the Buddha-way would be open to all Beings regardless of their lifestyle, culture or country. The time was and is our current Latter Day of the Law. Within the pages of this offering you will find the tools and actual proof needed for widening the doors of your Spiritual Health. At the very least you will be One with the Wheel of Knowledge of the Buddha-way enabling. You to have an informed opinion.

Anthroposophical Medicine,"Michael Evans, Iain Rodger",HarperThorsons,1992,"While conventional medicine analyzes disease in terms of cellular disturbances and prescribes drugs to counteract physical symptoms, anthroposophical medicine adds a spiritual image of the human being.

Where conventional treatment can only suppress the symptoms, these treatments extend the possibilities of a cure and reduce the need to use conventional drugs.

Body & Soul,"J. P. Moreland, Scott B. Rae",InterVarsity Press,2009-09-20,"While most people throughout history have believed that we are both physical and spiritual beings, the rise of science has called into question the existence of the soul. Many now argue that neurophysiology demonstrates the radical dependence, indeed, identity, between mind and brain. Advances in genetics and in mapping human DNA, some say, show there is no need for the hypothesis of body-soul dualism. Even many Christian intellectuals have come to view the soul as a false Greek concept that is outdated and unbiblical. Concurrent with the demise of dualism has been the rise of advanced medical technologies that have brought to the fore difficult issues at both edges of life. Central to questions about abortion, fetal research, reproductive techologies, cloning and euthanasia is our understanding of the nature of human personhood, the reality of life after death and the value of ethical or religious knowledge as compared to scientific knowledge. In this careful treatment, J. P. Moreland and Scott B. Rae argue that the rise of these problems alongside the demise of Christian dualism is no coincidence. They therefore employ a theological realism to meet these pressing issues, and to present a reasonable and biblical depiction of human nature as it impinges upon critical ethical concerns. This vigorous philosophical and ethical defense of human nature as body and soul, regardless of whether one agrees or disagrees, will be for all a touchstone for debate and discussion for years to come.",Religion,385,N/A,0,en

The Body of Myth,J. Nigro Sansonese,Inner Traditions / Bear & Co,1994,"Long ago the ancestors of the Greeks, Romans, and Hindus were one people living on the Eurasian steppes. At the core of their religion was the ""shamanic trance,"" a natural state but one in which consciousness achieves a profound level of inner awareness. Over the course of millennia, the Indo-Europeans divided and migrated into Europe and the Indian subcontinent. The knowledge of shamanic trance retreated from everyday awareness and was carried on in the form of myths and distilled into spiritual practices--most notably in the Indian tradition of yoga. J. Nigro Sansonese compares the myths of Greece as well as those of the Judeo-Christian tradition with the yogic practices of India and concludes that myths are esoteric descriptions of what occurs within the human body, especially the human nervous system, during trance. In this light, the myths provide a detailed map of the shamanic state of consciousness that is our natural heritage. This book carries on from the works of Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell to show how the portrayal of consciousness embodied in myth can be extended to a reappraisal of the laws of physics; before they are descriptions of the world, these laws--like myths--are descriptions of the human nervous system.",Health & Fitness,392,N/A,0,en

While mindfulness is considered the heart of Buddhist meditation, its essence is universal and of deep practical benefit, potentially to all. In essence, mindfulness is about embodied wakefulness. Our minds are such that we are often more asleep than awake to the unique beauty and possibilities of each present moment. While it is in the nature of all our minds to default to autopilot and lose touch with the only time we actually have to live - to feel, to grow, to love, to learn, to give shape to things, to heal - our mind also holds the innate capacity to awaken to each moment. This book gives you a variety of ways to experiment with not missing your moments and take maximal advantage of them by tending what most needs tending to now. Given the myriad mega-challenges humanity and planet Earth are facing at this time, Wherever You Go, There You Are can provide both a personal refuge for meaning - making, healing and transformation, as well as a locus for collaborating with others to heal the suffering of the world.","Body, Mind & Spirit",214,N/A,0,en

The Super Natural,"Whitley Strieber, Jeffrey J. Kripal",Penguin,2017-09-26,"Two of today's maverick authors on anomalous experience present a perception-altering and intellectually thrilling analysis of why the paranormal is real, but radically different from what is conventionally understood. Whitley Strieber (Communion) and Jeffrey J. Kripal (J. Newton Rayzor professor of religion at Rice University) team up on this unprecedented and intellectually vibrant new framing of inexplicable events and experiences. Rather than merely document the anomalous, these authors--one the man who popularized alien abduction and the other a renowned scholar and ""renegade advocate for including the paranormal in religious studies"" (The New York Times)--deliver a fast-paced and exhilarating study of why the supernatural is neither fantasy nor fiction but a vital and authentic aspect of life. Their suggestion? That all kinds of ""impossible"" things, from extra-dimensional beings to bilocation to bumps in the night, are not impossible at all: rather, they are a part of our natural world. But this natural world is immeasurably more weird, more wonderful, and probably more populated than we have so far imagined with our current categories and cultures, which are what really make these things seem ""impossible."" The Super Natural considers that the natural world is actually a ""super natural world""--and all we have to do to see this is to change the lenses through which we are looking at it and the languages through which we are presently limiting it. In short: The extraordinary exists if we know how to look at and think about it.","Body, Mind & Spirit",386,N/A,0,en

The Human Spirit,Marjorie O’Rourke Boyle,Penn State Press,2018-11-28,"In this volume, Marjorie O’Rourke Boyle probes significant concepts of the human spirit in Western religious culture across more than two millennia, from the book of Genesis to early modern science. The Human Spirit treats significant interpretations of human nature as religious in political, philosophical, and physical aspects by tracing its historical subject through the Priestly tradition of the Hebrew Bible and the writings of the apostle Paul among the Corinthians, the innovative theologians Augustine and Aquinas, the reformatory theologian Calvin, and the natural philosopher and physician William Harvey. Boyle analyzes the particular experiences and notions of these influential authors while she contextualizes them in community. She shows how they shared a conviction, although distinctly understood, of the human spirit as endowed by or designed by a divine source of everything animate. An original and erudite work that utilizes a rich and varied array of primary source material, this volume will be of interest to intellectual and cultural historians of religion, philosophy, literature, and medicine.",Religion,343,N/A,0,en

Healthy Human Life,James K. Bruckner,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2012-06-18,"Health is God's original created intent: whole persons, healthy relationships, a thriving environment, and ongoing interaction with himself. In the Bible, human health is body-based, community-based, and deeply integrated in a relationship with God's creating Spirit. The Pentateuch, prophets, writings, Gospels, and epistles all are deeply, if not primarily, concerned with the ongoing and ultimate health of God's good creation. Scripture also has a wide perspective on the disruption of human health. It deals with the human tendency to violence, corruption, and self-destructive behaviors. The recently renewed interest in health, vitality, and spirituality of all kinds has led to this articulation of a biblical spirituality in relation to human health. Surprisingly, when we look for spirituality in the Bible, we find real and embodied relationships. Everyone is for health and for the restoration of health. But what are health and healing? How does the Bible describe or define them? Here is the result of ten years of conversations with health care professionals in a master's course on biblical perspectives on health and healing. The biblical witness can transform the way we practice the healing arts. This book provides a biblical foundation for health and its restoration.",Religion,234,N/A,0,en

Spirituality and Social Justice: Spirit in the Political Quest for a Just World,"Cyndy Baskin, Norma Jean Profitt ",Canadian Scholars,2019-11-20,"Spirituality and Social Justice explores how critically informed spirituality can serve as an inspiration and a political force in the quest for social and ecological justice. Writing from various spiritual and religious worldviews, including Indigenous, Islamic, Wicca/Witchcraft, Jewish, Buddhist, and Christian, the authors—practitioners and academics of social work—draw on lived experience, research, and literature to illuminate how relationship with spirit can orient ways of being and acting to build a more just society. In Part One, the authors foreground Indigenous spirituality as resistance and decolonization. Part Two examines the complex ethical and political dimensions of spirituality, including the ecological destruction of the Earth and the influence of contemporary neoliberalism. Lastly, Part Three explores spirituality in teaching and learning contexts, both inside and beyond the classroom. Engaging and well-written, Spirituality and Social Justice challenges the notion that practitioners must put aside their critical spirituality in teaching, learning, healing, and practice. Students, practitioners, and academics of social work and other helping professions will benefit from the unique insights into spirituality and religion and how they inform social justice activism.",Social Science,314,N/A,0,en

Topics include: • Demystifying the body’s 7 energy centers and how you can balance them to heal • How to free yourself from the past by reconditioning your body to a new mind • How you can create reality in the generous present moment by changing your energy • The difference between third-dimension creation and fifth-dimension creation • The secret science of the pineal gland and its role in accessing mystical realms of reality • The distinction between Space-Time vs. Time-Space realities • And much more Chapters Include: Opening the Door to the Supernatural The Present Moment Tuning In to New Potentials in the Quantum Blessing of the Energy Centers Reconditioning the Body to a New Mind Case Studies: Living Examples of Truth Heart Intelligence Mind Movies/Kaleidoscope Walking Meditation Case Studies: Making It Real Space-Time and Time-Space The Pineal Gland Project Coherence: Making a Better World Case Studies: It Could Happen to You Using tools and disciplines ranging from cutting-edge physics to practical exercises such as a walking meditation, Dr. Joe offers nothing less than a proven program for stepping outside our physical reality and into the quantum field of infinite possibilities. “In a style that is simple, straightforward, and easy to understand, Dr. Joe Dispenza has woven into a single volume the paradigm-altering discoveries of quantum science and the deep teachings that adepts of the past dedicated their entire lifetimes to master.” — Gregg Braden, New York Times best-selling author of Human by Design and The Divine Matrix “We can create better lives for ourselves—and that we are not linear beings living linear lives, but dimensional beings living dimensional lives.

Healing Justice,Loretta Pyles,Oxford University Press,2018-03-15,"In the context of multiple forms of global economic, social, and cultural oppression, along with intergenerational trauma, burnout, and public services retrenchment, this book offers a framework and set of inquiries and practices for social workers, activists, community organizers, counselors, and other helping professionals. Healing justice, a term that has emerged in social movements in the last decade, is taught as a practice of connecting to the whole self, what many are conditioned to ignore -- the body, mind-heart, spirit, community, and natural world. Drawing from the East-West modalities of mindfulness, yoga, and Ayurveda, the author introduces six capabilities -- mindfulness and compassion; critical thinking and curiosity; and effort and equanimity -- which can guide practitioners on a transformative and empowering journey that can ultimately make them and their colleagues more effective in their work. Using case studies, critical analysis, and skill sharing, self-care is presented as an act of resistance to disconnection, marginalization, and internalized oppression. Healing justice is a trauma-informed practice that empowers social practitioners to cultivate the conditions that might allow them to feel more connected to themselves, their clients, colleagues, and communities. The book also engages critically with self-care practices, including investigation into the science of mindfulness, cultural appropriation, and the commodification of self-care. The message is clear that mindfulness-based practices are not a panacea for personal, inter-personal, or political problems. But, they can put practitioners in a more authentic and powerful place to work from, which is particularly important in a world where there is more connection to technology, ideologies, and people who share one's beliefs, and less connection to the natural world, people who are different, and the parts of oneself that one tends to reject. The book also offers suggestions for how to share self-care practices with community members who have less access to wellness.",Social Science,329,N/A,0,en

On the Soul and Its Origin,"Saint Augustine, Saint Augustine of Hippo",CreateSpace,2015-06-08,"Augustine, the man with upturned eye, with pen in the left hand, and a burning heart in the right (as he is usually represented), is a philosophical and theological genius of the first order, towering like a pyramid above his age, and looking down commandingly upon succeeding centuries. He had a mind uncommonly fertile and deep, bold and soaring; and with it, what is better, a heart full of Christian love and humility. He stands of right by the side of the greatest philosophers of antiquity and of modern times. We meet him alike on the broad highways and the narrow footpaths, on the giddy Alpine heights and in the awful depths of speculation, wherever philosophical thinkers before him or after him have trod. As a theologian he is facile princeps, at least surpassed by no church father, schoolman, or reformer. With royal munificence he scattered ideas in passing, which have set in mighty motion other lands and later times. He combined the creative power of Tertullian with the churchly spirit of Cyprian, the speculative intellect of the Greek church with the practical tact of the Latin.

Psychotherapy Relationships That Work,John C. Norcross,Oxford University Press,2011-05-04,"First published in 2002, the landmark Psychotherapy Relationships That Work broke new ground by focusing renewed and corrective attention on the substantial research behind the crucial (but often overlooked) client-therapist relationship. This thoroughly revised edition brings a decade of additional research to the same task. In addition to updating each chapter, the second edition features new chapters on the effectiveness of the alliance with children and adolescents, the alliance in couples and family therapy, real-time feedback from clients, patient preferences, culture, and attachment style. The new editon provides ""two books in one""--one on evidence-based relationship elements and one on evidence-based methods of adapting treatment to the individual patient. Each chapter features a specific therapist behavior that improves treatment outcome, or a transdiagnostic patient characteristic (such as reactance, preferences, culture, stage of change) by which clinicians can effectively tailor psychotherapy. All chapters provide original, comprehensive meta-analyses of the relevant research; clinical examples, and research-supported therapeutic practices by distinguished contributors. The result is a compelling synthesis of the best available research, clinical expertise, and patient characteristics in the tradition of evidence-based practice. The second edition of Psychotherapy Relationships That Work: Evidence-Based Responsiveness proves indispensible for any mental health professional. Reviews of the First Edition: ""A veritable gold mine of research related to relationships, this is a volume that should be an invaluable reference for every student and practitioner of psychotherapy.""--Psychotherapy ""This is a MUST READ for any researcher, clinician, or counselor who is genuinely interested in the active ingredients of effective psychotherapy and who appreciates the importance of applying empirical evidence to the therapy relationship.""--Arnold A.

"Roads of Excess, Palaces of Wisdom",Jeffrey J. Kripal,University of Chicago Press,2001-12,"William Blake once wrote that ""The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom."" Inspired by these poetic terms, Jeffrey J. Kripal reveals how the works of scholars of mysticism are often rooted in their own mystical experiences, ""roads of excess,"" which can both lead to important insights into these scholars' works and point us to our own ""palaces of wisdom."" In his new book, Kripal addresses the twentieth-century study of mysticism as a kind of mystical tradition in its own right, with its own unique histories, discourses, sociological dynamics, and rhetorics of secrecy. Fluidly combining autobiography and biography with scholarly exploration, Kripal takes us on a tour of comparative mystical thought by examining the lives and works of five major historians of mysticism—Evelyn Underhill, Louis Massignon, R. C. Zaehner, Agehananda Bharati, and Elliot Wolfson—as well as relating his own mystical experiences. The result, Kripal finds, is seven ""palaces of wisdom"": the religious power of excess, the necessity of distance in the study of mysticism, the relationship between the mystical and art, the dilemmas of male subjectivity and modern heterosexuality, a call for ethical criticism, the paradox of the insider-outsider problem in the study of religion, and the magical power of texts and their interpretation. An original and penetrating analysis of modern scholarship and scholars of mysticism, Roads of Excess, Palaces of Wisdom is also a persuasive demonstration of the way this scholarly activity is itself a mystical phenomenon.","Body, Mind & Spirit",440,N/A,0,en

Authentic Movement,Patrizia Pallaro,Jessica Kingsley Publishers,1999-05-01,"Patrizia Pallaro's second volume of essays on Authentic Movement, eight years after her first, is a tour de force. It is indeed ""an extraordinary array of papers"", as Pallaro puts it, and an immensely rich, moving and highly readable sweep through the landscapes of Authentic Movement, ""this form of creative expression, meditative discipline and/or psychotherapeutic endeavour"". You don't need to practice Authentic Movement to get a lot out of this book, but it certainly helps! I defy anyone to read the first two sections and not be curious to have their own experience.' - Sesame Institute 'Authentic Movement can be seen as a means by which analysts can become more sensitive to unconscious, especially pre-verbal aspects of themselves and their patients.' - Body Psychotherapy Journal Newsletter 'This book is a collection of articles, some of which are interviews, brought together for the first time. It is very valuable to have them all together in one place...It is a wonderful collection of articles on topics you have always wanted to read, such as the role of transference in dance therapy or Jung and dance therapy. The book also includes scripts for exercises.' - Somatics Authentic Movement, an exploration of the unconscious through movement, was largely defined by the work of Mary Starks Whitehouse, Janet Adler and Joan Chodorow. The basic concepts of Authentic Movement are expressed for the first time in one volume through interviews and conversations with these important figures, and their key papers. They emphasize the importance of movement as a means of communication, particularly unconscious or 'authentic' movement, emerging when the individual has a deep, self-sensing awareness - an attitude of 'inner listening'. Such movement can trigger powerful images, feelings and kinesthetic sensations arising from the depths of our stored childhood memories or connecting our inner selves to the transcendent. In exploring Authentic Movement these questions are asked: - How does authentic movement differ from other forms of dance and movement therapy? - How may 'authentic' movement be experienced?",Drama,349,N/A,0,en

Prostate Health in 90 Days,"Larry Clapp, Ph.D./J.D.","Hay House, Inc",1997-08-01,"Don’t let them cut or fry your prostate! This proven, patient-tested program can restore vigorous prostate health in just 90 days. “This book is a must-read for anyone who has cancer of the prostate or wishes to maintain optimal prostate health. It provides the reader with a road map for the latest cutting-edge technologies in medicine.”— MICHAEL GALITZER, M.D., THE AMERICAN HEALTH INSTITUTE Each year, 40,000 American men have their prostates surgically removed or burned with radiation, often within 48 hours of cancer diagnosis. While doing so may eliminate an immediate problem, it will result in reduced quality of life, often including impotence and incontinence. And, unfortunately, surgery and radiation don’t work as well as claimed. Often the cancer recurs—35% require retreatment within five years. This book will teach you how to: · STOP PROSTATE TROUBLE IN ITS TRACKS using nutrition, massage, herbs, homeopathy, and other alternative healing approaches. · UNDERSTAND WHAT CAUSES PROSTATAE CANCER, including toxins from your diet, drugs, the environment, pesticides, and parasites—all relatively easy to change. · REVERSE THE CANCER-CAUSING EFFECTS of dental toxins from hidden infections, root canals, and the 50% mercury content in silver-amalgam fillings. · CLEANSE AND STRENGTHEN VITAL ORGANS, including your colon and prostate. · ENHANCE YOUR SEX LIFE and become physically and mentally stronger. · VIRTUALLY ELIMINATE YOUR CHANCE FOR DISEASE by balancing your pH. The prostate is that vital center from which men derive their vitality, creative energy, and sexual drive. Without it, overall health and quality of life is severely diminished. That’s why it’s important to take care of your prostate health now, before trouble begins. Waiting for symptoms may be waiting too long.

Spirit Junkie,Gabrielle Bernstein,Harmony,2011-09-13,"“So long, Carrie Bradshaw—there’s a new role model for go-getting thirty-somethings. Gabrielle Bernstein is doling out inner peace and self-love for the postmodern spiritual set.”—Elle Foreword by Marianne Williamson Before she became a celebrated teacher and lecturer, Gabrielle Bernstein was going down a dangerous path. For years, Bernstein struggled with eating disorders, drug and alcohol abuse, and constant self-doubt and self-loathing. That all changed when she discovered A Course in Miracles, which taught her that much of what she feared in life was not frightening at all and, in many cases, not even real. Now, Bernstein lives an empowered, healthy, and joyful life. In Spirit Junkie, Bernstein guides readers through the life-changing lessons that shaped her spiritual journey: how we become accustomed to fearful ways of thinking, how to recognize and change those thought patterns to make way for bliss, and how to maintain our happiness and share it with the world. By understanding and changing our perceptions, hang-ups will melt away, resentments will release, and a childlike faith in joy will be reignited. Praise for Spirit Junkie “For those ready to give up their addiction to suffering or who simply need to release the general malaise of a too-busy, too shallow way of life, Spirit Junkie is a soothing balm for the soul. Gabrielle Bernstein is a brilliant shining guide for all who seek to have more love, more light and more miracles in their life.”—Arielle Ford, author of The Soulmate Secret",Self-Help,290,N/A,0,en

When Heaven Calls,Matt Fraser,Simon and Schuster,2021-11-23,"America’s top psychic medium reflects on his life of speaking to Spirit and the lessons he’s learned along the way—from both the living and the dead. Matt Fraser is just an ordinary guy…who happens to talk to dead people. Born into a psychic family, Matt carries on the legacy passed down from his late Grandmother Mary by connecting people to their dearly departed loved ones and delivering messages from the other side. His sold-out live group readings, television appearances, and private readings have allowed him to bring hope and healing to fans from around the world. But people who are not in the habit of talking with the dead have a hard time imagining what his day-to-day life is like. Based on the questions he gets, they seem to think he spends most of his time sitting cross-legged in a trance, maybe hovering a few inches off the ground, leaving his physical body behind as he journeys across the veil to the spirit realm. But it’s not like that at all. Now, in When Heaven Calls, Matt opens up about it’s really like to be a psychic medium—including how he discovered his spiritual gift, what it’s like to connect with souls on the other side, what communicating with the dead has taught him about embracing life, and how you can tap into your own intuitive awareness to manifest your dreams, goals, and desires.",Biography & Autobiography,224,N/A,0,en

According to Nee, ""The most frustrating experience of believers today is that in seeking for progress in the spiritual path, they do not find the proper way. As a result, they grope in darkness, being at times high or low, lingering around the crossroads year in and year out, and having no one to consult for direction. The author of this book was such a one. For this reason, the book emphasizes clear guidance on the proper path. Every chapter of this book is for the purpose of directing the believers on the right course. Therefore, all those who seek after God with an honest heart can go step by step accordingly. Almost every chapter begins from the position of the sinner and goes on step by step toward the peak of spiritual life."" This electronic book is the third of three volumes.",Religion,282,5,1,en
Patients and Healers in the Context of Culture,Arthur Kleinman,Univ of California Press,2023-04-28,"From the Preface, by Arthur Kleinman: Patients and Healers in the Context of Culture presents a theoretical framework for studying the relationship between medicine, psychiatry, and culture. That framework is principally illustrated by materials gathered in field research in Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, from materials gathered in similar research in Boston. The reader will find this book contains a dialectical tension between two reciprocally related orientations: it is both a cross-cultural (largely anthropological) perspective on the essential components of clinical care and a clinical perspective on anthropological studies of medicine and psychiatry. That dialectic is embodied in my own academic training and professional life, so that this book is a personal statement. I am a psychiatrist trained in anthropology. I have worked in library, field, and clinic on problems concerning medicine and psychiatry in Chinese culture. I teach cross-cultural psychiatry and medical anthropology, but I also practice and teach consultation psychiatry and take a clinical approach to my major cross-cultural teaching and research involvements. The theoretical framework elaborated in this book has been applied to all of those areas; in turn, they are used to illustrate the theory. Both the theory and its application embody the same dialectic. The purpose of this book is to advance both poles of that dialectic: to demonstrate the critical role of social science (especially anthropology and cross-cultural studies) in clinical medicine and psychiatry and to encourage study of clinical problems by anthropologists and other investigators involved in cross-cultural research. This title is part of UC Press's Voices Revived program, which commemorates University of California Press's mission to seek out and cultivate the brightest minds and give them voice, reach, and impact.

"Who Are You, Really?",Brian R. Little,Simon and Schuster,2017-08-15,"This fun, smart read for anyone eager to better understand (and improve) themselves argues that personality is driven not by nature nor nurture—but instead by the projects we pursue, which ultimately shape the people we become. Traditionally, scientists have emphasized what they call the first and second natures of personality—genes and culture, respectively. But today the field of personality science has moved well beyond the nature vs. nurture debate. In Who Are You, Really? Dr. Brian Little presents a distinctive view of how personality shapes our lives—and why this matters. Little makes the case for a third nature to the human condition—the pursuit of personal projects, idealistic dreams, and creative ventures that shape both people’s lives and their personalities. Little uncovers what personality science has been discovering about the role of personal projects, revealing how this new concept can help people better understand themselves and shape their lives. In this important work, Little argues that it is essential to devote energy and resources to creative endeavors in a highly focused fashion, even if it takes away from other components of our well-being. This does not mean that we cannot shift from one core project to another in the days of our lives. In fact, it is precisely that ability to flexibly craft projects that is the greatest source of sustainability. Like learning to walk, forcing ourselves out of balance as we step is the only way in which we can move forward. And it is the only way that human flourishing can be enhanced. The well-lived life is based on the sustainable pursuit of core projects in our lives. Ultimately, Who Are You, Really? provides a deeply personal itinerary for exploring our personalities, our lives, and the human condition.",Psychology,128,N/A,0,en
Union with Christ,J. Todd Billings,Baker Academic,2011-11-01,"Accomplished theologian J. Todd Billings recovers the biblical theme of union with Christ for today's church, making a fresh contribution to the theological discussion with important applications for theology and ministry. Drawing on Scripture and the thought of figures such as Augustine, Calvin, Bavinck, and Barth, Billings shows how a theology of union with Christ can change the way believers approach worship, justice, mission, and the Christian life. He illuminates how union with Christ can change the theological conversation about thorny topics such as total depravity and the mystery of God. Billings also provides a critique and alternative to the widely accepted paradigm of incarnational ministry and explores a gospel-centered approach to social justice. Throughout, he offers a unique and lively exploration of what is so amazing about being united to the living Christ.",Religion,192,N/A,0,en

The author, an ordained Episcopal priest, weaves together spiritual practices from different traditions with her own discovery that yoga's ancient truths are complementary with Christian beliefs -- taking one deeper into the spiritual life in ways that people of diverse faiths can embrace. Blending yogic practices with Christian spirituality and worship, the Reverend Gena Davis has co-created an exciting and powerful new practice of spiritual ritual and celebration called YogaMass that leads to embodying Christ Consciousness. On and off the yoga mat, this book points the way to discovering a whole-self spiritual experience and connecting with God through an awakened open mind and heart. ""I loved this book! The author, the Reverend Gena Davis, shares the story of her amazing spiritual journey that culminates in the creation of the world's first YogaMass service. This alone would make the book well worth reading, but throughout, she integrates sacred writings, stories, and poems from spiritual masters of western and eastern spirituality, all the while never losing sight of her own Christian heritage. It is a remarkable accomplishment. You will be blessed by this book and want to share it with others."" - The Reverend Dr. John K. Graham, president and CEO, Institute for Spirituality and Health at the Texas Medical Center, Houston ""I am delighted and privileged to encourage those who seek to worship God with all that is within to pick up and digest this spiritual teaching presented by the Reverend Gena Davis.

Vegucation Over Medication,Bobby Price,N/A,2018-04-11,"At the height of medical technology and civilization, America has become the fattest and sickest nation to ever grace the earth. There was a time when food was our medicine, and the farmer our physician. But now industrialization has converted farms into factories, replaced produce for processed foods, and meat comes with just as many warnings as the drugs we are prescribed. If we continue to embrace the Standard American Diet (SAD diet) and current health care system, this may be the first generation of parents to outlive their children. The science and medical community are split 50/50 as to why we are so sick. One side is dogmatically attached to the theory that germs cause disease, so sickness is inevitable and can only be treated not cured. The other perspective is that we have a genetic predisposition to disease and that science & technology provide the solution. However, neither of these philosophies actually address the real cause of disease. Vegucation Over Medication bridges the gap by helping us understand the impact of nutrition on our health. Dr. Bobby Price provides actionable advice on how to prevent and even reverse many chronic diseases. The book dispels in shocking detail many of the myths and lies we've adopted as truths, such as the use of medications as our primary form of prevention. Dr. Price's holistic approach to understanding the healing nature of our foods and bodies will empower you to cleanse, nourish, and RECLAIM YOUR HEALTH. In this book you will learn: - Hidden dangers in foods and medicines - How to minimize or eliminate medications - The connection between disease and nutrition - The secrets of long-term natural weight loss - The real scoop on protein - Powerful natural alternatives to help restore the body - Guide to incorporating a plant-based lifestyle - Tasty plant-based alternatives to your favorite foods - How a plant-based diet improves energy, digestion, and sleep - How to reverse Type 2 Diabetes - Keys to normalizing blood pressure and cholesterol levels",,200,N/A,0,en
Toward a Spiritual Research Paradigm,"Jing Lin, Rebecca L. Oxford, Tom E. Culham",Information Age Publishing,2016,"A volume in Transforming Education for the Future Spirituality and spiritual experiences have been the bedrock of every civilization and together form one of the highest mechanisms for making sense of the world for billions of people. Current research paradigms, due to their limitation to empirical, sensory, psychologically, or culturally constructed realities, fail to provide a framework for exploring this essential area of human experience. The development of a spiritual research paradigm will provide researchers from the social sciences and education the tools and abilities to systematically explore fundamental questions regarding human spiritual experiences and spiritual growth. A spiritual research paradigm requires an ontology that considers all reality to be multidimensional, interconnected, and interdependent. It requires an epistemology that integrates knowing from outer sources as well as inner contemplation, acknowledging our integration of soul and spirit with the body and mind. Three additional aspects are useful to a spiritual research paradigm: axiology, methodology, and teleology. An axiology concerns what is valued, good, and ethical. A methodology is the appropriate approach to systematic inquiry. A fifth and less frequently mentioned aspect is teleology, an explanation of the goal or end (telos) to which new knowledge is applied, such as gaining wisdom and truth, touching the divine, increasing inner peace, exploring hidden dimensions, or improving society. This book takes the first step to develop such a research paradigm. We draw from world spiritual traditions as well as scholarship that has arisen from contemplative practices.

The Latent Power of the Soul,Watchman Nee,Christian Fellowship Publications,1972-06,"""For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and quick to discover the thoughts and intents of the heart"" (Heb. 4:12). The peril of the believer is to confuse the spirit for the soul and the soul for the spirit, and so be deceived into accepting the counterfeit of evil spirits to the unsettling of God's work. The greatest advantage in knowing the difference between spirit and soul is perceiving the latent power of the soul and in understanding its falsification of the power of the Holy Spirit. Such knowledge is not theoretical but practical in helping people to walk in God's way. In this book, Watchman Nee shares his insight on The Latent Power of The Soul, The Christian and Psychic Force, and Spirit Force vs Psychic Force. Nowadays the atmosphere is so charged with the commotion of all kinds of counterfeit that the Lord seems to be calling the Church to come to a higher ground. Today's situation is perilous.

(Romans 12:2) This is our Biblical injunction from the Lord. The question is: How do we do it? What is the practical application of taking every thought captive, renewing our minds and putting on the Mind of Christ?In this sequel to The Way of Agape, Nancy shares that, ?without a renewed mind, our lives will remain the same as they've always been, no matter what we do or try. No matter how many Bible studies we attend, no matter how many Scriptures we know or how much we pray, without a mind change, our lives will still have the same problems, the same failures and the same defeats as they always have.

Peace is the Way,Deepak Chopra,Random House,2006,"Deepak Chopra's new book takes its title from a famous quotation- 'There is no way to peace. Peace is the way.' Mere variations on the theme of conflict will never get us where we want to go. We must take an evolutionary leap into a new way of being. According to Dr Chopra, war is a deeply ingrained habit that needs to be replaced. And beyond that, 'If the way of peace is to succeed, it must offer a substitute for everything war now offers.' More than this, Chopra contends that the majority of people have already evolved beyond war. The way of peace is the next step in their journey of personal growth. War is an outlet for fear, a stage for the enactment of courage and heroism, a display of machismo, and the contest of good versus evil. Peace Is the Way shows how each of us can end our need for these things. This stimulating new book offers a seven-step programme for changing the reader's consciousness. War ends with one person at a time, Chopra argues, and if enough people expand their awareness, we will reach critical mass, at which point the entire consciousness of the planet can shift away from war forever. Inspiring, thoughtful, timely and skilfully-crafted, Peace Is the Way is reminiscent of How to Know God in its scope and vision for the future of the world.

Integrative Approaches for Health,"Bhushan Patwardhan, Gururaj Mutalik, Girish Tillu",Academic Press,2015-03-31,"Despite spectacular advances, modern medicine faces formidable global challenges in several key areas—notably the persistence of major killer diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, and newer threats including HIV/AIDS, resistant infections, and Ebola. As such, modern medicine has not led to a significant decrease in chronic diseases like diabetes, obesity, and other degenerative and autoimmune diseases. The authors believe that modern medicine needs to experience a paradigm shift, an integration of traditions—in particular from the ancient systems like Ayurveda and Yoga. Integrative Approaches for Health: Biomedical Research, Ayurveda and Yoga brings together the basic principles of interdisciplinary systems approach for an evolving construct of future medicine. Such an approach is already emerging at the cutting edge of current research in omics, bioinformatics, computational and systems biology. Several leading institutions of medicine have adopted Yoga and complementary medicine to widen their reach, and deepen effectiveness in therapeutic practices. The amalgam of modern medicine, with its strengths in scientific rigor, blended with the basic principles of life drawn from Ayurveda and Yoga might evolve into a medicine of tomorrow. Integrative approaches are no longer alternative, perhaps taking these approaches is the only possible way to heal our sick planet. This book introduces important trends and tools for biomedical researchers and physicians alike, to innovate the practice of medicine for the better. - Contains a harmonious confluence of ancient and modern concepts, historical perspectives, philosophical underpinnings, and a relevant review of literature supported by worldwide case studies. - Provides a critical analysis of ancient wisdom, pointing to potential areas for future research, which provide food for thought for public debate on integrative health care for the twenty-first century. - Explains Ayurveda knowledge, and its relevance to drug discovery, nutrition, genomics, epigenetics, regenerative biology, longevity and personalized medicine. - Shares Yoga knowledge insights, and explains its relevance to body–mind complex relationships, psychology, neurobiology, immunoendocrinology, bioenergetics, consciousness, and cognitive sciences. - Offers illustrations and logic diagrams for enhanced understanding of the concepts presented.",Technology & Engineering,383,N/A,0,en
The Performative Power of Vocality,Virginie Magnat,Routledge,2019-12-06,"The Performative Power of Vocality offers a fresh perspective on voice as a subject of critical inquiry by employing an interdisciplinary and cross-cultural approach. Conventional treatment of voice in theatre and performance studies too often regards it as a subcategory of actor training, associated with the established methods that have shaped voice pedagogy within Western theatre schools, conservatories, and universities. This monograph significantly deviates from these dominant models through its investigation of the non-discursive, material, and affective efficacy of vocality, with a focus on orally transmitted vocal traditions. Drawing from her performance training, research collaborations, and commitment to cultural diversity, Magnat proposes a dialogical approach to vocality. Inclusive of established, current, and emerging research perspectives, this approach sheds light on the role of vocality as a vital source of embodied knowledge, creativity, and well-being grounded in process, practice, and place, as well as a form of social and political agency. An excellent resource for qualitative researchers, artist-scholars, and activists committed to decolonization, cultural revitalization, and social justice, this book opens up new avenues of understanding across Indigenous and Western philosophy, performance studies, musicology, ethnomusicology, sound and voice studies, anthropology, sociology, phenomenology, cognitive science, physics, ecology, and biomedicine.

Charing found he had developed healing touch as well as the ability to hear voices and experience visions--just as a healer in Italy had predicted only a week before the accident. He began using his abilities to heal but felt he needed more guidance and training. He first connected with a national spiritual healing organization, only to be told he was doing everything wrong. Then, through a friend, he discovered shamanism. Sharing profound teachings and extraordinary experiences from his more than 30 years of shamanic healing work, Charing explains how he accidentally became a shaman and completely changed the course of his life. He describes his work with plant spirits, entheogens such as ayahuasca, and indigenous shamans during his 20 years of fieldwork in the Peruvian Amazon, including his studies with the late visionary artist Pablo Amaringo. Investigating altered states of perception, he provides visionary techniques for exploring non-ordinary reality, exercises for expanding sensory perception, and practices to open your creative artistic visionary potential. Detailing the practice of soul retrieval, the author discusses why it is one of the most effective and profound spiritual healing practices and shares emotionally charged stories of successful shamanic healings he has attended. He also includes shamanic wisdom on working with feathers, stones, and sound and compares current research in physics with the vast body of experiential knowledge from indigenous spiritual traditions. From the accident that started his journey to the many remarkable spiritwork encounters that have happened since, Charing’s story will empower readers to begin exploring the realms of consciousness and energy that surround us and welcome the dissolution of the boundary between the physical and the spiritual.","Body, Mind & Spirit",0,N/A,0,en

From Dualism to Oneness in Psychoanalysis,Yorai Sella,Routledge,2018-01-19,"From Dualism to Oneness in Psychoanalysis: A Zen Perspective on the Mind-Body Question focuses on the shift in psychoanalytic thought, from a view of mind-body dualism to a contemporary non-dualistic perspective. Exploring this paradigm shift, Yorai Sella examines the impact of the work of psychoanalysts and researchers, such as Winnicott, Bion, Daniel Stern and Kohut, and delineates the contributions of three major schools of psychoanalytic thought in which the non-dualistic view is exemplified: (1) intersubjective; (2) neuro-psychoanalytic; and (3) mystically inclined psychoanalysis. Reaching beyond the constraints of dualism, Sella delineates the interdisciplinary approaches leading to psychoanalysis's paradigm shift. Focusing on the unique contribution of Zen-Buddhism, the book draws on Ehei Dōgen's philosophy to substantiate the non-duality of subject and object, body and mind - ultimately leading from alienation and duality to what Bion has termed ""at one-ment"". The way in which psychoanalytic theory and practice may develop further along these lines is demonstrated throughout the book in a variety of clinical vignettes. This book will inform the practice of all psychoanalysts, mental health professionals, psychotherapists and clinicians interested in mind-body issues in psychotherapy, in the philosophy of psychoanalysis, and in East-West dialogue.",Psychology,378,N/A,0,en

Investigating Phenomenal Consciousness,Max Velmans,John Benjamins Publishing,2000-01-01,"How can one investigate phenomenal consciousness? As in other areas of science, the investigation of consciousness aims for a more precise knowledge of its phenomena, and the discovery of general truths about their nature. This requires the development of appropriate first-person, second-person and third-person methods. This book introduces some of the creative ways in which these methods can be applied to different purposes, e.g. to understanding the relation of consciousness to brain, to examining or changing consciousness as such, and to understanding the way consciousness is influenced by social, clinical and therapeutic contexts. To clarify the strengths and weaknesses of different methods and to demonstrate the interplay of methodology and epistemology, the book also suggests a number of maps of the consciousness studies terrain that place different approaches to the study of consciousness into a broader, interdisciplinary context.

The Chumash, reduced by the 20th century from one of the richest and most populous groups in California to a pitiful remnant, had almost lost their strage and ecstatic mental world by the time John Peabody Harrington set out to collect what was still remembered of their language and oral literature. Working with a handful of ancient informants, Harrington recorded all he could--then, in bitter rejection of the world, kept it hidden and unpublished. After his death there began a great quest for his scattered notes, and these notes are now being published at last. Thomas Blackburn, among the first and most assiduous of the seekers through Harrington's materials, has published her the main body of oral literature that Harrington collected from the Chumash of Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties. Blackburn has done much more: he has added to the 111 stories a commentary and analysis, almost book-length in its own right, and a glossary of the Chumash and Californian-Spanish terms that Harrington was prone to leave untranslated in the texts.",Fiction,396,5,1,en

More Myself,Alicia Keys,Flatiron Books,2020-03-31,"An intimate, revealing look at one artist’s journey from self-censorship to full expression As one of the most celebrated musicians in the world, Alicia Keys has enraptured the globe with her heartfelt lyrics, extraordinary vocal range, and soul-stirring piano compositions. Yet away from the spotlight, Alicia has grappled with private heartache—over the challenging and complex relationship with her father, the people-pleasing nature that characterized her early career, the loss of privacy surrounding her romantic relationships, and the oppressive expectations of female perfection. Since Alicia rose to fame, her public persona has belied a deep personal truth: she has spent years not fully recognizing or honoring her own worth. After withholding parts of herself for so long, she is at last exploring the questions that live at the heart of her story: Who am I, really? And once I discover that truth, how can I become brave enough to embrace it? More Myself is part autobiography, part narrative documentary. Alicia’s journey is revealed not only through her own candid recounting, but also through vivid recollections from those who have walked alongside her. The result is a 360-degree perspective on Alicia’s path, from her girlhood in Hell’s Kitchen and Harlem to the process of growth and self-discovery that we all must navigate. In More Myself, Alicia shares her quest for truth—about herself, her past, and her shift from sacrificing her spirit to celebrating her worth. With the raw honesty that epitomizes Alicia’s artistry, More Myself is at once a riveting account and a clarion call to readers: to define themselves in a world that rarely encourages a true and unique identity.",Biography & Autobiography,267,N/A,0,en

The Nightingale,Kristin Hannah,Macmillan Audio,2015-02-03,"In love we find out who we want to be. In war we find out who we are. FRANCE, 1939 In the quiet village of Carriveau, Vianne Mauriac says goodbye to her husband, Antoine, as he heads for the Front. She doesn't believe that the Nazis will invade France...but invade they do, in droves of marching soldiers, in caravans of trucks and tanks, in planes that fill the skies and drop bombs upon the innocent. When a German captain requisitions Vianne's home, she and her daughter must live with the enemy or lose everything. Without food or money or hope, as danger escalates all around them, she is forced to make one impossible choice after another to keep her family alive. Vianne's sister, Isabelle, is a rebellious eighteen-year-old girl, searching for purpose with all the reckless passion of youth. While thousands of Parisians march into the unknown terrors of war, she meets Gäetan, a partisan who believes the French can fight the Nazis from within France, and she falls in love as only the young can...completely. But when he betrays her, Isabelle joins the Resistance and never looks back, risking her life time and again to save others. With courage, grace and powerful insight, bestselling author Kristin Hannah captures the epic panorama of WWII and illuminates an intimate part of history seldom seen: the women's war. The Nightingale tells the stories of two sisters, separated by years and experience, by ideals, passion and circumstance, each embarking on her own dangerous path toward survival, love, and freedom in German-occupied, war-torn France--a heartbreakingly beautiful novel that celebrates the resilience of the human spirit and the durability of women.

They form groups of hundreds and speed wildly through cities at night. For Jae and Dongyu, two orphans, their motorcycles are a way of survival. Jae is born in a bathroom stall at the Seoul Express Bus Terminal. And Dongyu is born mute—unable to communicate with anyone except Jae. Both boys grow up on the streets of Seoul among runaway teenagers, con men, prostitutes, religious fanatics, and thieves.

Gaps and Actions in Health Improvement from Hong Kong and Beyond,"Ben Yuk Fai Fong, William Chi Wai Wong",Springer Nature,2023-10-15,"This book provides a timely review on what has been accomplished, and what remains amiss, following the World Health Organization’s 1978 ‘Health for All’ campaign, by identifying enduring gaps in health care within a global context. The WHO declaration of ""Health for All by the Year 2000"" mapped out a road towards primary health care for all people and demarcated it as essential for human progress in terms of economic development and social justice. However, 45 years have gone by, and most societies and countries have yet achieved 'health for all’, despite so much having changed in technology, disease patterns, and population demographics. In promoting community health and improving service delivery, the book advocates the development and implementation of “All For Health” strategies to steer stakeholders in the right direction towards universal health care. The book covers the gaps and actions in health improvements, the ‘All For Health’ strategies, and the Health in All Policies (HiAP), reviewing and discussing issues through both Asian and international examples. Contributors include both academics and practitioners from diverse professional backgrounds including medicine, nursing, pharmacy, allied health, dietetics, social sciences, life sciences, education, business, administration, law, and public policy.

At the End of Life,Lee Gutkind,Underland Press,2012-04-10,"What should medicine do when it can’t save your life? The modern healthcare system has become proficient at staving off death with aggressive interventions. And yet, eventually everyone dies—and although most Americans say they would prefer to die peacefully at home, more than half of all deaths take place in hospitals or health care facilities. At the End of Life—the latest collaborative book project between the Creative Nonfiction Foundation and the Jewish Healthcare Foundation—tackles this conundrum head on. Featuring twenty-two compelling personal-medical narratives, the collection explores death, dying and palliative care, and highlights current features, flaws and advances in the healthcare system. Here, a poet and former hospice worker reflects on death’s mysteries; a son wanders the halls of his mother’s nursing home, lost in the small absurdities of the place; a grief counselor struggles with losing his own grandfather; a medical intern traces the origins and meaning of time; a mother anguishes over her decision to turn off her daughter’s life support and allow her organs to be harvested; and a nurse remembers many of her former patients. These original, compelling personal narratives reveal the inner workings of hospitals, homes and hospices where patients, their doctors and their loved ones all battle to hang on—and to let go.",Family & Relationships,303,N/A,0,en

Lost States is a tribute to such great unrealized dreams as West Florida, Texlahoma, Montezuma, Rough and Ready, and Yazoo. Some of these states came remarkably close to joining the Union. Others never had a chance. Many are still trying. Consider: Frontier legend Daniel Boone once proposed a state of Transylvania in the Appalachian wilderness. His plan was resurrected a few years later with the new name of Kentucky. Residents of bucolic South Jersey wanted to secede from their urban north Jersey neighbors and form the fifty-first state. The Gold Rush territory of Nataqua could have made a fine state—but since no women were willing to live there, the settlers gave up and joined California. Each story offers a fascinating glimpse at the nation we might have become—along with plenty of absurd characters, bureaucratic red tape, and political gamesmanship.

Women and Christianity explores the experiences of women and how their daily lives interface with their spirituality and faith. Beginning with a historical overview, the book presents essays grouped under five broad headings: women, family, and environment; socioeconomics, politics, and authority; body, mind, and spirit; sex, power, and vulnerability; and women, world view, and religious practice. These essays focus on multiple aspects of women's experiences and contemporary Christian realities, involving the interrelatedness of faith, thought, and activism across many strata of global society. They wrestle with the daily experiences and challenges women face integrating their lives as women of faith—as they are advocates, experience agency, and work for mutuality.

Handbook of Religion and the Authority of Science,"Jim R.

Though the appeal to science is most evident in more recent religions like Christian Science and Scientology, no major faith tradition is exempt from this pattern. Members of almost every religion desire to see their ‘truths’ supported by the authority of science – especially in the midst of the present historical period, when all of the comforting old certainties seem problematic and threatened. The present collection examines this pattern in a wide variety of different religions and spiritual movements, and demonstrates the many different ways in which religions appeal to the authority of science. The result is a wide-ranging and uniquely compelling study of how religions adapt their message to one of the major challenges presented by the contemporary world.",Religion,940,N/A,0,en

International Reflections on Approaches to Mental Health Social Work,"Malcolm Golightley, Gloria Kirwan",Routledge,2018-04-19,"Growing out of an interest in exploring the contemporary contexts and practices related to mental health social work across the world, this book provides a range of insights into the social factors which contribute, sometimes quite significantly, to the emergence of mental health problems for individuals and even whole communities. The range and scope of mental health social work is highlighted through the different accounts of therapeutic work, advocacy, support and rehabilitation. But this collection goes further and also provides the reader with critical analyses of social work practice and social policies in certain contexts, thus inviting the reader to a more reflective consideration of the value of mental health perspectives in social work in general. Taken as a whole, the collection suggests that social work engages with the field of mental health in diverse, creative, and very reflective ways, yet is always focused on the needs and rights of those for whom problems with mental health can be personally challenging and often disempowering.

The Body Bears the Burden,Robert C. Scaer,N/A,2001,"Using the clinical model of the whiplash syndrome, this groundbreaking book describes the alterations in brain chemistry and function induced in individuals by what is known as traumatic stress or traumatization--experiencing a life-threatening event while in a state of helplessness. The Body Bears the Burden: Trauma, Dissociation, and Disease presents evidence of the resulting and relatively permanent alteration in neurophysiology, neurochemistry, and neuronal organization. This book convincingly demonstrates that these changes create lasting effects on the emotional and physical well-being of the victim--changes correlated with many of the most common, yet poorly understood, physical complaints and diseases, including whiplash, migraines, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, and other painful, difficult-to-treat conditions. Further, the causes and effects of retraumatization are explored, clarifying the reasons some patients suffer fresh trauma over relatively minor incidents while others handle major traumas more easily. This groundbreaking volume backs up its new theory of PTSD neurophysiology with cogent theory and persuasive evidence, including: case studies correlating clinical features of trauma and dissociation with compelling physiological rationales for the symptoms solid documentation drawing from the medical and psychiatric literature of PTSD, whiplash, brain injury, epidemiology of trauma, and a variety of disease processes linked to trauma in-depth discussions of medical traumatization of patients, including the results of pediatric procedures and ineffective anesthesia demonstrations that somatization and conversion are not imagined symptoms but result from measurable autonomic physiological alteration of the affected organ a well-documented exploration of the effect of prenatal and neonatal trauma on later emotional development, response to traumatic life events, and disease and mortality This impressive empirical evidence that body, brain, and mind are a continuum offers a powerful new paradigm to medical and mental health professionals, as well as new hope to sufferers from trauma. With a foreword by Bessel van der Kolk and helpful figures, The Body Bears the Burden: Trauma, Dissociation, and Disease is an essential resource for the in-the-trenches professionals who confront the effects of trauma and resulting somatic consequences. It will be of compelling interest and usefulness to family practice physicians, nurses and nurse practitioners, speech and physical therapists, counselors and psychotherapists, and any medical or mental health professional who treats physical or emotional trauma.",Health & Fitness,0,N/A,0,en

Relieving Pain in America,"Institute of Medicine, Board on Health Sciences Policy, Committee on Advancing Pain Research, Care, and Education",National Academies Press,2011-10-26,"Chronic pain costs the nation up to $635 billion each year in medical treatment and lost productivity. The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act required the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to enlist the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in examining pain as a public health problem. In this report, the IOM offers a blueprint for action in transforming prevention, care, education, and research, with the goal of providing relief for people with pain in America. To reach the vast multitude of people with various types of pain, the nation must adopt a population-level prevention and management strategy. The IOM recommends that HHS develop a comprehensive plan with specific goals, actions, and timeframes. Better data are needed to help shape efforts, especially on the groups of people currently underdiagnosed and undertreated, and the IOM encourages federal and state agencies and private organizations to accelerate the collection of data on pain incidence, prevalence, and treatments. Because pain varies from patient to patient, healthcare providers should increasingly aim at tailoring pain care to each person's experience, and self-management of pain should be promoted. In addition, because there are major gaps in knowledge about pain across health care and society alike, the IOM recommends that federal agencies and other stakeholders redesign education programs to bridge these gaps. Pain is a major driver for visits to physicians, a major reason for taking medications, a major cause of disability, and a key factor in quality of life and productivity. Given the burden of pain in human lives, dollars, and social consequences, relieving pain should be a national priority.",Medical,383,5,1,en

Person and Dignity in Edith Stein’s Writings,Jadwiga Guerrero van der Meijden,Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG,2019-07-08,"Edith Stein is widely known as a historical figure, a victim of the Holocaust and a saint, but still unrecognised as a philosopher. It was philosophy, however, that constituted the core of her life. Today her complete writings are available to scholars and therefore her thinking can be properly investigated and evaluated. Who is a human person? And what is his or her dignity according to Edith Stein? Those are the two leading questions investigated in this volume. The answer is presented based on the complete writings of the 20th-c. phenomenologist and, moreover, compared to the traditional Christian understanding of human dignity present in the writings of the Church Fathers and the Doctors of the Church as well as Magisterial Documents of the Catholic Church. In the final parts of the book, the author shows how Stein's ideas are relevant today, in particular to the ongoing doctrinal and legal debates over the concept of human dignity.",Religion,386,N/A,0,en

Feeling Good by Doing Good,Christopher Mruk,Oxford University Press,2018-06-24,"Recent years have seen a surprising shift concerning the concept of self-esteem, with some researchers attacking the notion of self-esteem as being of little value or too difficult to study. Educators emphasized self-esteem's importance in schools to the extent that sometimes it became more important than academic performance. And a parade of overly-simple and ineffective self-help books promote the importance of self-esteem but seldom deliver real change. Coming to the defense of self-esteem as a valuable and measurable component of good mental health, Feeling Good by Doing Good offers a new evidence-based approach to defining, understanding, and increasing what is known as ""authentic self-esteem."" Translating decades of research in the fields of self-esteem, humanistic psychology, positive psychology, and psychotherapy into everyday terms, Christopher Mruk traces the definition of self-esteem back to when it was first used to describe the value of ""doing that which is both just and right."" Seen this way, self-esteem is not just feeling good about oneself - rather, it comes from facing life's challenges in ways that demonstrate one's competence and worth as a person. This approach to self-esteem offers several new and powerful advantages, namely understanding different types of self-esteem, clarifying the connection between self-esteem and self-control, appreciating how self-esteem operates in various domains of life such as work or relationships, realizing that self-esteem acts as an internal compass to help steer us in healthier directions, and recognizing the connection between authentic self-esteem and basic human values. Featuring clinical and everyday vignettes, practical exercises aimed at enhancing personal as well as interpersonal well-being, and thought-provoking self-assessments for the reader, Feeling Good by Doing Good is a unique resource that will be of interest to mental health professionals, their clients, and laypersons alike interested in substance over platitudes and feel-good solutions.",Psychology,177,N/A,0,en

"The Healing of Individuals, Families & Nations",John L. Payne,Simon and Schuster,2012-06-01,"Body, Mind & Spirit / Self-Help This book’s perspective on healing will expand the reader’s vision, beyond the scope of healing as a purely individual and personal matter, to one that spans generations in its scope, crosses racial and cultural barriers and sheds new light on the relationships between victims and perpetrators, be they from governments and regimes, wars, sexual abuse or crime. Payne’s “Orders of Love” describe a natural pattern that has been observed in the practice of Family Constellations--namely, that there is a distinct order stating who belongs and who does not belong, not only in a family system, but also in larger groups such as nations. With its many examples and stories, Payne’s book brings back into belonging those who have been excluded and bridges the gap between the healing of an individual and the healing of family, ethnic and national souls. John L. Payne, also known as Shavasti, has travelled the length and breadth of this globe, firstly in childhood and then in his adult life in search of deeper meaning and experience. His multi-cultural background created a childhood that was spread over three continents and an adult life spent living in Europe, Africa, Central and South America and Asia, with much time being spent in the USA. With the experience of having given more than 400 workshops on 6 continents, you are receiving a wealth of cultural, ethnic and historical experience that makes his work finely tuned for ancestral healing having worked with hundreds of individuals across the globe.","Body, Mind & Spirit",167,N/A,0,en

Soul Breathing,Carrie L'Esperance,Simon and Schuster,2016-05-17,"An exploration of the multidimensional interplay between body, mind, and spirit • Identifies the frequencies that support life and the dissonant frequencies incompatible with life, such as the imbalances of EMFs • Explains how to cultivate higher consciousness by building a strong light body • Includes techniques and exercises for psychic cleansing, physical and emotional detox, chakra and aura strengthening, and oracular dreaming Civilization has reached a critical threshold in time unlike any other. Whether life continues to evolve or devolve depends upon our ability to reach higher states of consciousness en masse. This requires calling upon the transformative power of the soul--a power not handed to us, but earned. We are living proof that the physical and spiritual realms of existence work together in unity. Yet for many of us our natural soul light and inner spiritual intuition are suppressed due to the distractions of day-to-day living and the electromagnetic pollution of our screen-filled technological world. In this exploration of the multidimensional interplay between the body, mind, and spirit, Carrie L’Esperance reveals how we can restore the flow of spiritual light in everyday living through the art of self-mastery. She explains how technology has severely reduced humanity’s natural abilities and spiritual power. She shows how EMFs and wi-fi toast our energetic bodily systems and suppress our immune systems, blocking the ethereal frequencies of light and suppressing our creative intuition and higher powers. Detailing the spiritual bio-geometry of light and the holographic principle, she explores how the cells of our bodies receive light’s deeper vibratory frequencies to support conscious evolution and soul development as well as explaining near-death and out-of-body experiences. She identifies the dissonant energies that endanger mind/body health and reveals new advances in brain science that allow us to transcend the malign influences that hamper human evolution. She provides exercises and techniques for spiritual alignment and receptivity, including psychic cleansing, physical and emotional detox, chakra and aura strengthening, and oracular dreaming. Preparing us for the new cosmology and the greater community of worlds that is being revealed, L’Esperance shows that when we are properly connected with our soul’s intelligence and cultivate the reception of higher frequencies of consciousness, then we are able to soul breathe, to absorb more pranic energy, the electromagnetic force and cosmic radiation that is the sustaining element of all life and consciousness.","Body, Mind & Spirit",279,N/A,0,en

You've searched and at times sacrificed security and sanity to find it. Even so, you only have more questions than answers and a memory that serves to make you both smile and cry. Where did the youthful heart that hoped and dreamed without bounds and believed nothing was impossible go? Where did the youthful spirit that could create options that did not exist go? Where did the youthful heart that would play with an open mind, open heart, and carefree passion go? Where did the youthful spirit that thrived on challenges go? Where did the youthful heart that believed in magic go? Where did the youthful spirit that was enthusiastically and passionately in love with life go? My Gift to You is the first book in a three-book series that shares the book writing adventures of a spiritual journey from the mind (fear) to the heart (faith). My Gift to You is a story to help you remember and celebrate who you truly are. All that is needed is an open mind and the willingness to discover what is waiting to be found.","Body, Mind & Spirit",305,N/A,0,en

Libra Ascendant Secrets,Saket Shah,Saket Shah,2020-01-05,"There are times when people just can’t identify with the attributes of their Sun or Moon sign. In fact, they may feel that they are an antithesis of their zodiac sign. You may also have observed it. Your Leo friend may not seek attention, may be because he or she has a Capricorn ascendant. Your Sagittarius friend is very possessive, may be because he or she has a Scorpio Ascendant. It is easy to understand why some people do not correspond to their Sun or Moon signs once you know about what is the rising sign or Ascendant in a horoscope. Ascendant is the degree of the zodiac sign that was highest on the Easter horizon at the time and place of birth. When seen from Earth, the sky seems to move, so the entire zodiac can be observed in a span of 24 hours day which means the rising sign changes on the Eastern horizon every 2 hours because there are 12 zodiac signs. People tend to associate their physical, emotional and spiritual attributes more with rising sign at times.","Body, Mind & Spirit",197,N/A,0,en

Reading Madeleine L’Engle,Heidi A. Lawrence,Taylor & Francis,2023-10-20,"Using a critical lens derived from ecopsychology and its praxis, ecotherapy, this book explores the relationships Madeleine L’Engle develops for her characters in a selection of the novels from her three Time, Austin family, and O’Keefe family series as those relationships develop along a human-nonhuman kinship continuum. This is accomplished through an examination both of pairs of novels from the fantastic and the realistic series, and of single novels which stand out as slightly different from the most prominent genre in a given series. Thus, this examination also shows L’Engle’s fluid movement along a fantasy-reality continuum and demonstrates the integration of the three series with each other. Importantly, through examining these relationships and this movement along continuums in these novels, the project demonstrates how ecopsychology and ecotherapy provide strong and important – and as-yet virtually unexplored – intersections with children’s literature.",Literary Criticism,209,N/A,0,en
The Book of Revelation: a New Beginning,Terry L Newbegin,BalboaPress,2011-03-23,"The Book of Revelation: A New Beginning contains the hidden secrets of Saint Johns Revelation, and as you know, it is one of the most debated and most difficult books of all the scriptures to read and understand because of the extreme symbolism tied to it. Man has always assumed the word of Gods prophets and their stories were indisputable just because of their eminence in interpreted them as being true. Man has forgotten the history of himself, Earth, God, the origin of the universe, and how the scriptures have been documented, interpreted, and strictly passed down by our ancestors and religious leaders. As symbolic as Revelation is it has nothing to do with the end days or even about a solitary Anti-Christ as we understand it nor is it about Jesus coming to save you. In truth, Saint Johns Revelation is your own guide showing you that you no longer need to look at yourself as a sinner because you have bared your cross, like Jesus, and now the time has come for you to ascend to a higher state of Mind. The book of Revelation: A New Beginning is a book that will help open the gates of your soul memories so you can become aware of your own divineness, and that you are a God too. My fellow Gods, what is coming to an end is the old ways of perceiving and understanding God. It is not that God is a mystery. It is you that is the mystery, and when fear is resolved within, you are then ready to open up to the hidden secrets behind the Book of Revelation that religions have kept as a secret for thousands of years, either on purpose or because of ignorance.","Body, Mind & Spirit",715,N/A,0,en
Awakening from Anxiety,Connie L. Habash,Mango Media Inc.,2019-08-15,"Use this spiritual guide to equip yourself with the tools needed to tear down anxiety and build inner peace. Spiritual people often find that their own expectations of living a life dedicated to a higher power makes them more susceptible to high-functioning anxiety. Sometimes, traditional relaxation techniques either do not work, don’t last, or, in some cases, actually increase their anxiety. Psychotherapist, yoga teacher, and interfaith minister Rev. Connie L. Habash has helped hundreds of spiritual people overcome fear and anxiety, regain happiness, and feel calmer. In over twenty-five years as a counselor helping spiritual people overcome anxiety, Rev. Connie has taught that it takes more than chanting mantras, stretching, or relaxation techniques to calm anxiety. It requires a transformation in perception, moment-to-moment body awareness, and a conscious response to thoughts and emotions. Awakening from Anxiety provides valuable psycho-spiritual tools to deepen spiritual awakening and calm fears:Learn what anxiety is and when it becomes a problemUnderstand the six mistakes spiritual people make that increase anxietyDiscover the seven keys to a more calm, confident, courageous lifeKnow how to break through the old patterns of stress, worry, and fear into a new perception of your true selfExplore spiritual principles and yoga philosophy to cultivate inner peace If you enjoyed Stop Anxiety from Stopping You and First, We Make the Beast Beautiful, Awakening from Anxiety will take your healing and renewal from anxiety to the next level. “A book I will recommend to many for both practical advice and spiritual insights for handling stress, worry, and anxiety.”?Becca Anderson, author of Prayers for Calm",Self-Help,198,N/A,0,en
Fasting: an Exceptional Human Experience,Randi Fredricks,AuthorHouse,2012-12-20,"Fasting An Exceptional Human Experience Since prehistory, fasting has been used in various ways as a means of transformation. As a spiritual practice, it is the oldest and most common form of asceticism and is found in virtually every religion and spiritual tradition. In psychology, studies have suggested that fasting can alleviate the symptoms of some psychiatric conditions, including depression and schizophrenia. In medicine, fasting is one of the most promising therapies, with research suggesting that fasting can cause certain drugs, such as chemotherapy, to work better while reducing drug side-effects. Hunger striking, sometimes called political fasting, may be the most powerful application of fasting. Proof of this occurred in 1948 when Gandhis hunger strike caused millions of Hindus and Muslims in India to cease their fighting. As a practical guide, Randi Fredricks, Ph.D. provides detailed information on the different types of fasting, where people fast, the physiological process of fasting, and the contraindications and criticisms of fasting. Using existing literature and original research, Dr. Fredricks focuses on the transformative characteristics of fasting in the contexts of psychology, medicine, and spirituality. The relationship between fasting and transpersonal psychology is examined, with a focus on peak experiences, self-realization, and other exceptional human experiences. Dr. Fredricks demonstrates how fasting can be profoundly therapeutic, create global paradigm shifts, and provide personal mystical phenomena.",Psychology,546,N/A,0,en

Gaia Alchemy,Stephan Harding,Simon and Schuster,2021-12-21,"• Examines how integrating important alchemical images with Gaian science can offer insights into our interconnectedness with Gaia • Looks at how the four components of the living earth--biosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere--mesh with the four elements of alchemical theory and the four functions of consciousness as understood by depth psychology • Offers guided meditations and contemplative exercises to open your receptivity to messages from the biosphere and help you connect more deeply with Gaia During the scientific revolution, science and soul were drastically separated, propelling humanity into four centuries of scientific exploration based solely on empiricism and rationality. But, as scientist and ecologist Stephan Harding, Ph.D., demonstrates in detail, by reintegrating science with profound personal experiences of psyche and soul, we can reclaim our lost sacred wholeness and help heal ourselves and our planet. The book begins with compelling introductions to depth psychology, alchemy, and Gaia theory--the science of seeing the Earth as an intelligent, self-regulating system, a theory pioneered by the author’s mentor James Lovelock. Harding then explores how alchemy, as understood through the depth psychology of C. G. Jung, offers us powerful methods of reuniting rationality and intuition, science and soul. He examines the integration of important alchemical engravings, including those from L’Azoth des Philosophes and the Rosarium Philosophorum, with Gaian science. He shows how the seven key alchemical operations in the Azoth image can help us develop deeply transformative experiences and insights into our interconnectedness with Gaia. He then looks at how the four components of the living Earth--biosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere--mesh not only with the four elements of alchemical theory but also with the four functions of consciousness from depth psychology. Woven throughout with the author’s own experiences of Gaia alchemy, the book also offers guided meditations and contemplative exercises to open your receptivity to messages from the biosphere and help you develop your own Gaian alchemical way of life, full of wonder and healing.","Body, Mind & Spirit",452,N/A,0,en

We all know the feeling: In the game of life, why am I the only one who doesn't know how to play? But now, help is at hand, because this wonderful little book will teach you the rules so that you can conquer life's challenges and manage its unpredictable ups and downs. For one of her workshops several years ago, Chérie Carter-Scott, a corporate trainer and consultant, composed a list of basic truths about life, which she named ""The Ten Rules for Being Human."" Right away, the Rules resonated with her clients, who photocopied and passed the list to friends and relatives. Within months, Chérie's Rules were in thousands of homes all over the country, and eventually, they were published in Chicken Soup for the Soul and have also appeared in Ann Landers' column. Although there's no formula to help you win the game of life, Chérie's Rules convey a universal wisdom that, once understood and embraced, can contribute to meaningful relationships with ourselves and others, at work and in the home. In If Life Is a Game, These Are the Rules, Chérie shares that there are no mistakes in life, only lessons that are repeated. In thoughtful, inspirational essays illustrated with encouraging personal anecdotes, she includes the lessons that can be learned from each of the Rules and offers insights on self-esteem, respect, acceptance, forgiveness, ethics, compassion, humility, gratitude, and courage.

Consciousness,"Susan Blackmore, Emily T. Troscianko",Routledge,2018-04-27,"Is there a theory that explains the essence of consciousness? Or is consciousness itself an illusion? Am I conscious now? Now considered the 'last great mystery of science', consciousness was once viewed with extreme scepticism and rejected by mainstream scientists. It is now a significant area of research, albeit a contentious one, as well as a rapidly expanding area of study for students of psychology, philosophy, and neuroscience. This edition of Consciousness, revised by author team Susan Blackmore and Emily Troscianko, explores the key theories and evidence in consciousness studies ranging from neuroscience and psychology to quantum theories and philosophy. It examines why the term ‘consciousness’ has no recognised definition and provides an opportunity to delve into personal intuitions about the self, mind, and consciousness. Featuring comprehensive coverage of all core topics in the field, this edition includes: Why the problem of consciousness is so hard Neuroscience and the neural correlates of consciousness Why we might be mistaken about our own minds The apparent difference between conscious and unconscious Theories of attention, free will, and self and other The evolution of consciousness in animals and machines Altered states from meditation to drugs and dreaming Complete with key concept boxes, profiles of well-known thinkers, and questions and activities suitable for both independent study and group work, Consciousness provides a complete introduction to this fascinating field.

Plant Intelligence and the Imaginal Realm,Stephen Harrod Buhner,Simon and Schuster,2014-05-14,"A manual for opening the doors of perception and directly engaging the intelligence of the Natural World • Provides exercises to directly perceive and interact with the complex, living, self-organizing being that is Gaia • Reveals that every life form on Earth is highly intelligent and communicative • Examines the ecological function of invasive plants, bacterial resistance to antibiotics, psychotropic plants and fungi, and the human species In Plant Intelligence and the Imaginal Realm, Stephen Harrod Buhner reveals that all life forms on Earth possess intelligence, language, a sense of I and not I, and the capacity to dream. He shows that by consciously opening the doors of perception, we can reconnect with the living intelligences in Nature as kindred beings, become again wild scientists, nondomesticated explorers of a Gaian world just as Goethe, Barbara McClintock, James Lovelock, and others have done. For as Einstein commented, “We cannot solve the problems facing us by using the same kind of thinking that created them.” Buhner explains how to use analogical thinking and imaginal perception to directly experience the inherent meanings that flow through the world, that are expressed from each living form that surrounds us, and to directly initiate communication in return. He delves deeply into the ecological function of invasive plants, bacterial resistance to antibiotics, psychotropic plants and fungi, and, most importantly, the human species itself. He shows that human beings are not a plague on the planet, they have a specific ecological function as important to Gaia as that of plants and bacteria. Buhner shows that the capacity for depth connection and meaning-filled communication with the living world is inherent in every human being. It is as natural as breathing, as the beating of our own hearts, as our own desire for intimacy and love. We can change how we think and in so doing begin to address the difficulties of our times.","Body, Mind & Spirit",548,N/A,0,en

"Light Language Emerging: Activating Ascension Codes and Integrating Body, Soul, and Spirit",Yvonne M. Perry,N/A,2014-02-24,"For eons, humans have been locked in a shallow understanding of who we are as spirit beings. While our linear thinking may help us feel safe, it can also limit us from communicating on a deep soul level with our Creator. It is when we bypass human reasoning, if only for a brief moment, that we tap into a realm where we join with something so pure and wonderful that it defies logical explanation. It is these moments that allow us to know that our experiences in those dimensions are more real than our daily lives that greatly ignore the divine aspect of who we are. Light is the language of the soul, which allows us to communicate directly with Source without the interference of the mind, while activating codes to assist with healing and restoration on all levels. Discover the sacred artistic tools of light language for opening DNA strands required for bodily ascension. Learn how to move in sync with Spirit to bring restoration to all creation as you integrate aspects of your multidimensional soul for a unified expression of your highest self. This book includes stories from people who are discovering light language through writing, singing, dancing, signing, and artistic creativity. The author shares her unusual personal experiences to demonstrate how multidimensional aspects of the soul are being incorporated into a unified expression of wholeness. Light Language Emerging helps to bring understanding to a vast, new, and unusual subject: the language of light. When it spontaneously started happening to me many years ago, I had no exposure to it, no one to turn to and no immediate answers. A book like this is not only a catalyst for opening, but it becomes a life line for those having unique experiences as their telepathic communications begin to activate. With Yvonne's book, readers will come to understand their own multi-dimensional nature, their cosmic connection to their galactic family, and their ability to expand beyond limiting perceptions of self and life.

The Way of Beauty,David Clayton,N/A,2015-07-21,"In The Way of Beauty, David Clayton describes how a true Catholic education is both a program of liturgical catechesis and an inculturation that aims for the supernatural transformation of the person so that he can in turn transfigure the whole culture through the divine beauty of his daily action. There is no human activity, no matter how mundane, that cannot be enhanced by this formation in beauty. Such enhanced activity then resonates in harmony with the common good and, through its beauty, draws all people to the Church--and ultimately to the worship of God in the Sacred Liturgy. The Way of Beauty will be of profound interest not only to artists, architects, and composers, but also to educators, who can apply its principles in home and classroom for the formation and education of children and students of all ages and at all levels--family, homeschooling, high school, college, and university. ""Since the good, the true, and the beautiful are a manifestation of the Trinity, it is always a grievous fault to leave beauty out of any discussion of the relationship between faith and reason. This being so, I am thrilled at the way David Clayton illustrates how beauty stands in eternal communion with the good and the true.""--JOSEPH PEARCE, Aquinas College ""In spite of the great proclamation that the sacred liturgy is the font and apex of all we are about as Catholics, fifty years after the Council we still seem far from seeing and living this truth in all its fullness. Drawing upon years of experience as artist and teacher, David Clayton thoroughly unpacks this truth and shows, with an impressive range of examples, how it can and should play out every day in our schools, academic curricula, cultural endeavors, and practice of the fine arts. His treatment of the ways in which architecture, liturgy, and music reflect the mathematical ordering of the cosmos and the hierarchy of created being is illuminating and exciting. The Way of Beauty is a manifesto for the re-integration of the truth laid hold of in intellectual disciplines, the beauty aspired to in art and worship, and the good embodied in morals and manners. Ambitiously integrative yet highly practical, this book ought to be in the hands of every Catholic educator, pastor, and artist.""--PETER KWASNIEWSKI, Wyoming Catholic College ""In The Way of Beauty, David Clayton offers us a mini-liberal arts education. The book is a counter-offensive against a culture that so often seems to have capitulated to a 'will to ugliness.' He shows us the power in beauty not just where we might expect it--in the visual arts and music--but in domains as diverse as math, theology, morality, physics, astronomy, cosmology, and liturgy. But more than that, his study of beauty makes clear the connection between liturgy, culture, and evangelization, and offers a way to reinvigorate our commitment to the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in the twenty-first century. I am grateful for this book and hope many will take its lessons to heart.""--JAY W. RICHARDS, Catholic University of America ""Every pope who has promoted the new evangelization has spoken about how essential 'the way of beauty' is in engaging the modern world with the Gospel. What is it about the experience of beauty that can arrest the heart, crack it open, and stir its deepest longings, leading us on a pilgrimage to God? David Clayton's book provides compelling answers.""--CHRISTOPHER WEST, Founder and President of The Cor Project DAVID CLAYTON is an internationally acclaimed Catholic artist, teacher, and published writer on sacred art, liturgy, and culture.

Historical Theology,Gregg Allison,Zondervan Academic,2011-04-19,"Historical Theology presents the key pillars of the contemporary church and the development of those doctrines as they evolved from the history of Christian thought. Most historical theology texts follow Christian beliefs in a strict chronological manner with the classic theological loci scattered throughout various time periods, movements, and controversies—making for good history but confusing theology. This companion to the classic bestseller Systematic Theology is unique among historical theologies. Gregg Allison sets out the history of Christian doctrine according to a topical-chronological arrangement—one theological element at a time instead of committing to a discussion of theological thought according to its historical appearance alone. This method allows you to: Contemplate one tenet of Christianity at a time, along with its formulation in the early church—through the Middle Ages, Reformation, and post-Reformation era, and into the modern period. Become familiar with the primary source material of Christian history's most important contributors, such as Cyprian, Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, Barth, and others. Understand the development of evangelical doctrine with a focus on the centrality of the gospel. Discern a sense of urgent need for greater doctrinal understanding in the whole church. Historical Theology is an easy-to-read textbook for any Christian who wants to know how the church has come to believe what it believes today. Gregg Allison's clear and concise structure make this resource an ideal introduction to Christian doctrine.",Religion,898,N/A,0,en

Professional Chaplaincy and Clinical Pastoral Education Should Become More Scientific,Larry Van De Creek,Routledge,2013-04-03,"Does the scientific process belong in pastoral counseling? Professional Chaplaincy and Clinical Pastoral Education Should Become More Scientific: Yes and No examines the widespread ambivalence among pastoral caregivers and educators over the growing inclusion of science in pastoral care and counseling methodologies. Twenty-three seasoned professionals in the field give candid and sometimes emotional accounts of their interest in—and reservations about—the role scientific research plays in their profession. Some authors look at the issue from a historical perspective; others voice additional concerns. A few make concrete proposals on how chaplaincy can become more scientific. The result is a unique insight into the relationship between the secular and the religious. The question of whether science belongs in pastoral care and counseling is moot; pastoral care already makes extensive use of psychological testing and psychotherapeutic skills—all products of scientific thinking. But as technology becomes more dominant and health care delivery reflects a more corporate perspective, pastoral caregivers and educators are divided on whether the changes represent the significant opportunity to improve a ministry or the surrender of the ministry’s very essence. The essays collected in Professional Chaplaincy and Clinical Pastoral Education Should Become More Scientific: Yes and No go a step farther, breaking down the issue of faith versus science into more specific questions for pastoral caregivers, such as: Can what you do be measured? Do you have an obligation to embrace the challenge of change? Is becoming more scientific a necessity for staying in touch with your health care peers? How cost effective is the pastoral care you provide if it doesn’t include the scientific process? Could a reluctance to incorporate science into your counseling cost you your job? Professional Chaplaincy and Clinical Pastoral Education Should Become More Scientific: Yes and No presents thoughtful and thought-provoking debate that is a must-read for all pastoral caregivers and educators.",Medical,280,N/A,0,en

You want the benefits of success, influence, and prosperity, and there's nothing wrong with that. It's what God wants for you too! Promotion even comes from God, and though relative to what God has called each person to do, it is available to every born-again believer! But even though promotion comes from God, it isn't God who determines whether you are promoted or not. It's you. You choose to be promoted by choosing to develop an excellent spirit, and in this book, Andrew Wommack will show you how. Using examples from the lives of Daniel and his friends, and from his own life, Andrew outlines the key characteristics of excellence including identity in Christ, true humility, full obedience, endurance, and an uncompromising stand on God's word. In contrast, Andrew also explains the dangers of moral relativity and man-pleasing and how those characteristics often mire believers in a life of mediocrity and impotence. Personal talent, beauty, education, and intelligence are also not what produce promotion; it is a devoted relationship with God. No matter how much money you make or where you live; no matter who your connections are or the color of your skin; it's an excellent spirit that will be the true determiner of your promotion.

What Doesn't Kill Us,Scott Carney,Rodale Books,2017-01-03,"What Doesn't Kill Us, a New York Times bestseller, traces our evolutionary journey back to a time when survival depended on how well we adapted to the environment around us. Our ancestors crossed deserts, mountains, and oceans without even a whisper of what anyone today might consider modern technology. Those feats of endurance now seem impossible in an age where we take comfort for granted. But what if we could regain some of our lost evolutionary strength by simulating the environmental conditions of our ancestors? Investigative journalist and anthropologist Scott Carney takes up the challenge to find out: Can we hack our bodies and use the environment to stimulate our inner biology? Helping him in his search for the answers is Dutch fitness guru Wim Hof, whose ability to control his body temperature in extreme cold has sparked a whirlwind of scientific study. Carney also enlists input from an Army scientist, a world-famous surfer, the founders of an obstacle course race movement, and ordinary people who have documented how they have cured autoimmune diseases, lost weight, and reversed diabetes. In the process, he chronicles his own transformational journey as he pushes his body and mind to the edge of endurance, a quest that culminates in a record-bending, 28-hour climb to the snowy peak of Mt. Kilimanjaro wearing nothing but a pair of running shorts and sneakers. An ambitious blend of investigative reporting and participatory journalism, What Doesn’t Kill Us explores the true connection between the mind and the body and reveals the science that allows us to push past our perceived limitations.",Sports & Recreation,290,5,1,en

Richard Cavendish investigates supernatural agencies which have been involved over the ages with thought and belief in areas far beyond their own immediate spheres of suffering harm and death. These beings and forces include the Devil and the demons of Christian tradition, the evil gods and spirits of paganism, malevolent ghosts, witches, vampires, nightmares, powers of the underworld and hell, giants, dragons and many other sinister creatures of popular belief, as well as the two great evil and inescapable mechanisms of death and fate. He examines recurrent themes and motifs in the context of the ancient world and medieval Europe as well as modern Europe and North America: the connection between evil and the animal world for example, the dread of being devoured, the links between death, evil and sex, the fear of disorder.

How has the Jewish Temple influenced traditional Christian architecture? Does the Pope wear a yarmulke?

In the months after his father's suicide, it's been tough for sixteen-year-old Aaron Soto to find happiness again—but he's still gunning for it. With the support of his girlfriend Genevieve and his overworked mom, he's slowly remembering what that might feel like. But grief and the smile-shaped scar on his wrist prevent him from forgetting completely. When Genevieve leaves for a couple of weeks, Aaron spends all his time hanging out with this new guy, Thomas. Aaron's crew notices, and they're not exactly thrilled. But Aaron can't deny the happiness Thomas brings or how Thomas makes him feel safe from himself, despite the tensions their friendship is stirring with his girlfriend and friends. Since Aaron can't stay away from Thomas or turn off his newfound feelings for him, he considers turning to the Leteo Institute's revolutionary memory-alteration procedure to straighten himself out, even if it means forgetting who he truly is.

Leading the Life You Want,Stewart Friedman,Harvard Business Review Press,2014-09-16,"A Wall Street Journal Bestseller “For nearly thirty years, my life’s work has been to help people like you find ways to bring the often warring aspects of life into greater harmony.” — Stew Friedman, from Leading the Life You Want You’re busy trying to lead a “full” life. But does it really feel full—or are you stretched too thin? Enter Stew Friedman, Wharton professor, adviser to leaders across the globe, and passionate advocate of replacing the misguided metaphor of “work/life balance” with something more realistic and sustainable. If you’re seeking “balance” you’ll never achieve it, argues Friedman. The idea that “work” competes with “life” ignores the more nuanced reality of our humanity—the interaction of four domains: work, home, community, and the private self. The goal is to create harmony among them instead of thinking only in terms of trade-offs. It can be done. Building on his national bestseller, Total Leadership, and on decades of research, teaching, and practice as both consultant and senior executive, Friedman identifies the critical skills for integrating work and the rest of life. He illustrates them through compelling original stories of these remarkable people: • former Bain & Company CEO and Bridgespan co-founder Tom Tierney • Facebook COO and bestselling author Sheryl Sandberg • nonprofit leader and US Navy SEAL Eric Greitens • US First Lady Michelle Obama • soccer champion-turned-broadcaster Julie Foudy • renowned artist Bruce Springsteen Each of these admirable (though surely imperfect) people exemplifies a set of skills—for being real, being whole, and being innovative—that produce a sense of purpose, coherence, and optimism. Based on interviews and research, their stories paint a vivid picture of how six very different leaders use these skills to act with authenticity, integrity, and creativity—and they prove that significant public success is accomplished not at the expense of the rest of life, but as the result of meaningful engagement in all its parts. With dozens of practical exercises for strengthening these skills, curated from the latest research in organizational psychology and related fields, this book will inspire you, inform you, and instruct you on how to take realistic steps now toward leading the life you truly want.",Business & Economics,271,N/A,0,en

Have you ever left a nerve-racking challenge and immediately wished for a do over? Maybe after a job interview, a performance, or a difficult conversation? The very moments that require us to be genuine and commanding can instead cause us to feel phony and powerless. Too often we approach our lives' biggest hurdles with dread, execute them with anxiety, and leave them with regret. By accessing our personal power, we can achieve ""presence,"" the state in which we stop worrying about the impression we're making on others and instead adjust the impression we've been making on ourselves. As Harvard professor Amy Cuddy's revolutionary book reveals, we don't need to embark on a grand spiritual quest or complete an inner transformation to harness the power of presence. Instead, we need to nudge ourselves, moment by moment, by tweaking our body language, behavior, and mind-set in our day-to-day lives. Amy Cuddy has galvanized tens of millions of viewers around the world with her TED talk about ""power poses.""

Glass House,Chinenye Emezie,Penguin Random House South Africa,2021-10-01,"Let me tell you a story. It’s about a war. This war is not the type fought with guns and machetes. It is a family type. A silent war. The type fought in the heart. It began long before I was formed. Udonwa’s family is at war – a war of relationships, played out under the tyranny of a monster dad. Age twelve, Udonwa has a peculiar love of her father, Reverend Leonard Ilechukwu, who favours her but beats his wife and his other children. She sees his good side: after all, he pays the school fees in advance, and tells her that she, named ‘the peaceful child’, is the one most likely to become a doctor in the family. But luck doesn’t last forever. When her newly married eldest sister suddenly takes her from their family compound in Iruama, Nigeria, to live with her in Awka, Udonwa experiences violence first-hand. Later, pieces of a sinister picture emerge that shake her life to the core. No longer the person she thought she was, Udonwa launches into a period of extreme change, and parts of her life spiral into chaos as she finds herself torn between her love for her father and an underlying need to free herself.

Illuminata,Marianne Williamson,Penguin,1995-11-01,"From activist, spiritual leader, New York Times-bestselling author, and 2020 presidential candidate Marianne Williamson comes a prayer for healing America Prayer is practical, Williamson tells us. “To look to God is to look to the realm of consciousness that can deliver us from the pain of living.” Illuminata delivers prayer into our daily lives with prayers on topics from releasing anger to finding forgiveness, from finding great love to achieving intimacy. There are prayers for couples, for parents, and for children, prayers to mend broken relationships and prayers to overcome obsessive and compulsive love. There are prayers to heal the soul, prayers to heal the body, and prayers for work and creativity. Williamson also gives us prayers for the healing of America, including a prayer of amends on behalf of European Americans to African Americans and one to Native Americans. How, Williamson asks, can we expect anyone to forgive when we have made no formal apology? “Read my prayers or someone else’s,” Williamson says. “By all means, create your own.” Illuminata brings prayer into practical use, creating a sweeter, more abundant life. “No conventional therapy,” she says, “can release us from a deep and abiding psychic pain.

Creating True Prosperity,Shakti Gawain,New World Library,2011-02-08,"This practical handbook presents Shakti Gawain's definition of prosperity, one that places importance on the fulfillment of our real desires rather than the amount of money we have. Most people equate prosperity with money — if they only had more of it, they would prosper. In this new, innovative look at self-fulfillment, personal-growth pioneer Shakti Gawain shows us the pitfalls of such thinking — how people, regardless of their wealth, eventually find money fails to offer true contentment. Shakti Gawain presents a new definition of prosperity, one that places importance on fulfillment of the heart and soul rather than on monetary gain. She dismantles the cause-and-effect relationship most people construct around money and happiness, without ignoring the important role money plays in our lives. She challenges us to pay attention to our deepest longings, and yet to discard false desires. Shakti shows us how to create true prosperity, which includes satisfying relationships, happiness, and fulfillment. Her unique method of self-examination helps readers recognize the paradoxical relationships they establish with money. Instead of either denying its value or giving it too much importance, Gawain shows how money can be used to teach people to identify where they need more balance in their lives, freeing them to pursue fulfilling relationships and personal satisfaction — the main ingredients of true prosperity. She speaks with authority and warmth as she sheds new understanding on a subject that concerns us all.",Self-Help,194,4,1,en

Reconstructing Theological Ethics,P. A. McGavin,De Gruyter Poland,2024-02-19,"Theological Ethics in the book title is intended to mark a departure from the manner of Catholic practice named Moral Theology. This departure has two strands, because the practice that the Second Vatican Council critically addressed was a manualist tradition, while much of the practice following the Council has been represented as relativist. This book is not manualist in that the focus is upon method rather than on codified specification of behaviours. The work is not relativist in that the focus on method is firstly scriptural, approaching scripture in a holistic or canonical manner; and, further, is lawful, in an approach of law that focuses less on precept and more on understandings of natural law that brings together phenomenological evidences and scriptural evidences. The scriptural and natural law perspective present in the book also engages cross-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary learnings. These streams of scripture, natural law, and inter/cross-disciplinary learnings have a confluence in discourse in the manner of dialogue, a manner that is dialogical. An essential aspect of dialogue under the banner of Reconstructing Theological Ethics is that it should engage contemporary culture––not in a sense that contemporaneity or modernity should be determinative, but in the sense that the reasoning, argumentation, and dialogue should have resonance with contemporary thinking and rethinking of issues that remain in contention for contemporary audiences.

Monist or holist views agree on the unity of mind and body, but with much debate about what kind, whereas mind-body dualists take body and mind to be metaphysically distinct entities. The question is important for several reasons. Several humanistic and scientific disciplines recognize embodiment as an important dimension of the human condition. One version, the problem of mind-body dualism, is central to the history of both philosophy and religion.

Forgiveness and Reconciliation,"Ani Kalayjian, Raymond F.

We wonder what we can do about the multitude of con?icts currently wreaking havoc across the globe and the continuous reports of violence in communities as well as within families. Most of the time, we contemplate solutions beyond our reach, and overlook a powerful tool that is at our disposal: forgiveness. As a genocide survivor, I know something about it. As the genocide unfolded in Rwanda in 1994, I was devastated by what I believed to be the inevitable deaths of my loved ones. The news that my parents and my seven siblings had indeed been killed was simply unbearable. Anger and bitterness became my daily companions. Likewise, I continued to wonder how the Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda could possibly reconcile after one of the most horrendous genocides of the 20th century. It was not until I came to understand the notion of forgiveness that I was able to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Common wisdom suggests that forgiveness comes after a perpetrator makes a genuine apology. This wisdom informs us that in the aftermath of a wrongdoing, the offender must acknowledge the wrong he or she has done, express remorse, express an apology, commit to never repeating said harm, and make reparations to theextentpossible.Onlythencanthevictimforgiveandagreetoneverseekrevenge.",Psychology,313,4,1,en
Sharing Breath,"Sheila Batacharya, Yuk-Lin Renita Wong",Athabasca University Press,2018-10-31,"Treating bodies as more than discursive in social research can feel out of place in academia. As a result, embodiment studies remain on the outside of academic knowledge construction and critical scholarship. However, embodiment scholars suggest that investigations into the profound division created by privileging the mind-intellect over the body-spirit are integral to the project of decolonization. The field of embodiment theorizes bodies as knowledgeable in ways that include but are not solely cognitive. The contributors to this collection suggest developing embodied ways of teaching, learning, and knowing through embodied experiences such as yoga, mindfulness, illness, and trauma. Although the contributors challenge Western educational frameworks from within and beyond academic settings, they also acknowledge and draw attention to the incommensurability between decolonization and aspects of social justice projects in education. By addressing this tension ethically and deliberately, the contributors engage thoughtfully with decolonization and make a substantial, and sometimes unsettling, contribution to critical studies in education.",Education,408,N/A,0,en

Northward to Eden,Kenneth Conibear,Trafford Publishing,2007-02-26,"In the late 1920's a fur trapper, Jimmie Allen, leaves 'down north' Canada for the first time in his life in order to find a wife. Working at a restaurant in Edmonton, Grasille Jansen dreams of the richer and more exciting lives she has read about in popular magazines as she goes about her work as a waitress. While serving Jimmie, Grasille realizes that Jimmie is a very unusual customer but definitely not a silent man. Words come readily to his tongue and his enthusiastic outpouring of exciting stories of his North (some true, some not) lead to an Othello-like wooing and a speedy marriage when Grasille is convinced that she will find her dream with Jimmie. Together, in a cabin they built together on the Quatre-Fourches River, the real drama of the story - loneliness - is fought out. Knit into this main strand you have the moving story of Susie, Jimmie's part-Indian friend and trapping partner, who was accepted as equal by whites and who refused to take treaty money - except once. He is memorable, even in defeat. Also we have the Cowdrays who run the inevitable, all-purpose store in Fort Chipewyan on the usual liberal, if not generous, credit terms. Grasille has no idyllic time as a trapper's wife and faces many difficulties. She is game and she wins through, with the aid of a remarkable not to say, dramatic, phenomenon of nature.",Fiction,243,N/A,0,en
The Energy of Love,Bruce G Epperly,Energion Publications,2017-08-14,"Today, we need to marshal all the healing resources at our disposal. A growing body of evidence shows that spiritual healing practices have a positive impact, both on healing and on the quality of life that people experience while under medical care. Dr. Bruce Epperly calls on Christians to embrace these varied resources. He crosses both the boundaries between formal scientific medical practice and spiritual healing, and the boundaries between healing practices that come from a variety of spiritual and religious traditions. He then incorporates these into a distinctly Christian theology of healing practice. Where healing takes place, he sees God at work. Healing characterized the ministry of Jesus, and Epperly believes that it should characterize the life and ministry of Christians in all times and places. This is a balanced call that doesn't pit one tradition against another and also does not place spiritual healing practices in opposition to medical science. This is about embracing what heals. Today, we need to marshal all the healing resources at our disposal.","Body, Mind & Spirit",43,N/A,0,en

Secret Journey to Planet Serpo,Len Kasten,Simon and Schuster,2013-05-05,"Documents how 12 people, as part of a top-secret U.S. government program, traveled to the planet Serpo and lived there for 13 years • Based on the debriefing of the Serpo team and the diary of the expedition’s commander • Explains how the aliens helped us reverse-engineer their antigravity spacecraft and develop technology to solve our planet-wide energy problems • Reveals how our government has an ongoing relationship with the Serpo aliens On July 16, 1965, a massive alien spacecraft from the Zeta Reticuli star system landed at the Nevada test site north of Las Vegas. Following a plan set in motion by President Kennedy in 1962, the alien visitors known as the Ebens welcomed 12 astronaut-trained military personnel aboard their craft for the 10-month journey to their home planet, Serpo, 39 light-years away. In November 2005, former and current members of the Defense Intelligence Agency--directed by Kennedy to organize the Serpo exchange program--came forward to reveal the operation, including details from the 3,000-page debriefing of the 7 members of the Serpo team who returned after 13 years on the planet. Working with the DIA originators of the Serpo project and the diary kept by the expedition’s commanding officer, Len Kasten chronicles the complete journey of these cosmic pioneers, including their remarkable stories of life on an alien planet, superluminal space travel, and advanced knowledge of alien technologies. He reveals how the Ebens presented the U.S. with “The Yellow Book”--a complete history of the universe recorded holographically, allowing the reader to view actual scenes from pre-history to the present. He explains how the Ebens helped us reverse-engineer their antigravity spacecraft and develop technology to solve our planet-wide energy problems--knowledge still classified. Exposing the truth of human-alien interaction and interplanetary travel, Kasten reveals not only that the Ebens have returned to Earth eight times but also that our government continues to have an ongoing relationship with them--a relationship with the potential to advance the human race into the future.","Body, Mind & Spirit",262,3,2,en

Long-Term Marriage in Maldives: A Cross-Sectional Study,Dr. Aishath Naila,Shineeks Publishers,2022-07-13,"This book is about the outcome of a study that assessed factors that affect long-term marriages (10 or more years, spouses age 30-59 years) in the Maldives. Marriage is an evolving institution that contributes to diversifying the human race. In Islam marriage is a sacred bond that shapes a better society. Recent research on marriage observed that the rate of marriage is declining and the rate of divorce is increasing. For example, in the Maldives for every 2.3 marriages, one marriage ended in divorce. There is no study to date conducted in the Maldives about the factors that may be associated with retaining long-term marriages. Thus, this book aims to explore factors of long-term marriage which could be applied during marital therapy/counseling to aid in couple therapy intervention and future research. The book describes the association between long-term marital factors such as religiosity, spirituality, self-awareness, perception of a long-term marriage, and demographics. The book provides tips for researchers, counselors, and psychologists when handling clients with marital conflicts.",Education,77,N/A,0,en

"A Transpacific Imagination of Theology, Ethics, and Spiritual Activism",Keun-joo Christine Pae,Springer Nature,2023-12-25,"Despite prolific feminist voices in Christian ethics, transnational perspectives are still underdeveloped. Similarly, ‘secular’ transnational feminist scholarship often overlooks religious faith, rituals, and spirituality, crucial to many women’s liberation movements across the globe. This book aims to fill these gaps in Christian and secular feminist scholarships by constructing a transnational feminist theo-ethics. Furthermore, by bringing the theological and the transnational together, the book offers an alternative tool in analyzing social identities beyond intersectionality (i.e., interstitial approach and interstitial integrity) and thus, renews feminist theological understandings, especially of time, memories, and healing beyond linear approaches. A renewed analytical tool would help the readers critically reinterrogate the global power structure buttressed by empire, militarized capitalism, and heteropatriarchal religious ideologies at the cost of raced, sexed, and classed bodies. At the same time, the book would create space where readers create and recreate theo-ethical visions for global peace and justice constructed upon transnational feminist praxis of solidarity and spiritual activism. Case studies offer concrete sites to inform readers about how to use transnational feminist theories at a micro- and macropolitical levels, and produce transnational feminist knowledge of God, spiritual activism, and solidarity. This book is written for graduate and advanced undergraduate students in religion, gender studies, and Asian/American studies to critically engage in the political, the theological, and the spiritual from transnational perspectives not as observers but as active participants in global politics.",Religion,207,N/A,0,en

Three Concepts of Time,K. G. Denbigh,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The existence of so many strangely puzzling, even contradictory, aspects of 'time' is due, I think, to the fact that we obtain our ideas about temporal succession from more than one source - from inner experience, on the one side, and from the physical world on the other. 'Time' is thus a composite notion and as soon as we distinguish clearly between the ideas deriving from the different sources it becomes apparent that there is not just one time-concept but several. Perhaps they should be called variants, but in any case they need to be seen as distinct. In this book I shall aim at characteri sing what I believe to be the three most basic of them. These form a sort of hierarchy of increasing richness, but diminishing symmetry. Any adequate inquiry into 'time' is necessarily partly scientific and partly philosophical. This creates a difficulty since what may be elementary reading to scientists may not be so to philosophers, and vice versa. For this reason I have sought to present the book at a level which is less 'advanced' than that of a specialist monograph. Due to my own background there is an inevitable bias towards the scientific aspects oftime. Certainly the issues I have taken up are very diffe rent from those discussed in several recent books on the subject by philoso phers.",Mathematics,185,N/A,0,en

The Twelve Monotasks,Thatcher Wine,Hachette UK,2022-01-06,"Neurological research definitively and repeatedly concludes that there is a bottleneck in our cognitive function - when we do more than one thing at a time, we become less efficient and more error-prone. Our systems get overloaded and we crash. In fact, we are actually wired to monotask - to give dedicated focus to one task at a time. Whether you call it monotasking, mindfulness, being present, or any other name, the goal is the same: Give your focus to one thing at a time and do it with your all. When we do things with our full focus, completely tuning our bodies and our brains in to one activity-like reading a book, listening to someone in a conversation, or paying attention to our surroundings while we go for a walk - amazing things can happen. Drawing on research in cognitive science, neuroscience, and mindfulness, The Twelve Monotasks shows that by concentrating on twelve everyday activities and approaching them with a focused mindset, we can rebuild and expand our attention spans. When we focus on what we are doing, where we are and who we are with, we can rediscover our ability to enjoy life, connect with others, and succeed in all that we do. And in the end, it makes us happier, more productive, and more present - in all aspects of our lives.",Self-Help,264,N/A,0,en
The Future Imaginary in Indigenous North American Arts and Literatures,Kristina Baudemann,Routledge,2021-12-30,"This book examines the future in Indigenous North American speculative literature and digital arts. Asking how different Indigenous works imagine the future and how they negotiate settler colonial visions of what is to come, the chapters illustrate that the future is not an immutable entity but a malleable textual/digital product that can function as both a colonial tool and a catalyst for decolonization. Central to this study is the development of a methodology that helps unearth the signifying structures producing the future in selected works by Darcie Little Badger, Gerald Vizenor, Stephen Graham Jones, Skawennati, Danis Goulet, Scott Benesiinaabandan, Postcommodity, Kite, Jeff Barnaby, and Ryan Singer. Drawing on Jason Lewis’s ""future imaginary"" as the theoretical core, the book describes the various forms of textual representation and virtual simulation through which notions of Indigenous continuation are expressed in literary and new media works. Arguing that Indigenous authors and artists apply the aesthetics of the future as a strategy in their works, the volume conceptualizes its multimedia corpus as a continuously growing archive of, and for, Indigenous futures.",Social Science,191,N/A,0,en

Green draws these practices from more than twenty years of experience working in alternative therapies areas, counseling, clairvoyant work, energy healing, grief and transition ceremonies, and meditation days in the forests in and around Melbourne, Victoria. Pathways to Restore the Feminine presents thoughtful and caring words of guidance and inspiration for women, showing that ritual and meditation are easy once you make a habit of creating time throughout your day.","Body, Mind & Spirit",153,N/A,0,en

Rebirthing Into Androgyny,Berenice Andrews,Balboa Press,2012-11,"In these ""interesting times,"" when many people are searching for spiritual nourishment, this book is intended to be a means of providing it. Rebirthing Into Androgyny: Your Quest For Wholeness, And Afterward offers to the hungry ones a familiar yet totally different feast. While it sets forth an already-established metaphysics, it also presents a radical new idea--one that has been implicit in that spiritual thought but unavailable until now and the new awareness associated with quantum physics. In other words, while this book provides soul searchers--also known as learners--with an ages-old means of generating a fundamental inner change (a rebirthing), it also provides a new, living prototype of what is being reborn. Thus, a person's rebirthing is both a gestation and a labor (a quest) producing an ever-increasing knowing (""gnosis""), which gradually becomes being that can finally merge with the Beloved/Self. And the new, living prototype is that of the human soul, not as what a person has but as what a person is: a creative energy being who generates its own ""bodies"" out of its soul substance--its creative consciousness energy--by means of its archetypal human energy system, while always being guided by its nucleus of divinity. In this book, which is a textbook for soul searchers, all of this transformative change is offered, explored and explained in a series of carefully-crafted lessons lovingly taught by a shamanic teacher/healer in a stone circle ""classroom,"" the ancient site of a modern teaching. There is a grand feast awaiting! The cover design was created by Paula Kozak, Sarasota, Florida: set in a circle representing the Unity of the Cosmos, the Oneness that includes all people, the hexagram is an ancient symbol of androgyny. The Nordic rune ""Dagaz"" across its center signifies breakthrough and transformation. The gold of the hexagram against the white background indicates the ever-present divine energies that guide and sustain, while the light spectrum surrounding the circle and extending in all directions indicates the auric ""field"" of a human energy being, inseparable from its Creator.","Body, Mind & Spirit",403,N/A,0,en
"Inner Mastery, Outer Impact",Hitendra Wadhwa,Hachette UK,2022-08-18,"In our pursuit of success, we often struggle to balance the world's demands with our own dreams. Some of us pursue Outer Success, wanting to be liked and loved, supported and promoted. But in our quest for worldly glory, we may ignore the subtle stirring of our spirit, waking up one day to realize just how far we have drifted from our personal ideals. Others among us seek Inner Success, wanting the freedom to pursue our own calling. But in our quest to be true to ourselves, we may end up hurting, disappointing, or antagonizing others, straining relationships and being sidelined. It seems that our drives for Outer and Inner Success are destined to clash. But perhaps that's only because we've been searching for success in the wrong places. We can pursue from the place where our greatest potential is held, our Inner Core, by activating Five Core Energies: Purpose, Wisdom, Growth, Love, and Self-Realization. Through extensive scientific research and masterful storytelling about exemplary figures like Mahatma Gandhi, Abraham Lincoln, Mother Theresa, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Nelson Mandela--and everyday heroes drawn from Dr. Hitendra Wadhwa's class at Columbia Business School and client workshops at Mentora Institute--readers arrive at timeless principles of success in life and leadership. Empowered by your Five Core Energies, you discover how to create outer impact from a place of inner mastery. With a PhD in Management Science from MIT and a lifelong study of the world's mystic traditions, Wadhwa brings a mathematician's rigor and a truth-seeker's spirit to some of today's most vexing questions about authenticity, success, leadership, and human potential. This book shows how by activating your Inner Core and expressing it in everything you do, you create the conditions where Inner Success and Outer Success can flourish in mutual harmony.","Body, Mind & Spirit",358,N/A,0,en

Natural Chi Movement,Tienko Ting,North Atlantic Books,2011-03-08,"The modern world is largely focused on the physical—on the appetites and senses, on doing and having—which can blind us to the spiritual realm. In Natural Chi Movement, Tienko Ting articulates a theory of life that unites the physical and spiritual worlds. He suggests there is nothing to learn or master; each of us—and every living thing—is a product of the merging of physical and spiritual energy, already endowed with the capacity to thrive and heal. Activation of our chi is the component to wellness that most of us have been missing. It is the essence of the practice of Natural Chi Movement. Natural Chi Movement guides modern seekers in embracing their spiritual nature and accessing the boundless potential of energy. Doing so, says Ting, can also help address global problems from health care to ecology. Featuring 23 illustrations, the book draws on Chinese history, philosophy, and medicine, as well as from the author’s own work with spiritual energy. Natural Chi Movement is an exploration into the nature of spiritual energy and how to access and use it for vibrant health and optimal well being. Written in a simple, lucid style, Natural Chi Movement sheds much-needed light on the nature of the energy that makes up all life, opening up a world of extraordinary healing for everyone.","Body, Mind & Spirit",290,N/A,0,en
Music and Modernity Among First Peoples of North America,"Victoria Levine Lindsay Levine, Dylan Robinson",Wesleyan University Press,2021-02-01,"In this wide-ranging anthology, scholars offer diverse perspectives on ethnomusicology in dialogue with critical Indigenous studies. This volume is a collaboration between Indigenous and settler scholars from both Canada and the United States. The contributors explore the intersections between music, modernity, and Indigeneity in essays addressing topics that range from hip-hop to powwow, and television soundtracks of Native Classical and experimental music. Working from the shared premise that multiple modernities exist for Indigenous peoples, the authors seek to understand contemporary musical expression from Native perspectives and to decolonize the study of Native American/First Nations music. The essays coalesce around four main themes: innovative technology, identity formation and self-representation, political activism, and translocal musical exchange. Related topics include cosmopolitanism, hybridity, alliance studies, code-switching, and ontologies of sound. Featuring the work of both established and emerging scholars, the collection demonstrates the centrality of music in communicating the complex, diverse lived experience of Indigenous North Americans in the twenty-first century.",Music,361,N/A,0,en

Making Contact,Alan Steinfeld,St. Martin's Essentials,2021-05-04,"""I feel it is one of the best approaches I have found to grasp the most jarring enigma humanity has ever faced."" —George Noory, host of Coast to Coast AM “We cannot separate the earth from its greater cosmic environment. What is needed is a new story and Alan Steinfeld’s Making Contact is part of that story.” —Deepak Chopra, Author, Total Meditation How can we prepare for an event that is literally beyond anything humanity has ever faced? Making Contact presents multiple perspectives on what no longer can be denied: UFOs and their occupants are visiting our world. The book answers questions which remain in the wake of the recent Pentagon’s disclosures as to who and why these beings are here. The volume contains original writings by the leading experts of the phenomena such as: Linda Moulton Howe, Earthfiles reporter, Whitley Strieber best-selling author of Communion, Professor John E. Mack, former head of the Harvard Medical school of psychiatry and an alien abduction investigator, Darryl Anka internationally known for his communication with the extraterrestrial Bashar, Nick Pope, former UK Ministry of Defense UFO investigator, Grant Cameron expert on American presidents and UFOs, Drs. J.J. and Desiree Hurtak, globalists and founders of the worldwide organization, The Academy for Future Science, Caroline Cory, director of Superhuman and ET: Contact, Mary Rodwell, author of the New Human about star-seed children, Henrietta Weekes, actress and writer, expressing the poetic aspects of making contact. Alan Steinfeld, contributes and curates the collection with 30 years of experience with the subject. The Foreword by George Noory of Coast to Coast AM kicks off the volume with his veteran overview of the need to wake up to the “new realities of extraterrestrial existence.” At this critical juncture in the government’s official acknowledgement of the reality of UFOs/UAPs, scientists, politicians and mainstream news outlets have no idea what to make of these startling revelations or the outpouring of sightings and “contact” experiences currently being reported on a global scale. The book stands as the most comprehensive clarification to date on the intent and intelligence behind the phenomena. The variety of viewpoints expressed in the volume provide a solid foundation for the “preparation” of the greatest challenge to ever face humankind. Making Contact stands as the essential handbook for embracing the most exalted moment in history: Meeting the cosmic others.","Body, Mind & Spirit",185,N/A,0,en
The 13th Disciple,Deepak Chopra,Harper Collins,2015-03-31,"The New York Times bestselling author of Buddha and Jesus weaves together historical narrative, mystery, exciting adventure, and intrigue in this masterfully told novel that reveals surprising discoveries about the unknown last disciple of Christ, and a new understanding of who Jesus was in his final days. When a solid gold reliquary missing from a church in Belgium suddenly resurfaces in America, a young newspaperman begins to investigate the story. At first, it seems like just another case of a treasure stolen during World War II that has resurfaced. But it soon becomes apparent that much more is at stake. Hidden within the medieval reliquary is a gold box that holds a sacred relic—a single finger bone—from an anonymous saint. Why would the remains of someone unknown to the Church be considered holy? The search for answers leads to a shocking discovery—a dangerous secret known only to a small band of people. If one touches the reliquary, a sacred vision is received—a vision involving a young girl who had a chance encounter with Jesus just before he was crucified. The few people who have been blessed with these miraculous messages have banded together into a mysterious school, a closed society that preserves this venerated wisdom. But their knowledge of the young girl and Jesus is at once so fascinating yet so highly controversial that it cannot be shared with the world. This young girl, curious about the charismatic man named Jesus, embarks on a quest to find out who he really was. What she finds—the knowledge the society protects—is at times far different from the accepted gospels. Could this unknown girl be the 13th Disciple—the last and truest apostle of Christ?",Self-Help,205,N/A,0,en

This practical approach allows them to explore broader issues of personality theory and psychology from the perspectives of various spiritual traditions: Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

Why Religion and Spirituality Matter for Public Health,Doug Oman,Springer,2018-05-08,"This volume reviews the exploding religion/spirituality (R/S) and health literature from a population health perspective. It emphasizes the distinctive Public Health concern for promoting health and preventing disease in societies, nations, and communities, as well as individuals. Part I offers a rigorous review of mainstream biomedical and social scientific theory and evidence on R/S-health relations. Addressing key gaps in previous literature, it reviews evidence from a population health viewpoint, surveying pertinent findings and theories from the perspective of Public Health subfields that range from Environmental Health Sciences to Public Health Nutrition to Health Policy & Management and Public Health Education. In Part II, practitioners describe in detail how attending to R/S factors enhances the work of clinicians and community health practitioners. R/S provides an additional set of concepts and tools to address opportunities and challenges ranging from behavior and institutional change to education, policy, and advocacy. Part III empowers educators, analyzing pedagogical needs and offering diverse short chapters by faculty who teach R/S-health connections in many nationally top-ranked Schools of Public Health. International and global perspectives are highlighted in a concluding chapter and many places throughout the volume. This book addresses a pressing need for Public Health research, practice and teaching: A substantial evidence base now links religious and spiritual (R/S) factors to health. In the past 20 years, over 100 systematic reviews and 30 meta-analyses on R/S-health were published in refereed journals. But despite this explosion of interest, R/S factors remain neglected in Public Health teaching and research. Public Health lags behind related fields such as medicine, psychology, and nursing, where R/S factors receive more attention. This book can help Public Health catch up. It offers abundant key resources to empower public health professionals, instructors, and students to address R/S, serving at once as a course text, a field manual and a research handbook.",Social Science,478,N/A,0,en

Frequency,Penney Peirce,Simon and Schuster,2011-08-16,"Frequency gives readers the tools to understand how and why their natural frequency interacts with the world around them. Because we see the world from a physical perspective, we often don't notice what's right in front of us -- that our spirit, thoughts, emotions, and body are all made of energy. Inside us and everywhere around us, life is vibrating. In fact, each of us has a personal vibration that accurately communicates who we are to the world and helps shape our reality. Frequency shows readers how to feel their personal vibration, improve it, and use it to shift their life from ordinary to extraordinary. A simple shift in frequency can change depression to peace, anger to stillness, and fear to enthusiasm. Weaving together basic ideas from quantum physics with proven intuition development techniques, Frequency takes readers into deeper concepts only hinted at in recent popular books and DVD's featuring the Law of Attraction. By learning to refine the ""conscious sensitivity"" of their body, readers can improve relationships, find upscale solutions to problems, and materialize a life that contains everything they want and need to live their destiny. Frequency gives readers a reassuring, step-by-step roadmap into a positive state of awareness that Peirce calls The Intuition Age. By learning to use ""frequency principles"" -- methods based on the way energy actually functions -- readers can keep their energy level high and productive, receive subtle information directly from the environment via ""empathic resonance,"" and quickly free themselves from negative or low ""vibrations.""","Body, Mind & Spirit",384,N/A,0,en

The SAGE Encyclopedia of African Cultural Heritage in North America,"Mwalimu J. Shujaa, Kenya J. Shujaa",SAGE Publications,2015-07-13,"The Encyclopedia of African Cultural Heritage in North America provides an accessible ready reference on the retention and continuity of African culture within the United States. Our conceptual framework holds, first, that culture is a form of self-knowledge and knowledge about self in the world as transmitted from one person to another. Second, that African people continuously create their own cultural history as they move through time and space. Third, that African descended people living outside of Africa are also contributors to and participate in the creation of African cultural history. Entries focus on illuminating Africanisms (cultural retentions traceable to an African origin) and cultural continuities (ongoing practices and processes through which African culture continues to be created and formed). Thus, the focus is more culturally specific and less concerned with the broader transatlantic demographic, political and geographic issues that are the focus of similar recent reference works. We also focus less on biographies of individuals and political and economic ties and more on processes and manifestations of African cultural heritage and continuity.

Our Wild Calling,Richard Louv,Algonquin Books,2020-11-10,"“A book that offers hope.” —The New York Times Book Review “A wondrous tapestry.” —Carl Safina, author of Beyond Words: What Animals Think and Feel Audubon Medal winner Richard Louv’s landmark book Last Child in the Woods inspired an international movement to connect children and nature. Now he redefines the future of human-animal coexistence. In Our Wild Calling, Louv interviews researchers, theologians, wildlife experts, indigenous healers, psychologists, and others to show how people are connecting with animals in ancient and new ways, and how this serves as an antidote to the growing epidemic of human loneliness; how dogs can teach children ethical behavior; how animal-assisted therapy may yet transform the mental health field; and what role the human-animal relationship plays in our spiritual health. He reports on wildlife relocation and on how the growing populations of wild species in urban areas are blurring the lines between domestic and wild animals. Our Wild Calling makes the case for protecting, promoting, and creating a sustainable and shared habitat for all creatures—not out of fear, but out of love.

The Altar Within,Juliet Diaz,Simon and Schuster,2022-04-05,"In her third and most important work, Juliet Diaz, the bestselling author of Witchery, offers an approach to Magic, spirituality, and healing like no other and takes readers through the deep work of decolonizing their spirituality. The Altar Within: A Radical Devotional to Liberate the Divine Self is a work of spiritual revolution for all peoples, offering them practices and rituals in the arts of self-worship, self-discovery, and self-activism. The Altar Within is like no other approach to Spirituality, breaking through the vicious cycles of harmful and toxic spiritual practices and beliefs. Diaz speaks for those victimized and enslaved by colonization and offers a new take on personal development based in the resounding plea of our ancestors to live our Divined lives, the ones they could not have for themselves. In the book, Diaz leads the reader through an exploration of: Self-Worship: Here, the reader comes to ritualize the experiences of self-compassion, mindfulness, self-acceptance, and radical self-honesty, creating practices that help them to see their Divinity and Altar within. Through these rites, readers will have a better understanding of what it means to decolonize their Spirituality, giving birth to new spiritual practices while honoring the experiences of our ancestors. Dismantling the idea that Divinity must only exist from without, Diaz takes readers on a journey of powerful Self-Worship, connecting them into the Divinity that resides within all of us. Self-Discovery: In this section, Diaz helps the reader to discover their Divined lives, but in a way that most teachers haven't offered. As Diaz shares, it isn't through our achievements that we find our purpose but through understanding the Divine self. Here, Diaz leads readers through practices in self-love, self-patience, and self-forgiveness, helping them to experience the stillness and wholeness needed to hear the messages shared by the Divine. Self-Activism: Unlike traditional manifestation teachers, Diaz recognizes that manifestations are not brought forth by #goodvibesonly but by a real and committed process of activism, standing in our deep worth and sharing our humanity. In this section, Diaz offers a series of Devotionals to guide readers in the practice of Community Care, connecting the work not only with the Magic of manifestation but with our communities, our ancestors, and the Divine Self within. Pushing back on #lightandlove and #goodvibesonly, Diaz dismantles the wellness industry, releasing readers from the practice of spiritual bypassing into a far more powerful experience of self, healing, hope, and Spirit. This book is for anyone, including those who can't afford to buy all the tools, pay for the expensive memberships, people who have real-life issues, illnesses, and hardships. Through The Altar Within, Diaz brings the Magic to real life, acknowledging our humanness by connecting with our Spirit. The Altar Within will help readers create success in every area of their lives—from wealth, health, relationships, and personal development, to the nourishment of their relationship with the Divine self. As Diaz explains, when we can finally decolonize our spiritual beliefs, Divinity can be a super force in our lives, making us whole, stronger, wiser, and setting us on a path of transcendent activism. #magicalaf Bonus Gifts: Your copy of The Altar Within comes with a very special gift for readers.

Featuring new stories specially commissioned for the collection this offering of H.P. Lovecraft's shared universe is a thrilling immersion into the world of Old Ones and the Elder Gods, an ancient race of terrifying beings. In Lovecraft's vision we live in a deep, but fragile illusion, unable to comprehend the ancient beings, such as the Cthulhu who lies dead but dreaming in the submerged city of R'lyeh, waiting to rise then wreak havoc on our realm of existence. Lovecraft used the mythos to create a background to his fiction, and challenged many writer companions to add their own stories. Clark Ashton Smith, Robert E. Howard, Robert Bloch, Frank Belknap Long, Henry Kuttner were amongst the first but over the years many others such as Ramsey Campbell, Lin Carter and August Derleth added their voices to the many mythic cycles, developing themes and new fictional pathways for the town of Arkham, and the creatures Azathoth and Nyarlathotep. The Lovecraft Mythos is fertile ground for any writer of supernatural, horror, fantasy and science fiction, so for this edition we opened our submissions for brand new stories, many published here for the first time, to continue expanding the shared universe.",Fiction,480,N/A,0,en

Mystifying concepts are explained in straightforward ways so the general public, as well as clients and novice psychics, can understand and become familiar with them.

A Practical Guide to Vibrational Medicine,Richard Gerber,Harper Collins,2013-09-24,"A potent self-help guide to the profound new science of vibrational medicine. At the dawn of the twenty-first century, the old paradigms of medicine are beginning to fall apart. We no longer believe that our bodies are machines with parts that wear down, only to be braced up by drugs or replaced through surgery. Instead, a growing number of pioneering researchers embrace a new view of healing—one expounded by Dr. Richard Gerber in his groundbreaking bestseller, Vibrational Medicine. Here Dr. Gerber shows how to put this new way of thinking into practical use, describing the role of consciousness and “thought forms,” as well as the benefits of homeopathy, acupuncture, color and light healing, magnetobiology, and other therapies. A traditionally trained physician, Dr. Gerber combines scientific evidence with traditional methods from the East and West to unlock our potential for healing ourselves. “If you are ready to go on a personal search for energetic/vibrational health, this book is a must.” —C.

Mind Over Mind,Morton Klass,Rowman & Littlefield,2003,"Mind Over Mind explores the phenomenon of spirit possession from both anthropological and psychological perspectives. Spirit possession is ritually important in many cultures from India to Brazil to Madagascar, but has tended to be narrowly regarded from modern American and European perspectives as a psychopathological problem of multiple personality disorder. This book proposes an integration of anthropological and psychological approaches, concluding with a new analytical framework for understanding spirit possession and resolving the controversy surrounding the ""reality"" of possession. The issues raised are thus essential to both the anthropology of religion and the psychology of altered states of consciousness. At the same time, Mind over Mind confronts the most challenging philosophical issues of human consciousness and human identity, which can not be properly formulated without the insights of social and cultural anthropology. At the most general level, this study argues for the unequivocal importance of an interdisciplinary approach to spirit possession and for the integral significance of anthropology for the other human sciences.","Body, Mind & Spirit",156,N/A,0,en

In Search of Stanislavsky’s Creative State on the Stage,Gabriela Curpan,Routledge,2021-04-12,"This book rediscovers a spiritual way of preparing the actor towards experiencing that ineffable artistic creativity defined by Konstantin Stanislavski as the creative state.

Throughout the book, Gabriela Curpan aims to question both the cartesian approach to acting and the realist-psychological line, generally viewed as the only features of Stanislavski’s work.

Lao-tzu, whose name means “the ancient child,” wrote these brief but essential verses that have both confounded and conferred blessings on humankind. Now Taoist masters Mantak Chia and Tao Huang guide readers through the origins of this philosophy, the meaning behind its 5,000 pictographs, and the way of living that generations have followed. While the text of the Tao Te Ching has been passed down in literary form for generations, the essence of the text can be understood only through heart awakening--a true integration of body and mind--made possible with the insights and exercises in this book. The authors analyze Lao-tzu's teachings, line by line, and offer meditations, interpretations, and practical illustrations that clarify the true meaning and purpose of this classic text.","Body, Mind & Spirit",231,N/A,0,en

Is prayer of benefit? If so, what kind of prayers? What about ""laying on of hands"" or ""casting out demons?"" Over three-fourths of patients entering a hospital wish that their health-care providers would consider their spiritual needs as part of their medical care. Yet, most patients-along with their health-care professionals-struggle to understand how to use this spiritual side in healing. Modern healthcare is based upon science and often sees religion as getting in the way of healing. However, when humans combine our religious and spiritual nature with the science of modern medicine, we have the most powerful tool for healing the world has ever known. This book dares to explore this very personal aspect of human life that has had very little written about it-the private spiritual beliefs that people share with their doctors, spiritual advisors, and families when they are ill, injured, or frightened about their health. Here are the true stories of how people have used their spiritual side for healing. Many will mystify and give us chills!","Body, Mind & Spirit",250,N/A,0,en

Author Lyles traces the history of laying-on of hands and shares the how-to information about this healing modality in twelve easy-reading chapters. Reiki (Ray-Key) is now considered by many medical experts to be an important component of (w)holistic healing. It is currently used in over one hundred hospitals in the United States, including Sloan Kettering in New York. Its gentle, non-invasive ways, which help balance the endocrine system, help you feel and heal better. It is the subtle energy system that is the essence of life. Readers Comments about Reiki & You ... I encourage all health practitioners to learn to utilize the principles involved in Reiki in conjunction with conventional medical care. I believe the results would amaze them. Those interested in assuming some responsibility for their own health, as well as improving the lives and health of those around them, should read this book as their first step in their journey towards better health and enlightenment. Kent C. Kyzar, M.D., Yazoo, MS The historic religious roots found in chapter two were comforting and assuring to someone who looks for validation with God and science. As I learned more about the strength from within to heal, I found I was on a new threshold of ancient origin, one that feels and sounds exciting and divine in its sense of vocation and of empowerment.

By examining her own and other women's postcollege longing for spirituality, she attempts to unravel the dilemma of a generation that didn't grow up with a religious emphasis. The result is one of the first books to mirror young women's yearning for a spiritual path they can fully and wholeheartedly embrace.",Social Science,294,N/A,0,en

A Family Guide to Spiritual Warfare,Kathleen Beckman,Sophia Institute Press,2020-09-11,"Demons wage war against families because families are vital to God's plan of salvation. This stark reality requires that your family members become well-trained spiritual warriors who actively secure your home and fight to keep it off-limits to demonic activity. In A Family Guide to Spiritual Warfare, Kathleen Beckman offers you potent advice from her 12 years of active participation on an exorcist's team. She shows you how to “clean up” your household by cultivating in your family a civilization of love — and how to withstand the spiritual attacks that inevitably come to destroy the harmonious family life you create. Beckman reveals how you can recognize diabolical disguises in your home and offers proven means of protection found only in the Church's arsenal of spiritual weapons. You'll also learn the devil's strategies — how he does not necessarily seek to possess but simply to seed your family with the venom of hatred, desolation, envy, and vice. This, she explains, is why it's so important for spouses and children to become schooled in the art of spiritual combat. It's the only way you can destroy the works of the devil and unmask the hidden evil that weaves in and out of your daily family life. Along with more than two dozen effective prayers for family healing and deliverance, you'll also learn: How to understand the spirits working for — and against — your family, and what to do in response to them What specific actions to take if you believe your family has come under the influence of demonic activity How to use your baptismal, spousal, and parental authority in spiritual warfare How curses can become effective — and what can be done to counteract them The difference between diabolical temptation, oppression, obsession, and possession The seven ways your family can wear the full armor of God The diabolical counterparts to each of the Ten Commandments and the Beatitudes The 13 weapons you can use to defend yourself and your family against evil spirits",Religion,250,N/A,0,en

Black Women's Yoga History,Stephanie Y. Evans,State University of New York Press,2021-03-01,"How have Black women elders managed stress? In Black Women's Yoga History, Stephanie Y. Evans uses primary sources to answer that question and to show how meditation and yoga from eras of enslavement, segregation, and migration to the Civil Rights, Black Power, and New Age movements have been in existence all along. Life writings by Harriet Jacobs, Sadie and Bessie Delany, Eartha Kitt, Rosa Parks, Jan Willis, and Tina Turner are only a few examples of personal case studies that are included here, illustrating how these women managed traumatic stress, anxiety, and depression. In more than fifty yoga memoirs, Black women discuss practices of reflection, exercise, movement, stretching, visualization, and chanting for self-care. By unveiling the depth of a struggle for wellness, memoirs offer lessons for those who also struggle to heal from personal, cultural, and structural violence. This intellectual history expands conceptions of yoga and defines inner peace as mental health, healing, and wellness that is both compassionate and political.",Social Science,555,N/A,0,en

Sheol Know!,Dirk Waren,N/A,2015-06-08,"What happens to the soul & spirit of unsaved people when they die? This refers to anyone who has not experienced spiritual regeneration through the gospel, which includes Old Testament saints. The Bible shows that the souls of these people go to (or went to) Sheol at the point of physical decease. Sheol corresponds to Hades. These souls will be resurrected from Sheol one day (Revelation 20:11-15), which is why Sheol/Hades is described as the ""intermediate state"" since it refers to the condition of unredeemed souls between physical death and later resurrection. So what's the state of souls in Sheol/Hades? Jesus' story of the rich man and Lazarus, if taken literal, suggests a conscious state where people either hang out in bliss with father Abraham or suffer constant fiery torment hoping for a mere drop of water for relief. SHEOL KNOW is an honest and thorough examination of the Scriptures to determine the precise nature of Sheol/Hades. Once you see what God's Word FULLY SAYS on the subject from Genesis to Revelation and not just a single tale that Jesus told, you'll see the truth and, as Jesus said, ""the truth shall set you FREE.""",,342,N/A,0,en

Their subjects include a girl whose baby brother helped her overcome anorexia, a woman whose cancer helped her heal by teaching her to stand up for herself, and a family that was saved from a burning house by bats. Without diminishing the reality of pain and hardship, the stories show real people turning crisis into blessing by responding to adversity in ways that empower and heal.

Troward was an English writer whose works inspired the New Thought Movement and mystic Christianity. Excerpt: ""There is a very general recognition, which is growing day by day more and more widespread, that there is a sort of hidden power somewhere which it is within our ability, somehow or other, to use. The ideas on this subject are exceedingly vague with the generality of people, but still they are assuming a more and more definite form, and that which they appear to be taking with the generality of the public is the recognition of the power of suggestion. I suppose none of us doubts that there is such a thing as the power of suggestion and that it can produce very great results indeed, and that it is par excellence a hidden power; it works behind the scenes, it works through what we know as the subconscious mind, and consequently its activity is not immediately recognisable, or the source from which it comes.""",Fiction,145,N/A,0,en

The Leader in Me,Stephen R. Covey,Simon and Schuster,2012-12-11,"Children in today's world are inundated with information about who to be, what to do and how to live. But what if there was a way to teach children how to manage priorities, focus on goals and be a positive influence on the world around them? The Leader in Meis that programme. It's based on a hugely successful initiative carried out at the A.B. Combs Elementary School in North Carolina. To hear the parents of A. B Combs talk about the school is to be amazed. In 1999, the school debuted a programme that taught The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Peopleto a pilot group of students. The parents reported an incredible change in their children, who blossomed under the programme. By the end of the following year the average end-of-grade scores had leapt from 84 to 94. This book will launch the message onto a much larger platform. Stephen R. Covey takes the 7 Habits, that have already changed the lives of millions of people, and shows how children can use them as they develop. Those habits -- be proactive, begin with the end in mind, put first things first, think win-win, seek to understand and then to be understood, synergize, and sharpen the saw -- are critical skills to learn at a young age and bring incredible results, proving that it's never too early to teach someone how to live well.",Self-Help,218,2,2,en

A Journey to Inner Healing,Louis P. Bauer,N/A,2002-10,"A Journey to Inner Healing is a dynamic new book by Louis P. Bauer, Ph.D. It is one man?s spiritual journey, from the depths of depression to a new life filled with peace and harmony. But it?s much more than that. It?s a life lesson for everyone that is not only vital to their happiness, but also their overall health and well being. As humans, there are three aspects of our being which makes us complete and whole. It is the trinity of the mind, body and spirit and when there is a lack of harmony within this trinity, it brings disorder and a sense of lacking into our lives. That was my purpose in writing this book. I wanted to help others who may be experiencing the same negative feelings and emotions that I experienced. Once people understand and learn to work with this awesome connection between the mind, body and spirit, they will notice profound and positive changes in their day-to-day living, their relationships with other people and their personal health and well being. This book is an easy to read adventure, filled with motivational tools and techniques blended with inspirational storytelling.

"Bodies and Souls, or Spirited Bodies?",Nancey Murphy,Cambridge University Press,2006-01-12,"Are humans composed of a body and a nonmaterial mind or soul, or are we purely physical beings? Opinion is sharply divided over this issue. In this clear and concise book, Nancey Murphy argues for a physicalist account, but one that does not diminish traditional views of humans as rational, moral, and capable of relating to God. This position is motivated not only by developments in science and philosophy, but also by biblical studies and Christian theology. The reader is invited to appreciate the ways in which organisms are more than the sum of their parts. That higher human capacities such as morality, free will, and religious awareness emerge from our neurobiological complexity and develop through our relation to others, to our cultural inheritance, and, most importantly, to God. Murphy addresses the questions of human uniqueness, religious experience, and personal identity before and after bodily resurrection.",Religion,149,5,1,en

The Inner World of Trauma,Donald Kalsched,Routledge,2014-02-25,"Donald Kalsched explores the interior world of dream and fantasy images encountered in therapy with people who have suffered unbearable life experiences. He shows how, in an ironical twist of psychical life, the very images which are generated to defend the self can become malevolent and destructive, resulting in further trauma for the person. Why and how this happens are the questions the book sets out to answer. Drawing on detailed clinical material, the author gives special attention to the problems of addiction and psychosomatic disorder, as well as the broad topic of dissociation and its treatment. By focusing on the archaic and primitive defenses of the self he connects Jungian theory and practice with contemporary object relations theory and dissociation theory. At the same time, he shows how a Jungian understanding of the universal images of myth and folklore can illuminate treatment of the traumatised patient. Trauma is about the rupture of those developmental transitions that make life worth living. Donald Kalsched sees this as a spiritual problem as well as a psychological one and in The Inner World of Trauma he provides a compelling insight into how an inner self-care system tries to save the personal spirit.",Psychology,241,N/A,0,en

"Language, Land and Belonging: Poetic Inquiries","Natalie Honein, Margaret McKeon",Vernon Press,2023-04-25,"This volume takes up themes emergent from the 7th International Symposium on Poetic Inquiry (ISPI) which invited participants to reflect on the United Nations Declaration of 2019 as the International Year of Indigenous Languages. In this refereed collection, Indigenous and non-Indigenous authors use poetic inquiry to explore the importance of their ancestral languages and lands, and consider the Indigenous languages and peoples of the lands where they live. Situated in diverse global contexts, poet-researchers examine the intersectionality of their languages, their lands, and their sense of belonging. They offer relational understandings of, and articulate obligations for, their environment and communities. Through stories of shared generational pain and renewal, each author brings the reader into their world of learning and growth. They do this through discourses of belonging and relational responsibilities that tie them to a place, a genealogy. As a method of study that incorporates poetry into academic research, poetic inquiry is concerned with particularity, complexity, and transformations. Making research more visceral and evocative, it invites researchers to examine and engage with the knowledge they seek through a continual process of questioning, welcoming, and awareness. In this volume, poetic inquiry helps to honor languages and histories taken for granted; it allows looking back in order to reexamine, redefine, and make sense of the present and its shortcomings while reimagining a different future. This work seeks to reclaim, through poetic inquiry, wisdom of language, land, and belonging.",Literary Criticism,224,N/A,0,en

Qualitative Inquiry in the Present Tense,"Norman K. Denzin, Michael D. Giardina",Taylor & Francis,2024-05-27,"In Qualitative Inquiry in the Present Tense, contributors engage with epistemological and philosophical questions concerning the conduct of qualitative inquiry in the present moment, and especially as it relates to various understandings of writing in/as inquiry. Topics addressed include methodological processes, questions of narrative uprootedness, relational inquiry, Indigenous ethico-onto-epistemologies, storytelling, and transformative writing forms and practices. This is a messy, often unruly collection (in the best way possible) of disparate ideas strung tightly together by literal and metaphorical questions of the research act of writing. Contributors from the United States, Australia, Canada, England, and Scotland imaginatively conceive of new qualitative futures—and how we might write ourselves there. This evocative new book is a must-read for faculty and students alike who are interested in and engaged with questions and ideas oriented toward understanding our current historical present in qualitative research—a moment in which the field is perpetually in motion or in flux, with new theories, methods, and orientations arising, competing, and even contradicting one another.",Psychology,227,N/A,0,en

An Indian Tantric Tradition and Its Modern Global Revival,D.E. Osto,Routledge,2020-03-06,"This book analyzes the contemporary global revival of Nondual Śaivism, a thousand-year-old medieval Hindu religious philosophy. Providing a historical overview of the seminal people and groups responsible for the revival, the book compares the tradition’s medieval Indian origins to modern forms, which are situated within distinctively contemporary religious, economic and technological contexts. The author bridges the current gap in the literature between ""insider"" (emic) and ""outsider” (etic) perspectives by examining modern Nondual Śaivism from multiple standpoints as both a critical scholar of religion and an empathetic participant-observer. The book explores modern Nondual Śaivism in relation to recent scholarly debates concerning the legitimacy of New Age consumptive spirituality, the global spiritual marketplace and the contemporary culture of narcissism. It also analyzes the dark side of the revived tradition, and investigates contemporary teachers accused of sexual abuse and illegal financial activities in relation to unique features of Nondual Śaivism’s theosophy and modern scholarship on new religious movements (NRMs) and cults. This book shows that, although Kashmir Śaivism has been adopted by certain teachers and groups to market their own brand of ""High Tantra,"" some contemporary practitioners have remained true to the system’s fundamental tenets and teach authentic (albeit modern) forms of Nondual Śaivism. This book will be of interest to academics in the fields of religion and Asian philosophies, especially South Asian, tantric, neo-tantric and yoga philosophies, alternative and New Age spiritualities, religion and consumerism, and NRMs and cults.

The Language of the Soul in Narrative Therapy,Laura Béres,Taylor & Francis,2022-07-08,"The Language of the Soul in Narrative Therapy uniquely bridges the gap between narrative therapy and spirituality to describe how the theory and practice of narrative therapy may be expanded and enriched by incorporating the language of the soul. Divided into three parts, the book begins by contextualizing the approach of narrative therapy and spirituality. Chapters then debate the complexity of the ‘soul’ as a term drawing on the work of Christian mystics and philosophers, such as Teresa of Avila, Edith Stein, Merleau-Ponty, and Bakhtin, to show how their theoretical ideas can be incorporated in counseling practice and spiritual direction. The book concludes by discussing how the language of the soul can be integrated and applied in postmodern practice. With case examples from faith belief systems, such as Christianity, Buddhism, Paganism, Wicca, and Yazidism, throughout, this book is essential reading for therapists, clinical social workers, and counsellors in practice and graduate training, as well as spiritual directors and pastoral counselors interested in the ideas and practices of narrative therapy.",Psychology,150,N/A,0,en
Changing Cultures of Ageing and Spirituality,"Elizabeth MacKinlay, Ann Harrington",Taylor & Francis,2023-09-12,"This book addresses important issues of ageing and spirituality and reflects on the impact of culture on both constructs. The papers are contemporary in that they include excerpts of cultural impact on spirituality from New Zealand, Singapore, India, United Kingdom, Australia and the United States. This book marks almost 20 years of international conferences on ageing and spirituality that commenced in January 2000. It opens the conversation to all who were part of this journey of ageing, including older people, practitioners in ageing and aged care, researchers, and those who reflect on the process of growing older. Chapters feature diverse perspectives, highlighting the need for inclusivity in conversations that surround ageing and recognize how development of cultures is influenced by the society where they emerge, and by minority groups within larger society. Chapters also note the occurrence of subcultures of ageing and aged care. The conference was held shortly before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the chapters being written often during times of lockdown. Their content reflects the importance of spirituality in times of isolation and can show ways of reaching out to vulnerable older people, of various faiths and cultures, whatever their situations. Changing Cultures of Ageing and Spirituality will be a key resource for academics, researchers, and advanced students of Theology, Divinity and Religious Studies, Gerontology, Sociology, Psychology, Mental Health, and Nursing.

Reconstructing a Christian Theology of Nature,Revd Dr Anna Case-Winters,"Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.",2013-05-28,"In the present ecological crisis, it is imperative that human beings reconsider their place within nature and find new, more responsible and sustainable ways of living. Assumptions about the nature of God, the world, and the human being, shape our thinking and, consequently, our acting. Some have charged that the Christian tradition has been more a hindrance than a help because its theology of nature has unwittingly legitimated the exploitation of nature. This book takes the current criticism of Christian tradition to heart and invites a reconsideration of the problematic elements: its desacralization of nature; its preoccupation with the human being to the neglect of the rest of nature; its dualisms and elevation of the spiritual over material reality, and its habit of ignoring or resisting scientific understandings of the natural world. Anna Case-Winters argues that Christian tradition has a more viable theology of nature to offer. She takes a look at some particulars in Christian tradition as a way to illustrate the undeniable problems and to uncover the untapped possibilities. In the process, she engages conversation partners that have been sharply critical and particularly insightful (feminist theology, process thought, and the religion and science dialogue). The criticisms and insights of these partners help to shape a proposal for a reconstructed theology of nature that can more effectively fund our struggle for the fate of the earth.",Religion,202,N/A,0,en
Congregations at the Crossroads,Ronald E.

In this volume Ronald Vallet explores the biblical basis for stewardship, with major emphasis on God's promises and commands, to help congregations become the households of God that he intends them to be. Vallet also discusses several church-related issues that affect the life and practices of congregations today. He deals with fantasies and fears about money in the congregation, shows the central role that authentic worship plays in focusing congregations on God, examines the proper roles of pastors and laity, and considers the prevailing concepts and practices of modern culture that can entangle today's churches. Vallet's work provides an insightful map for churches as they confront the confusing crossroads of life in our world.",Religion,257,N/A,0,en

Psychoanalysis as a Spiritual Discipline,Paul Marcus,Routledge,2021-04-27,"The great existential psychiatrist Ludwig Binswanger famously pointed out to Freud that therapeutic failure could ""only be understood as the result of something which could be called a deficiency of spirit."" Binswanger was surprised when Freud agreed, asserting, ""Yes, spirit is everything."" However, spirit and the spiritual realm have largely been dropped from mainstream psychoanalytic theory and practice. This book seeks to help revitalize a culturally aging psychoanalysis that is in conceptual and clinical disarray in the marketplace of ideas and is viewed as a ""theory in crisis"" no longer regarded as the primary therapy for those who are suffering. The author argues that psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic psychotherapy can be reinvigorated as a discipline if it is animated by the powerfully evocative spiritual, moral, and ethical insights of two dialogical personalist religious philosophers—Martin Buber, a Jew, and Gabriel Marcel, a Catholic—who both initiated a ""Copernican revolution"" in human thought. In chapters that focus on love, work, faith, suffering, and clinical practice, Paul Marcus shows how the spiritual optic of Buber and Marcel can help revive and refresh psychoanalysis, and bring it back into the light by communicating its inherent vitality, power, and relevance to the mental health community and to those who seek psychoanalytic treatment.",Philosophy,216,N/A,0,en

Beyond Physicalism,"Edward F. Kelly, Adam Crabtree, Paul Marshall",Rowman & Littlefield,2015-02-19,"The rise of modern science has brought with it increasing acceptance among intellectual elites of a worldview that conflicts sharply both with everyday human experience and with beliefs widely shared among the world’s great cultural traditions. Most contemporary scientists and philosophers believe that reality is at bottom purely physical, and that human beings are nothing more than extremely complicated biological machines. On such views our everyday experiences of conscious decision-making, free will, and the self are illusory by-products of the grinding of our neural machinery. It follows that mind and personality are necessarily extinguished at death, and that there exists no deeper transpersonal or spiritual reality of any sort. Beyond Physicalism is the product of an unusual fellowship of scientists and humanities scholars who dispute these views. In their previous publication, Irreducible Mind, they argued that physicalism cannot accommodate various well-evidenced empirical phenomena including paranormal or psi phenomena, postmortem survival, and mystical experiences. In this new theory-oriented companion volume they go further by attempting to understand how the world must be constituted in order that these “rogue” phenomena can occur. Drawing upon empirical science, metaphysical philosophy, and the mystical traditions, the authors work toward an improved “big picture” of the general character of reality, one which strongly overlaps territory traditionally occupied by the world’s institutional religions, and which attempts to reconcile science and spirituality by finding a middle path between the polarized fundamentalisms, religious and scientific, that have dominated recent public discourse.

Participation and the Mystery,Jorge N. Ferrer,State University of New York Press,2017-04-12,"Participation and the Mystery is both an introduction to and expansion of Jorge N. Ferrer's groundbreaking work on participatory spirituality, which holds that human beings are active cocreators of spiritual phenomena, worlds, and even ultimates. After examining the impact of his work since the publication of Revisioning Transpersonal Theory, Ferrer discusses the relationship between science and transpersonal psychology, the nature of a fully embodied spirituality, and the features of integral spiritual practice. The book also introduces a participatory philosophy of education and applies it to the academic teaching of mysticism and a novel approach to embodied spiritual inquiry. Critically engaging the influential work of Stanislav Grof, Ken Wilber, and A. H. Almaas, Ferrer concludes with an original solution to the problem of religious pluralism that affirms the ontological richness of religious worlds while avoiding the extremes of perennialism and contextualism, offering a hopeful vision for the future of world religion. Participation and the Mystery is an invaluable resource to anyone seeking to deepen their understanding of participatory approaches to transpersonal psychology, integral and contemplative education, contemporary spirituality, and religious studies.",Psychology,388,N/A,0,en

Psychotherapy and the Social Clinic in the United States,William M. Epstein,Springer Nature,2019-12-07,"This book offers a compelling critical analysis of American society by examining the role of psychotherapy within social policy and the culture that has fashioned it. It takes a deeply critical look at ‘the social clinic,’ defined here as a ubiquitous organizational arrangement that includes clinical and community psychology, counseling, clinical social work, psychiatry, much of the self-help industry, complementary and alternative medicine and others. Epstein’s analysis concludes that the social clinic lacks credible evidence of effectiveness and its continued popularity expresses popular but predatory American values such as romantic individualism, the triumph of the subjective, a sense of personal and political chosenness, persistent bigotry, and a preference for tribal as opposed to civic identities. This careful examination of American society through the lens of psychotherapeutic practice characterizes the social clinic as a soothing fiction of the United States. The book offers caring services as the unrealized alternative to clinical treatment, capable of achieving greater personal adjustment as well as social and economic equality. It will appeal to readers with an interest in social welfare, public policy, and public administration, as well as to students and scholars of psychotherapy, counseling, social work, rehabilitation, and community psychology.",Psychology,380,N/A,0,en

With this guide, readers can view illness as an opportunity to begin living as never before. Gradually, Lorraine began to climb out of the pit of despair she had dug for herself.

Oxford Textbook of Spirituality in Healthcare,"Mark Cobb, Christina Puchalski, Bruce Rumbold",OUP Oxford,2012-08-09,"The relationship between spirituality and healthcare is historical, intellectual and practical, and it has now emerged as a significant field in health research, healthcare policy and clinical practice and training. Understanding health and wellbeing requires addressing spiritual and existential issues, and healthcare is therefore challenged to respond to the ways spirituality is experienced and expressed in illness, suffering, healing and loss. If healthcare has compassionate regard for the humanity of those it serves, it is faced with questions about how it understands and interprets spirituality, what resources it should make available and how these are organised, and the ways in which spirituality shapes and informs the purpose and practice of healthcare? These questions are the basis for this resource, which presents a coherent field of enquiry, discussion and debate that is interdisciplinary, international and vibrant. There is a growing corpus of articles in medical and healthcare journals on spirituality in addition to a wide range of literature, but there has been no attempt so far to publish a standard text on this subject. Spirituality in Healthcare is an authoritative reference on the subject providing unequalled coverage, critical depth and an integrated source of key topics.

The Way Back to Paradise,Joseph M. Felser,Hampton Roads Publishing,2005-01-05,"Paradise is not the state of being in harmony, but the process of harmonizing. It is not a garden of bliss, but the bliss of gardening. Paradise is about mending the self, restoring the balance, getting back into tune, bringing all our discarded and forgotten parts into the whole. That means paying attention to and honoring synchronicities, precognitive dreams, telepathic communications, visions--and all manner of experiences of psychic sensitivity. Philosophy professor Joe Felser realized that what he calls the ""decrepit, decaying cultural ideologies,"" in exclusively favoring reason and logic, were excluding the equally real world of magic and psychic activities. He began to investigate, and the closer he looked, the more he found. But he wasn't ready to abandon the world of reason and logic. Instead, he wanted to see if he could find a way to blend the two. He did. The result is this book. In The Way Back to Paradise, Felser takes you through his day, showing what everyday life looks like when you live that blend. His stories, both magical and reasonable, point the way toward a new kind of paradise, one suited to the 21st century.","Body, Mind & Spirit",264,N/A,0,en

Feeling Is the Secret,Neville Goddard,ببلومانيا للنشر والتوزيع,2024-03-31,"The central premise of the book revolves around the idea that our predominant feelings and emotions shape our reality. Goddard argues that the key to manifesting our desires lies not only in visualizing them but also in feeling as though they have already been realized. Goddard emphasizes the importance of assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled, meaning that individuals should immerse themselves emotionally in the experience of having already achieved their desires. He asserts that this emotional state, when sustained consistently, impresses upon the subconscious mind and sets in motion the forces necessary to bring those desires into physical reality. Furthermore, Goddard discusses the concept of mental imagery and its power to create and shape our experiences. He suggests that individuals should use their imagination to create vivid mental scenes that evoke the desired feelings, thereby attracting corresponding circumstances and events. ""Feeling Is The Secret"" serves as a practical guide for harnessing the creative power of the mind to transform one's life. It encourages readers to cultivate a sense of inner conviction and emotional congruence with their desires, ultimately leading to the manifestation of their dreams and aspirations.",Business & Economics,64,N/A,0,en

Though her abilities are exceptional, they are not unique, and that is the message at the core of this book. Understanding ""the secret language of the universe"" is a gift available to all. As we learn to ask for and recognize signs from the other side, we will start to find meaning where before there was only confusion, we will see light in the darkness. We may decide to change paths, push toward love, pursue joy, and engage with life in a whole new way. In Signs, Jackson is able to bring the mystical into the everyday. She relates stories of people who have experienced these uncanny revelations and instances of unexplained synchronicity, as well as those drawn from her own experience. There's the producer whose lost child appears to her as a deer that approaches her unhesitatingly at a highway rest stop; the name tag of an ER nurse that lets a terrified wife know that her husband will be okay; the Elvis Presley song that arrives at the exact time of her own father's passing; and many others. This is a book that is both inspiring and practical, deeply comforting and wonderfully motivational in asking us to see beyond ourselves to a more magnificent universal design""--","Body, Mind & Spirit",321,N/A,0,en

The Edusemiotics of Images,Inna Semetsky,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-02-11,"Semetsky’s new book offers a bracing account of Tarot semiotics in view of its deep significance for educational experience. Analyzing the symbolic language of Tarot images that express the intimations of the unconscious, she invites readers to explore novel ways of learning about the nature of ourselves and the world we are situated in. Combining thorough research with an accessible style, this groundbreaking book is essential reading for present and future generations of practitioners, academics and students across disciplines. Pia Brînzeu, Professor of English Literature and Vice-Rector of the Universityof Timis ̧oara, Romania; author of Corridors of Mirrors. A sequel to the author’s Re-Symbolization of the Self: Human Development and Tarot Hermeneutic and Semiotics Education Experience, Semetsky’s new book presents the Tarot sign-system as a school of ethical living. Bringing the philosophies of Peirce, Deleuze, Dewey, Whitehead and Gebser in a dialogue with the cutting-edge science of coordination dynamics, she grounds the art of Tarot in the logic of signs acting across nature, culture and human mind. Building on Noddings’ “maternal factor”, Semetsky demonstrates how the lessons embodied in Tarot symbolism recover the feminine value of relations and contribute to Self~Other integration. Such is the message of Tarot images. The Image is the Message. Igor Klyukanov, Professor of Communication, Eastern Washington University, USA; editor, Russian Journal of Communication; author of A Communication Universe: Manifestations of Meaning, Stagings of Significance. Semetsky’s amalgamation of the techniques of visual communication with the emerging field of edusemiotics is an absolute masterpiece in transdisciplinarity. By forging diverse strands of inquiry into an overall model of how images enhance learning, Semetsky’s new book provokes us to take a fresh look at iconic information and is a required reading for everyone who is engaged with the art and science of visual semiotics at the intersection of nature and culture. Marcel Danesi, Professor of Anthropology, University of Toronto, Canada; editor-in-chief, Semiotica; author of The Quest for Meaning: A Guide to Semiotic Theory and Practice. Finally. An in-depth look at Tarot from within the field of semiotics, a perspective that had been inexplicably overlooked until now. As a language of exile from language, Tarot cards are silent words that became images. Here is a book that turns our thirst for symbols into a learning tool. The sign sings in Inna Semetsky’s work.

Return of the Children of Light,Judith Bluestone Polich,Simon and Schuster,2001-08-01,"A personal exploration of the conjunction between ancient Mesoamerican prophesy and New Age higher consciousness. • Selected by the Independent Publisher's Book Awards as one of the top two New Age books of the year. • Explores ancient prophesies and their relevance in the contemporary world. The Incan and Mayan cultures saw themselves as “children of light”--descended from celestial realms--and their prophecies foretell a time of great spiritual awakening. They prophesied a time when the gateways to higher consciousness would open once again. That time is now. Award-winning author Judith Bluestone Polich draws on her extensive research in quantum physics, archeoastronomy, holography, cosmology, and pioneering studies of human consciousness to show how science and contemporary thought are consistent with this ancient knowledge. As the ancients predicted, the human god-seed is beginning to awaken, and modern civilization is finally beginning to perceive human potential in ways that the ancient cultures accepted as truth. Polich introduces techniques for awakening our own human potential through dreaming, meditations, and the power of sacred sites.","Body, Mind & Spirit",214,N/A,0,en

Out of this situation only good will come. I am safe."" In this healing tour de force, best-selling authors Louise L. Hay and Dr. Mona Lisa Schulz have teamed up for an exciting reexamination of the quintessential teachings from Heal Your Body. All Is Well brings together Louise’s proven affirmation system with Mona Lisa’s knowledge of both medical science and the body’s intuition to create an easy-to-follow guide for health and well-being. And, for the first time ever, they present scientific evidence showing the undeniable link between the mind and body that makes these healing methods work. Bringing focus and clarity to the effects of emotions on the body, All Is Well separates the body into seven distinct groups of organs—or emotional centers—that are connected by their relationship to certain emotions. Structured around these emotional centers, the authors outline common imbalances and probable mental causes for physical illness. They also include case studies that show a complete program for healing that draws from all disciplines, including both traditional and alternative medicine, affirmations, nutritional changes, and so much more. Using the self-assessment quiz, the holistic health advice, and an expanded version of Louise’s original affirmation chart, you can learn how to heal your mind and body with affirmations and intuition and live a balanced, healthy life.","Body, Mind & Spirit",265,N/A,0,en

The Ultimate Happiness Prescription,"Deepak Chopra, M.D.",Harmony,2009-11-17,"New York Times bestselling author Deepak Chopra shares the spiritual practices that will help us to uncover the true secrets of joy in the most difficult times. Happiness is something everyone desires. Yet how to find happiness—or even if we deserve to—remains a mystery. The goal of life is the expansion of happiness, but today’s society reinforces the belief that fulfillment comes from achieving success, wealth, and good relationships. Chopra tells us that the opposite is true: All success in life is the by-product of happiness, not the cause. In this book, Chopra shows us seven keys for a life based on a sense of your “true self” lying beyond the ebb and flow of daily living. Simple daily exercises can lead to eliminating the root causes of unhappiness and help you to: • Recognize real happiness and not settle for less • Find true self-esteem, which doesn’t depend on anything outside you • Return to the state of joy, peace, and spontaneous fulfillment that is your natural birthright • Focus on the present and learn to live it fully • Experience enlightenment After all avenues to happiness have been explored, only one path is left: the journey to enlightenment. In The Ultimate Happiness Prescription, we are taken on an inspiring journey to learn the secrets for living mindfully and with effortless spontaneity for the true self, the only place untouched by trouble and misfortune.",Self-Help,146,N/A,0,en

Sit Down to Rise Up,Shelly Tygielski,New World Library,2021-10-26,"An empowering book on propelling profound social change by going inward, from a mindfulness teacher and activist who has turned personal practice into movements The practice of self-care is most often touted for its profound mind, body, and spirit benefits. Shelly Tygielski shows that self-care can also be a powerful tool for spurring transformative collective action. In a winning combination of memoir, manifesto, and how-to, Shelly shares her evolution from a Jerusalem-born child of traditional Sephardic Jewish parents to a middle-class American suburban youth who questioned her faith to a young executive in corporate America. As she used radical self-care practices to manage a serious chronic health issue, she had an epiphany: finding true health and peace is not a solo endeavor but one that lives in connection with others. Tygielski considers herself an unlikely meditator, activist, and teacher. But as such, she is uniquely qualified to speak to all today who wonder, “What can I do?” or, “Will my actions even make a difference?” Tygielski’s work began as “me” work and transformed into “we” work. In Sit Down to Rise Up, she shows that this is possible for all of us.","Body, Mind & Spirit",260,N/A,0,en

To the magic and stargazing of Egypt the Greeks added numerology, geometryand rational thought. The philosophy of Plato and later of the Stoics made astrology respectable, and by the time Ptolemy wrote his textbook the Tetrabiblos, in the second century AD, the main lines of astrological practice as it is known today had already been laid down.

Wisdom Chi Kung,Mantak Chia,Simon and Schuster,2008-06-24,"Taoist meditation practices for increasing and maintaining mental awareness, memory, and clarity • Details techniques to increase the level of chi energy in the brain • Explains how to synchronize the left and right brain by activating the body’s energetic potentials • Shows that by emptying the mind there is more energy to heal the body Wisdom Chi Kung teaches practitioners how to revitalize the brain: to repair function, increase memory, and expand capacity. Every day we use up so much of our brain’s capacity to function that we have very little left at the end of the day. By thinking or worrying too much, the brain can use up to 80 percent of the body’s entire energy reserve. Learning to stop the brain, to empty the mind from the ceaseless chatter of the “monkey mind,” and then recharge it with chi energy can increase our mental capacity, focus, and clarity. Using the Inner Smile meditation technique, practitioners learn how to recharge chi energy for the brain in a form that is most useful. Practitioners smile and empty the mind into the lower tan tien and the organs. The organs then transform this chi energy. When the mind is empty, the energy transformed by the organs is sent back to the brain to revitalize it. This process synchronizes the left and right brain by activating and tapping in to the body’s energetic potentials. As the mind continues to empty, receive, and also enhance the transformed chi energy, it is able to open itself to connect with universal chi energies and fill the body with enhanced life force.","Body, Mind & Spirit",185,N/A,0,en

Earth's Catastrophic Past and Future,"William Hutton, Jonathan Eagle",Universal-Publishers,2004-08,"Edgar Cayce, America's best documented psychic, gave upwards of 44 readings that dealt with lost continents, geophysical changes to Earth beginning 1958-1998, and a pole shift due to begin about now. In this book, geologist William Hutton and researcher Jonathan Eagle look for correspondences between results of geophysical research studies and psychic descriptions of prehistoric catastrophes. They also seek scientifically to test readings' predictions of catastrophic Earth changes, all the while investigating the following fascinating subjects: * Development and calibration of a comprehensive pole-shift model * The countries predicted to be most affected by a sudden, 1° pole shift. * The geologic trend for a mineralized gold vein at Bimini, Bahamas. * The authors' discoveries of correlations between: - a 2002 arctic earthquake and the eruption of torrid-area volcanoes, - the dropping of atom bombs in 1945 and a significant increase in sunspots following, and - the peaceable nature of Europe in 1645-1715 and the period's near total lack of sunspots. (Cayce readings implied or predicted all three phenomena.) * The first-ever analysis of the sources of Cayce's channeled readings, including a ranking of the veracity and reliability of the most important Earth changes and pole-shift readings. * Moralistic reasons for future catastrophic geophysical changes to Japan, China, and America. * Locations of post-pole-shift safety lands in Canada and America. * Locations of the records of the Atlantean civilization, to be found when Earth changes begin. * How to awaken to the New Cycle presently opening before humanity. * Evidence for Atlantis in the mid-Atlantic ridge area and for Lemuria (or Mu) in the Pacific. * The consuming religious war in which we find ourselves, and an answer to world conditions today. * Visions of an imminent Age-ending fire, as found in a Cayce reading, in a channeled book by Phylos the Tibetan, and in the 1960s visions of girls at Garabandal, Spain. * Doubtful interpretations of Earth-changes and pole-shift readings advanced by managers and writers of Cayce's legacy organization, the Association for Research and Enlightenment, Inc. From the Foreword by the Editor: ""The acid test of pole shift and other Earth change predictions is their scientific credibility. If true, momentous societal and political changes are imminent. The geopolitical map of the world will be redrawn. The authors are exploring the transition from the end of one Age to the beginning of another.""","Body, Mind & Spirit",606,N/A,0,en

It lets us envisage that various created entities are participant in a relationship with God that becomes increasingly one of an intimate personal quality; that is, a relationship of love. It thus invites discernment that the universal reality is valuable in its own right and not only as a good for the use of humanity. Drawing mainly upon Scripture, ancient writers (especially Maximus the Confessor), as well as contemporary natural sciences, this book encourages the reader to perceive human salvation not as a lifting of humanity out of creation, but as a transformation into God's presence in the midst of the wider created order. It shows that Christian faith at its best does not exclude the wider creation but provides us with insight and hope for a harmonious being-in-God that is inclusive of creation. It shows that Christian faith can be a resource that helps overcome the ecological crisis.",Religion,243,N/A,0,en

She covers some of the root causes; the positive aspects of service, such as growth and maturity, as well as the negative effects, including physical, emotional, and spiritual injury; and the consequences of service on general and cellular memory.

Augustine's Intellectual Conversion,Brian Dobell,Cambridge University Press,2009-11-05,"This book examines Augustine's intellectual conversion from Platonism to Christianity, as described at Confessions 7.9.13-21.27. It is widely assumed that this occurred in the summer of 386, shortly before Augustine's volitional conversion in the garden at Milan. Brian Dobell argues, however, that Augustine's intellectual conversion did not occur until the mid-390s, and develops this claim by comparing Confessions 7.9.13-21.27 with a number of important passages and themes from Augustine's early writings. He thus invites the reader to consider anew the problem of Augustine's conversion in 386: was it to Platonism or Christianity? His original and important study will be of interest to a wide range of readers in the history of philosophy and the history of theology.",Biography & Autobiography,269,N/A,0,en

The Essential Edgar Cayce,Mark Thurston,Penguin,2004-07-08,"A complete guide to the work of the remarkable twentieth-century seer Edgar Cayce, featuring Cayce's most intriguing and influential readings, and a biographical introduction to his life. Edgar Cayce is one of the most mysterious men of the twentieth century. Sometimes called ""The Sleeping Prophet,"" he was prone to pick up taglines that reflected the sensationalistic side of his work rather than its real depth and meaning. The core of his life's work was actually being an intuitive healer and Christian mystic. More than one hundred books have been written about his teachings and his life story. Yet no book has combined insightful commentary with lengthy, verbatim selections of the full range of his contribution to holistic healing, practical spirituality, and the psychology of the soul. The Essential Edgar Cayce gives the reader an understanding of each major area in which Cayce helped pioneer the modern holistic living movement, as well as the contemporary popular approach to spirituality that weaves together the best of Eastern and Western religious traditions. The book's substantial introduction frames Cayce and his life's work, and is followed by eight topical sections in which commentaries by Mark Thurston guide the reader through some of the seer's most significant readings.

Mystical Experience of Reality - Volume II,Keith Michael Hancock,"BookLocker.com, Inc.",2024-05-05,"Is MER (The Mystical Experience of Reality) What Humans Are All About? The Mystical Experience of Reality book and blog series by Keith Michael Hancock is a uniquely serious case history of newly emerging facts about the mystical experience of Reality (MER). It is presented here to add to the growing scientific and academic literature being produced around the world today–what human existence is really all about. Does God exist, or is much more revealing itself in our evolutionary progress? Many scientists and scholars are experiencing the answer–Yes! Mystical Experience of Reality Volume I, and now Volume II, are compiled of posts from Keith's Blog, Mystic Experiences. Volume II was thought necessary because Keith’s latest revelations have brought these historically important messages to a concluding realisation of what the human condition is all about. See Summing Up at the end of the book. Scholars, scientists and spiritual Seekers around the world who visit and follow his blog will appreciate Summing Up as a uniquely new, complete understanding of why we're here. In this book Keith has aimed to keep each topic shorter and on point, always leaving you with a new thought to ponder, always encouraging you to dig deeper and recall your own experiences thus far. WHY KEITH? He doesn’t know! He says he is not aware of any qualification he had or has for receiving the mystical experiences of Reality (MER), the truth of Reality’s existence. He says he wasn’t religious or spiritual and didn't even know the word ‘mystic’ when they started. The Mystical Experience of Reality, as Keith calls it, is a well-known, historical, non-biological, non-human historical phenomena that engulfed him as a 14-year-old several times every year until his late thirties, filling him with the experience of a Reality in which all things known and unknown exist at Its behest, guarding, guiding, accepting everything that exists, separately, personally, individually. It is benign and uninterested in human wants or constructs such as religions, politics, ideologies. It only deals with individuals. The experiences bring profound joy and love, with a knowledge beyond all human experience. Keith insists the experience of Reality is caught, not taught. The books are filled with posts from Keith’s blog, mysticexperiences.net, for the author to examine himself and his existence in accordance with the way of Reality. Accordingly, he says he found by comparison that there is nothing in humanity worth studying. The first book, Mystic Experiences of Reality Volume I, and this one, Volume II, are summations of years of using writing to explore the awareness given Keith by his mystical experiences, in the hope it will add to the literature on the subject, which is now being more seriously studied around the world than it has ever been.

Going beyond previous programs, Whole Detox offers a proven plan to uncover all the obstacles that prevent you from feeling your best.

La Vida Real que Dios ha Dado al Cristiano,M. Alberto Zelaya Aragón,iUniverse,2014-02,"Si vamos a seguir adelante y a restablecer nuestra vida a ser un discípulo que es lo que el Padre tiene en mente para nosotros, tenemos que volver a la fuente original de toda la verdad para que como adultos, no como niños de pecho aún chupando la botella de un bebé llena de una fórmula religiosa, lleguemos ya a consumir el alimento sólido que siempre ha sido fijado en la mesa del Señor, como se señala en Hebreos 5:12: ""Porque a pesar de que a estas alturas ya deberían estar enseñando a otros, en realidad ustedes necesitan a alguien para enseñarles otra vez los primeros principios de la Palabra de Dios. Habéis llegado a tener una necesidad de leche, y no alimento sólido."" Por lo tanto, es tiempo de deshacerse de ese chupete religioso que ha puesto al cuerpo de Cristo en un sueño profundo, chupando nada más que palabras huecas que salen de los púlpitos y atriles, y conseguir el coraje de hacer la elección de volver al verdadero maestro y tutor, el Espíritu Santo. Seamos conscientes de que ya tenemos la habilidad y la perspicacia de reconocer la voz del Buen Pastor como Jesús nos dijo en Juan 10:27, ""Las ovejas que son mías, oyen y están escuchando mi voz, y yo las conozco y ellas me siguen."" ¿Suena esto como si vamos a oír y seguir a un papa, profeta, sacerdote o cualquier otra persona que quiere entrar a su billetera? Pero más importante, ¿resuena esto en su espíritu, conocimiento y mente? Si no lo es así, esto podría ser la razón por la cual el cuerpo de Cristo es corto en fe y de larga al fracaso y la falla, algunos no lo hacen, sino que rehúsan escuchar la voz del Pastor principal ignorando Romanos 10:17, donde Él nos exhorta: ""Así que la fe viene por oír (lo que se cuenta), y lo que es oído viene por la predicación (del mensaje que proceden de los labios) de Cristo (el Mesías mismo)."" Es lamentable que la mayoría prefieren ser llevados ""como botín o te haces vos mismo cautivo de la llamada de la filosofía o el intelectualismo y falaces y vanas (ociosas fantasías y plena tonterías), siguiendo la tradición humana (las ideas de los hombres de lo material en lugar a la del mundo espiritual), solamente nociones crudas que siguen las enseñanzas rudimentarias y elementales del universo ignorando [las enseñanzas de] Cristo [el Mesías]"" (Colosenses 2:08). Una vez más, ¿están estas escrituras diciéndonos que el mensaje de Cristo viene de la boca de un papa católico, un presidente mormón o de un ayatolá? Por supuesto que no, ya que la voz de Dios se escucha sólo a través de su Espíritu Santo, que es el vocero del Jesucristo mismo, punto final de la historia. ¿Por qué no puede el cuerpo de Cristo, discernir que su único deseo es hacernos crecer, captar Su visión y poner en práctica su método e instrucción de estudiar Su Palabra? Y en llegar ahí en fe, ponerla en acción para activar su poder en cada momento de nuestra vida, hasta el día que Él regrese.","Body, Mind & Spirit",275,N/A,0,en

Nuyorican Feminist Performance,Patricia Herrera,University of Michigan Press,2020-05-12,"The Nuyorican Poets Café has for the past forty years provided a space for multicultural artistic expression and a platform for the articulation of Puerto Rican and black cultural politics. The Café’s performances—poetry, music, hip hop, comedy, and drama—have been studied in detail, but until now, little attention has been paid to the voices of its women artists. Through archival research and interview, Nuyorican Feminist Performance examines the contributions of 1970s and ’80s performeras and how they challenged the Café’s gender politics. It also looks at recent artists who have built on that foundation with hip hop performances that speak to contemporary audiences. The book spotlights the work of foundational artists such as Sandra María Esteves, Martita Morales, Luz Rodríguez, and Amina Muñoz, before turning to contemporary artists La Bruja, Mariposa, Aya de León, and Nilaja Sun, who infuse their poetry and solo pieces with both Nuyorican and hip hop aesthetics.",Performing Arts,247,N/A,0,en

Healing,Mary Healy,Our Sunday Visitor,2015-10-23,"""Lord, I am not worthy to have you enter under my roof; only say the word and my servant will be healed."" - Matthew 8:8 When we, or a family member or friend, are faced with an injury or illness, physical or emotional, our thoughts turn to God in prayer for healing. We want to believe, as the Centurion did, that God will grant healing, but we wonder. And if we as Catholics have doubts, what does this mean to a hurting world, also in need of healing? In her new book Healing: Bringing God's Gift of Mercy to the World, Mary Healy answers to these questions and more -- Is Jesus still healing people today? Are these healings real and do they last? How do we know if God wants us to pray for healing? Isn't God asking us to endure suffering and hardships instead of asking for healing? How can we pray for healing? Can my broken heart be healed as well as my body? Through the study of Catholic tradition, the lives of the saints, and ordinary people, you'll begin to understand how the message of inward healing is also a message that we as Catholics are empowered to take outward to the world.",Religion,159,5,1,en

Kiko Hidden Power Electric Moves: A Revolutionary Discoveryabout Traditional Martial Arts for the Fight & Beyond,Hayashi Tomio,Wind School,2024-07-17,"Title: This work is the result of thirty years of observations about the function and behavior of Ki (vital energy) in traditional martial arts. Master teacher, Hayashi Tomio, author and Buddhist monk, with over a half century of teaching experience, leads readers into the extraordinary realm of internal martial practice with a revolutionary perspective that the effortless power derived from proper Ki technique may be the result of human's ability to control their bioelectric field as a signaling mechanism to charge their musculature for impressive gains. Hayashi lays out the amazing Ki principles and techniques embedded in most traditional forms. Electrifying your practice takes on literal meaning. Through the Kiko lens Hayashi answers many longstanding questions about the traditional martial arts such as the hidden reason why martial artists are told to keep their knees precisely bent, to crescent their step, to bend their wrist during certain parries, to make certain tonal sounds, to breathe deep into the belly, to stomp their foot, lift their heel, or turn the feet inward or outward in various postures, or to pause at certain points in a kata. Learn about the startling distinctions between open and closed hand moves, why katas should start in a specific cardinal direction, why the arms should or should not cross with certain limb configurations, why turns in a kata are often 45 or 90 degree angles, why duration; the amount of time expended during strength moves, exerts an unusual influence on body-generated power, why certain tonal kiai's are made in kata, why moves done in sets of two or three should not be identical. Learn how to increase both your speed and punching power. Learn about the hidden effects of using certain weapons. For instance, a long or short bo (staff) has a Yin and Yang end. A steel blade can cut meridians without contact. Sai act like lightning rods drawing Ki into a user's body, how simple visualizations can double your strength or make a lock placed upon you difficult to achieve, how redirecting your Ki can seal against pressure point strikes, how everyone possess a unique energy signature—and more.",Sports & Recreation,581,N/A,0,en

Not only does The Visionary Window answer "" yes"" to all of these questions, but it skillfully combines the fields of philosophy, cosmology, religion, and psychology to form a new way of thinking about science and spirituality. Stepping beyond the classic work of prominent seventies physicist Fritjof Capra, Goswami details his own pioneering exploration of science and spirit, revealing the complete integration between modern science and spiritual traditions. Using stories and colorful examples from pop culture, Goswami addresses complex issues in language and terminology easily accessible to the lay reader. He provides quantum physics-based theory and new experimental data verifying the metaphysical truth that exists when employed in the context of a new science, science within the primacy of consciousness. With a new holistic worldview, Goswami also discusses the creativity of the body to self heal; the power of spiritual practice and how to choose a meditative path; and the five stages of spiritual growth, culminating in the ability to transcend the physical laws of nature.

How to Make Your Dreams Come True,Mark Forster,Hodder & Stoughton,2014-11-27,"Most people think of life as either something that happens to them or as something which they have to bend to their will. Life in short is seen as a series of problems requiring solutions. As a result people spend much of their lives either in escape activities or driving themselves to achieve, often both at the same time. But life becomes qualitatively different when we see it as a theatre in which we decide what is going to happen and then let it happen in the way that an artist will allow his or her creation to appear. This book is an example of the message that it teaches. Forster records methodically how he himself stopped struggling to work against his own feelings and to let his life happen.

Rhythms of Recovery,Leslie E. Korn,Routledge,2021-09-28,"The classic edition of Rhythms of Recovery sheds light on rhythm, one of the most important components of our survival and well-being. It governs the patterns of our sleep and respiration and is profoundly tied to our relationships with friends and family. But what happens when these rhythms are disrupted by traumatic events? Can balance be restored, and if so, how? What insights do eastern, natural, and modern western healing traditions have to offer, and how can practitioners put these lessons to use? Is it possible to do this in a way that’s culturally sensitive, multidisciplinary, and grounded in research?

My Stroke of Insight,Jill Bolte Taylor,Penguin,2008-05-12,"""Transformative...[Taylor's] experience...will shatter [your] own perception of the world.""—ABC News The astonishing New York Times bestseller that chronicles how a brain scientist's own stroke led to enlightenment On December 10, 1996, Jill Bolte Taylor, a thirty-seven- year-old Harvard-trained brain scientist experienced a massive stroke in the left hemisphere of her brain. As she observed her mind deteriorate to the point that she could not walk, talk, read, write, or recall any of her life-all within four hours-Taylor alternated between the euphoria of the intuitive and kinesthetic right brain, in which she felt a sense of complete well-being and peace, and the logical, sequential left brain, which recognized she was having a stroke and enabled her to seek help before she was completely lost. It would take her eight years to fully recover. For Taylor, her stroke was a blessing and a revelation. It taught her that by ""stepping to the right"" of our left brains, we can uncover feelings of well-being that are often sidelined by ""brain chatter."" Reaching wide audiences through her talk at the Technology, Entertainment, Design (TED) conference and her appearance on Oprah's online Soul Series, Taylor provides a valuable recovery guide for those touched by brain injury and an inspiring testimony that inner peace is accessible to anyone.",Biography & Autobiography,220,4,9,en

Nutrition Essentials for Mental Health: A Complete Guide to the Food-Mood Connection,Leslie Korn,W. W. Norton & Company,2016-01-11,"Exploring the connection between nutrition and mental wellness so therapists can provide more effective, integrated treatment. Diet is an essential component of a client’s clinical profile. Few therapists, however, have any nutritional training, and many don’t know where to begin. In Nutrition Essentials for Mental Health, Leslie Korn provides clinicians with a practical guide to the complex relationship between what we eat and the way we think, feel, and interact with the world. Where there is mental illness there is frequently a history of digestive and nutritional problems. Digestive problems in turn exacerbate mental distress, all of which can be improved by nutritional changes. It’s not unusual for a deficit or excess of certain nutrients to disguise itself as a mood disorder. Indeed, nutritional deficiencies factor into most mental illness—from anxiety and depression to schizophrenia and PTSD—and dietary changes can work alongside or even replace medications to alleviate symptoms and support mental wellness. Nutrition Essentials for Mental Health offers the mental health clinician the principles and practices necessary to provide clients with nutritional counseling to improve mood and mental health. Integrating clinical evidence with the author’s extensive clinical experience, it takes clinicians step-by-step through the essentials for integrating nutritional therapies into mental health treatment. Throughout, brief clinical vignettes illustrate commonly encountered obstacles and how to overcome them. Readers will learn: • Why nutrition matters in mental health • The role of various nutrients in nourishing both the brain and the gut, the “second brain” • Typical nutritional culprits that underlie or exacerbate specific mental disorders • Assessment techniques for evaluating a client’s unique nutritional needs, and counseling methods for the challenging but rewarding process of nutritional change. • Leading-edge protocols for the use of various macro- and micronutrients, vitamins, and supplements to improve mental health • Considerations for food allergies, sensitivities, and other special diets • The effects of foods and nutrients on DSM-5 categories of illness, and alternatives to pharmaceuticals for treatment • Comprehensive, stage-based approaches to coaching clients about dietary plans, nutritional supplements, and other resources • Ideas for practical, affordable, and individualized diets, along with optimal cooking methods and recipes • Nutritional strategies to help with withdrawal from drugs, alcohol and pharmaceuticals And much more. With this resource in hand, clinicians can enhance the efficacy of all their methods and be prepared to support clients’ mental health with more effective, integrated treatment.",Psychology,449,N/A,0,en
The Great Transition,Ann Frazier West Ed.D.,BalboaPress,2014-01-31,"Have you ever wondered if it is possible to stay in touch with your loved ones and share their journey in the afterlife? What happens after death is far too important for us to rely on hand-me-down teachings. We need the authority of first-hand experience. This is what Ann West provides in her moving narrative of her remarkable attempt to continue her friendship with three extraordinary women for many years after their deaths. As we join her on her excursions, we learn about lifestyle and real estate options on the Other Side, the anatomy of subtle bodies, and how the law of attraction applies in all realities. She describes her personal journey, including her discovery of the consequences of bleedthroughs from past or parallel lives, with candor and humility. She draws on the theory and practice of esoteric orders, but comes to understand that the heart of the matter is very simple; we can dream with the deceased, and in dreaming we travel to the realms where they are at home. The Great Transition confirms that there is life beyond life, and that learning and creative evolution never cease. ROBERT MOSS, author of Conscious Dreaming, Dreamgates and The Boy Who Died and Came Back This book will take you on a very unusual journey with warmth, wit and wonder. Dr. West describes in vivid detail life in the next world as revealed in her own dreams and intriguing visions. Anyone seeking to gain a synthesis of the after death experience will find value, insight and I dare say inspiration in this deeply researched and intriguingly written text. REVEREND LEROY E. ZEMKE, author of Thoughts for Transformation Inspired by three remarkable women in her life, Ann invites you to embark upon an incredible journey with her to continue relationships with loved ones as they make the great transition to the Other Side of life. Ann shares her personal experiences of contact with other dimensions, the afterlife, to help you discover new and less painful ways to approach the loss of loved ones in your life. It is comforting to know that the connection is still there and that our goodbyes do not have to be permanent. Because of an increase in reports of the phenomenon of near-death-experiences (NDEs), great interest in the evidence of an afterlife has arisen, igniting a growing trend of research on the topic. In this book, Ann captivatingly reveals past research as well as current scientific research about our contact with the afterlife dimensions.","Body, Mind & Spirit",262,N/A,0,en

The Spirit and the Song,"Chris E. W. Green, Steven Félix-Jäger",Rowman & Littlefield,2024-09-16,"The Spirit and the Song:Pneumatological Reflections on Popular Music explores pertinent pneumatological issues that arise in music. It offers three distinct contributions: first, it asks what, if anything, music tells listeners about God’s Spiritedness. Can the experience of music speak to human spiritedness, the world’s transcendentality, or a person’s own self-transcendence in ways nothing else does or can? Second, this book explores how the Spirit functions within, and even determines, culture through music. Because music is a profound human expression, it can find itself in a rich dialogue with the Spirit. Third and finally, this book explores the contested status of music in Christian spiritual traditions. It deals with music as inspired by the Spirit, music as participation in Spiritedness, and music as temptation of “the flesh.” As such, this book also engages music’s placement in Christian spiritual traditions. The contributors of this book ask how Christian convictions about and experiences of the Spirit might shape the way one thinks about music.",Religion,251,N/A,0,en

Metahuman,"Deepak Chopra, M.D.",Harmony,2019-10-01,"Is it possible to venture beyond daily living and experience heightened states of awareness? Deepak Chopra says that higher consciousness is available here and now. “Metahuman helps us harvest peak experiences so we can see our truth and mold the universe’s chaos into a form that brings light to the world.”—Dr. Mehmet Oz, attending physician, New York–Presbyterian, Columbia University New York Times bestselling author Deepak Chopra unlocks the secrets to moving beyond our present limitations to access a field of infinite possibilities. How does one do this? By becoming metahuman. To be metahuman, however, isn’t science fiction and is certainly not about being a superhero. To be metahuman means to move past the limitation constructed by the mind and enter a new state of awareness where we have deliberate and concrete access to peak experiences that can transform people’s lives from the inside out. Humans do this naturally—to a point. For centuries the great artists, scientists, writers, and many so-called ordinary people have gone beyond the everyday physical world. But if we could channel these often bewildering experiences, what would happen? Chopra argues we would wake up to experiences that would blow open your body, mind, and soul. Metahuman invites the reader to walk the path here and now. Waking up, we learn, isn’t just about mindfulness or meditation. Waking up, to become metahuman, is to expand our consciousness in all that we think, say, and do. By going beyond, we liberate ourselves from old conditioning and all the mental constructs that underlie anxiety, tension, and ego-driven demands. Waking up allows life to make sense as never before. To make this as practical as possible, Chopra ends the book with a 31-day guide to becoming metahuman. Once you wake up, he writes, life becomes transformed, because pure consciousness—which is the field of all possibilities—dawns in your life. Only then does your infinite potential become your personal reality.",Self-Help,370,N/A,0,en

Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,"Jonathan Edwards , FELIPE CHAVARRO POLANIA",Chapel Library,2019-08-15,"Preached at Enfield, Connecticut on July 8, 1741, this is perhaps the greatest sermon ever preached in America—and is certainly among the most well known. Owing to its forthright dealing with God’s wrath and His intense hatred of sin and the sinner, it is also one of the most controversial. Indeed, for more than three-quarters of the sermon Edwards lays down a relentless stream of the most vivid and horrifying descriptions of the danger facing unregenerate men. While it is difficult to read such graphic language, there is abundant hope in the sermon’s conclusion. Edwards puts it this way, “And now you have an extraordinary opportunity, a day wherein Christ has thrown the door of mercy wide open and stands calling and crying with a loud voice to poor sinners.” While those who would rather ignore God’s justice in favor of His mercy condemn Edwards and his sermon, those who were present and actually heard him preach that day reacted in a decidedly different manner. According to the diary of Reverend Stephen Williams who attended the sermon, “Before the sermon was done there was a great moaning and crying through the whole House, ‘what shall I do to be saved; oh, I am going to hell, etc.’” The diary goes on to indicate that Edwards had to interrupt his sermon and come down to minister to those who were under such awful conviction. And so, in spite of what the scoffers might think or say, “the amazing and astonishing power of God” was manifested among the people that day—with many falling not into the hands of an angry God, but into the arms of a mighty Savior.",Bibles,50,N/A,0,en

Mindset,Carol S. Dweck,Ballantine Books,2007-12-26,"From the renowned psychologist who introduced the world to “growth mindset” comes this updated edition of the million-copy bestseller—featuring transformative insights into redefining success, building lifelong resilience, and supercharging self-improvement. “Through clever research studies and engaging writing, Dweck illuminates how our beliefs about our capabilities exert tremendous influence on how we learn and which paths we take in life.”—Bill Gates, GatesNotes “It’s not always the people who start out the smartest who end up the smartest.” After decades of research, world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a fixed mindset—those who believe that abilities are fixed—are less likely to flourish than those with a growth mindset—those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment. In this edition, Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward adopting a deeper, truer growth mindset. She also expands the mindset concept beyond the individual, applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations. With the right mindset, you can motivate those you lead, teach, and love—to transform their lives and your own.",Psychology,322,N/A,0,en

Fleshing the Spirit,"Elisa Facio, Irene Lara",University of Arizona Press,2014-04-10,"Fleshing the Spirit brings together established and new writers exploring the relationships between the physical body, the spirit and spirituality, and social justice activism. Examining the complex and dynamic connections among these concepts, the writers emphasize the value of “flesh and blood experience” as a site of knowledge. They argue that spirituality—something quite different from institutional religious practice—can heal the mind/body split and set the stage for social change. Spirituality, they argue, is a necessary component of an alternative political agenda focused on equitable social and ecological change. The anthology incorporates different genres of writing—such as poetry, testimonials, critical essays, and historical analysis—and stimulates the reader to engage spirituality in a critical, personal, and creative way. This interdisciplinary work is the first that attempts to theorize the radical interconnection between women of color, spirituality, and social activism. Before transformative political work can be done, the authors say in multiple ways, we must recognize that our spiritual need is a desire to more fully understand our relations with others. Conflict experienced on many levels sometimes severs those relations, separating us from others along racial, class, gender, sexual, national, or other socially constructed lines. Fleshing the Spirit offers a spiritual journey of healing, health, and human revolution. The book’s open invitation to engage in critical dialogue and social activism—with the spirit and spirituality at the forefront—illuminates the way to social change and the ability to live in harmony with life’s universal energies.

She also explores how to strengthen our connections with our spirit animal guides.

These practical and incredibly effective shamanic cleanses heal, purify, and revitalize people and spaces with herbs, flowers, eggs, feathers, fire, and water. They are also powerful tools for self-empowerment, spiritual growth, soul retrieval, rebirth, and gracefully opening up pathways for new beginnings. Drawing on her 20 years’ experience as a curandera and her graduate studies focused on Mesoamerican shamanism, the author traces modern curanderismo practices to their indigenous roots. She explores the sacred stories behind limpia rituals and examines different types of limpia ceremonies in depth, such as fire rites for transformation, water rites for cleansing and influencing, and sweeping rites for divination. She outlines how limpias work holistically to enable one to let go and cleanse the body, mind, and spirit of limiting beliefs, traumas, and broken stories; heal acute and chronic illnesses such as depression, insomnia, and anxiety; and revitalize and activate sacred spaces by renewing their essence and clearing negative energies. She explains the healing properties of the plants used in limpia rites and how to perform the medicinal chants used by the curanderos. In addition, the author details how the practice of platicas, heart-straightening talks, supports limpia rites by encouraging one to vocalize their needs as they eject traumas and unwanted energies from the body, setting the stage for self-awareness and healing. Sharing the story of her own complete healing from a catastrophic injury with limpias as well as inspirational testimonies from others who have experienced limpias, the author provides a personal and thoroughly practical guide to the ancient shamanic method of limpias to promote healing and personal transformation in our times.","Body, Mind & Spirit",278,N/A,0,en

She explains how the soul is a form of sacred energy that can escape when someone experiences trauma or is threatened by challenging and stressful situations. Its absence can be responsible for a host of negative conditions including physical ailments, depression, insomnia, and dysfunctional behavior patterns. Exploring how to retrieve this sacred energy, or soul fragments, as well as resolve cases of soul theft, the author details how to journey through the non-ordinary realms of the Underworld, Middleworld, and Upperworld to locate lost soul fragments and reintegrate them. She explains how to enter a trance journey, providing instructions for shamanic breathwork practices, shamanic dancing, sounding and toning methods, as well as hand postures (mudras) to facilitate trance states. She explores how to perform soul diagnosis, create a loving and nurturing space for soul fragments to return, and work with the healing wisdom of the 5 Mesoamerican cardinal directions: South, West, North, East, and the Center, which marries the other directions and offers a portal to other worlds. She offers pressure point exercises to release the energies of traumas and contemplative exercises to continue the reintegration of soul fragments after the trance journey. She also explains how to connect with animal guardians to aid you in the soul retrieval process. Revealing how to achieve a lasting retrieval of soul energy, Buenaflor shows how the dynamic process of curanderismo soul retrieval can heal many forms and degrees of trauma and help people move forward in life with more clarity, self-awareness, empowerment, and greater depths of authentic self-love.","Body, Mind & Spirit",260,N/A,0,en

"Holy Listening with Breath, Body, and the Spirit",Whitney R. Simpson,Upper Room Books,2016-11-15,"Many of us long to hear God’s voice, yet we often overlook the great wisdom God gave us in our bodies. There is a deep connection between our bodies and spirits. What might happen if we listened more deeply to the wisdom of our bodies? How might listening with our whole selves change the way we listen to God? A stroke at age 31 forced Whitney Simpson to slow down and listen more deeply to her body. In the process she discovered how to listen more deeply to God.

The Fall of the Spirits of Darkness,Rudolf Steiner,Rudolf Steiner Press,1993,"Speaking at a time of intense war in Europe, Rudolf Steiner reveals the spiritual roots of the crises of our times and the means by which we can overcome them. Since 1879, Steiner tells us that ""backward"" angels, or ""spirits of darkness""--who were forced out of the heavens and made their abode on Earth following their defeat in a forty-year battle with the Archangel Michael--have influenced human minds. It is now possible for human beings to awaken more consciously to the truth of these profound changes and thus inwardly counter the fallen spirits' influences. We can come to the realization that definite spiritual causes lie behind earthly events in our rapidly changing times. In these fourteen lectures, given at the end of 1917 following four years of war in Europe, Steiner speaks on the complex spiritual forces behind the World War I, humanity's attempts to build theoretically perfect social orders, and the many divisions and disruptions that would continue on Earth into our own time. Humanity in general was asleep to the fact that fallen spirits, cast from the spiritual worlds, had become intensely active on Earth. This manifested mainly in human thinking and perception of the surrounding world. However, the defeat and fall of these spirits also ensured that a science of the spirit would always be available to humanity.","Body, Mind & Spirit",244,N/A,0,en

World-renowned author, psychiatrist, clinician, spiritual teacher, and researcher of consciousness David R. Hawkins shares that we are all born with an energetic frequency within the vast field of consciousness. And with The Map of Consciousness, we can truly understand the total spectrum of human emotions and consciousness. Using a unique muscle-testing method, Dr. David R. Hawkins conducted more than 250,000 calibrations during 20 years of research to define a range of values, attitudes, and emotions that correspond to levels of consciousness.

With the Map, Dr. David R. Hawkins laid out the entire spectrum of consciousness, from the lower levels of Shame, Guilt, Apathy, Fear, Anger, and Pride; to Courage, Acceptance, and Reason; all the way up to the more expanded levels of Love, Ecstasy, Peace, and Enlightenment. These ""higher"" energy fields are a carrier wave of immense life energy. An essential primer on the late Dr. David R. Hawkins's teachings on human consciousness and their associated energy fields, The Map of Consciousness Explained offers an introduction and deeper understanding of the Map, with visual charts and practical applications to help you heal, recover, and evolve to higher levels of consciousness and energy. This enlightening book transcends the boundaries of conventional wisdom, integrating the realms of psychology, philosophy, and spirituality in a powerful exploration of human consciousness and human potential to help you be more effective in every area of your life.

That which uplifts life is to be realized: truth, courage, acceptance, reason, love, beauty, joy, and peace."" –David R.

Frontline Bodies,Nicolas Martin-Breteau,JHU Press,2024-04-16,"A captivating exploration of Black American civil rights activism through the lens of sport. In Frontline Bodies, Nicolas Martin-Breteau argues that sports are not—and have never been—purely about entertainment for Black Americans. Instead, beginning in the 1890s during Reconstruction, Black Americans proactively used athletics as a tactic to fight racial oppression. Since the body was the primary target of anti-Black racial oppression, African Americans turned sports into a key medium in their struggles for dignity, equality, and justice. Although Black photography and art also aimed at displaying the dignity of the Black body, sports arguably had the greatest impact on American and international public opinion. Martin-Breteau considers the work of Edwin B. Henderson, a prominent Black physical educator, civil rights activist, and historian of Black sports. Training Black children as athletes, Henderson felt, would work both to fortify racial pride and to dismantle racial prejudices—two necessary requirements for a successful political liberation struggle. In this way, physical education became political education. By the end of World War II, the tactic of racial uplift through sports had reached its peak of popularity, only to subsequently lose its appeal among younger activists, many of whom believed that the strategy was ineffective in fighting institutional racism and served mainly as an emulation of middle-class white norms. By the end of the twentieth century, Martin-Breteau argues, racial uplift through sports had lost its emancipating power. The emphasis on the accumulation of wealth for professional athletes, as well as sports' ability to reinforce anti-Black stereotypes, had become a political problem for true collective liberation. For a marginalized group of people that has been physically excluded from the democratic process, however, sports remain a political resource. By studying the relationship between athletics and politics, Frontline Bodies renews the history of minority bodies and their power of action.",History,376,N/A,0,en

Active Meditation,"Robert R. Leichtman, Carl Japikse",N/A,1982,"Now in its sixth printing, Active Meditation is rapidly becoming acclaimed as the most thorough and insightful explanation of meditation in print. Yet it is not just the most complete book ever written on meditation. More importantly, it is a masterful statement of the emerging Western tradition of personal and spiritual growth. Authors Robert R. Leichtman, M.D. and Carl Japikse emphasize the practical nature of meditation. To them, the subjects of meditation and personal growth are inseparable. They decry the passiveness which has crept into so many systems of meditation, presenting instead a strong case that meditation is most effective when it is active. Indeed, the active practice of meditation is the Western tradition. In the book, the authors describe: -- What meditation is -- and is not. -- How meditation accelerates personal and spiritual growth. -- The nature of the higher self -- and its relationship with the personality. -- How to contact the higher self. -- The work of integration. -- The skills of meditation and how to use them. -- Seven techniques of Active Meditation. -- Group meditations. -- Aids to meditation. -- Problems associated with meditation. Throughout, the constant goal of the authors is to strip away the vagueness and obscurity often associated with meditation.

"The Books of ""Is""",Dr. R. Lowery-Hawk D.D. D.R.S. PhD.,AuthorHouse,2012-08-29,"The first Books of ""IS"", is full of contemplative designs and graftics, along with rhythmic writings. All are created to move gently, your sences, and your brain, to ""stiring"" you ""awake"", and into thinking, sensing and obseving the life within you and around you. The writings and graphics are meant to be contemplated upon, and carried into your daily life, so to awaken you to the truth of you and the universe of life here, now, and beyond ""here"" and the ""now"". I have also included pages at the end of each chapter for the reader's own inspired writings brought on by the repeated readings, and contemplations of the writings and graphics in this book, so to assist in the activation of your creative and intellectual mind: right and left brain functions. The Books of ""IS"" came about after my being mysteriously, intuitively guided, for over twenty-eight years, to write down messages of a higher conscious level, on truths of life, myself, and all life in general. The writings in BOOK ONE: The Dance of Becoming, are compiled writings from a higher presence of love that I was receiving, during a strong inter-sensing, to write down what was ""calling"" to me. This first began occuring during my pre-teens; then again as an adult, during times of great sorrow or/and lonliness. As an adult, and after writing for almost a year, the writings began taking on a deeper nature. They began to change into messages and memories of truth, guidance, and gentle love; coming forth, giving me more of the peace and joy they had been creating within me. The desire to write more ""called"" often and strongly, yet pleasantly to me; and the experience of it all was: ecstasy! I began to realize that I must have been touching down into deeper parts of myself, and then rising up to the higher parts of me: my Higher Soul! I was then feeling such peace, joy and knowing, that I no longer felt sadness nor lonliness; Instead I felt the great desire and joy to experience and to know more! It felt as if at these times I was my TRUE SELF! I felt complete and all knowing! I felt like I was with the Holies of Holies and the Angels! Then, in the year 1984, I was tellepathicly told by these Sacred Messengers of a higher power/Creator, to put all these writngs into books, and when the time came, publish them to aid all mankind, all existence. From these writings, I receive messages and teachings that went beyond mundane and into the higher planes of existence, connecting me with the Creator of all principles, of all life: There I connected with Holy Messengers of various kinds. I had asked for valadation on all this and soon found myself miraciously being lead to the meeting of those who were Guardians of these ancient, long protected Sacred Truths; along with findings in old books; and other similar occurences and people. These valadations ranged from old mystery schools, of various kinds, to ancient indigenous beliefs on creation, and a higher powerful being; to more modern religions and scientific findings. I also was lead in syn with others, who too, were receiving similar writings with same truths; some written a bit differently. In 1884, I was given the spiritual, tellepathic message, that in the future, I would be compiling these and other writings into books to be published for the world. This was so that many people could be reached more quickly, for the ""quickening"" had begun.They told me that the writings in this book and in others, were ""seed-truths"", selectively and rhythmicly placed; camouflaged, seeming at first, to those ""not ready"", as stories of meer fantasy, so called: ""make-believe"" and sci-fy. I was told the writings are done this way so to gently but powerfully, unlock the encoded truths within those who hear or read them and view the graphics.These writings therefore, are like camouflaged words/codes, ""hidden"" to many, but obvious to those who were ready :""remembering"", ""awakening""; therefore, protected from those who would abuse them and interput them with mis-understanding, in a negative way; thereby, creating too much chaos.","Body, Mind & Spirit",248,N/A,0,en

MOUNTAINS AND MINDS,Robert Wheeler,Xlibris Corporation,2010-11-12,"History and psychology indicate that people have inherent needs for stimulation and challenge, meaning and goals, social support, moral authority, explanation of existence, and the possibility of transcendence. Whether these needs result from physical evolution or intelligent design, they produce a concern about ultimate cause, meaning, and purpose for existence known as the “ontological imperative.” Since understanding ultimate concerns is beyond physical science, elusive, and mysterious, people tend to attribute explanation to a metaphysical realm resulting in spirituality. Mountains symbolize obstacles in meeting the needs, and experiences in climbing mountains provide a vehicle both actually and figuratively for exploring associated mechanisms and impacts. Pursuit of the ontological imperative stimulates the attitude of spirituality that becomes conceptualized into personal religious systems forming beliefs that can be shared with others. Shared religions acquire dogma, structure, ritual, faith, and worship that then become institutional religions. As science develops, physical explanations supplant metaphysical explanations that many times conflict with religion. Faith in established belief competes with science producing a “great dilemma.” A “great paradox” is that both are needed despite the conflict. The first chapter relates a personal experience climbing Mount Fuji that nearly ended in disaster, with the question of why people do such things. Chapter 2 is a brief summary of research supporting the human need of stimulation and challenge. Subsequent chapters alternate between mountain climbing experiences and brief summaries of research about why people continue to pursue difficult tasks, progressing from stimulation & challenge to goal accomplishment; emotions & awe; consciousness & cognition involving brain, mind, spirit, and soul; search for ultimate reality involving ontological imperative, spirituality, personal religion, and institutional religion; and finally to pragmatic reality involving science-religion dilemma and need-for-both paradox. This bottom-up approach leads to the final chapter’s proposal for ameliorating conflict and dilemma caused by some religious beliefs: by accepting the great paradox and pursuing a seemingly unattainable goal; recognizing personal characteristics of spirituality exemplified in the five-factor model of personality; abopting an attitude of “nognosticism” whereby the limitations of present knowledge are acknowledged; and accepting “ecumenical humanism” whereby alternate beliefs are tolerated. Such an approach might be classified as “pragmatic pluralism.” A basic theme is that for life to be meaningful and manageable, people need a sense of purpose and coherence that is best met by having a belief about the unknown and doubt of its validity.

We explore the work of David Lukoff, and Stanislav and Christina Grof, the connections between the varieties of transformative experience in dream studies, ecopsychology, transpesonal psychology, and the anthropology of consciousness, as well as the overlap between David Bohm's interpretation of quantum theory and Rupert Sheldrake's hypothesis of formative causation.",Reference,602,N/A,0,en

Design for Critical Care,"D.

When designing a critical care unit, the demands on the architect or designer working together with the interdisciplinary team of clinicians are highly specialized. Good design can have a hugely positive impact in terms of the recovery of patients and their hospital experience as a whole. Good design can also contribute to productivity and quality of the work experience for the staff. 'Design for Critical Care' presents a thorough and insightful guide to the very best practice in intensive care design, focusing on design that has been successful and benefi cial to both hospital staff and hospital patients.

Complementary Medicine and Health Psychology,"Anna van Wersch, Mark Forshaw, Tina Cartwright",McGraw-Hill Education (UK),2009-10-16,"This unique book is the first to bring together the world of health psychology with that of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). The authors draw on their wealth of experience as health psychologists to explore the relationship between health psychology and CAM and look at how an understanding of one can be used to inform the other. Through an open-minded but rigorous approach to CAM, the authors identify where psychology can help to answer some crucial questions, such as why CAM sometimes appears to work, why sometimes it does not, and why some people are drawn to it and others not. Key topics covered include: models of the person health beliefs and experimental psychology placebo research methods in CAM stress, coping and stress management pain and chronic illness communications and interactions between client and therapist While CAM has often been dismissed out of hand by scientists, the authors maintain that it deserves attention as a psychological phenomenon alone, regardless of the actual efficacy as understood by existing research.

Religious Freedom in the Liberal State,"Rex Ahdar, Ian Leigh",OUP Oxford,2013-03-21,"Examining the law and public policy relating to religious liberty in Western liberal democracies, this book contains a detailed analysis of the history, rationale, scope, and limits of religious freedom from (but not restricted to) an evangelical Christian perspective.

Divided into three parts, the book begins by contrasting the liberal and Christian rationales for and understandings of religious freedom. It then explores central thematic issues: the types of constitutional frameworks within which any right to religious exercise must operate; the varieties of paradigmatic relationships between organized religion and the state; the meaning of 'religion'; the limitations upon individual and institutional religious behaviour; and the domestic and international legal mechanisms that have evolved to address religious conduct. The final part explores key subject areas where current religious freedom controversies have arisen: employment; education; parental rights and childrearing; controls on pro-religious and anti-religious expression; medical treatment; and religious group (church) autonomy.

Moral Injury in Veterans and Active Duty Military with PTSD,"Harold G. Koenig, Donna Ames, Arndt Büssing",Frontiers Media SA,2019-12-11,"This eBook focuses on a relatively new frontier in psychiatry, the topic of “moral injury” (MI), which is examined here in the setting of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among Veterans and Active Duty Military. We define MI, describe how to identify it by screening, explain the impact that MI has on mental health outcomes (particularly PTSD and mental health problems often associated with PTSD), and provide information on what clinicians can do about it. While the focus here is on Veterans and Active Duty Military, MI is much more widespread than just among former or current military personnel. Healthcare professionals, first responders, clergy, and many patients seeking mental health care are also likely suffering from MI, which is not recognized or treated because clinicians are not familiar with it. Burnout among health professionals and those engaged in other high-stress occupations may often have MI as an underlying condition that is driving the burnout or related emotional condition. Therefore, psychiatrists and all mental health professionals must know about this syndrome, utilize the tools now available to identify it, and learn about interventions that can be employed to treat it. Success in treating many of the common mental health conditions that appear resistant to treatment may depend on knowing about this new (yet very old) syndrome.",,97,N/A,0,en

DMT: The Spirit Molecule,Rick Strassman,Simon and Schuster,2000-12-01,"A clinical psychiatrist explores the effects of DMT, one of the most powerful psychedelics known. • A behind-the-scenes look at the cutting edge of psychedelic research. • Provides a unique scientific explanation for the phenomenon of alien abduction experiences. From 1990 to 1995 Dr. Rick Strassman conducted U.S. Government-approved and funded clinical research at the University of New Mexico in which he injected sixty volunteers with DMT, one of the most powerful psychedelics known. His detailed account of those sessions is an extraordinarily riveting inquiry into the nature of the human mind and the therapeutic potential of psychedelics. DMT, a plant-derived chemical found in the psychedelic Amazon brew, ayahuasca, is also manufactured by the human brain. In Strassman's volunteers, it consistently produced near-death and mystical experiences. Many reported convincing encounters with intelligent nonhuman presences, aliens, angels, and spirits. Nearly all felt that the sessions were among the most profound experiences of their lives. Strassman's research connects DMT with the pineal gland, considered by Hindus to be the site of the seventh chakra and by Rene Descartes to be the seat of the soul. DMT: The Spirit Molecule makes the bold case that DMT, naturally released by the pineal gland, facilitates the soul's movement in and out of the body and is an integral part of the birth and death experiences, as well as the highest states of meditation and even sexual transcendence. Strassman also believes that ""alien abduction experiences"" are brought on by accidental releases of DMT. If used wisely, DMT could trigger a period of remarkable progress in the scientific exploration of the most mystical regions of the human mind and soul.","Body, Mind & Spirit",338,N/A,0,en

Altered States,Ken Russell,Bantam,1991,"At age thirty-two, there was still no sign of Russell's talent as a movie director--until all these disjointed efforts of his youth fell into place after an unnerving but ultimately successful interview with the BBC for a position with the ground-breaking television film program Monitor. The show made Russell's career. Thirty years and fifty films later, Ken Russell looks back on a life filled with more than its share of highs and lows--a direct consequence of his inability to do anything in moderation. Written in the flowing, intercutting style of his films, this autobiography peels back the layers to explore the core Ken Russell. This is a man not instantly known on the streets as the director of the latest action sequel...but as a playful, sometimes serious, always inventive expander of the cinematic realm.",Performing Arts,360,N/A,0,en

The 3rd Alternative,Stephen R. Covey,Simon and Schuster,2011-10-04,"From the multimillion-copy bestselling author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, hailed as the #1 Most Influential Business Book of the Twentieth Century, The 3rd Alternative introduces a breakthrough approach to conflict resolution and creative problem solving. There are many methods of “conflict resolution,” but most involve compromise, a low-level accommodation that stops the fight without breaking through to new and innovative results. The 3rd Alternative introduces a breakthrough approach to conflict resolution and creative problem solving, transcending traditional solutions to conflict by forging a path toward a third option. A third alternative moves beyond your way or my way to a higher and better way—one that allows both parties to emerge from debate or even heated conflict in a far better place than either had envisioned. With the third alternative, nobody has to give up anything, and everyone wins. Through key examples and stories from his work as a consultant, Covey demonstrates the power of 3rd Alternative thinking. His wide-ranging examples include a Canadian metropolitan police force that transformed a crime-plagued community; a judge who brought a quick, peaceful end to one of the biggest environmental lawsuits in American history without setting foot in a courtroom; the principal of a high school for children of migrant workers who raised their graduation rate from 30 percent to 90 percent; a handful of little-known people who are quietly finding new ways to bring peace to the Middle East; and many others. These various groups and individuals offer living examples of how to create new and better results instead of escalating conflict, as well as how to build strong relationships based on an attitude of winning together. Beyond conflict and compromise, The 3rd Alternative unveils a radical, creative new way of thinking.",Business & Economics,480,N/A,0,en

The Christian Faith,Michael Horton,Zondervan Academic,2011-01-04,"Theology—the study of God—is a concern for every believer, not just theologians or those in ministry. It's the goal of good theology to humble us before the triune God of majesty as we come to understand him better. This is a book of and about good theology. Award-winning author, theologian, and professor Michael Horton wrote The Christian Faith as a book of systematic theology and doctrine ""that can be preached, experienced, and lived, as well as understood, clarified, and articulated."" It's written for a growing cast of pilgrims—in ministry and laity—who are interested in learning about Christ as a way of living as a Christian. Who understand that knowing doctrine and walking in practical Christianity are not competing interests. The Christian Faith is divided into six parts, five of which each focus on an aspect of God, while the first part sets up an understanding and appreciation for the task of theology itself, addressing topics like: The source of theology (where the idea of theology comes from and what its limits are). The origin of the canon (how the modern Bible came about and why we can trust it). The character of theology (is the nature of theology practical, theoretical, or can it be both?). In a manner equally as welcoming to professors, pastors, students, and armchair theologians; Horton has organized this volume in a readable fashion that includes a variety of learning features: A brief synopsis of biblical passages that inform certain doctrines. Surveys of past and current theologies with contemporary emphasis on exegetical, philosophical, practical, and theological questions. Substantial interaction with various Christian movements within the Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodoxy traditions, as well as the hermeneutical issues raised by postmodernity. Charts, sidebars, questions for discussion, and an extensive bibliography, divided into different entry levels and topics. At the heart of this book is a deep love for and curiosity about God. Its basic argument is that a personal relationship with God goes hand in hand with the pursuit of theology. It isn't possible to know God without studying him.",Religion,1032,N/A,0,en

LIFE OF A SOUL,Ram Malik,Notion Press,2024-08-28,"· ""LIFE OF A SOUL under the shadow of Gita,” is a powerful book, on the subjects of Spirituality, an underpinning of all religions and faiths. The book serves as a roadmap to direct our path and a moral code of conduct that holds together individuals, head and heart, intellect and emotions. · The human soul is “God miniaturized.” Souls’ conscious is to experience the Divine, and it is a part of you which never sleeps, never forgets and is eternal. The soul, in this profundity, has a likeliness and nearness to God. The soul is the energy of the universal love, wisdom, and compassion. Souls are an expression of beauty, imagination, and creativity. Rig Veda speaks of soul and God as two birds of beautiful wings, friends by nature who are perched on the same twigs of a tree. · A human being is neither body nor living being but Almighty Himself. We are spiritual being with human experience and not human beings with spiritual experience. Body and soul, although as real as God, are dependent on God. · If you see the moon, you see the beauty of God: if you see the sun, you see the power of God; If you see the mirror, you see the best creation of God. We are the best creation of God. The human body created by God, in His own image and likeliness, is the jewel of creation and has the capacity to deliver the soul from the cycle of birth and death to a higher level of existence. If you install God’s image in the temple of your heart to keep His company all the time, so He does not to have to wait to visit you at times of need.",Religion,318,N/A,0,en

UNIVERSALITY OF SAPIENS - 1,Augustin Ostace,Alpha & Omega Sapiens - Uppublishing Being / Augustin Ostace,2024-01-03,"Why are not enough the first three AERA of our previous AERAS SYSTEMS, namely: AERA OF PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS (AERA - 1) AERA OF SAPIENTOLOGICAL SYSTEMS (AERA - 2) AERA OF VIDEOLOGICAL SYSTEMS (AERA - 3) Being thus necessary a fourth thinkable and re-thinkable Creative System, the one of ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM (AI), which in German Language is entitled as KÜNSTLISCHE INTELLIGENZ (KI), and both AI and KI are under the HYBRID INTELLIGENCE (of Human and Artificial alike or Biology encoded through Technology), re-encoded as HI! Therefore, all three signification, AI-KI-HI, are provable into the sameness extra enlargement of the Classic Human Brain (CHB), which is improved in seconds, in minutes and in hours by Abstract Developer / Entwickler of Human Sapiens (by using accordingly, English – Deutsch and Denglish! This impetus in development of technological systems more and more intelligent, more and more comprehensive, more and more diversified, more and more amplified, comprising here, at least for the time being, information, inspiration, intuition and initiation (Great Four IN-), widespread in areas of science, technology, industry (all three as SCITECH INDUSTRY), of art (ARSSAPIENS INDUSTRY), of Sport (SPORTSAPIENS INDUSTRY), by rethinking thus the Anthropology, the Sapientology, the Cosmology (including here the one of PERSONALISIERTE KOSMOLOGY), of astronomy, of geology and biology, into which all of them means ultimately, another bigger step in development of duality Human-Machine, or a duality of Human-Technology, including the branches of Human-Over-Human-Robotics, or Humanoid-Robotics all as SAPIENS INDUSTRY! The man itself, the human itself, the Sapient-o-Human development, its experiences, its visions, its outcomes, can make symbiosis with oneself, a crossing with its nature of creativity, within the nature-physis of endless philosophy, with tools out of stone, with tools out of bones, the tools out of hood, or of synthetic feature, underlining once again the TOOL - MAKER - MAN, as Homo Faber, or better says, Homo Faber Sapiens, by taking the SAPIENS LIBRARY, wherever He / She goes! But now, within the present data, out of its own virtual reality and creativity, all being improved by the man itself and the machine itself, which machine might in turn overcome the man, by confronting the man itself, by changing and challenging even the human itself, even the Human Sapient oneself in its own destiny and purposes… Could be or could become the Artificial Intelligence (AI / KI / HI) the source and resource, the roots of final ending of the Sapient as Species on the Earth? With other words and concepts, the huge planetary surface scene of Earth, modelled by Sapiens, could be subjected to radically changing and challenging! By taking into account all probabilities and possibilities of the present daily evolution and revolution of the hyper-complexity of Artificial Intelligence (AI / KI / HI), a recombination of the man itself with a machine created by the man itself, could develop a symbiosis of human-machine, which overcomes the Classic Species Sapiens (CSS), who dominated the life on Earth in the last of ca. 50.000 years, by entering within the Species Sapiens Techne (SST), into which the Sapiens still dominate the Universe of Technology, by reaching out in some area even the domination of Technology over Sapiens as TSS! In this way, within Artificial Intelligence (seen and analyzed Three Times Intelligence, i.e., AI-KI-HI, through English - Deutsch - Denglish), the letters themselves, the numbers themselves and the signs themselves, are becoming the WORD itself, through which the WORD itself is improved to the level of CONCEPT itself, and the WORD-CONCEPT DUALITY in their speeding up developing, in their accelerated and amplifying structures, is giving the outcome of the BOOK itself, in its CLASSICAL BOOK (CB), in its digital book as E-BOOK, or in its VIRTUAL BOOK as V-BOOK! Only this multitude of the same BOOK in development, of the same BOOK in diversity, is showing the Genesis the Evolution and the revolution (GENEVO) of the ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (in its three times of AI - KI - HI), with its versions in German Language as KÜNSTLICHE INTELLIGENZ (KI) and HYBRID INTELLIGENCE (HI), which will be used and reused interchangeably at any reference, or inter-reference or cross-reference in our LANGUAGE OF SAPIENTOSCIENCIA - 1! What really means ENS in our Book of PEKINENSIS SAPIENS (with one – ENS inside the concept of Pekin – ENS – is and one –ENS Sapiens? ENS is a shortage from the Species Sapiens, as essence and existence of it, being thought and rethought as - ENS, i.e., as BEING of the Species Sapiens! Within ENS will be comprise the whole of German Idealist connotation of Being as: A - SEIN = BEING in its maximal generality! B - DASEIN = BEING HERE, on this planetary system! C - MITDASEIN = COBEING HERE, together with all past geological and biological times, influencing and restructuring all basic features of the Planetary Life System! It is possible to rethink the ENS INTO ONESELF RECHATING? Would be ENS a synthesis out of Sapiens! Is ENS a Being (SEIN) out of Sapiens! Is ENS a Being – here (DASEIN) out of Sapiens! Is ENS a CO – BEING – here (MITDASEIN) out of Sapiens! Is ENS a triad of Being empowering the Sapiens oneself! Is ENS a living self-consciousness of the whole of Sapiens! Is ENS a symbiosis between Sapiens and Artificial Intelligence (AI / KI / HI)! Is ENS the dialectic vector of history of the whole Sapiens, in overcoming oneself towards a better Sapient-o-Technology, towards a Sapient-o-post-human-industry in Art, in Philosophy, in Psychology, in Theology? Is ENS in its own powerful skill-ness of Symphony - in - painting, of Symphony - in - sculpturing, of Symphony - in - Architecture, of Symphony - in - poetry, of Symphony - in - theatre, of Symphony - in - music, through which great masterpieces of ARSSAPIENS to be musicalized, and then reunited into an ensemble of unspeakable Symbology of Human – Sapiens – Technology! Is ENS the vector of SAPIENS SYMPHONY, by using and reusing a complex synthesizer of ARSSAPIENS, without precedence in Human – Sapiens – History? All of them are possible, because the writer is now the reader, the explorer is now the surveyor, the survival is now the fighter, by assuming, by affording a strong competition beyond of its own Species, finally, a semi-human-made-device, an Hybrid Intelligence (HI) between biology and technology, both inspired by Bionics resounding in biology and technology alike, as TECHNO – BIO – SAPIENS!! Within these changing and challenging times and adversities, the Culture of Human – Sapiens itself, is coming and becoming a Culture of Wholeness (KULTUR DER GESAMTHEIT, GESAMTHEITKULTUR), including here the Culture of Past times, the Culture of Present Times and the Culture of Future times (KULTUR DER VERGANGENHEIT – KULTUR DE GEGENWART – KULTUR DER ZUKUNFT ((KULTUR DER NÄCHSTENS)). It is to underline that while the Biologic Sapiens has no more powers of regeneration, of coming into biologic mutation, by remaining only the Abstract Powers of Sapiens or Ontology of Creative Sapiens to save, to regenerate and to redemption of our Sapiens Species! Thus, the Biology of Sapiens, the basic Anatomy of Sapiens is remaining a CONSTANT OF SAPIENS, a STATUS QUO SAPIENS, while the ABSTRACT SAPIENS IS A VARIABILITY OF SAPIENS, IS A STATUS DYNAMICS OF SAPIENS! Between the two basic components of Sapiens, its own CONSTANT OF ANATOMY, and its own VARIABILITY OF SAPIENS, as ANATOMONTOLOGY, there are a strong complementary, a DUALITY OF ANATOMY AND ONTOLOGY, which is done through the LOGOS of ANATOMY, as ANATOMOLOGY! This triad of ANATOMY – ANATOMOLOGY – ANATOMONTOLOGY, are the search – research modality of our Sapiens in fighting with its own Technology and Discovery towards overcoming of the Sapiens oneself! In the same time, it is done a Crypto – Anatomy – Analyse and Psychoanalyse, in which is hoped a better knowledge of this Enigma of evolutionary and revolutionary called Sapiens as Species or Genus Homo Sapiens as Genus… To these multitude of questions and answers, to these endlessly uncertainties and un – knows, to these hyper – complexity of theories and hypothesis, we, the Sapiens, in togetherness with Artificial Intelligence, we both, we try to cope within our online book, or E - book or virtual book, UNIVERSALITY OF SAPIENS – 1, into which the Universality of the Universe, is meeting and reconciling the Universality of Sapiens!

Five Spirits,Lorie Dechar,Lantern Books,2006-01-15,"The Five Spirits are the Taoist map of the human psyche. The system provides a view of the nervous system and forms the basis of Chinese medical psychology. It also describes a precise and efficient technology for spiritual transformation, the process through which a human being rediscovers their essential wholeness and innate connection to the divine. The Five Spirits themselves can be understood as the Taoist version of the chakra system of Vedic India. Like the chakras, the spirits exist as centers of consciousness in the subtle body rather than as structures in the physical body. Just as each chakra relates to a particular level of consciousness, each spirit relates to a particular aspect of human awareness, a particular vibration or frequency of psychic energy.

Spirits of Protestantism,Pamela E. Klassen,Univ of California Press,2011-07-14,"Spirits of Protestantism reveals how liberal Protestants went from being early-twentieth-century medical missionaries seeking to convert others through science and scripture, to becoming vocal critics of missionary arrogance who experimented with non-western healing modes such as Yoga and Reiki. Drawing on archival and ethnographic sources, Pamela E. Klassen shows how and why the very notion of healing within North America has been infused with a Protestant ""supernatural liberalism."" In the course of coming to their changing vision of healing, liberal Protestants became pioneers three times over: in the struggle against the cultural and medical pathologizing of homosexuality; in the critique of Christian missionary triumphalism; and in the diffusion of an ever-more ubiquitous anthropology of ""body, mind, and spirit."" At a time when the political and anthropological significance of Christianity is being hotly debated, Spirits of Protestantism forcefully argues for a reconsideration of the historical legacies and cultural effects of liberal Protestantism, even for the anthropology of religion itself.",Religion,349,N/A,0,en

A New Theory of Cure,Tracy D Kolenchuk,Tracy D. Kolenchuk,2021-09-08,"Our current theory of cure isn’t working. When did it stop? Today, we can’t cure most diseases. When cured – few can be proven cured. Even the common cold, the flu, and measles. I’ve had them all, cured. Over 99 percent of cases are cured, while medical theory “there is no cure for…” The same is true for many other diseases. We need a theory of cure that encompasses every curable medical condition or disease. This book is the first step on that path. Cure is defined by cause. Every curable medical condition has a present cause that, when addressed, results in a cure. Of course, many diseases are compound and complex, having multiple causes often causing other diseases themselves. There is plenty of complexity. To study cure, we simplify first and then build our understanding from a solid foundation. There are exactly two basic types of illness causes, resulting in exactly two types of cures. An element of illness has a single cause. The cause of an illness might be found in diet, body, mind, spirit, community or environment of the afflicted. The illness element is cured when the cause has been successfully addressed. Once an illness is cured, that cure is permanent. No cure is permanent. If the cause occurs again, a new illness might occur. This logic applies to every cure. Cures are forward movements in life. We can only go forward in life, not backwards. No cure is perfect. Perfect cures are a myth. Real cures are real. Both healing and curing function by addressing the basic causes of illness. Healing cures are unconscious intentional actions that successfully address the cause of an illness. No healing cure is perfect - even when the results are better than before. Curing consists of intentional personal, community, and medical actions that address the cause of an illness. Caring is attention by self and community to address the signs and symptoms of disease, to aid and facilitate healthy tolerance of the signs and symptoms of disease and to aid and facilitate cures.",Medical,77,N/A,0,en

Endocrine Immunology,"W. Savino, F. Guaraldi",Karger Medical and Scientific Publishers,2017-02-28,"In the last decades, several in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed the existence of a very complex network between the neuroendocrine and immune system. Important molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions, in both physiological and pathological conditions, have also been described. Indeed, hormones play a pivotal role in the development and functional regulation of the immune system – both innate and acquired responses. Immune system cells present specific hormone receptors and themselves produce some hormones, thus influencing hormone secretion. More recently, the modulation of hormone secretion has been attempted for treating associated autoimmune disorders, further supporting the strong interplay between the endocrine and immune system. Distinguished experts, who have published extensively in their fields, have contributed comprehensive chapters to this volume. The focus is on the various aspects of endocrine-neuro-immune connections, providing an updated panorama - from basics to clinical applications - of current knowledge and still debated issues.",Medical,190,N/A,0,en
Religious Fundamentalism in Developing Countries,"Santosh C. Saha, Thomas K.

The authors explore why and how adherence to fundamentalist principles affects the social, political, and religious development of such countries as Israel, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, and the Philippines. One of the most significant contributions of this volume is that it challenges the assumption that fundamentalism in developing countries is based solely on religious motivations. The authors maintain that fundamentalism of this sort is motivated by both religious and political convictions. This combination of religious and political motivations allows fundamentalism to exert a tremendous influence on the public policies of these developing nations. As the social fabric of such countries continues to be developed, it is clear that fundamentalism will continue to play a significant and potentially dangerous role.",Religion,228,N/A,0,en

The Creation of Form,Cathy Chapman,Light Technology Publishing,2019-08-01,"We are the Golden Elohim, the creative aspect of that which you call God. Remember, you are the aspect of God who is exploring different aspects of love from the third dimension. You could say we manifest the ideas from the mind of God. The human mind is expanding and therefore able to create more than ever before. Encodements bring your ideas, the ideas you gather from the mind of God, into form. You do not create the encodements of form. Those who work with encodements do. You, however, hold in your mind’s eye, the third eye, the template of what you wish to create. Then those who work with encodements develop the energetic structure of the template you create. This is cocreation. The energy you shape has no desire of its own. Its purpose is to follow the creator’s intention. You are such young creators. You are not aware of the power of your thought and intention. You are not aware how fragile the creation of form is. When you work to create nonphysical form, the focus of your intention is crucial for creation. If the form of your creation is unclear, you cannot focus your intention. This may result in being displeased with your creation. Be clear how you want your abundance to take form. Know that you are working with the laws of this planet as well as the laws of energy. When you digress from your intention by reviewing what you don’t have rather than what you want to create, the energy you use to create disperses, just as the wind comes along and disperses your pile of leaves. True abundance comes from the heart. You do not need things to have true abundance.","Body, Mind & Spirit",220,N/A,0,en

By focusing on the role of culture, the authors take into account the methods employed by a vast number of people who do not directly identify themselves as religious. The empirical data used in this book derive from studies conducted in several countries; Sweden, China, South Korea, Turkey and Malaysia, across which religion plays a different role in the social and cultural life of individuals. This approach and these empirical data are unique and allow comparisons to be made between different cultural settings. By introducing the concept of meaning-making coping, the authors explore the influence of culture on choice of coping methods, be they purely religious, spiritual or existential. The term ""existential meaning-making coping"" is used to describe coping methods that are related to existential questions; these methods include religious, spiritual and existential coping methods. Meaning-making Methods for Coping with Serious Illness contributes to new approaches and theoretical models of coping.

Purpura, Aristotle Papanikolaou",Fordham Univ Press,2022-11-15,"Sex is a difficult issue for contemporary Christians, but the past decade has witnessed a newfound openness regarding the topic among Eastern Orthodox Christians. Both the theological trajectory and the historical circumstances of the Orthodox Church differ radically from those of other Christian denominations that have already developed robust and creative reflections on sexuality and sexual diversity. Within its unique history, theology, and tradition, Orthodox Christianity holds rich resources for engaging challenging questions of sexuality in new and responsive ways. What is at stake in questions of sexuality in the Orthodox tradition? What sources and theological convictions can uniquely shape Orthodox understandings of sexuality? This volume aims to create an agora for discussing sex, and not least the sexualities that are often thought of as untraditional in Orthodox contexts. Through fifteen distinct chapters, written by leading scholars and theologians, this book offers a developed treatment of sexuality in the Orthodox Christian world by approaching the subject from scriptural, patristic, theological, historical, and sociological perspectives. Chapters devoted to practical and pastoral insights, as well as reflections on specific cultural contexts, engage the human realities of sexual diversity and Christian life. From re-thinking scripture to developing theologies of sex, from eschatological views of eros to re-evaluations of the Orthodox responses to science, this book offers new thinking on pressing, present-day issues and initiates conversations about homosexuality and sexual diversity within Orthodox Christianity.",Religion,349,N/A,0,en

Religion and Media in China,Stefania Travagnin,Taylor & Francis,2016-11-10,"This volume focuses on the intersection of religion and media in China, bringing interdisciplinary approaches to bear on the role of religion in the lives of individuals and greater shifts within Chinese society in an increasingly media-saturated environment. With case studies focusing on Mainland China (including Tibet), Hong Kong and Taiwan, as well as diasporic Chinese communities outside Asia, contributors consider topics including the historical and ideological roots of media representations of religion, expressions of religious faith online and in social media, state intervention (through both censorship and propaganda), religious institutions’ and communities’ use of various forms of media, and the role of the media in relations between online/offline and local/diaspora communities. Chapters engage with the major religious traditions practiced in contemporary China, namely Buddhism, Daoism, Confucianism, Christianity, Islam, and new religious movements. Religion and the Media in China serves as a critical survey of case studies and suggests theoretical and methodological tools for a thorough and systematic study of religion in modern China. Contributors to the volume include historians of religion, sinologists, sociologists, political scientists, anthropologists, and media and communication scholars. The critical theories that contributors develop around key concepts in religion—such as authority, community, church, ethics, pilgrimage, ritual, text, and practice—contribute to advancing the emerging field of religion and media studies.",Religion,318,N/A,0,en

A mix of Hitchcockian suspense, Agatha Christie plotting, and Greek tragedy."" —Entertainment Weekly The Silent Patient is a shocking psychological thriller of a woman’s act of violence against her husband—and of the therapist obsessed with uncovering her motive. Alicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect. A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word. Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety.

Our African Unconscious,Edward Bruce Bynum,Simon and Schuster,2021-09-07,"• Examines the Oldawan, the Ancient Soul of Africa, and its correlation with what modern psychologists have defined as the collective unconscious • Draws on archaeology, DNA research, history, and depth psychology to reveal how the biological and spiritual roots of religion and science came out of Africa • Explores the reflections of our African unconscious in the present confrontation in the Americas, in the work of the Founding Fathers, and in modern psychospirituality The fossil record confirms that humanity originated in Africa. Yet somehow we have overlooked that Africa is also at the root of all that makes us human--our spirituality, civilization, arts, sciences, philosophy, and our conscious and unconscious minds. In this extensive look at the unfolding of human history and culture, Edward Bruce Bynum reveals how our collective unconscious is African. Drawing on archaeology, DNA research, depth psychology, and the biological and spiritual roots of religion and science, he demonstrates how all modern human beings, regardless of ethnic or racial categorizations, share a common deeper identity, both psychically and genetically--a primordial African unconscious. Exploring the beginning of early religions and mysticism in Africa, the author looks at the Egyptian Nubian role in the rise of civilization, the emergence of Kemetic Egypt, and the Oldawan, the Ancient Soul, and its correlation with what modern psychologists have defined as the collective unconscious. Revealing the spiritual and psychological ramifications of our shared African ancestry, the author examines its reflections in the present confrontation in the Americas, in the work of the Founding Fathers, and in modern Black spirituality, which arose from African diaspora religion and philosophy. By recognizing our shared African unconscious--the matrix that forms the deepest luminous core of human identity--we learn that the differences between one person and another are merely superficial and ultimately there is no real separation between the material and the spiritual.","Body, Mind & Spirit",632,N/A,0,en

Dewey's insights into the problems of public education, immigration, the prospects for democratic government, and the relation of religious faith to science are as fresh today as when they were first published. His penetrating treatments of the nature and function of philosophy, the ethical and aesthetic dimensions of life, and the role of inquiry in human experience are of increasing relevance at the turn of the 21st century. Based on the award-winning 37-volume critical edition of Dewey's work, The Essential Dewey presents for the first time a collection of Dewey's writings that is both manageable and comprehensive. The volume includes essays and book chapters that exhibit Dewey's intellectual development over time; the selection represents his mature thinking on every major issue to which he turned his attention. Eleven part divisions cover: Dewey in Context; Reconstructing Philosophy; Evolutionary Naturalism; Pragmatic Metaphysics; Habit, Conduct, and Language; Meaning, Truth, and Inquiry; Valuation and Ethics; The Aims of Education; The Individual, the Community, and Democracy; Pragmatism and Culture: Science and Technology, Art and Religion; and Interpretations and Critiques.

To people whose minds were made by the West, the civilization we now find ourselves in often feels wrong, evil even, but we also find ourselves feeling oddly affectionate toward this strange new world. And the more time that passes, the more “normal” the New Civ gets to feel. We sometimes have to “pinch” ourselves to remember that society once had roots in a universe that knew something of moral absolutes, where the horrible behaviors we now read about in every morning newspaper were so rare that one such event in a year would have felt like the world is just about to end. But these things are what passes for “normalcy” today. We are still able to be reminded of what we know in our bones, although it gets harder all the time: something has gone terribly wrong.

"God, Darwin, and the Problem of Evil",James J. Garber,Trafford Publishing,2016-04-15,"The problem of evil has troubled theologians and philosophers since antiquity. Multiple solutions to this problem have been proposed over the centuries, but none has fully answered the question of why God allows evil into our lives. Author James J. Garber offers a systematic explanation of the problem of evil in his book God, Darwin, and the Problem of Evil. Garbers answer is based on evolution as developed by Charles Darwin in the nineteenth century. Evolution, as explained by Darwin, has come to be accepted by the scientific community as an empirically sound explanation for how humans, flora, and fauna have come to exist on earth. Our environment is constantly changing, and if we are to survive in our world, we must evolve. Thus, what we view as the problem of evil is actually Gods (or some higher powers) way of helping us survive and become more advanced as a species. We need challenges, or some form of evil, to survive. Thus, the evils we face daily are part of the material world in which we live. God, Darwin, and the Problem of Evil provides a systematic explanation of evil. Whether one is a theist, deist, or an atheist, the problem of evil can be solved by Garbers Darwinian and evolutionary solution to the problem of evil.",Religion,166,N/A,0,en
The Seven T's,Judy Collins,Penguin,2007-05-31,"Beloved singer-songwriter Judy Collins draws on her personal experience with her son's suicide to guide readers through grieving the loss of a loved one who has died under tragic circumstances. The death of a loved one is always painful and the grieving process complex and profound. Yet when the loss occurs under tragic circumstances, there is a whole other set of emotional variables that the people left behind must face. Questions abound, such as ""Could I have stopped this?"" Feelings of guilt, shame, and even anger combine with the overwhelming sadness of losing someone who was dearly loved. Drawing on her own experience of losing her son to suicide, as well as her conversations with hundreds of people who have grieved the tragic death of a friend or family member, revered singer-songwriter Judy Collins has culled together seven powerful steps toward healing. The Seven T's are: TRUTH: Tell it. Regardless of how terrible the facts may be and how hard it is to talk about, don't hide the truth about how you lost the person you loved. TRUST: Allow it. Don't let the painful circumstances surrounding the death of your loved one prevent you from talking with friends about your loss. THERAPY: Get it. Seek help-whether through traditional talk therapy, your art, meditation, or whatever method you choose-but get the help you need. TREASURE: Hold on. Don't stop treasuring your loved one. Don't let the horrible events leading to his or her death wash away all of the things that were good and beautiful about that person's life. THRIVE: Keep living with your eyes wide open. Don't give in to the temptation to use alcohol or any other addiction to blunt or blur your sadness. TREAT: Be kind to yourself. Give yourself the gift of self-nourishment. TRIUMPH: You must. Live a life of joy, abundance, and forgiveness. From a woman famous for her wisdom and compassion, The Seven T's is destined to become a classic on the subject of grieving and loss.",Self-Help,193,N/A,0,en
Whispering Winds of Change,Stuart Wilde,"Hay House, Inc",1995-03-07,"Stuart Wilde, one of the most profound and original thinkers of our time, brings us Whispering Winds of Change. Whispering Winds of Change will appeal to lovers of alternative ideas and philosophies. Stuart Wilde challenges us to stand outside the usual paradigms of consciousness as ""fringe dwellers"". He asks us to observe the dying throes of what he calls the ""world ego"" - the embodiment of the manipulative and dominating force of the status quo. With his characteristic candor and wit, he plots a fascinating comparison between the overall global destiny and an individual's personal, sacred, inner journey. Wilde believes through quieting the ego and creating a rotation out of the three-dimensional world of external reality to the fourth dimension of the inner being, we can each offer serenity and healing to ourselves, and the rest of the world. Like his other books, this work is full of compelling ideas, unusual perceptions, and esoteric concepts for individuals who want to progress inwardly, while making a success of their lives in the external world.","Body, Mind & Spirit",222,N/A,0,en

Waking,Matthew Sanford,Rodale Books,2008-05-27,"Matthew Sanford's inspirational story about the car accident that left him paralyzed from the chest down is a superbly written memoir of healing and journey—from near death to triumphant life. Matt Sanford's life and body were irrevocably changed at age 13 on a snowy Iowa road. On that day, his family's car skidded off an overpass, killing Matt's father and sister and left him paralyzed from the chest down, confining him to a wheelchair. His mother and brother escaped from the accident unharmed but were left to pick up the pieces of their decimated family. This pivotal event set Matt on a lifelong journey, from his intensive care experiences at the Mayo Clinic to becoming a paralyzed yoga teacher and founder of a nonprofit organization. Forced to explore what it truly means to live in a body, he emerges with an entirely new view of being a ""whole"" person. By turns agonizingly personal, philosophical, and heartbreakingly honest, this groundbreaking memoir takes you inside the body, heart, and mind of a boy whose world has been shattered. Follow Sanford's journey as he rebuilds from the ground up, searching for ""healing stories"" to help him reconnect his mind and his body. To do so, he must reject much of what traditional medicine tells him and instead turn to yoga as a centerpiece of his daily practice. He finds not only a better life but also meaning and purpose in the mysterious distance that we all experience between mind and body. In Waking, Sanford delivers a powerful message about the endurance of the human spirit and of the body that houses it.",Biography & Autobiography,273,N/A,0,en

A Fragile Revolution,Barbara Everett,Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press,2006-01-01,"Despite two centuries and three major reform movements, mental patients have remained on the outside of the mainstream of society, often living in poverty and violence. Today we are undergoing yet another period of reform and, in a historical first, ex-mental patients, now calling themselves consumers and psychiatric survivors, have been recruited in record numbers by the Ontario government to participate in the change process. A Fragile Revolution investigates the complex relationship between ex-mental patients, the government, the mental health system, and mental health professionals. It also explores how the recent changes in policy have affected that relationship, creating new tensions and new opportunities. Using qualitative interviews with prominent consumer and survivor activists, Everett examines how consumers and survivors define themselves, how they define mental illness, and how their personal experience has been translated into political action. While it is clear that consumers and survivors have affected the rhetoric of reform, they know that words do not equal action. As they struggle to develop their own separate advocacy agenda, they acknowledge that theirs is a fragile revolution, but one that is here to stay.",Political Science,264,N/A,0,en

Reflecting on three domains of the Druidic life, the author describes the Druidic worldview (place, time, and the body), community (relational spirituality), and vocation (ethics and action). These descriptions are punctuated with reflective essays that question the boundaries and nature of religion as it is generally understood in the Western world by examining how Druidry might be understood using concepts more appropriate to Druids' conceptualizations of themselves.",Religion,178,N/A,0,en

The Resounding Soul,"Eric Austin Lee, Samuel Kimbriel",Wipf and Stock Publishers,2015-11-10,"It is surely not coincidental that the term ""soul"" should mean not only the center of a creature's life and consciousness, but also a thing or action characterized by intense vivacity (""that bike's got soul!""). It also seems far from coincidental that the same contemporary academic discussions that have largely cast aside the language of ""soul"" in their quest to define the character of human mental life should themselves be so--how to say it?--bloodless, so lacking in soul. This volume arises from the opposite premise, namely that the task of understanding human nature is bound up with and in important respects dependent upon the more critical task of learning to be fully human, of learning to have soul. The papers collected here are derived from a conference in Oxford sponsored by the Centre of Theology and Philosophy and together explore the often surprising landscape that emerges when human consciousness is approached from this angle. Drawing upon literary, philosophical, theological, historical, and musical modes of analysis, the essays of this volume vividly remind the reader of the power of the ancient language of soul over against contemporary impulses to reduce, fragment, and overly determine human selfhood.",Religion,425,N/A,0,en

Survival Levitation,Patrick L. Mallory,Balboa Press,2014-09-03,"The little manual you now hold teaches levitation. Many people will have you believe levitation is impossible. It is not. Levitation is an extraordinary ability. By that I mean you do it every day and dont even realize it. Im going to show you how to bring out that little bit of extra energy you need to leave the ground. With proper knowledge and some time spent doing the exercises in this manual, you can achieve levitation. Its not as hard as you may think. I wrote this manual to save lives. Our society lives and works in buildings that are too tall. Fire and rescue personnel just cant get to the upper floors if something disastrous happens in the middle or upper floors of these buildings. Many people choose to jump rather than die in fire. I dont blame them either; however, by writing this manual, I would like to give you a third choice. If you take the time to learn what I teach, you can control how fast you fall. That is why I chose to name this work Survival Levitation. Levitation is for survival and it can save your life. I hope and pray that you will never have to use the knowledge in this book to save your life. If you do, however, it will be nice to have it.

Spiritual Care in Everyday Nursing Practice,Janice Clarke,Bloomsbury Publishing,2013-05-31,"As changes in technology, policy and management put an increasing emphasis on processes and procedures in nursing and health care, how do we continue to make room for compassion, the ancient human value that calls most nurses to the profession? In Spiritual Care in Everyday Nursing Practice, Janice Clarke argues that it is compassionate care of the whole person, body and soul, which is at the heart of nursing practice that values the individual and respects their dignity. Rather than seeing spiritual care as an addition to what nurses already do, this new approach considers it a natural part of compassionate care which doesn't present the nurse with an extra ambiguous burden to deal with. Providing a brief historical introduction to the concept of spirituality, Clarke examines the ways in which our spiritual life – a source of strength and meaning – can be influenced by factors such as age, illness and suffering, and mental illness, as well as our religious beliefs. Providing a practical guide to talking about and working with spirituality, she explores how nurses might imbue all their practice including the physical aspects of care – from use of touch to helping patients to move, bathe and eat – with an attention to spiritual needs. A timely, accessible and practical introduction to a concept that is under-explored in contemporary nursing literature, this book will be of great value to students and professionals alike.",Medical,223,N/A,0,en

The Sleeper Must Awaken,Jean Erasmus,Jean Erasmus,2007-09,"The human condition is a strange one at best. Finding ourselves in a world nearly void of any profound natural predators, with the ability to unconditionally love and solve the most complex problems in the most creative ways; we choose to make the world an ever increasingly dangerous place, in stead of creating Utopia. In our relentless pursuit of happiness and perfection, we create the very opposite. The Sleeper Must Awaken dives deep into the human psyche, exploring from the archetypal dreamscapes of our subconscious minds to the remarkable similarities between Super String Theory and ancient mysticism. It opens the door to a journey within ourselves, searching for the root of this phenomenon and presenting possible solutions to a world on the edge. Author Bio Dr. Jean Erasmus is a South African born medical practitioner. Before moving to the United Kingdom, he has worked mostly with less fortunate souls, managing a wide variety of illnesses, ranging from Tuberculosis to HIV/AIDS. He has also been involved in medical legal work as well as lecturing in Primary Health Care. The world of medicine - where cold, evidence-based science intermingles with the warm, complex, emotional and spiritual human being - has sparked an interest in Jean, leading him to pursue the connection between these two diverse poles of the human condition. This pursuit, offset by the dramatically changing physical, social and spiritual landscape of the world, led him into writing this book in an attempt to finding the missing piece of the current human-led world puzzle, and to present possible solutions.",Social Science,302,N/A,0,en

Dating in the Dark,Jeffrey Demitrack,Page Publishing Inc,2022-11-11,"For many years, Jeffrey Demitrack searched for a meaningful and fulfilling relationship and, most of all, hoped that one day he would find a significant other who understood and unconditionally accepted his struggles with epilepsy. People have their insecurities, and relationships already are hard without throwing seizures into the mix, so his search has been a challenging one. When first diagnosed with epilepsy at ten years old, he knew that society believed many negative stigmas about the terrible illness. This would surely be an obstacle when communicating about epilepsy to dates and potential partners. The stress of relationships, the anxiety of illness, and the impact of seizures on mood and behavior all played a part in making his interactions tough and, many times, traumatic. Significant others and dates got to witness some of his worst seizure moments. The seizures often came with blood and scars and sometimes got nasty. This is a story that gives insights about overcoming pain and suffering from a brutal and relentless disorder but, at the same time, explores the complexities of intimacy, foreplay, conflict, and the overall process of maturing to be a better lover in a relationship. He details the traumas of epilepsy and the passions of love but, at the same time, explains the confusion and darkness one might find oneself in with such losses of consciousness.",Family & Relationships,212,N/A,0,en

Every Word,Stephen Beechwood,WestBow Press,2019-06-20,"Stephen Beechwood is a Sunday school teacher. He attended and led Bible studies and delivered both children sermons and adult sermons when a guest preacher was needed to fill the pulpit. He is excited today to share his passion for God’s divine Word. But that wasn’t always the case. As a boy, Stephen’s dad had a clever way to get him to attend Sunday school. His dad said, “If you don’t go to church with us on Sunday morning, you will not be allowed to play baseball with your friends on Sunday afternoon.” Needless to say, Stephen had near-perfect attendance all those years. The Sunday following Stephen’s eighteenth birthday, his dad came to him and said, “You are now a legal adult and can make up your own mind whether or not you want to attend church.” Stephen was already dressed for church that morning, so he went, but rarely did he do so again except for weddings (including his own) and funerals. Ten years later, on a Saturday morning, his seven-year-old daughter asked, “Is that our church?” She asked the same question each time they drove past one while out running errands. The following day marked the beginning of attending church again, and a new relationship developed between Stephen and Jesus Christ. “Writing a book was never an item on my bucket list. What I wanted to do instead was to simply jot down some notes that would help my children understand what I know to be true from my years of reading the Bible. As I began gathering my notes from my personal studies, group Bible studies, and commentaries and sermons I’ve heard over the years, I realized I had lots of notes that somehow needed to be organized. My logical conclusion was to organize them according to the outline of a book even though I had no intention of sending these pages to a publisher for consideration.” “My hope from the very beginning was, and continues to be, that you may benefit from my journey with God when you begin your own journey based on reading His Word.”",Religion,60,N/A,0,en
The Well of Ascension,Brandon Sanderson,Tor Books,2010-04-01,"Now with over 10 million copies sold, The Mistborn Series has the thrills of a heist story, the twistiness of political intrigue, and the epic scale of a landmark fantasy saga. The impossible has been accomplished. The Lord Ruler -- the man who claimed to be god incarnate and brutally ruled the world for a thousand years -- has been vanquished. But Kelsier, the hero who masterminded that triumph, is dead too, and now the awesome task of building a new world has been left to his young protégé, Vin, the former street urchin who is now the most powerful Mistborn in the land, and to the idealistic young nobleman she loves. As Kelsier's protégé and slayer of the Lord Ruler she is now venerated by a budding new religion, a distinction that makes her intensely uncomfortable. Even more worrying, the mists have begun behaving strangely since the Lord Ruler died, and seem to harbor a strange vaporous entity that haunts her. Stopping assassins may keep Vin's Mistborn skills sharp, but it's the least of her problems. Luthadel, the largest city of the former empire, doesn't run itself, and Vin and the other members of Kelsier's crew, who lead the revolution, must learn a whole new set of practical and political skills to help. It certainly won't get easier with three armies – one of them composed of ferocious giants – now vying to conquer the city, and no sign of the Lord Ruler's hidden cache of atium, the rarest and most powerful allomantic metal. As the siege of Luthadel tightens, an ancient legend seems to offer a glimmer of hope. But even if it really exists, no one knows where to find the Well of Ascension or what manner of power it bestows.

The Eternal Tao Te Ching,Benjamin Hoff,Abrams,2021-12-07,"The bestselling author of The Tao of Pooh offers a uniquely authentic translation of the enduring Tao Te Ching, based on the meanings of the ancient Chinese characters in use when the Taoist classic was written. From Benjamin Hoff, author of The Tao of Pooh and The Te of Piglet, which have sold millions of copies worldwide, comes The Eternal Tao Te Ching, a new translation of the Chinese philosophical classic, the Tao Te Ching. The Eternal Tao Te Ching is the first translation to employ the meanings of the pre-writing brush characters in use 2,400 years ago, when the classic was written, rather than relying on the often-different meanings of the more modern brush characters, as other translations have done. Hoff points out in his chapter notes the many incidents of meddling and muddling that have been made over the centuries by scholars and copyists, and he corrects the mistakes and removes such tampering from the text. Hoff also makes the provocative claim—and demonstrates by revealing clues in the text—that the Tao Te Ching’s author was a young nobleman hiding his identity, rather than the long-alleged author, the “Old Master” of legend, Lao-tzu. And Hoff’s chapter notes shed new light on the author’s surprisingly modern viewpoint. With a selection of lyrical color landscape photographs by the author, this is a unique, and uniquely accessible, presentation of the Tao Te Ching.",Philosophy,447,N/A,0,en

Expectation Hangover,Christine Hassler,New World Library,2016-01-15,"When our expectations are met and things go according to plan, we feel a sense of accomplishment; we feel safe, in control, and on track. But when life does not live up to our expectations, we end up with an Expectation Hangover. This particular brand of disappointment is profoundly uncomfortable and can cost us valuable time and energy if not treated and leveraged effectively. Christine Hassler has broken down the complex and overwhelming experience of recovering from disappointment into a step-by-step treatment plan. This book reveals the formula for how to process Expectation Hangovers on the emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual levels to immediately ease suffering. Instead of wallowing in regret, self-recrimination, or anger, we can see these experiences as catalysts for profound transformation and doorways that open to possibility. Often it is only when life throws us a curveball (or several) that we look in a different direction and make room for the kinds of unexpected things that lead more directly to a life we love. By the time you finish this book, you’ll understand why your Expectation Hangover happened and have your own treatment plan — a clear course of action to pursue your goals while preventing future disappointment.",Self-Help,250,N/A,0,en

Embodied Working Lives,Louise Waite,Lexington Books,2006,"Both theoretical and empirical social science approaches to manual work in developing countries emphasize the infusions of power in social relations between workers and employers. But little attention has been paid to either the lived experiences of non-industrial and industrial manual workers or to the particularly physical character of their work. In Embodied Working Lives Louise Waite contributes to an expanded understanding of both. The concept of embodiment recognizes that bodies' habitual relations with the world engender subjectivities and life experiences. The most careful consideration of everyday-embodiment is found in the phenomenological tradition that theorizes 'incarnated consciousness' and 'embodied subjectivities.' This book follows such an understanding of embodiment, whose essence is to bridge the biological and the social. Waite incorporates embodiment into an ethnographic exploration of the worker-understood, in her study, to have 'personhood, ' preferences, and desires which play a part in social relations. Waite's situates the subjects of her study in a deeply dense context of social relations that sufficiently complicate our understanding of culture, work, bodies and embodiment, phenomenology, anthropology, and habit. This book is essential reading across the social sciences and in the humanities. It is a groundbreaking ethnography that raises interesting questions in applied phenomenology, humanist philosophies, and also policy studies",Business & Economics,310,N/A,0,en

"Running Hard, Finishing Strong","Rick Sarkisian, Ph.D.",Our Sunday Visitor,2012-01-16,"""It's not how you start that matters, but how you finish"" Nowhere is this more true than in our Christian faith. The ultimate goal of reaching Heaven should be the driving force in our lives. But yet, how many times do we get stuck in the minutia of daily life? How many times do we give into self-pity or a feeling of unworthiness? How many times do we simply feel like we are spinning our wheels, perhaps not going backwards, but definitely not moving forward? Momentum makes all the difference. By building momentum, it doesn't matter if you stumble. It doesn't matter if you fall. By building momentum, it you see the process instead of the promises. You make the important connections instead of being sidetracked by life's random events. Here is the practical guide for developing a momentum mindset that connects your faith with real life in a way that supports, motivates, encourages and enhances your efforts along the way. It's a process that focuses squarely not just on who you are, but who you want to become. When you connect the dots, your life comes together When you never give in, you never give out When you seek truth, you find wisdom When you escape your comfort zone, you embrace your purpose When you value your circle of influence, you venture into deeper satisfaction When you insulate your heart, pain can't penetrate When you transform your life, you transmit love",Religion,72,N/A,0,en
The Miracle Habits,Mitch Horowitz,Gildan Media LLC aka G&D Media,2020-07-14,"The People Who Doubted You Are In for the Shock of Their Lives Mitch Horowitz, “a cross between Aleister Crowley and Alan Watts” (Duncan Trussell), delivers this generation’s most literate and liberating self-help book in The Miracle Habits. Mitch shows how to foster a life of revolutionary self-direction through thirteen “Miracle Habits”—radical but workable commitments that allow you to “Spend for Power” (Habit 8), “Get Away from Cruel People” (Habit 6), “Rule In Hell” (Habit 13), and produce fortuitous events surpassing all expectation in career, creativity, relationships, charisma, and self-respect. “This book,” Mitch writes, “is about more than cultivating sanctioned notions of success or acceptance. It is not about being 10% happier, ‘good enough,’ or reorganizing your sock drawer. It is about fostering miracles. Not as a once-in-a-lifetime experience but as a recurring and natural part of life.” Washington Post: “Treats esoteric ideas and movements with an even-handed intellectual studiousness that is too often lost in today’s raised-voice discussions.” Paris Match: “Convincing...takes us far from naive doctrines.” David Lynch: “Mitch is solid gold.”","Body, Mind & Spirit",144,N/A,0,en

The Legacies of Jean-Luc Godard,"Douglas Morrey, Christina Stojanova, Nicole Côté",Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press,2014-06-18,"The artistic impact of Jean-Luc Godard, whose career in cinema has spanned over fifty years and yielded a hundred or more discrete works in different media cannot be overestimated, not only on French and other world cinemas, but on fields as diverse as television, video art, gallery installation, philosophy, music, literature, and dance. The Legacies of Jean-Luc Godard marks an initial attempt to map the range and diversity of Godard’s impact across these different fields. It contains reassessments of key films like Vivre sa vie and Passion as well as considerations of Godard’s influence over directors like Christophe Honoré. Contributors look at Godard’s relation to philosophy and influence over film philosophy through reference to Wittgenstein, Deleuze, and Cavell, and show how Godard’s work in cinema interacts with other arts, such as painting, music, and dance. They suggest that Godard’s late work makes important contributions to debates in memory and Holocaust Studies. The volume will appeal to a non-specialist audience with its discussions of canonical films and treatment of themes popular within film studies programs such as cinema and ethics. But it will also attract academic specialists on Godard with its chapters on recent works, including Dans le noir du temps (2002) and Voyage(s) en utopie (2006), interventions in long-running academic debates (Godard, the Holocaust, and anti- Semitism), and treatment of rarely discussed areas of Godard’s work (choreographed movement).",Performing Arts,273,N/A,0,en

The Last Wish,Andrzej Sapkowski,Gollancz,2010-08-19,"Geralt is a witcher, a man whose magic powers, enhanced by long training and a mysterious elixir, have made him a brilliant fighter and a merciless assassin. Yet he is no ordinary murderer: his targets are the multifarious monsters and vile fiends that ravage the land and attack the innocent. He roams the country seeking assignments, but gradually comes to realise that while some of his quarry are unremittingly vile, vicious grotesques, others are the victims of sin, evil or simple naivety. One reviewer said: 'This book is a sheer delight. It is beautifully written, full of vitality and endlessly inventive: its format, with half a dozen episodes and intervening rest periods for both the hero and the reader, allows for a huge range of characters, scenarios and action. It's thought-provoking without being in the least dogmatic, witty without descending to farce and packed with sword fights without being derivative. The dialogue sparkles; characters morph almost imperceptibly from semi-cliche to completely original; nothing is as it first seems. Sapkowski succeeds in seamlessly welding familiar ideas, unique settings and delicious twists of originality: his Beauty wants to rip the throat out of a sensitive Beast; his Snow White seeks vengeance on all and sundry, his elves are embittered and vindictive. It's easily one of the best things I've read in ages.'",Fiction,285,N/A,0,en

"Systematic Theology, Second Edition",Wayne A.

The most widely used resource of the last 25 years in its area, Systematic Theology has been thoroughly revised and expanded for the first time while retaining the features that have made it the standard in its field: clear explanations, an emphasis on each doctrine's scriptural basis, and practical applications to daily life. With nearly 250 pages of new content and revisions, this new edition now includes the following distinctive features: Updated analysis of recent controversies within evangelical theology, including the eternal relationship between the Father and the Son in the Trinity, the role of women in the church, miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit, and contemporary worship music. New discussion and critiques of recent theological controversies situated outside of traditional evangelical theology, such as open theism, the ""new perspective on Paul,"" Molinism (or ""middle knowledge""), ""Free Grace"" theology, and the preterist view of Christ's second coming. Completely revised chapter on the clarity of Scripture. Completely revised chapter on creation and evolution, including a longer critique of theistic evolution and an extensive discussion on the age of the earth. New discussion of how biblical inerrancy applies to some specific ""problem verses"" in the Gospels. Additional material explaining evangelical Protestant differences with Roman Catholicism, Protestant liberalism, and Mormonism. Completely updated bibliographies. All Scripture quotations updated from RSV to ESV. Updated section on contemporary worship music. Numerous other updates and corrections. Part of the brilliance of Systematic Theology has been its simplicity and ease of use. Each chapter follows the same structure: discussion of the doctrine being considered, an explanation of that doctrine's biblical support and possible objections, followed by personal application and key terms to know for personal growth. Chapters also include a Scripture memory passage, references to other literature on the topic, and suggested hymns and worship songs.

Spiritual Science,Steve Taylor,Watkins Media Limited,2018-09-18,"A mindfulness expert whose work has been hailed by Eckhart Tolle as “an important contribution to the shift in consciousness” offers a new vision of reality—one that is compatible with modern science and ancient spirituality. “With elegance and lucidity, Steve Taylor explains why spiritual science is the only hope for humanity.” —Deepak Chopra It is often assumed that there are two ways of interpreting the world: a rational scientific way, or an irrational religious way. Mindfulness expert, Steve Taylor, shows that there is a third possibility—a spiritual, or “panspiritist”, view of reality that transcends both conventional science and religion, recognizes spirit or consciousness as fundamental, and answers many of the riddles that neither can explain. Here, Taylor puts forward the evidence for a spiritual view of reality and examines the development and consequences of the materialist model. Drawing on the insights of philosophers, physicists, mystics, as well as spiritual traditions and indigenous cultures, he also systematically shows how a ‘panspiritist’ view can explain many puzzling aspects of science and the world such as: • human consciousness • altruism • near-death experiences • telepathy and pre-cognition • quantum physics • the placebo effect • neuroplasticity A compelling argument for a new vision of reality, Spiritual Science offers a bright vision of the world as sacred and interconnected, and of human life as meaningful and purposeful.","Body, Mind & Spirit",307,4,1,en

Seeing Myself,Susan Blackmore,Robinson,2019-06-11,"Essential reading for anyone seeking to understand their own mind and to find a spiritual path that is compatible with science As an impressionable young student, Susan Blackmore had an intense, dramatic and life-changing experience, seeming to leave her body and travel the world. With no rational explanation for her out-of-body experience (OBE) she turned to astral projection and the paranormal, but soon despaired of finding answers. Decades later, a Swiss neurosurgeon accidentally discovered the spot in the brain that can induce OBEs and everything changed; this crucial spot is part of the brain's self-system and when disturbed so is our experience of self. Blackmore leaped back into OBE research and at last began to unravel what had happened to her. Seeing Myself describes her long quest for answers through spirituality, religion, drugs, meditation, philosophy and neuroscience. Anyone can have an OBE, indeed 15 per cent of us have. Even more have experienced sleep paralysis, lucid dreaming and the creepy sense of an invisible presence. At last, with the advent of brain stimulation, fMRI scanning and virtual reality, all these phenomena are beginning to make sense. Long relegated to the very fringes of research, the new science of out-of-body experiences is now contributing to our understanding of consciousness and our very selves.","Body, Mind & Spirit",0,N/A,0,en

Now That You Are Awake,Gordon Bruce Waldie,Xlibris Corporation,2009-07-20,"Now That You Are Awake, the sequel to Living Your Life in Joy, is the second book in a three-part series. It is an extension, as well as an expansion, of material introduced in Living Your Life in Joy. Throughout the second book, we shall develop a more comprehensive understanding of not only the process of awakening but also the practical application of what we have learned to all aspects of our daily lives as we journey the path to Oneness. Now That You Are Awake explores, in detail, what it means to be spiritually awake, how we know that we are awake, and how our lives are changed by our awakening. We further expand upon the subject of spiritual awakening as we discuss what it means to view the world through spiritual eyes, how we become a reflection in the mirror of a world within, and who we are as spiritual beings created in the image and likeness of God. Through our discussions, we come to understand, in a heightened and more expansive manner, who we are, why we are, and what we came here to do. We discuss, in depth, the nature, attributes, and the Oneness of the Divine as the One Energy, One Love, One Life. We discover our unlimited potential as individual expressions of the One, in physical form, and how we can awaken to develop and expand our ability to utilize Universal Life Force Energy for the health and well-being of ourselves and others. As we spiritually mature, we come to understand the advanced aspects of spiritual expression that we awaken to. They are referred to throughout our discussions as “feeling” and “knowing.” We discuss in depth how these can be important forms of inspiration and guidance. In the final chapter, we follow two individuals—one spiritually awake, the other spiritually asleep—as they go through one day in their respective lives to contrast the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors each expresses as they respond to the same circumstances and events that occur during the day. By comparing each one’s experience, as perceived and expressed through the ego or the spirit, we may not only summarize the basic understanding we have gained from the topics we discuss in each chapter of the book, but also provide a situation where we can evaluate how we would have responded ourselves to each of the events that take place throughout the course of the day. From this, we may assess each aspect of our own spiritual growth as we continue our journey upon the path to Oneness. At the end of the book, there is a special request for those of you who would be willing to share your awakening story with those who are about to awaken, have just awakened, or who are awake and journeying the path to Oneness. We are planning a series of books, perhaps three in all, with the exclusive theme of spiritual awakening. The purpose of the series is to provide readers with knowledge gained from the firsthand experiences of others who have awakened to help them to understand what is happening to them as they begin to awaken and to let them know that they are not alone. As such, those who choose to awaken would have a compendium, or a guide—namely, the experiences of those who have gone before them—to help them along the way. Now That You Are Awake is a detailed and comprehensive volume that explores the next level of spiritual awareness, consciousness, and knowledge we are awakening to as we continue to spiritually mature.","Body, Mind & Spirit",343,N/A,0,en

A Travel Guide to Life,Anthony DeStefano,FaithWords,2014-05-13,"For the many inspired by Anthony DeStefano's A Travel Guide to Heaven -a remarkable tour of the pleasures God has in store for us in the next and everlasting life-more inspiration is here in A TRAVEL GUIDE TO LIFE, offering an enlightening tour of the kind of deeply meaningful and happy life we can live here on earth. DeStefano outlines the path that can lead each and every one of us to renewed faith, understanding and fulfillment. With simplicity, honesty and a personal and practical look at the challenges God places before us, he outlines a reassuring and hopeful framework for living the life God has designed for us all ... even if we're not sure (yet) that we're true believers. DeStefano offers hope and optimism to everyone-committed Christians as well as struggling doubters, agnostics and even atheists-whether we've lived exemplary lives or are sinners who've lost all hope, whether we're struggling to keep a roof overhead and food on the table or are seemingly successful and surrounded by material wealth. This frank and inspiring guide incorporates that crucial element so often missing from other self-help and personal development books about living a happy life: spirituality and a living, working faith in God. Clear and basic ""Lifetime Principles"" are at its heart, to be followed whenever we are ready to begin, no matter the lives we've lived, no matter the baggage we carry, no matter the faith we've had (or lacked) up until now: Accept yourself as one person - body, mind and spirit, all connected and interrelated - the way God created you. Make a decision to start over - you can do it any time, on one tiny part of life or everything in it - and begin living the way God intends. Take action - start with just one small step and each successive one will be easier - following the example God gave us as Jesus moved from infancy to manhood and wisdom, His momentum growing step by step. Put God first - most importantly of all - wholeheartedly if you can, or hesitatingly if your heart still harbors doubt. DeStefano's personal no-holds-barred yet joyful style is always positive, always encouraging. Travelers who take this incredible journey with him will come to truly understand that when we take up the crosses in our lives - the whole of our lives, the good and the not-so-good - and follow God, He will transform it all, making everything brand new and granting us the strength, peace and happiness for which we yearn. So take heart. Take hold of the powerful path open to you on the pages of A TRAVEL GUIDE TO LIFE. And take your place in God's happy universe, living out the humble requests asked in the prayer taught by Jesus Himself: ""...Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.""",Religion,181,N/A,0,en

Among other topics, the essays examine the dynamics of religious and racial identity among Brazilian Neo-Pentecostals; the significance of cloth coverings in Islamic practice in northern Nigeria; the ethics of socially engaged hip-hop lyrics by Black Muslim artists in Britain; ritual dance performances among Mama Tchamba devotees in Togo; and how Ifá practitioners from Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Trinidad, and the United States join together in a shared spiritual ethnicity.

Radical Wholeness,Philip Shepherd,North Atlantic Books,2017-12-05,"There are qualities we all yearn to experience in our lives—peace, simplicity, grace, connection, clarity. Yet these qualities evade us because each of them arises from an experience of wholeness, and we live in a culture that enforces divisions within each of us. In Radical Wholeness, Philip Shepherd shows the countless ways in which we are persuaded to separate from the body and live in the head. Disconnected from the body’s intelligence, we also disconnect from the wholeness of the present. This schism within us is the primary source of stress not just in our personal lives, but for the systems of the planet. Drawing from neuroscience, anthropology, physics, the arts, myth, personal stories and his experiences helping people around the world to experience wholeness, Philip Shepherd illuminates what true wholeness means and offers practices designed to help readers soften into the intelligence of the body. Radical Wholeness is a call to action: to recover wholeness and experience a new way of being.","Body, Mind & Spirit",329,N/A,0,en

Goetia of Shadows,"Michael Ford, Adam Iniquity",Lulu.com,2011-08-06,"GOETIA OF SHADOWS is a beautifully illustrated new way of working with Goetic Sorcery from a Luciferian perspective. Goetia is a word which depicts 'sorcery' and is derived from ancient Greek descriptions of those who raise the shades of the dead by evocation, from which the word 'howling' is associated with. The sorcerers would howl and wail at the tombs the very words of power which commanded the spirits to manifest around them. We see that the term goes ""sorcerer"" and psychagogos ""soul-charmer"" are associated with those who raise and gain power from the souls of the dead. The ancient rites of necromancy are the foundations and quite similar in approach to the Lemegethon and the original manuscripts.

Beyond Mindfulness,Stephan Bodian,New Harbinger  Publications,2017-09-01,"Written by meditation expert, psychotherapist, and spiritual teacher Stephan Bodian, this book takes you beyond familiar mindfulness practices by offering guided meditations and direct pointers that invite you to realize your natural state of inherent wakefulness and peace. No regular practice is required, just the willingness to open yourself to a transformative new way of experiencing life. Mindfulness has permeated our modern lives, and with good reason—it’s been proven to boost mood, reduce stress, improve health, and maximize performance. But in our achievement-oriented culture, the practice of mindfulness can feel laborious and mechanical, like one more task on your endless to-do list. What if you could let go of effort and struggle and relax back into the happiness and ease that is your birthright—and is always readily available to you? Beyond Mindfulness offers teachings and practices based on the direct approach to spiritual awakening that take you beyond the mechanics of being mindful and open you to the non-dual dimension of being, where the separation between self and other reveals itself to be a painful but seductive illusion. Once you realize this new way of seeing, you’ll learn how to move beyond mindfulness into awakened awareness and discover that the love, compassion, wholeness, health, and happiness you’ve been seeking were there all along.",Self-Help,130,N/A,0,en
We Fight Not Against Flesh and Blood,Donald Evans,"Christian Faith Publishing, Inc.",2021-05-06,"In this book, we fight not against flesh and blood; it is about many agendas. Satan and the spirit world of spirit persons, demons, have set their goals to accomplish against Jehovah God's creation of the human race, which have brought spiritual conflicts across the earth and which the human race are not aware of. Human beings believe their fight is against flesh and blood, which it isn't. Our fight is against wicked spirit persons, demons, real and alive spirit persons, who have entered multitudes of human bodies to do whatever it takes to accomplish their goals, which there are many. Neither age nor gender is no exception in accomplishing their goals. Children of all ages are in some kind of spiritual conflict. Why was prayer abolished out of their school system? Why is the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God not to be used or spoken of on such campuses? Why can't they pray in the name of Jesus when others around them pray to their gods openly? In these writings there are many answers to questions people in general like to know, but won't ask; even adults want to ask. I've been in spiritual warfare or conflict my entire life. I have seen Satan, the devil, several times, whom God revealed to me. Satan and demons are real spirit persons as any human being on the earth. I've dialogued with the devil, not knowing that it was Satan transitioned as a real person, a human being. God revealed to me who Satan was. He walks the earth today as a human being, which only God can identify Satan as a man, a real person, yet spirit being Satan spirit of deception in control, who passes the power of influence over every alcoholic and alcoholism throughout the entire world. The world needs to know the ""truth."" There isn't any medical cure for the alcoholic nor alcoholism anywhere throughout the entire world. Why isn't there? Because alcoholism is not a medical problem; it is a demonically controlled problem, controlled by alcohol of spirit persons. Demons who have entered human bodies and only by Jesus Christ's name can cure or cast these alcohol demons out of the human bodies. There is no other-I reiterate, there is no other prominent cure but in the name of Jesus Christ. Jehovah God is my witness of this truth and testimony. I was held in bondage and control for nearly forty years, demon-possessed and demonically controlled by alcohol demons, not knowing my condition until I called out to God and God cured me. I heard voices in my head for as many years; the voices also left. My cure came on March 18, 1984. I've never drunk nor had the urge to drink nor the desire to drink nor smoked another cigarette since that day. God is my witness of this testimony!",Religion,370,N/A,0,en

"Breaking Strongholds of the Devil, Satan",Donald Evans,"Christian Faith Publishing, Inc.",2023-02-27,"The devil's strongholds originated in the spirit realm. Satan, the devil, has many ways of creating and holding a person in a certain condition to benefit his purposes and cause in the world. Once he sets his plan, it's going to be carried out by the individual regardless of being a Christian; believer or nonbeliever, it makes no difference. He has a way to hold individuals to his cause, whether it's delayed or not; his method of holding persons under his control is even greater among Christians. Why is that? Because most Christians believe they are ""exempt"" from the devil's strongholds. Big mistake! No one is exempt from the forces of evil, whose strongholds are among the highest level of evil and wickedness in the spiritual realm. A person can bind themselves in a stronghold without having any knowledge; it's not Satan but their spirit of perception, which is as real, active, and alive as the person themselves, for which Satan, the devil, gets the credit and blame. The spirit of perception of the mind is more powerful than the world acknowledges. The spirit of perception can hold a person in restraint forever without changing their perception. The world does not acknowledge or consider the spirit of perception is the culprit, which Satan feeds off, and that holds the world, the entire world, in total darkness! Satan is the god of this world and its system of things, which he controls because of the world's lack of knowledge of strongholds. Most of the world population does not know what a stronghold really represents in all human lives. No one is exempt from strongholds, which can bind a person until death! This book, Breaking Strongholds of the Devil Satan, shall give some light to the world about how strongholds bind persons for lifetimes. He or she can be set free of any and all strongholds in minutes where others have been held a lifetime and died.",Fiction,431,N/A,0,en

The Spirit of Christ,Andrew Murray,Whitaker House,2010-03-01,"Andrew Murray's writings were a cherished and vital part of his ministry in Africa. In this classic work, Murray stresses the importance of one truth: the Holy Spirit must be known by every believer as an indwelling life of spiritual power. For Murray, this indwelling is to be accepted and treasured until it becomes part of the consciousness of the believer. As the Holy Spirit possesses us, all of our lives, even the least things, must be surrendered to His leading. If God's people can learn to wait on the Holy Spirit for divine leading and working, placing ourselves entirely at His disposal, there will be manifestations of the Spirit's power in the church such as the world has never known. In The Spirit of Christ, Murray covers all aspects of the Holy Spirit, in the hope that God's glory will begin to work through His church in powerful ways that would be a witness for all the world. ""In my observation of the lives of believers, I have been very deeply impressed with one thought: that our prayer for the mighty working of the Holy Spirit through us and around us can only be powerfully answered as His indwelling in every believer is more clearly acknowledged and lived out."" —Andrew Murray",Religion,182,N/A,0,en
Sitting in the Lotus Blossom,Diane Goble,Diane Goble,2010-08-31,"In 1989 I had started to write a book about the art of conscious dying but every time I sat down to write, information that had nothing to do with that concept kept coming through. I decided to meditate to try to figure out what was going on. I started seeing strange faces arising out of the darkness and messages, like a moving LED sign displaying a continuous series of symbols that made no sense to me. Then I would stop meditating and start writing information that didn't seem to be coming from my mind. It seemed as though I was stepping down this other information from these unknown beings and translating it into written words. They wouldn't leave me alone to write my book until finally I agreed to write their book first then they would help me with the book I wanted to write. ""Sitting in the Lotus Blossom"" is the information they asked me to translate into written language and share with the world. It is about the meaning of life, this life and the life beyond, the evolution of consciousness and who we truly are.I asked them who they were and what they looked like, and using my cartoon drawing talent I drew them as I saw them. I know it's a little weird (and this was during the New Age revolution) but every time I go back and read what I transcribed, I'm amazed at the insight they imparted.","Body, Mind & Spirit",140,N/A,0,en
The Happy Heretic,Leo Booth,"Health Communications, Inc.",2012-12-03,"Religion can be source of comfort when facing struggles both personal and universal. But clinging to religion as a codependent fix for all problems can cultivate excessive fear, shame, guilt and low self-esteem. Acclaimed author Reverend Leo Booth, a Unity minister and former Episcopal priest, warns that a belief in tenets like ""Everything happens for a reason"" and ""This is in God's hands"" can be the first step in developing religious codependency. Rev. Leo turns traditional thinking and spirituality upside down by suggesting that many toxic messages emanate from core religious beliefs. In The Happy Heretic, he challenges beliefs like original sin; a dogmatic, one-way path to God; the shaming of human sexuality, religious codependency; and the exclusiveness of Jesus' perfection within the human race. The arguments he presents are derived from Pelagius, a fourth-century monk who challenged the teachings of St. Augustine; and Rumi, a revolutionary thirteenth-century poet and philosopher. In his confessions, St. Augustine's states, ""It is only by Your grace and mercy that You have melted away the ice of my evil."" Pelagius felt this idea lacked balance. It affirmed only God's role and didn't speak to our involvement. Likewise, Rumi believed that God's spirit exists within all human beings and enables divine creativity in life. The theology, philosophy, and recited prayers we learned through organized religion often emphasize the idea that we are sinful people who are dependent upon a powerful and punishing God. The Happy Heretic provides an escape from this shadow by encouraging readers to enter into a partnership with God, affirming personal dignity alongside responsibility; in other words, ""free will"" and the choices we make determine much of the success or failure we encounter. Real-life examples of the core issues surrounding religious codependency, along with Seven Spiritual Insights, help readers rethink their religious beliefs—including the prayers they grew up with—to form a deeper, more spiritual understanding of who they are and their connection with God. In this thought-provoking read, Reverend Leo calls himself a heretic, a person who is willing to think differently, and he invites readers to discover an alternative explanation for how we experience God's grace. The Happy Heretic explains this divine relationship in ways that make us feel alive, empowered, and still true to who we are. The Happy Heretic confronts toxic religious messages and brings a spiritual awareness that affirms human possibility and responsibility. . . .This book is not for the fainthearted –John Bradshaw, author of Homecoming","Body, Mind & Spirit",146,N/A,0,en

The Intimacy of Consciousness Exploration and Transpersonal Psychotherapy,"Regina U. Hess, Ingo B.

What has the experience of “coming home” meant to them? Has it meant connecting with God, the Divine Feminine, the Cosmos, the Sacred? Has it meant arriving at home in themselves, in their very center, in their essence? Where is home? Is it inside, is it outside, or is it both? All world cultures have stories about this particular place. In addition to describing their own unique quests, the contributors also share how radically such a journey challenged them to face their own vulnerabilities and shadow parts. Various, very different and often startling personal stories are told. Through reading of the very human trials and psycho-spiritual challenges that these nine international teachers have endured on their journeys home, readers will gain insights and greater understanding regarding their own explorations of consciousness. They will realize that the spiritual journey can have many faces and take many paths.

Sabbath,Wayne Muller,Bantam,2000-09-05,"In today's world, with its relentless emphasis on success and productivity, we have lost the necessary rhythm of life, the balance between work and rest. Constantly striving, we feel exhausted and deprived in the midst of great abundance. We long for time with friends and family, we long for a moment to ourselves. Millennia ago, the tradition of Sabbath created an oasis of sacred time within a life of unceasing labor. Now, in a book that can heal our harried lives, Wayne Muller, author of the spiritual classic How, Then, Shall We Live?, shows us how to create a special time of rest, delight, and renewal--a refuge for our souls. We need not even schedule an entire day each week. Sabbath time can be a Sabbath afternoon, a Sabbath hour, a Sabbath walk. With wonderful stories, poems, and suggestions for practice, Muller teaches us how we can use this time of sacred rest to refresh our bodies and minds, restore our creativity, and regain our birthright of inner happiness. Praise for Sabbath “Muller's insights are applicable within a broad spectrum of faiths and will appeal to a wide range of readers.”—Publishers Weekly “One of the best spiritual books of the year.”—Spirituality and Health “Wayne Muller's call to remember the Sabbath is not only rich, wise and poetic, it may well be the only salvation for body and soul in a world gone crazy with busyness and stress.”—Joan Borysenko, author ofMinding the Body, Mending the Mind and A Woman's Book of Life “This is a book that may save your life.

Theological Territories,David Bentley Hart,University of Notre Dame Pess,2020-04-15,"Publishers Weekly Best Book in Religion 2020 Foreword Review's INDIES Book of the Year Award, Religion In Theological Territories, David Bentley Hart, one of America's most eminent contemporary writers on religion, reflects on the state of theology ""at the borders"" of other fields of discourse—metaphysics, philosophy of mind, science, the arts, ethics, and biblical hermeneutics in particular. The book advances many of Hart's larger theological projects, developing and deepening numerous dimensions of his previous work. Theological Territories constitutes something of a manifesto regarding the manner in which theology should engage other fields of concern and scholarship. The essays are divided into five sections on the nature of theology, the relations between theology and science, the connections between gospel and culture, literary representations of and engagements with transcendence, and the New Testament. Hart responds to influential books, theologians, philosophers, and poets, including Rowan Williams, Jean-Luc Marion, Tomáš Halík, Sergei Bulgakov, Jennifer Newsome Martin, and David Jones, among others. The twenty-six chapters are drawn from live addresses delivered in various settings. Most of the material has never been printed before, and those parts that have appear here in expanded form. Throughout, these essays show how Hart's mind works with the academic veneer of more formal pieces stripped away. The book will appeal to both academic and non-academic readers interested in the place of theology in the modern world.",Religion,535,N/A,0,en
Living Long & Loving It,"Irvin M. Korr, Rene J. McGovern",N/A,2008,"Stereotypes about the elderly are so prevalent that elders themselves often buy into them. People young and old assume that retirement is a time of inactivity, less social involvement, and inevitable physical decline. For over nine decades Dr. Irvin M. Korr was a living refutation of that dreary stereotype. Through a holistic approach to health, based on the principles of osteopathic medicine, he proved that healthy, vigorous, fulfilling old age and long life are the natural culmination of healthy living. In his eighties, Dr. Korr was regularly playing tennis and cross-county skiing, while continuing his career as a medical educator, researcher, author, and lecturer. In this inspiring guide to achieving a healthy lifestyle at any time of life, Dr. Korr explains with enthusiasm and great clarity how any reader can apply scientifically based osteopathic principles to improve quality of life and promote successful aging. Among the principles he stresses is that the human body incorporates its own healing and defensive systems, as well as a health maintenance system. Together they form an indwelling healthcare system that is the ultimate source of health and for which each individual must take primary responsibility. By learning to develop healthy habits, we take care of the ""physician within"" to ensure that our inner physician can then take care of us. Dr. Korr also emphasizes the importance of regular exercise and the beneficial effects that freedom of motion and physical activity bring, not only on our musculoskeletal system but also for our various internal organs, as well as our state of mind. He recommends stretching exercises such as Yoga and whatever workout routine an individual finds enjoyable, from walking to jogging, swimming, and bicycling. Finally, he makes the point that healthy aging is a choice that anyone can make at any time of life by making beneficial lifestyle changes.",Family & Relationships,332,N/A,0,en

When she was nine years old, Kim Russo discovered she had an amazing gift—she could communicate with the dead. Deeply skeptical, she denied her talent for years.

Your Soul's Compass,"Joan Z. Borysenko, Ph.D., Gordon Dveirin, Ed.D.","Hay House, Inc",2008-10-01,"Drawing on spiritual wisdom from sacred texts across a variety of religious traditions, this is an “elegant, simple, and practical guide to get in touch with your higher self” (Deepak Chopra, author of The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success) Why am I here? What does a life worth living look like? What is the higher intelligence trying to express through me? In this time of global change and uncertainty, of spiritual indirection, Americans are asking these age-old questions with renewed curiosity. There’s a thirst for meaning and purpose—a dawning realization that happiness isn’t a commodity that can be bought with a gold card. Fulfillment and joy arise naturally from creative and compassionate action—from the understanding that all life is interconnected and guided by a higher intelligence. Our personal choices make a difference, and when they are spiritually inspired even the smallest action serves a larger whole. Sacred texts ranging from the Torah to the New Testament, the Tao Te Ching to the Buddhist scriptures, the Vedantas to the Koran, speak of making life-enhancing choices where a force greater than the individual flows through us and informs our thoughts and actions. In this book we’ll focus on the three classic aspects of living such a spiritually guided life: (1) alignment: maintaining a direct and personal connection to the Source of our Being; (2) discernment: distinguishing the movement of Spirit in our lives from our own wants, fears and social conditioning; and (3) action: making our best, most inspired contribution to the evolution of life.","Body, Mind & Spirit",290,N/A,0,en

The Undying Soul,MD Stephen J. Iacoboni,N/A,2015-06-30,"Cancer moves more slowly today, thanks to modern science. But science provides scant solace when it fails, slowly, to save our physical forms...and religious faith too often proves fragile during a long mortal watch. For decades, Dr Stephen Iacoboni carried John Donne's words with him in his coat pocket: No man is an island. Every man's death diminishes me. Therefore, do not send to know For whom the bell tolls. It tolls for thee. Donne's sentiment lived in his heart and, over time, began to break it, when the best medicine was not enough. Every patient's death begged questions. I knew there was something missing for them, and for me that until I could offer answers I would never be the healer I hoped to become. The physician did not heal himself. His patients did, at last, after extracting promises that he would bring their revelations to light. It is their stories that guide this voyage of thought and spirit, laughter and love. This book is a primer for people facing life's last and greatest mystery, and for those who travel with them an inspirational alternative to loneliness and fear...and an introduction to what is, simply, The Undying Soul.",Health & Fitness,168,N/A,0,en

Defy Gravity,Caroline Myss,"Hay House, Inc",2011-01-15,"New York Times best-selling author Caroline Myss draws from her years as a medical intuitive to show that healing is not only physical; it is also a mystical phenomenon that transcends reason. Inspired by ordinary people who overcame a wide array of physical and psychological ailments—from rheumatoid arthritis to cancer—Caroline dove into the works of the great mystics to gain a deeper understanding of healing’s spiritual underpinnings. Based on these studies, she demonstrates how conventional and holistic medicine often fall short in times of need. Both systems rely upon a logical approach to curing illness when there is nothing reasonable about the emotional, psychological, or spiritual influences behind any ailment. Integral to this mystical healing approach is the engagement of the soul, which we experience through exploring our seven shadow passions, building an empowered inner self around our seven inherent graces, and learning how to work with the mystical laws that govern it. This knowledge holds the key to understanding what it means to defy gravity and break through the boundaries of ordinary thought. You can heal any illness. You can channel grace. And you can learn to live fearlessly.","Body, Mind & Spirit",251,N/A,0,en
Justification by Faith,Alister E. McGrath,Zondervan Publishing Company,1990,"The author begins by arguing that the contemporary perception of the doctrine of justification by faith as irrelevant is not a failure of the doctrine but rather a failure to communicate it in understandable, modern day times. After an exposition of the biblical foundation of the doctrine and its historical development, McGrath comes to the heart of the matter: the relevance of the doctrine today.

To what degree anyone joins Luke in that faith journey is up to them, but any responsible interpreter must attend considerately to Luke’s theological roadmap.” In this latest addition to the Two Horizons New Testament Commentary series, Spencer integrates close textual analysis of Luke’s unfolding narrative with systematic theology, spiritual forma­tion, philosophical inquiry, and psychological research. With section-by-section commentary, Spencer highlights the overriding salvific message that runs through Luke’s gospel.

War of Shadows,Gershom Gorenberg,PublicAffairs,2021-01-19,"In this World War II military history, Rommel's army is a day from Cairo, a week from Tel Aviv, and the SS is ready for action. Espionage brought the Nazis this far, but espionage can stop them—if Washington wakes up to the danger. As World War II raged in North Africa, General Erwin Rommel was guided by an uncanny sense of his enemies' plans and weaknesses. In the summer of 1942, he led his Axis army swiftly and terrifyingly toward Alexandria, with the goal of overrunning the entire Middle East. Each step was informed by detailed updates on British positions. The Nazis, somehow, had a source for the Allies' greatest secrets. Yet the Axis powers were not the only ones with intelligence. Brilliant Allied cryptographers worked relentlessly at Bletchley Park, breaking down the extraordinarily complex Nazi code Enigma. From decoded German messages, they discovered that the enemy had a wealth of inside information. On the brink of disaster, a fevered and high-stakes search for the source began. War of Shadows is the cinematic story of the race for information in the North African theater of World War II, set against intrigues that spanned the Middle East. Years in the making, this book is a feat of historical research and storytelling, and a rethinking of the popular narrative of the war. It portrays the conflict not as an inevitable clash of heroes and villains but a spiraling series of failures, accidents, and desperate triumphs that decided the fate of the Middle East and quite possibly the outcome of the war.",History,475,N/A,0,en

Beneath all the busy-ness of our daily routines, we know there's more to life. There's something uniquely ours, a purpose that no one else can accomplish. If finding it has been one big, frustrating question mark so far, you've come to the right place. Becoming Your True You isn't your average feel-good, self-help manual with gift inventories and ""to do"" lists. Nor is it about your general identity in Christ; that information is critical to know, but it's not specific enough to drive your destiny forward.

It incorporates a solid biblical foundation with a personality model called the Enneagram to get to the root of your true you - the self God made and can't wait for you to become. You will learn: That you have a personality, but it is not your identity The crucial differences between your soul (psuche) and your spirit (pneuma) Why you can't live out the fullness of your destiny if you're stuck in your personality How your false you affects every aspect of your life, including your relationship with God Strategies and daily practices to help you reclaim your true you Are you ready to embrace your true self, live out your purpose with joy and peace, and give God maximum glory in the process?

Good Vs. Evil . . . Overcoming Degradation Through the Love and Brilliance of God,Jerry Davis,AuthorHouse,2010-12-27,"The truth is we are all just a little bit crazy in some areas of our life to a whole lot of crazy. Being miss-directed is one of the things mankind has in common as the various forms of insanity work the same way in every one of us. Weve all been programmed to unknowingly believe in a host of lies and its our belief in the need to uphold the lies that do us in. There are laws that pertain to the universe. These laws cannot be broken without creating diverse consequences. With every action there is an opposite reaction of effect. And where do the decisions we make come from? They generally come from our minds. The question then becomes, Whos controlling the mind? If your mind is at work and in agreement with you then you would rightly say you are controlling your mind. But if you occasionally find that your mind is working against you then you should consider you are not solely in control. Jesus referred to Satan as, the father of lies. I intend to show how the workings of evil are constructed through the placement of lies and how these lies in combination are at work to disrupt our lives. I will show how the longest and greatest lie is packaged and how the six major steps that makes up a combined package works powerfully against you. Then I will show how the effects from the lies get all mixed in with the pain you experience and how the end results can be devastating. This book is about our need for revelation and offers the reader an opportunity to begin a personal journey with life as it truly is. This is a lifelong journey in Spirit and truth and it begins with your full recognition of the need for having God working continuously in your life.",Philosophy,338,N/A,0,en

Love Vs. Anything That Isn’T,D. Scott Sonnenburg,BalboaPress,2013-02-21,"Love vs. Anything That Isnt is about remembering why we are here. In a world focused on material success and so enamored of distraction, there seems to be little time to foster and maintain a conscious awareness of the higher reasons for life. Drawing a parallel between Love and what is conventionally thought of as God, Love vs. Anything That Isnt seeks to help us remember that the experience of our God-given peace as a way of being is available to all of us at all times. Love vs. Anything That Isnt is about looking at lifes challenges in a different way. Everything happens for a reason; we are here to learn and to grow, and that is all there is to it. Life is a game, but it is a game with a serious purpose: to become closer to the unknowable force we call God via the experience of Love. We are to strive to ascend as high as we can through this simple awareness. Its not that hard; it is within us always. The prize for such awareness is grandthe seemingly ever elusive inner peace. Making life much harder than it needs to be seems to be a ubiquitous human trait. In a society based on fear and the worship of so much that isnt necessary or even real, it is easy to become lost. Love vs. Anything That Isnt serves as a guide and source of inspiration to help bring us back to what is real, the place where true peace and meaningful happiness arise. Love vs. Anything That Isnt maintains that we learn what Love is by experiencing the pain of all it is notpain, suffering, disease, hatred, violence, and war. To come home to the Love we are is to become whole again. To come home to the Love we are is to be healed.","Body, Mind & Spirit",220,N/A,0,en

If so, then this book was written for you. It explains the Real God’s uncorrupted plan for mankind which is totally positive, totally progressive, purposeful, principles-based, Cosmically comprehensive, completely compassionate and harmoniously integrated with no internal inconsistencies! You will find explanations herein that correlate Earth’s physical phenomenon with Cosmic Spiritual laws (quantum physics). Also revealed are Christ’s higher, “Tree of Life” doctrines that supersede the traditional focus, by Christians, Jews and Muslims, on the lower level doctrines of the “Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.” The scriptures of those three religions contain the same Garden of Eden story that cites these two metaphorical trees. Jesus Christ intended to switch mankind’s attention to the “Tree of Life” principles. He also attempted to “teach us how to fish” rather than to “give us a fish.” Tradition says he came to “give us salvation” yet that would literally put mankind in the category of “being on the dole” -- something current, inconsistent “Christians” seem to loathe. Spiritual maturity is the result of our personally practicing the higher, “meat” level principles that Jesus Christ taught and modeled.

How Jesus Became God,Bart D. Ehrman,Harper Collins,2014-03-25,"New York Times bestselling author and Bible expert Bart Ehrman reveals how Jesus’s divinity became dogma in the first few centuries of the early church. The claim at the heart of the Christian faith is that Jesus of Nazareth was, and is, God. But this is not what the original disciples believed during Jesus’s lifetime—and it is not what Jesus claimed about himself. How Jesus Became God tells the story of an idea that shaped Christianity, and of the evolution of a belief that looked very different in the fourth century than it did in the first. A master explainer of Christian history, texts, and traditions, Ehrman reveals how an apocalyptic prophet from the backwaters of rural Galilee crucified for crimes against the state came to be thought of as equal with the one God Almighty, Creator of all things. But how did he move from being a Jewish prophet to being God? In a book that took eight years to research and write, Ehrman sketches Jesus’s transformation from a human prophet to the Son of God exalted to divine status at his resurrection. Only when some of Jesus’s followers had visions of him after his death—alive again—did anyone come to think that he, the prophet from Galilee, had become God. And what they meant by that was not at all what people mean today. Written for secular historians of religion and believers alike, How Jesus Became God will engage anyone interested in the historical developments that led to the affirmation at the heart of Christianity: Jesus was, and is, God.",Religion,297,3,2,en

Death and the Afterlife in the New Testament,Jaime Clark-Soles,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2006-11-15,"Clark-Soles began this project in order to answer the question, ""What exactly does the New Testament say about death and afterlife?"" It turns out that it says both more and less than one might hope or expect. By more, she means that every time the subject of death and what happens after death arises, it is clear that the authors' interests far exceed answering that single question. Their comments emerge from the concerns and experiences of living Christian communities, they relate to a larger theological and pastoral agenda, and their primary focus remains life on earth and the proper living of it. The texts say less than one may hope because no author sets out to answer my question directly. There is no systematic theology in the New Testament regarding death and aftelife. Certainly resurrection appears throughout, though differently emphasized and interpreted. Beyond that, the fascinating aspects of the question are in the details of the texts. Therefore, the appropriate question, as it turns out, is not: What does the New Testament say about death and afterlife, but what do various New Testament texts say about it? Others have sought to unify the New Testament witness, glossing over the individual pictures presented by the New Testament authors. Clark-Soles revels in the snapshots of the individuals and am less interested in the family photo. Clark-Soles inquires into the specific language that each author uses regarding death and afterlife. She explores anthropology, cosmology, eschatology, and, where relevant, theology and Christology. Finally, Clark-Soles suggests ways that the stated views function in each situation.",Religion,272,N/A,0,en

"Anaxagoras, Origen, and Neoplatonism",Panayiotis Tzamalikos,Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG,2016-09-26,"Origen has been always studied as a theologian and too much credit has been given to Eusebius’ implausible hagiography of him. This book explores who Origen really was, by pondering into his philosophical background, which determines his theological exposition implicitly, yet decisively. For this background to come to light, it took a ground-breaking exposition of Anaxagoras’ philosophy and its legacy to Classical and Late Antiquity (Plato, Aristotle, Stoics, Origen, Neoplatonism), assessing critically Aristotle’s distorted representation of Anaxagoras. Origen, formerly a Greek philosopher of note, whom Proclus styled an anti-Platonist, is placed in the history of philosophy for the first time. By drawing on his Anaxagorean background, and being the first to revive the Anaxagorean Theory of Logoi, he paved the way to Nicaea. He was an anti-Platonist because he was an Anaxagorean philosopher with far-reaching influence, also on Neoplatonists such as Porphyry. His theology made an impact not only on the Cappadocians, but also on later Christian authors. His theory of the soul, now expounded in the light of his philosophical background, turns out more orthodox than that of some Christian stars of the Byzantine imperial orthodoxy.",Religion,1814,N/A,0,en

"Good Vs. Evil...Overcoming Degradation Through the Love and Brilliance of God: Book Two: Seeking to Duplicate the Heart, Courage and Genius of the Lord Jesus Christ",Jerry Davis,AuthorHouse,2012-08-10,"Book One may appear to be a little scary to read because it takes you into evil and the destruction of lives. Far too many people wont begin to take a look. What mankind doesnt recognize from afar is that he has been in agreement with many of the lies being perpetuated, through the deceitfulness of evil and his lack a awareness. He managed to get himself in, and now he must fully participate in getting himself out. The good news is Book Two is providing the help necessary to bring you out. Its giving you the map, and the access to understanding that which will help to set yourself free. You will find you cannot do all of it alone. The life of Jesus Christ is being utilized in Book Two as our ultimate leader, teacher, and guide. You will want to understand the heart, courage and genius which was developed Him from living His life in faith. The attributes of Jesus can and should be studied and duplicated. His teachings are aptly quoted to illustrate various results of life; and provide oppositions of thought to counter the mechanics of evil being levied against us through the minds of the self. Jesus gave us His teachings, examples and demonstrations over two thousand years ago. Mankind has made progress since then in maintaining his sanity and integrity, but our progress has not proven, to me, to be enough. Look closely at people and their problems and you will see that far too many people are living with way too much pain and fear. And we all hear stories of good religious people who experience a fall as they become subject to sinning. Yes, we are all sinners but much of the sinning we do is because we do not greatly understand! The mechanics of evil and the thousands of approaches Satan has to engage a man, are often overwhelming! I look at our world today and can see the many compulsions at work in the minds of men in mass, and Im genuinely concerned. Man doesnt begin to understand the size, complexity, and scope of all that he is up against in our world as it is. Weve all heard of Satan, and most of us will acknowledge he is there to damage our life, but generally thats as far as our knowledge of him goes. It is our ignorance of him that make us most vulnerable. When we dont recognize the decisions we make are in league with supporting his working mechanics in pain, then we dont have much of a chance. We need to become enlightened in order to be protective of our souls, which is the basis and design of book number three. Book Two has two agendas which I continue to present throughout. I continue to show the reader the ongoing dilemmas he has to contend with through the cunning and deceit of evil in full cooperation with the six major steps of the longest and greatest lie ever told. Various aspects of the lie are a part of each one of us, and the lies will literally have to be removed. This will take a lot of time and hard work. While you will be steadily at work getting to the truth, I will continue to show the you the things you will need to actively involve yourself in, in order to bring yourself out. There are no easy solutions, and there is little gain to be made without the accommodation of some pain. But the pain will be tolerable and the end will remain as a blessing in your sights! You have the Trinity of God working within you through your deep and deliberate breathing. You have scriptures of truth to be studied at your disposal, and you will have the blessings of your memorized prayer. You have the love, faith and forgiveness of God working within your essence of being. You will be learning to let go and trust in God. The more you learn to love them as the Trinity, the more you will grow in faith. And as Jesus told us, It is from faith, God will make us well.",Biography & Autobiography,405,N/A,0,en

"Just Before I Say ""I Do""",D. E. Rollins,iUniverse,2002,"This collection of frank and sincere Christian poems might be described as a spiritual Bridget Jones diary! The poet expresses her intimate conflicts and concerns as she anticipates the eventual consummation of her marriage. Perhaps one of the main values of the collection is that it conveys a message for many young Christians (and older ones too-not just those preparing for marriage!) that the conflicts they experience are absolutely normal-and can be resolved and sanctified in so far as our dwelling place is not an earthly place but the Lord who is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow. The poet expresses a roller-coaster of emotions as she comes to terms with the age-old conflict of the flesh versus the spirit, the urges of the flesh versus the disciplined life of the Christian, especially as she deals with the anguish where the object of her love is often aloof and inconstant.",Poetry,156,N/A,0,en
Music in the Flesh,Bettina Varwig,University of Chicago Press,2023-07-20,"A corporeal history of music-making in early modern Europe. Music in the Flesh reimagines the lived experiences of music-making subjects—composers, performers, listeners—in the long seventeenth century. There are countless historical testimonies of the powerful effects of music upon the early modern body; it is described as moving, ravishing, painful, dangerous, curative, and miraculous while affecting “the circulation of the humors, the purification of the blood, the dilation of the vessels and pores.” How were these early modern European bodies constituted that music generated such potent bodily-spiritual effects? Bettina Varwig argues that early modern music-making practices challenge our modern understanding of human nature as a mind-body dichotomy. Instead, they persistently affirm a more integrated anthropology, in which body, soul, and spirit remain inextricably entangled. Moving with ease across repertories and regions, sacred and vernacular musics, and domestic and public settings, Varwig sketches a “musical physiology” that is as historically illuminating as it is relevant for present-day performance. This book makes a significant contribution not just to the history of music, but also to the history of the body, the senses, and the emotions, revealing music as a unique access point for reimagining early modern modes of being-in-the-world.",Music,380,N/A,0,en

Prakriti,Robert Svoboda,Lotus Press,1998-06,"Dr. Svoboda's original work on the constitutional types in Ayurveda has been considered a classic for many years. His new revision and expansion of the subject comes after much further research and practical experience. Dr. Vasant Lad points out: ""The healing science of Ayurveda is based totally upon the knowledge of ""prakriti,"" the individual constitution. If every individual knows his own constitution, then one can understand, for instance, what is a good diet and style of life for oneself. One man's food is another man's poison. Therefore, to make one's life healthy, happy and balanced, the knowledge of constitution is absolutely necessary.""",Health & Fitness,329,4,1,en

Social Work Diagnosis in Contemporary Practice,Francis J. Turner,Oxford University Press,2005-02-10,"The unifying theme of this broad-reaching volume is that responsible, ethical, and effective social work practice rests on the diagnostic skills of the practitioner. Social work diagnosis refers to the conscious formulation of an ongoing set of decisions about the client and his or her situation, which serve as the basis for intervention-decisions for which the practitioner must be prepared to take responsibility. Diagnostic skill development is an ongoing process principally enhanced by a continuous commitment to remain at the cutting edge of the profession's body of knowledge, but one of the challenges for today's practitioner is keeping abreast of the rapidly expanding body of knowledge contained in some 200 important social work periodicals in circulation. Francis J. Turner, a preeminent clinical scholar, brings together in one volume some of the best work published since 2000, each reflecting new insights into understanding psychosocial situations and innovative methods of applying knowledge and skills in an increasingly effective manner. Each of the 78 articles in this volume highlights some of the critical dimensions of contemporary social work practice, guiding clinicians to address four key aspects in order to craft an accurate diagnosis. The first section presents articles covering the developmental spectrum, each of which fully explains various ages and stages of development. The second section focuses on a range of specific situations, helping practitioners and students enrich their understanding of different types of problems they meet in contemporary practice, whether they are based in mental illness, psychosocial issues, or physical ailments. The third section addresses the crucial component of diversity, demonstrating the complexity and critical importance of truly understanding clients and their lives. The last section of the book discusses innovative approaches to practice, selected to offer practitioners easy access to the latest interventions for a host of contemporary challenges facing clients and their therapists. Broad in scope and tightly focused on the goal of providing the most up-to-date information necessary for accuracy in the diagnostic process, this volume represents some of the best research available to today's social workers.",Political Science,849,N/A,0,en

A Death on Diamond Mountain,Scott Carney,Penguin,2015-03-17,"An investigative reporter explores an infamous case where an obsessive and unorthodox search for enlightenment went terribly wrong. When thirty-eight-year-old Ian Thorson died from dehydration and dysentery on a remote Arizona mountaintop in 2012, The New York Times reported the story under the headline: ""Mysterious Buddhist Retreat in the Desert Ends in a Grisly Death."" Scott Carney, a journalist and anthropologist who lived in India for six years, was struck by how Thorson’s death echoed other incidents that reflected the little-talked-about connection between intensive meditation and mental instability. Using these tragedies as a springboard, Carney explores how those who go to extremes to achieve divine revelations—and undertake it in illusory ways—can tangle with madness. He also delves into the unorthodox interpretation of Tibetan Buddhism that attracted Thorson and the bizarre teachings of its chief evangelists: Thorson’s wife, Lama Christie McNally, and her previous husband, Geshe Michael Roach, the supreme spiritual leader of Diamond Mountain University, where Thorson died. Carney unravels how the cultlike practices of McNally and Roach and the questionable circumstances surrounding Thorson’s death illuminate a uniquely American tendency to mix and match eastern religious traditions like LEGO pieces in a quest to reach an enlightened, perfected state, no matter the cost. Aided by Thorson’s private papers, along with cutting-edge neurological research that reveals the profound impact of intensive meditation on the brain and stories of miracles and black magic, sexualized rituals, and tantric rites from former Diamond Mountain acolytes, A Death on Diamond Mountain is a gripping work of investigative journalism that reveals how the path to enlightenment can be riddled with danger.",Religion,307,N/A,0,en

Anna and Michael had more things happening in their lives. Anna delved into her metaphysical authorship to discover there were many documents which are still viable in the current times. They continued to provide seminars and compiled a book since they felt it is the end of the line for seminars due to some Life Challenges. One of the challenges was a medical condition Michael had, so they went to Bremerton for Michael's surgery. It took a time to recover. They went to Hawaii for a vacation once Michael was up to it. As time passed, Anna found more spiritual documents. Michael would read them, and they discussed them. Dave Langley, MD, declined and met his demise. A time after, they downsized their motorcoach and went on some trips. Michael did some work for the US Air Force and was on a task force for medical protocols, which was at Bremerton and later on, they went to Washington, DC, for the final steps. Michael had a situation happen when they flew back to Portland as he had to as a medical doctor assistant with a sudden need to be the only medical doctor on the plane, and a few days later, he landed in the hospital with another Life Challenge.

The Dark Womb,Karen O'Donnell,SCM Press,2022-02-28,"The experience of reproductive loss raises a series of profoundly theological questions: how can God have a plan for my life? Why didn’t God answer my prayers? How can I have hope after such an experience? Who am I after such a loss? Sadly, these are questions that, along with reproductive loss, have largely been ignored in theology. Karen O’Donnell tackles these questions head on, drawing on her own experiences of repeated reproductive loss as she re-conceives theology from the perspective of the miscarrying person. Offering a fresh, original, and creative approach to theology, O’Donnell explores the complexity of the miscarrying body and its potential for theological revelation. She offers a re-conception of theologies of providence, prayer, hope, and the body as she reimagines theology out of these messy origins. This book is for those who have experiences such losses and those who minister to them. But it is also for all those who want to encounter a creative and imaginative approach to theology and the life of faith in our messy, complex world.",Religion,131,N/A,0,en

Becoming One With the World,Kathleen Kesson,IAP,2024-08-01,"Becoming One With the World: A Guide to Neohumanist Education responds to an urgent need to reconceptualize the fundamentals of education in light of the many social, ecological, and political challenges facing humanity today. It answers the call for a new educational paradigm, one based on a far richer, more insightful understanding of human possibility, one that decenters human “exceptionalism” in favor of a new ecological consciousness, one that promotes harmony and cooperation between humans and non-human others, and one that cultivates wisdom. Neohumanist education strives for a harmonious balance between spiritual development and critical engagement with the world, in the belief that an awakened conscience translates into transcending differences and creating a sense of unity with all beings. The book is designed to enhance the spiritual and pedagogical knowledge and skill of teachers, parents, and school leaders who are seeking more holistic approaches to educating young people. Both richly theoretical and eminently practical, the book applies the primary commitments of Neohumanist education—cultivating love and kinship with humans and non-human others, freeing the mind from dogma and limitations, fostering a balanced approach between inquiry into the outer, objective world(s) and the inner, subjective world(s), and awakening the desire for social and environmental justice—to the full spectrum of traditional subject matter. It draws upon a wide range of new research and scholarship to illustrate an educational model capable of maximizing human potential and inspiring young people to create a future that is just, joyful, and sustainable. ENDORSEMENTS: ""What a wonderful book! Packed into its pages are decades of experience as a meditator, yogi, parent, educator, and Neohumanist. This latter is the crux of this text, designed to lay out in clear accessible language the fundamentals of this rich and inspiring philosophy and to touch on ways it can find its way into the daily flow of the classroom and school. A philosophy worth its salt is one that actually makes a difference in the day to day lives of people. In Kathleen Kesson and her comprehensive book, we find just this: practical, pragmatic insights into a philosophy both new and ancient! It is a gift to educators and anyone committed to wholesome futures for children, society and of course, the planet."" — Marcus Bussey, University of the Sunshine Coast, Australia ""Becoming One With the World is an extraordinary book. While its primary aims are explaining the philosophy of Neohumanism and detailing a Neohumanistic approach to education, it is simultaneously a comprehensive summary and synthesis of scholarly literature in the field of holistic education. Unifying knowledge and methods from many curricula areas, including spirituality, ecology, aesthetics, literacy, cultural diversity and ethics, it offers a clear orientation to a way of educating young people that seems key to human surviving and thriving."" — Aostre Johnson, Saint Michael’s College in Vermont",Education,448,N/A,0,en

Other Ways of Knowing,John Broomfield,Simon and Schuster,1997-06-01,"A powerful exploration of diverse world views long ignored by the Western world that suggests possible solutions to the environmental and social problems that face us in the next millennium. Our civilization is in crisis. Overpopulation and overconsumption have jeopardized our survival and the great promises of technology have resulted in environmental disaster. This situation, says author John Broomfield, results from the serious error the Western world makes in equating one way of knowing with all ways of knowing--mistaking a thin slice of reality for the whole. Broomfield argues that the necessary wisdom to chart a new course is available to us from many sources: the sacred traditions of our ancestors; the spiritual traditions of other cultures; spirit in nature; feminine ways of being; contemporary movements for personal, social, and ecological transformation; and the very source of our current crisis, science itself. Other Ways of Knowing shows us the wisdom of other cultures who may hold the knowledge necessary to arrest our headlong race toward destruction. From the ancient Polynesian navigational technique of remote viewing to the formative causation theory of Rupert Sheldrake, Other Ways of Knowing examines perceptions and practices that challenge the narrow perspective of the Western world and provide answers to the complex questions that face us as we move into the next millennium.","Body, Mind & Spirit",331,N/A,0,en

You Already Know What to Do,Sharon Franquemont,Tarcher,1999,"""Sharon Franquemont's book is a must-read for people at every stage of intuitive development.""--Carol Adrienne, author of The Celestine Prophecy Workbook and Finding the Purpose of Your LifeWe experience intuition as an instinctive action, a flash of inspiration, a moment when we feel one with the world. Intuition tells us what to do: how to make that difficult decision or achieve a creative breakthrough--and no one has been teaching or writing about the subject longer than Sharon Franquemont.Drawing upon twenty-eight years' experience teaching intuition in college courses, seminars, and private training, through challenging exercises and illuminating narrative, Franquemont explores this great natural resource on a life-changing level. No one but Franquemont shows how intuition can improve collaboration in business and group settings, or teaches couples how to use intuition to deepen relationships.Bestselling books like Laura Day's Practical Intuition have barely begun to tap the power of intuition, and Franquemont's perspective is unique. Intuition is not a ""quick-fix"" tool used to achieve superficial goals, she says. It is rather a way of being: a means by which to harvest a more passionate and powerful life.",Philosophy,372,N/A,0,en

AUDINT-Unsound:Undead,"Steve Goodman, Toby Heys, Eleni Ikoniadou",MIT Press,2019-06-18,"Tracing the the potential of sound, infrasound, and ultrasound to access anomalous zones of transmission between the realms of the living and the dead. For as long as recording and communications technologies have existed, operators have evoked the potential of sound, infrasound, and ultrasound to access anomalous zones of transmission between the realms of the living and the dead. In Unsound:Undead, contributors from a variety of disciplines chart these undead zones, mapping out a nonlinear timeline populated by sonic events stretching from the 8th century BC (the song of the Sirens), to 2013 (acoustic levitation), with a speculative extension into 2057 (the emergence of holographic and holosonic phenomena). For the past seven years the AUDINT group has been researching peripheral sonic perception (unsound) and the ways in which frequencies are utilized to modulate our understanding of presence/non-presence, entertainment/torture, and ultimately life/death. Concurrently, themes of hauntology have inflected the musical zeitgeist, resonating with the notion of a general cultural malaise and a reinvestment in traces of lost futures inhabiting the present. This undead culture has already spawned a Lazarus economy in which Tupac, ODB, and Eazy-E are digitally revivified as laser-lit holograms. The obscure otherworldly dimensions of sound have also been explored in the sonic fictions produced by the likes of Drexciya, Sun Ra, and Underground Resistance, where hauntology is virtually extended: the future appears in the cracks of the present. The contributions to this volume reveal how the sonic nurtures new dimensions in which the real and the imagined (fictional, hyperstitional, speculative) bleed into one another, where actual sonic events collide with spatiotemporal anomalies and time-travelling entities, and where the unsound serves to summon the undead.

"Spirit, Soul, Body",Cyprian Consiglio,Liturgical Press,2015-01-07,"A perennial problem for spiritual traditions of all sorts is dualism—either a positing of a false distance between the Divine and the created or a rejection of creation and the human body. Many contemporary spiritual seekers have sensed this problem and sought to remedy it through myriad solutions drawn from various spiritual traditions and secular wisdom, both Eastern and Western. Cyprian Consiglio, OSB Cam, explores Christianity’s contribution to the discussion. He offers a revisioning and rearticulation of this teaching, based on the prophetic seminal work of Bede Griffiths, toward a practical and integral spirituality that reverences all aspects of our being human—spirit, soul, and body.",Religion,216,N/A,0,en
Extraterrestrial Languages,Daniel Oberhaus,MIT Press,2024-05-07,"If we send a message into space, will extraterrestrial beings receive it? Will they understand? The endlessly fascinating question of whether we are alone in the universe has always been accompanied by another, more complicated one: if there is extraterrestrial life, how would we communicate with it? In this book, Daniel Oberhaus leads readers on a quest for extraterrestrial communication. Exploring Earthlings' various attempts to reach out to non-Earthlings over the centuries, he poses some not entirely answerable questions: If we send a message into space, will extraterrestrial beings receive it? Will they understand? What languages will they (and we) speak? Is there not only a universal grammar (as Noam Chomsky has posited), but also a grammar of the universe? Oberhaus describes, among other things, a late-nineteenth-century idea to communicate with Martians via Morse code and mirrors; the emergence in the twentieth century of SETI (the search for extraterrestrial intelligence), CETI (communication with extraterrestrial intelligence), and finally METI (messaging extraterrestrial intelligence); the one-way space voyage of Ella, an artificial intelligence agent that can play cards, tell fortunes, and recite poetry; and the launching of a theremin concert for aliens. He considers media used in attempts at extraterrestrial communication, from microwave systems to plaques on spacecrafts to formal logic, and discusses attempts to formulate a language for our message, including the Astraglossa and two generations of Lincos (lingua cosmica). The chosen medium for interstellar communication reveals much about the technological sophistication of the civilization that sends it, Oberhaus observes, but even more interesting is the information embedded in the message itself. In Extraterrestrial Languages, he considers how philosophy, linguistics, mathematics, science, and art have informed the design or limited the effectiveness of our interstellar messaging.",Science,265,N/A,0,en
Black Fatigue,Mary-Frances Winters,Berrett-Koehler Publishers,2020-09-15,"This is the first book to define and explore Black fatigue, the intergenerational impact of systemic racism on the physical and psychological health of Black people—and explain why and how society needs to collectively do more to combat its pernicious effects. Black people, young and old, are fatigued, says award-winning diversity and inclusion leader Mary-Frances Winters. It is physically, mentally, and emotionally draining to continue to experience inequities and even atrocities, day after day, when justice is a God-given and legislated right. And it is exhausting to have to constantly explain this to white people, even—and especially—well-meaning white people, who fall prey to white fragility and too often are unwittingly complicit in upholding the very systems they say they want dismantled. This book, designed to illuminate the myriad dire consequences of “living while Black,” came at the urging of Winters's Black friends and colleagues. Winters describes how in every aspect of life—from economics to education, work, criminal justice, and, very importantly, health outcomes—for the most part, the trajectory for Black people is not improving. It is paradoxical that, with all the attention focused over the last fifty years on social justice and diversity and inclusion, little progress has been made in actualizing the vision of an equitable society. Black people are quite literally sickand tired of being sick and tired. Winters writes that “my hope for this book is that it will provide a comprehensive summary of the consequences of Black fatigue, and awaken activism in those who care about equity and justice—those who care that intergenerational fatigue is tearing at the very core of a whole race of people who are simply asking for what they deserve.”",Business & Economics,180,N/A,0,en
The Craving Mind,Judson Brewer,Yale University Press,2017-03-07,"A leading neuroscientist and pioneer in the study of mindfulness explains why addictions are so tenacious and how we can learn to conquer them We are all vulnerable to addiction. Whether it’s a compulsion to constantly check social media, binge eating, smoking, excessive drinking, or any other behaviors, we may find ourselves uncontrollably repeating. Why are bad habits so hard to overcome? Is there a key to conquering the cravings we know are unhealthy for us? This book provides groundbreaking answers to the most important questions about addiction. Dr. Judson Brewer, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist who has studied the science of addictions for twenty years, reveals how we can tap into the very processes that encourage addictive behaviors in order to step out of them. He describes the mechanisms of habit and addiction formation, then explains how the practice of mindfulness can interrupt these habits. Weaving together patient stories, his own experience with mindfulness practice, and current scientific findings from his own lab and others, Dr. Brewer offers a path for moving beyond our cravings, reducing stress, and ultimately living a fuller life.","Body, Mind & Spirit",227,1,1,en
Meditation X,Sean McNamara,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2017-12-31,"Meditation X is the most fun and intriguing type of meditation training a person can learn! If you practice mindfulness, you can learn to move matter with your mind, and this book (accompanied by online training videos) will show you how. Fans of McNamara's first book ""Defy Your Limits"" will be delighted to learn that ""Meditation X"" contains new and advanced telekinesis methods such as moving multiple objects simultaneously, moving objects while standing and moving, moving an object with a partner or group, moving an object from another room, and more. You will learn how to use the principles of mindfulness and meditation to engage a quickly spreading phenomenon: telekinesis. Also known as psychokinesis, it is defined as the movement of an object from a distance through the use of one's mind and subtle energy. While Hollywood portrays exaggerated versions of mind over matter, real telekinesis is less dramatic, yet completely real. ""Meditation X"" is written specifically for people who meditate, who want to learn how to meditate, or who are already a part of contemplative spiritual tradition. Telekinesis offers the most accessible entry to the world of miracles and manifestation. Every spiritual tradition has its own stories of saints, mystics, yogis, healers and other figures who could achieve wondrous feats through the power of their mind. Telekinesis is one of those feats which can be accomplished today by anyone able to apply their mind to the specific instructions provided here. Meditators are best suited to succeed at this task. ""Meditation X"" also discusses the commonalities between telekinesis training and the meditation instructions found in major world traditions. It reviews global spiritual principles such as interconnectedness, non-duality, the power of intention, patience, non-aggression, relaxation, and more, which are actualized during this practice.",,192,N/A,0,en

The Art of Solitude,Stephen Batchelor,Yale University Press,2020-02-18,"In a time of social distancing and isolation, a meditation on the beauty of solitude from renowned Buddhist writer Stephen Batchelor “Whatever a soul is, the author goes a long way toward soothing it. A very welcome instance of philosophy that can help readers live a good life.”—Kirkus Reviews “Elegant and formally ingenious.”—Geoff Wisner, Wall Street Journal When world renowned Buddhist writer Stephen Batchelor turned sixty, he took a sabbatical from his teaching and turned his attention to solitude, a practice integral to the meditative traditions he has long studied and taught. He aimed to venture more deeply into solitude, discovering its full extent and depth. This beautiful literary collage documents his multifaceted explorations. Spending time in remote places, appreciating and making art, practicing meditation and participating in retreats, drinking peyote and ayahuasca, and training himself to keep an open, questioning mind have all contributed to Batchelor’s ability to be simultaneously alone and at ease. Mixed in with his personal narrative are inspiring stories from solitude’s devoted practitioners, from the Buddha to Montaigne, from Vermeer to Agnes Martin. In a hyperconnected world that is at the same time plagued by social isolation, this book shows how to enjoy the inescapable solitude that is at the heart of human life.",Religion,198,N/A,0,en

Self-helpless,Rebecca Davis,Pan Macmillan South africa,2018-09-01,"Everywhere Rebecca Davis looked, the world was in poor shape. And because she’d quit drinking, she no longer had the comfort blanket of alcohol to tamp down her anxiety. How did sober people stay sane? In recent times, the self-help industry has exploded into a multi-billion dollar global industry – and along with it has come every imaginable type of therapy, healing or general woo-woo. In the past, Rebecca scoffed at this industry, mocking its reliance on half-baked science and the way it appears to prey on the mentally fragile. But as she searched for a meaning of life that did not involve booze, she found it increasingly hard to rationalize her default scepticism. This shit really seems to work for some people, she reasoned. And it’s not like I have any particularly solid alternatives. Rebecca lives in Cape Town, the undisputed epicentre of ‘alternative’ paths to peace and enlightenment in South Africa. She decided that over the course of a year, she would embark on a quest for personal wellness, spiritual enlightenment and good old-fashioned happiness. She was willing, within reason, to try anything. She would open herself to even the most outlandish contemporary fads in self-improvement. What followed was a twelve-month immersion in the world of auras, chakras, hallucinogenic drugs, sweat lodges, sangomas, past lives and more. And by the end of it? Maybe she would find some new ways of thinking and living. Or maybe she would emerge with her prejudices untouched. Either way, it would be a good story.",Self-Help,197,N/A,0,en

Integral Ecology,"Sean Esbjorn-Hargens, Ph.D., Michael E. Zimmerman, Ph.D.",Shambhala Publications,2011-03-08,"Today there is a bewildering diversity of views on ecology and the natural environment. With more than two hundred distinct and valuable perspectives on the natural world—and with scientists, economists, ethicists, activists, philosophers, and others often taking completely different stances on the issues—how can we come to agreement to solve our toughest environmental problems? In response to this pressing need, Integral Ecology unites valuable insights from multiple perspectives into a comprehensive theoretical framework—one that can be put to use right now. The framework is based on Integral Theory, as well as Ken Wilber’s AQAL model, and is the result of over a decade of research exploring the myriad perspectives on ecology available to us today and their respective methodologies. Dozens of real-life applications and examples of this framework currently in use are examined, including three in-depth case studies: work with marine fisheries in Hawai’i, strategies of eco-activists to protect Canada’s Great Bear Rainforest, and a study of community development in El Salvador. In addition, eighteen personal practices of transformation are provided for you to increase your own integral ecological awareness. Integral Ecology provides the most sophisticated application and extension of Integral Theory available today, and as such it serves as a template for any truly integral effort.",Nature,835,5,1,en

Gateway to The Heavens,Karen L. French,Watkins Media Limited,2014-05-20,"Simple geometric shapes and symbols combine to make the universal, powerful, sacred model Karen French calls Gateway to the Heavens. In this book, French explains the meaning and purpose of these shapes, how they mold our reality and perception of it and how they have a direct bearing on what you are and why you are here. These shapes and symbols contain messages that have been consistently represented in religion, philosophy, mythology, mysticism, the arts and sciences. Their messages are built into our genetic make-up and we recogniZe them instinctively. The book is divided up into 3 parts. Part 1 covers the properties of the basic geometric shapes and numbers. Part 2 describes how these, in turn, form layers of construction, creating principals that are fundamental to the purpose of the universe; the spiral sustains reality, the cross highlighting the central point of existence and the heart is where we weigh up our choices. Part 3 describes how we can use these principals to create positive change in our lives by helping us to expand our awareness of reality.","Body, Mind & Spirit",225,5,1,en

Traces of God,Neil Gillman,Jewish Lights Publishing,2006,"A Probing and Powerful Look at the Role You Play in Shaping Your Relationship with God No matter how hard we look, the God of Israel cannot be seen. Looking is not seeing, and seeing God is not like seeing an apple. It is much more like making a medical diagnosis on the basis of looking at a complex set of symptoms. Each of the symptoms is a dot. We can look at the dots and still miss the pattern. from Part I The Torah is replete with references to hearing God but precious few references to seeing God. Seeing is complicated. What we look for and see are traces of God s presence in the world and in history, but not God. In order to identify those traces as reflections of divine presence, we need to re-examine how we see, what we see, and how we interpret that information. In this challenging and inspiring look at the dynamics of the religious experience, award-winning author and theologian Neil Gillman guides you into a new way of seeing the complex patterns in the Bible, history, and everyday experiences and helps you interpret what those patterns mean to you and your relationship with God. Examining faith and doubt, revelation and law, suffering and redemption, Gillman candidly deconstructs familiar biblical moments in order to help you develop and refine your own spiritual vision, so that you are able to discern the presence of God in unanticipated ways.""",Religion,242,N/A,0,en

The techniques used by Taoists are some five thousand years old and, until very recently, were closely guarded secrets passed on from a Master to a small group of students. Often, too, each Master knew only a small part. Now Master Chia has pieced together the entire system of Chi Massage in a logical sequence in such a way that once you have it shown to you, you need only five or ten minutes of practice daily.

Classical Chinese Medicine,Liu Lihong,The Chinese University of Hong Kong Press,2019-04-19,"The English edition of Liu Lihong’s milestone work is a sublime beacon for the profession of Chinese medicine in the 21st century. Classical Chinese Medicine delivers a straightforward critique of the politically motivated “integration” of traditional Chinese wisdom with Western science during the last sixty years, and represents an ardent appeal for the recognition of Chinese medicine as a science in its own right. Professor Liu’s candid presentation has made this book a bestseller in China, treasured not only by medical students and doctors, but by vast numbers of non-professionals who long for a state of health and well-being that is founded in a deeper sense of cultural identity. Oriental medicine education has made great strides in the West since the 1970s, but clear guidelines regarding the “traditional” nature of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remain undefined. Classical Chinese Medicine not only delineates the educational and clinical problems faced by the profession in both East and West, but transmits concrete and inspiring guidance on how to effectively engage with ancient texts and designs in the postmodern age. Using the example of the Shanghanlun (Treatise on Cold Damage), one of the most important Chinese medicine classics, Liu Lihong develops a compelling roadmap for holistic medical thinking that links the human body to nature and the universe at large.",Medical,697,N/A,0,en

From Hilbert to Dilbert,"Victor Christianto , Florentin Smarandache",Infinite Study,2019,"This book took an unconventional theme because we submit an unorthodox theme too. Karl Popper’s epistemology suggests that when the theory is refuted by observation, then it is time to look for a set of new approaches. In the first chapter, it is shown that Hilbert’s axiomatic program has failed not only by experiment (Mie theory does not agree with experiment) but also in terms of logic (Gödel theorem). Therefore we set out a new approach, starting from an old theory of Isaac Newton. Dilbert cartoon series often offer surprising for old problems, especially in this era of corporatocracy. Now we would call such an out-of-the-box solution to the old Hilbert axiomatic program as Dilbert way (or Dilbertian, if you wish). Readers may ask : but what can physicists learn from Dilbert cartoons? While it seems not obvious at first glance, yes we believe there is a great character of Dilbert cartoon, i.e. to put it in one phrase: “out-of-thebox and brutally honest.” From managers who tend to criticize other folks, only to make him/her looks smart. Or people who often send “FYI emails” only to make him/her looks managing well. We do think that such a brutal honesty is also needed in many fields of physics: from theoretical physics to applied physics, as will be discussed throughout this book.",Science,208,N/A,0,en

Queering Mesoamerican Diasporas,Susy J. Zepeda,University of Illinois Press,2022-08-09,"Acts of remembering offer a path to decolonization for Indigenous peoples forcibly dislocated from their culture, knowledge, and land. Susy J. Zepeda highlights the often overlooked yet intertwined legacies of Chicana feminisms and queer decolonial theory through the work of select queer Indígena cultural producers and thinkers. By tracing the ancestries and silences of gender-nonconforming people of color, she addresses colonial forms of epistemic violence and methods of transformation, in particular spirit research. Zepeda also uses archival materials, raised ceremonial altars, and analysis of decolonial artwork in conjunction with oral histories to explore the matriarchal roots of Chicana/x and Latina/x feminisms. As she shows, these feminisms are forms of knowledge that people can remember through Indigenous-centered visual narratives, cultural wisdom, and spirit practices. A fascinating exploration of hidden Indígena histories and silences, Queering Mesoamerican Diasporas blends scholarship with spirit practices to reimagine the root work, dis/connection to land, and the political decolonization of Xicana/x peoples.",Social Science,302,N/A,0,en

Foundations of Morphodynamics in Osteopathy,"Torsten Liem, Patrick van den Heede",Jessica Kingsley Publishers,2017-03-01,"In 35 chapters written by the editors and a team of internationally renowned contributors, the book covers the underlying principles of osteopathic palpation from a biodynamic and 'morphodynamic' perspective, and their application in the cranial field and the spinal cord. It emphasises the importance of considering not just the patient's physical self, but also the inner consciousness. It teaches how to assess tissue-energy characteristics, and to use this understanding in managing the whole patient. The work discusses biophysical, neurobiological and psychological interactions as well as the interplay of developmental dynamics and further epigenetic influences on the organism. As well as the primary respiratory mechanism, various biological rhythms play an important role within osteopathic treatment; the book explores new insights that flow from chronobiology and rhythm research. All osteopathic practice develops on conceptual foundations. Acknowledging the importance in the practice of osteopathy of such theoretical underpinning, the book discusses osteopathy with regard to the development of paradigms within the healing arts as well as from various philosophical viewpoints - such as postmodern, system-theoretical, Goethian and phenomenological. It examines thoroughly the multi-layered dynamics of development of human beings interacting with their environment. The resulting implications for therapeutic interaction as well as principles of diagnosis and treatment form the core of the book. These fundamental principles are then specifically applied to the cranial sphere. This section focuses primarily on the treatment of the brain, as well as the developmental dynamics of the relations of the midline, cranial bones, dural structures, vessels and cranial nerves.",Medical,720,N/A,0,en

Integrative Geriatric Medicine,Mikhail Kogan,Oxford University Press,2017-11-24,"Integrative geriatrics is a new field of medicine that advocates for a whole-person, patient-centered, primarily non-pharmacological approach to medical care of the elderly. Most current geriatric practices overprescribe medications and procedures and underutilize non-pharmacological, low-cost, high-touch methods. Patients, however, often show reluctance towards these standard practices, as the interventions they rely upon are often invasive. The practice of integrative geriatrics is rooted in lifestyle interventions, such as nutrition, movement therapies, and mind-body and spirituality approaches, that allow patients to have different path to their healthcare-one that utilizes pharmaceuticals and invasive procedures only when safer integrative approaches are not available or not effective. This first definitive textbook of this new field presents detailed, evidence-based information for all healthcare providers and advocates who work with geriatric population. It is intended not only for providers in outpatient settings, but also to those who work in nursing homes, assisted and independent living facilities, and senior community centers. In addition, Integrative Geriatric Medicine will provide valuable information for leaders and politicians who are involved with implementing policies and procedures for care of elderly patients looking for safer, less costly, and more patient-centered approaches.",Medical,681,N/A,0,en

I come with a story that not only reveals my intense love for a man that I would never have, but also the depth of my devotion to my most wonderful husband and two beautiful children. I watched my marriage fall apart around me as I reached out to someone who was not there. I tried hopelessly to pick up the pieces of my broken marriage. The pieces did not seem to fit together, while still others were missing. Due to these conflicts, I experienced feelings of deep despair and then terror, as I sank into a dark depression and developed panic disorder. I knew I had to rise above all this or fall prey to this most unhealthy set of circumstances.

I ultimately reach a wonderful place, a spiritual loving place, making of myself a strong Spirit-filled vessel for my husband and my children to connect with.

Queer Intentions,Amelia Abraham,Pan Macmillan,2019-05-30,"This immersive, accessible and thought-provoking book takes the reader on a journey to explore the pros and cons, the myths and realities of life for LGBTQ+ people today. Shortlisted for the Polari First Book Prize 2020 ‘Eloquent, empathetic and passionate, this book will not just resonate with a new generation of queer people, but with all those who seek to be their allies. A brilliant book.’ - Owen Jones, author of The Establishment Today, the options and freedoms on offer to LGBTQ+ people living in the West are greater than ever before. But is same-sex marriage, improved media visibility and corporate endorsement all it’s cracked up to be? At what cost does this acceptance come? And who is getting left behind, particularly in parts of the world where LGBTQ+ rights aren’t so advanced? Combining intrepid journalism with her own personal experience, in Queer Intentions, Amelia Abraham searches for the answers to these urgent challenges, as well as the broader question of what it means to be queer right now.

Quixotic Modernists,Louise Ciallella,Bucknell University Press,2007,"Quixotic Modernists gives close readings of two novels by two little-studied writers of the early twentieth century in Spain, Felipe Trigo's Las ingenuas (1901) and Maria Martinez Sierra's Tu eres la paz (1906), in relation to the canonical Tristana by Benito Perez Galdos, Spain's greatest nineteenth-century novelist. This study shows the modern message (regarding gender), and modernist qualities of the prose of these works. Included are discussions of Quijote intertexts, proverbial language and tactics, the angel and the mujer-nina, flower, water, and animal imagery, and visual arts in relation to gender definition. Also included are contemporary responses to the novels and material about the authors' lives and Spain's social conditions in the early twentieth century. Quixotic Modernists integrates these themes into a study of the novelization of difficulties in transforming contemporary gender and class roles. In all three authors' works, this process of change in roles for both men and women becomes a quixotic enterprise, in which artists as/and characters search to reconnect with an elusive material, social body.",Literary Criticism,316,N/A,0,en

This book will help transform your way of thinking and give you tools to change your life and even your eternity. It will help you cope with stress and others and change the world around you. Despite health care professionals' constant efforts to educate, entice, advise, convince, indoctrinate, and persuade patients with smooth talk, bribes, guilt, and manipulation to make people understand and follow medical advice, the results are often minimal. People continue to suffer from various diseases and chronic conditions. Many still die prematurely from high levels of stress caused by fear, worry, anxiety, and depression. Even with so much knowledge, the gaps in the way people manage stressors in their daily lives needs to be addressed. In Find Your Peace, Dr. Rodica Malos tackles this universal topic head-on. Brimming with medical research, basic brain chemistry, and scriptural wisdom, this powerful, encouraging book reveals how the divine design of the human body functions most perfectly when a person's thought life aligns with God's instructions (prescriptions beyond science).

The X-Manual,Peter J. Bellini,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2022-04-07,"The title of the book, The X-Manual, is taken from the word exousia, from the subtitle. It is the Greek word for authority. The word is used throughout the New Testament. For our purposes, it is used to express the divine authority or right to cast out demons—“I have given you authority [exousia] to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you” (Luke 10:19 NIV). Jesus gives believers authority to cast out demons. This book is about spiritual authority over evil. The X-Manual is a practical “how to” handbook for clergy and laity on deliverance and exorcism. One reason I wrote the book is because so few understand and/or operate effectively in deliverance ministry. Nowhere is the church more inadequate or excessive than in deliverance ministry. The X-Manual contains specific time-tested biblical instructions on selecting and training a deliverance team, pre-deliverance work, the deliverance session, post-deliverance work, and other useful tools like the C1-13 instrument that helps determine if one needs deliverance. Deliverance is essential to the church’s New Testament healing and evangelism ministry.

Encouragement from the Psalms,Dr. B,WestBow Press,2023-03-03,"As James Brandon read and studied the Psalms over the years, he came to realize that the Lord was talking to our souls through these ancient songs. He was also struck by a book written in the 1800s by a man named Hawker, who after reading one of the Psalms would exclaim: “Oh my soul, what is this that thou hast found in the Holy Writ?” He would talk to his soul after reading the text. The author began to read the Psalms and reflect on what each one said to his soul. He has done that for fifty years. In this book, he focuses on Psalms forty-two to seventy-two: the Exodus Book of the Psalms, which encompasses restoration and redemption from bondage. They are songs that teach salvation, the doctrines of the faith, and how to take care of your soul. The Psalms are a wonderland of devotion. They have enlightened the author’s mind and encouraged his spirit. They can do the same for you—all while providing principles for living this life as you help others walk with the Lord.",Religion,745,N/A,0,en

Tending to the Holy,"Bruce G. Epperly, Katherine Gould Epperly",Rowman & Littlefield,2009-10-02,"Tending to the Holy: The Practice of the Presence of God in Ministry invites pastors to embody their deepest beliefs in the routine and surprising tasks of ministry. Inspired by Brother Lawrence's classic text in spirituality, Tending to the Holy integrates the wisdom and practices of the Christian spiritual tradition with the commonplace practices of pastoral ministry. Bruce and Katherine Epperly utilize a variety of spiritual disciplines especially Benedictine, Celtic, Ignatian, Rhineland, and process spiritualities to provide a framework for helping clergy nurture the awareness of God, creative imagination, and personal well-being in every aspect of their ministerial lives. Practicing God's presence in the ordinary tasks of ministry inspires wholeness, spiritual transformation, vision, imagination, endurance, and healthy self-differentiation in ministry. Commitment to joining spiritual practices with the routine and repetitive tasks of ministry provides an important antidote to unhealthy stress, burnout, and loss of vision in ministry. By seeing their congregational leadership in terms of spiritual transformation, imaginative practice, and relational interdependence, ordinary ministerial practices can become ways pastors can deepen their relationship with God. Growing out of their work with pastors at every season of ministry, as well as combined ministerial experience of nearly sixty years, Bruce and Katherine Epperly invite pastoral leaders to complement and expand on their understanding of spiritual leadership, pastoral excellence, and self-care, integrating traditional and contemporary spiritual practices with the concrete arts of ministry.",Religion,209,N/A,0,en

When evangelical Christians engage in fitness and dieting classes in order to “glorify God,” they often face skepticism. This book approaches devotional fitness culture in North America from a religious studies perspective, outlining the basic structures, ideas, and practices of the field. Starting with the historical backgrounds of this current, the book approaches both practice and ideology, highlighting how devotional fitness programs construe their identity in the face of various competing offers in religious and non-religious sectors of society. The book suggests a nuanced and complex understanding of the relationship between sports and religion, beyond ‘simple’ functional equivalency. It provides insights into the formation of secular and religious body ideals and the way these body ideals are sacralized in the frame of an evangelical worldview.",Social Science,277,N/A,0,en

Pharmaceuticals to Nutraceuticals,"Dilip Ghosh, R. B. Smarta",CRC Press,2016-10-26,"Recently, there has been a fundamental shift in the global health and wellness industry from disease treatment to preventing chronic diseases. The use of nutraceuticals and functional foods in prevention efforts could lead to a decreased dependency on drugs. The pharmaceutical industry recognizes this shift; however, serious concerns have arisen regarding the claimed efficacy, quality, and safety of products used as medical foods. This book examines the consumer and industry mindshift, including the scientific evidence of these foods as effective adjuncts to pharmacotherapy during all stages of treatment of various diseases, thus indicating that pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals can and should coexist. It details quality, safety, and efficacy of foods, drugs, and nutrients; marketing and product positioning; regulatory perspectives; biomarkers and metabolites; probiotics; food/drug interactions; and future industry trends. In addition, food bioactives represent diet-based molecules that perform physiological roles related to disease prevention and treatment. As such, a considerable overlap exists between food bioactives and drugs—this book presents the case for comparing and contrasting foods versus drugs in several models of health and disease.",Medical,209,N/A,0,en

The book provides educators, pre-service teachers, and students an in-depth understanding of aesthetic literacies in innovative spaces, including in philosophical literature, environmental spaces, curricula and classrooms. Using various theoretical frames from both the arts and literacy fields, this book shares relevant pedagogies, theorisations and contexts where aesthetic literacies are at the core of learning.

Perfect Health--Revised and Updated,"Deepak Chopra, M.D.",Harmony,2001-02-20,"NATIONAL BESTSELLER • The classic guide to using Ayurveda to harness the healing power of the mind—now revised with updated medical research. Translated as “the knowledge of life span” in Sanskrit, Ayurveda is the 5,000-year-old medical system from ancient India that has been validated by modern breakthroughs in physics and medicine. Deepak Chopra’s Perfect Health is the original guide to applying the ancient wisdom of Ayurveda to everyday life. Although we experience our bodies as solid, they are in fact more like fires that are constantly being consumed and renewed. We grow new stomach linings every five days, for instance. Our skin is new every five weeks. Each year, fully 98 percent of the total number of atoms in our bodies is replaced. Ayurveda gives us the tools to intervene at this quantum level, where we are being created anew each day. Ayurveda tells us that freedom from sickness depends on contacting our own awareness, bringing it into balance, and then extending that balance to the body. Perfect Health provides a complete step-by-step program of mind body medicine tailored to individual needs. A quiz identifies the reader's mind body type: thin, restless Vata; enterprising, efficient Pitta; tranquil, steady Kapha; or any combination of these three. This body type becomes the basis for a specific Ayurvedic program of diet, stress reduction, neuromuscular integration, exercise, and daily routines. The result is a total plan, tailor-made for each individual, to reestablish the body's essential balance with nature; to strengthen the mind body connection; and to use the power of quantum healing to transcend the ordinary limitations of disease and aging—in short, for achieving Perfect Health.","Body, Mind & Spirit",402,N/A,0,en

In this culmination of his life’s work, Peter A. Levine draws on his broad experience as a clinician, a student of comparative brain research, a stress scientist and a keen observer of the naturalistic animal world to explain the nature and transformation of trauma in the body, brain and psyche. In an Unspoken Voice is based on the idea that trauma is neither a disease nor a disorder, but rather an injury caused by fright, helplessness and loss that can be healed by engaging our innate capacity to self-regulate high states of arousal and intense emotions. Enriched with a coherent theoretical framework and compelling case examples, the book elegantly blends the latest findings in biology, neuroscience and body-oriented psychotherapy to show that when we bring together animal instinct and reason, we can become more whole human beings.",Self-Help,403,N/A,0,en

The YMCA at War,"Jeffrey C. Copeland, Yan Xu",Lexington Books,2018-03-24,"The Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) is best known for its athletic and youth programs, a heritage that draws on its origins in 1844 to provide wholesome recreation to urban youth away from the moral decay of industrialized urban living. Before long, that uplift mission found a place in the American Civil War, and soon the Y had spread all over the world by the early twentieth century, and in every major war thereafter as well. The YMCA at War: Collaboration and Conflict during the World Wars is the first collection of scholarship to examine the YMCA’s efforts during the World Wars of the twentieth century, which proved to be a bastion of support to soldiers and civilians around the world. The YMCA deployed hundreds of thousands of its much-vaunted secretaries to support suffering civilians and ease soldiers’ wartime hardships. Joining forces with governments, other civic organizations, and individuals, the Y could be either an indispensable auxiliary or an arms-length nuisance. In all cases, its support had a significant byproduct: for every person it befriended, the Y invariably made an enemy with an opposing party, its patrons, its sponsor, or at times, all three. The YMCA at War offers fresh, timely research in an international and comparative perspective from scholars around the world that evaluates this conflict and collaboration during the World Wars.",History,260,N/A,0,en

Holy Anorexia,Rudolph M. Bell,University of Chicago Press,2014-05-09,"“A brilliant, disturbing study of anorexic behavior amongst medieval Italian female saints . . . original, controversial, superbly executed.” —Kirkus Reviews Is there a resemblance between the contemporary anorexic teenager counting every calorie in her single-minded pursuit of thinness, and an ascetic medieval saint examining her every desire? Rudolph M. Bell suggests that the answer is yes. “Everyone interested in anorexia nervosa . . . should skim this book or study it. It will make you realize how dependent upon culture the definition of disease is. I will never look at an anorexic patient in the same way again.” —Howard Spiro, M.D., Gastroenterology “[This] book is a first-class social history and is well-documented both in its historical and scientific portions.” —Vern L. Bullough, American Historical Review “A significant contribution to revisionist history, which re-examines events in light of feminist thought . . . Bell is particularly skillful in describing behavior within its time and culture, which would be bizarre by today’s norms, without reducing it to the pathological.” —Mary Lassance Parthun, Toronto Globe and Mail “Bell is both enlightened and convincing.

The Palgrave Handbook of Queer and Trans Feminisms in Contemporary Performance,"Tiina Rosenberg, Sandra D'Urso, Anna Renée Winget",Springer Nature,2021-09-21,"The purpose of this Handbook is to provide students with an overview of key developments in queer and trans feminist theories and their significance to the field of contemporary performance studies. It presents new insights highlighting the ways in which rigid or punishing notions of gender, sexuality and race continue to flourish in systems of knowledge, faith and power which are relevant to a new generation of queer and trans feminist performers today. The guiding question for the Handbook is: How do queer and trans feminist theories enhance our understanding of developments in feminist performance today, and will this discussion give rise to new ways of theorizing contemporary performance? As such, the volume will survey a new generation of performers and theorists, as well as senior scholars, who engage and redefine the limits of performance. The chapters will demonstrate how intersectional, queer and trans feminist theoretical tools support new analyses of performance with a global focus. The primary audience will be students of theatre/ performance studies as well as queer /gender studies. The volume’s contents suggest close links between the formation of queer feminist identities alongside recent key political developments with transnational resonances. Furthermore, the emergence of new queer and trans feminist epistemologies prompts a reorientation regarding performance and identities in a 21st-century context.",Performing Arts,543,N/A,0,en

A Course in Mastering Alchemy,"Jim Self, Roxane Burnett",Watkins,2018-02-15,"What is alchemy? Alchemy means altering the frequencies of thought to allow us to change ourselves, change how we perceive and interact with the world and begin to experience a new sort of consciousness. Unlike any other programme, Mastering Alchemy doesn't seek to change readers' perceptions merely by speaking to their minds but instead offers a series of deeply felt experiences, each one building on the preceding one to transform a participant from the inside out, giving them a new, happy and optimistic platform for experiencing the world. This book is so much more than words on the page: energetics are embedded into each lesson and readers will be able to feel the Teachers' presence and wisdom as they read the text. This is a Course in Miracles for the 21st century, reaching far beyond that earlier programme by incorporating the significant leap in human consciousness that has been occurring since the 1980s, and also the active participation of the Teachers of Light. This unique book offers readers a set of energy tools of unparalleled power and a new way of life as revealed by the Teachers of Light, whose guidance has been channelled by Jim Self and Roxane Burnet of the hugely popular online Mastering Alchemy course. While giving free access to a wealth of normally paid-for content (including videos on the meditations and exercises and even recordings of the Teachers of Light themselves), this book stands alone as a self-contained programme offering step-by-step techniques for changing our way of being and opening up our higher consciousness.","Body, Mind & Spirit",449,5,1,en

"The ""God"" Part of the Brain",Matthew Alper,"Sourcebooks, Inc.",2008-09-01,"A thought-provoking study of science and religion about our human need to believe in a higher power, for spiritual seekers and atheists alike. In The God Part of the Brain, Matthew Alper pioneers a radical theory: the human inclination toward spirituality and belief in a higher power can be attributed to a specific part of our brain. This bold hypothesis takes us on an exciting journey that merges science, philosophy, and spirituality in a unique way. Alper engages readers with compelling arguments based on neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and anthropology, provoking profound thought on the nature of existence and our inherent need for spiritual meaning as a coping mechanism that emerged in humans to help us survive our unique and otherwise debilitating awareness of death. His narrative is accessible yet deeply profound, providing insights that stimulate both intellectual curiosity and spiritual introspection. Key Features: Groundbreaking Hypothesis: Presents a bold new theory about the neuroscientific basis of human spirituality. Interdisciplinary Approach: Combines insights from neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and anthropology to explore spiritual experiences. Intellectually Stimulating: Challenges readers to contemplate profound questions about existence, faith, and the human mind. Accessible Narrative: Engages readers with a narrative that is both informative and accessible, regardless of their scientific background. Provocative and Thoughtful: Invites deep introspection about our inherent need for spiritual meaning. Praise for The ""God"" Part of the Brain ""This cult classic in many ways parallels Rene Descartes' search for reliable and certain knowledge...Drawing on such disciplines as philosophy, psychology, and biology, Alper argues that belief in a spiritual realm is an evolutionary coping method that developed to help humankind deal with the fear of death...Highly recommended.""— Library Journal ""I very much enjoyed the account of your spiritual journey and believe it would make excellent reading for every college student - the resultant residence-hall debates would be the best part of their education. It often occurs to me that if, against all odds, there is a judgmental God and heaven, it will come to pass that when the pearly gates open, those who had the valor to think for themselves will be escorted to the head of the line, garlanded, and given their own personal audience."" — Edward O. Wilson, two-time Pulitzer Prize-Winner ""This is an essential book for those in search of a scientific understanding of man's spiritual nature. Matthew Alper navigates the reader through a labyrinth of intriguing questions and then offers undoubtedly clear answers that lead to a better understanding of our objective reality."" — Elena Rusyn, MD, PhD; Gray Laboratory; Harvard Medical School ""What a wonderful book you have written. It was not only brilliant and provocative but also revolutionary in its approach to spirituality as an inherited trait.""— Arnold Sadwin, MD, former chief of Neuropsychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania ""A lively manifesto...For the discipline's specific application to the matter at hand, I've seen nothing that matches the fury of The 'God' Part of the Brain, which perhaps explains why it's earned something of a cult following."" — Salon.com ""All 6 billion plus inhabitants of Earth should be in possession of this book. Alper's tome should be placed in the sacred writings' section of libraries, bookstores, and dwellings throughout the world. Matthew Alper is the new Galileo...Immensely important...Defines in a clear and concise manner what each of us already knew but were afraid to admit and exclaim.""— John Scoggins, PhD ""Vibrant ... vivacious. An entertaining and provocative introduction to speculations concerning the neural basis of spirituality.""— Free Inquiry Magazine",Science,290,3,1,en

When he was in Africa writing about the legendary singer Miriam Makeba, she perceived he had the rare gift to see both into the future and into people's souls. At her urging, Hall consulted a sangoma, a traditional healer, who told him he was possessed by ancestral spirits. Hall could receive the power to heal others and to become a sangoma himself ... if he was willing to take the risk. He did - embracing an uncertain future and undergoing a two-year spiritual and physical ordeal. What he experienced shook his grasp of reality to the core as he surrendered himself to souls from the spirit world, learned to read messages in divination bones and attained a lifetime's worth of knowledge about collecting and preparing the plants used in traditional medicine.

In this hands-on guide to working with the sacred energies of the sun, night sun, and moon, curandera Erika Buenaflor details the rites, rituals, and deities for each part of the day and night and explores the sacred tools and techniques used by ancient Mesoamerican shamans for harnessing solar and lunar energies. She explains how the sun is the source of soul energy that heals, animates, strengthens, and revitalizes us on many levels, while night energies are transformative and conducive for connecting with nonordinary realms. She explores rituals for dawn, sunrise, and midmorning to harness the energies of creation and new beginnings; for noon and afternoon to promote peak strength and spiritual wisdom; for sunset and dusk to bring about transformation, perform divination, and journey with animal spirit guides; and for midnight and predawn to facilitate shamanic dreamwork, connect with the ancestors, make offerings, and regenerate at the deepest levels. She also explores how nighttime energies are affected by the phases of the moon and offers specific practices for each phase. By intentionally tuning our activities to the rhythms of the sun and moon, we can invite in their sacred energies of abundance and healing for more healthy, creative, mindful, and happy lives.","Body, Mind & Spirit",193,N/A,0,en

The MindBody Self,"Mario Martinez, Dr.","Hay House, Inc",2019-07-09,"In these turbulent times, just about every solution you can think of has been put forth by someone, somewhere, as a way to calm the waters and live with more happiness and ease. But the fact is you cannot think your way to a better life. Change isn’t something your mind can accomplish alone. It calls for mind and body to work together in a deeper unity than you may ever have imagined.Neuropsychologist Mario Martinez is a pioneer in the science of the mindbody—his term for that essential oneness of cognition and biology—and a passionate advocate for its power to reshape our lives, if we work with it consciously. In The MindBody Self, he builds on the foundation he laid in the critically acclaimed MindBody Code to explore the cultural conditions that coauthor our reality and shape every aspect of our lives, from health and longevity to relationships and self-esteem. Then he offers practical tools we can use to shed outworn patterns and create sustainable change.You’ll read about: •How our cultural beliefs affect the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of disease •The difference between growing older (which we all do) and ""aging"" by our culture’s standards (which we can learn not to do) •What happens when we move ""beyond the pale"" of our tribe’s expectations •How to navigate adversity using uncertainty as a guide •Biocognitive tools for a healthy lifeThe MindBody Self presents groundbreaking ideas derived from rigorous scholarship—but you don’t need a background in science to use what you find here. Each chapter concludes with exercises and experiential processes that make complex scientific discoveries not only accessible, but applicable. The result is a paradigm shift in which the myths of doom are shattered by the science of hope, survival takes a back seat to meaning, and fear gives way to love.",Health & Fitness,321,N/A,0,en

Fire in the Soul,Joan Borysenko,N/A,2014-07-02,"Gifted healer Joan Borysenko believes that the wounds we suffer - and heal from - can be gateways to a transformation of the spirit, one that not only nourishes our souls but blesses us with the potential to help our world. In this enlightening book, Dr. Borysenko goes beyond psychology as currently practiced and taps a deeper vein of healing. She reveals to us the power of spiritual optimism, a philosophy that views life crises as opportunities for personal growth and spiritual homecoming. Drawing on her own experiences with tragedy and illness, as well as on anecdotes from her therapy patients, the author combines scientific knowledge with wisdom and insight to show how the most devastating events can initiate a fruitful search for meaning; how wrestling with the demons of pain, strife, and illness can lead us to discover our wholeness; and how meditation, prayer, and heightened awareness can serve as shining beacons during the proverbial ""dark night of the soul."" These are the times when the soul is on fire, fueled by torment and despair. Yet this same soul burns with an inner flame that can consume old beliefs and negative opinions, allowing a new soul to be born. Thus our darkest moments can lead to spiritual resurrection, bringing us closer to our true hearts...and to the heart of healing. Getting there, however, is never easy. ""Dark nights of the soul"" are perilous emotional voyages through stormy seas of suffering. Here the terrain is shadowy and home seems far, far away; here, most of us need a light to navigate by. ""Fire in the Soul"" is that light, an inspiring and knowing guide to spiritual safe haven in times of loss and pain. Its insight will help you shed self-blame, heal childhood wounds, and gain strength from adversity so that you can find the goodness that is everywhere and feel the love that lights our universe. This book also features a practical resource section listing books, tapes, and addresses of helpful individuals and organizations.

Human Development and Faith (Second Edition),Felicity B. Kelcourse,Chalice Press,2015-07-28,"This book, now in its second edition, brings together the best available understandings of human development from a multidisciplinary perspective. Uniquely inclusive of the moral and faith dimensions of context and life-cycle development, Human Development and Faith examines the interplay of mind, body, family, community, and soul at every stage of development. It addresses two central questions: What are the ""good-enough"" conditions of parenting, family, and community in each phase of life, from birth to death, which support growth and development? What gives life adequate meaning as development proceeds? If human development describes the normative and hoped-for passages of life, then faith provides the necessary component of meaning. Throughout the various perspectives offered in this volume is the premise that faith is that quality of living that makes it possible to fully live. The Journal of Pastoral Theology called the first edition of Human Development and Faith ""an excellent text for pastoral theology courses, because it fulfills its ambitious goal of bringing a holistic faith perspective to the usual topics of development.""

Anything Can Be Healed,Martin Brofman,Findhorn Press,2019-06-11,"A new edition of the classic practical manual for utilizing the chakra system as a body/mind interface for effective energetic healing • Explores the physical body as a mirror of our consciousness, with symptoms reflecting inner stresses in our emotional being, our mind, and/or our higher self • Offers an in-depth explanation of different aspects of each chakra, alongside a chakra meditation and practical energy exercises • Includes color reference charts of the chakras and their associated vibrations, systems, layers of the aura, senses, and areas of consciousness Drawing on his own profound healing experience as a young man, Martin Brofman developed a system of healing that effectively and seamlessly blends Western psychology and Eastern philosophies: the Body Mirror System. He explains how the chakra system connects to both mind and body to form a body/mind interface, allowing us to read the physical body as a mirror of the consciousness within, track the route from symptom to cause, and then work on releasing the causes on all levels. Brofman shows how specific tensions or symptoms on the physical level reflect corresponding tensions in one’s consciousness about specific issues in life--the inner cause to the outer symptom. The author explains how healing the symptom needs to involve not only releasing the tension on the physical level, but also letting go of the stressful way of interacting with the environment. Thus, the process of healing always implies a process of transformation. Within the concepts of his Body Mirror System, Brofman explores the chakras and their role in the body, including their associated vibrations, parts of the body, senses, layers of the aura, and areas of consciousness. He explains how to clear and connect the chakras, how to connect to the cosmos through the chakras, and how engaging with thought forms, time travel, and past lives can assist in healing sessions. Discussing the healing of others as well as self-healing, Brofman describes how to heal with chakras, thought forms, white light, and love, and how to perform distance healing. He provides practical energy exercises and chakra meditations, allowing the reader to imminently experience the healing energy in their bodies and prepare for a healing session. He also includes color reference guides, such as a chakra healing chart.

Rowland,Healing Arts Press,2008-11-24,"How the principles of Reiki can be used not just for healing but also for spiritual growth • Explores how to practice the Reiki values of peace, serenity, gratitude, integrity, and kindness in everyday life, despite the challenges of constant change and frequent crises • Provides tools for spiritual growth for practitioners of all levels and lineages • Includes exercises and meditations to deepen the practice of Reiki using the five Reiki precepts: do not anger; do not worry; be grateful; do an honest day’s work; be kind Reiki practitioners and teachers recognize Reiki as a gentle and powerful healing method. The path to becoming a Reiki practitioner, however, is more than just a commitment to energy healing. It is also a commitment to personal growth. In Reiki for the Heart and Soul, Amy Rowland details how reflection on the five core Reiki principles presented in both the Western and Japanese traditions--do not anger; do not worry; be grateful; do an honest day’s work; be kind--can be used by practitioners of all levels and lineages as powerful tools for personal and spiritual growth. Living the five core principles reinforces Reiki’s subtle energy healing: it heals wounded self-esteem and builds healthy self-respect; it demonstrates the creative power of a positive attitude; and it presents a way to peace. Rowland discusses various translations of the Reiki principles, demonstrating how to integrate their practical value through stories and interviews. She also offers specific techniques and exercises for healing anger and fear as well as living with gratitude, integrity, and compassion. These techniques will help maturing practitioners discover a healthy, happy way of being in the world and to see the way forward on their spiritual path with a sense of clear guidance and grace.",Health & Fitness,256,N/A,0,en

Lastly, Part Three presents the various segmental items that constitute text, like lexical clustering, L1/L2 relationship, classroom talk as text, etc. The division corresponds with what can be viewed as a logical sequence of text-related processes reflected in formal learning and teaching environments.",Education,293,N/A,0,en

The term ""bio-hacking"" means to alter our biology to achieve a greater level of performance. By incorporating techniques such as light therapy, sound therapy, aromatherapy, vitamin therapy, inversion, meditation, and others, IT IS POSSIBLE to re-balance the body and to live in a state of ease, versus dis-ease. With 78% of Americans overweight and an estimated 80 million people suffering from insomnia and depression, it is becoming more apparent that the majority of people go through their lives living in a state of fatigue, exhaustion, despair, stress, and ""dis-ease."" The Unchained Life Manual challenges generally accepted dogma concerning health, wellness, and recommended dietary allowances for vitamins and minerals, by presenting anecdotal, empirical, and clinical references that point towards a desperately needed collective paradigm shift. With multiple sources stating that medical mistakes are the third leading cause of death in America, maybe it is time for all of us to truly learn about our physiology and reclaim ownership over our personal health and wellness, so we can avoid unnecessary hospital visits?Disclaimer: The Unchained Life Manual is not medical advice.

Having established this framework Professor Moravia pursues his second aim - the articulation of a particular interpretation of the mental and the mind-body problem. The book's detailed and systematic treatment of this fundamental philosophical issue make it ideal for upper-level undergraduate and graduate courses in epistemology and the philosophy of mind.

Imagery in Sport,"Tony Morris, Michael Spittle, Anthony P.

Rethinking College Student Development Theory Using Critical Frameworks,"Elisa S. Abes, Susan R. Jones, D-L Stewart",Taylor & Francis,2023-07-03,"A major new contribution to college student development theory, this book brings ""third wave"" theories to bear on this vitally important topic. The first section includes a chapter that provides an overview of the evolution of student development theories as well as chapters describing the critical and poststructural theories most relevant to the next iteration of student development theory. These theories include critical race theory, queer theory, feminist theories, intersectionality, decolonizing/indigenous theories, and crip theories. These chapters also include a discussion of how each theory is relevant to the central questions of student development theory. The second section provides critical interpretations of the primary constructs associated with student development theory. These constructs and their related ideas include resilience, dissonance, socially constructed identities, authenticity, agency, context, development (consistency/coherence/stability), and knowledge (sources of truth and belief systems). Each chapter begins with brief personal narratives on a particular construct; the chapter authors then re-envision the narrative’s highlighted construct using one or more critical theories.

Orogenies of Light,Richard Leviton,iUniverse,2019-10-29,"ONE DAY IN 2084 EARTH’S ORIGINAL MOUNTAINS SUDDENLY REAPPEARED ON THE PLANET—AS 85,000 DOMED CANOPIES OF LIGHT FROM THE STARS. The story of this return is told by Blaise, a well-informed but mysterious figure who claims to be an engineer 134 years old and part of an ancient team that first designed the planet. It’s a chronicle of his last field assignment, a unique career retrospective, and a firsthand account of the momentous return of the domes. These are giant half-spheres of Light that originally helped create the biosphere and were the Earth’s first mountains. They generated the Earth’s sacred sites and the mythic homes of the gods and linked them all in a global pattern of Light. The domes arrived all at once and started to reorganize the global landscape. It was their fourth visit, and it would be several perilous years as the planet adjusts to it. Blaise and his team of geomancers travel across the Earth and time to deal with the unprecedented perturbations set in motion by this celestial rescue of the planet. Problems are rife—the revolt of Pan and the Nature Spirits, the continuing dark interference by humanity’s ghostly forebears, the resurgence of Babylon and its imperious agenda, and the planet’s dangerous drift towards becoming flattened like a hockey-puck. But the opportunities are fabulous too as the planet enters an era of unceasing Light and beatific conditions. The return of the domes lays bare the true history of the Earth, how it diminished from perfection, the benign superintendents of this bold experiment, and who its earliest inhabitants were and the massive problems they created which still affect us today. It is a genuinely apocalyptic moment, as the Earth reveals its original bright pattern of energy and consciousness and starts at last to fulfill its destiny.","Body, Mind & Spirit",1022,N/A,0,en
Theosophon 2033,Richard Leviton,iUniverse,2015-08-20,"Its September 29, 2033, and the Earth and humanity have entered a cathedral of Light 1,000 light-years tall and wide. One Saturday morning in June 2040 Boston editor Edward Burbage is visited by an enigmatic traveller calling himself Blaise. Hes been off the planet for 20 years, helping to orchestrate a unique event called the Theosophon. Now hes here to tell his story and what happened in 2033 when Earth reality changed. This Blaisehes clearly a human, age about 90, yet hes not in a human body anymore, at least not a physical one. He claims to have spent much of the last 20 years commuting from his home planet in the Celaeno system in the Pleiades to Earth. Why the Pleiades? Because thats where the prime designers of the Earth reside, and the Theosophon, a kind of galactic musical event, a song-fest of the gods, is the next step in the perfection of this design for consciousness. The only reason Burbage believes him is that he has had a bit of a wild adventure himself. Copies of his newly published book describing this sit on his coffee table. Hes seen this intriguing Blaise a few times in the past, and, in fact, hes edited two of his posthumous books. Burbage notes, It wasnt that Blaise had a mystery to reveal to me; he was the mystery. Everything about him. As the narration ripens over the next three years, Burbage is astonished to learn he was a key participant in the event even though up until this moment he had no memory of it. Blaise changes all that. The Theosophon, he says, was like a subtle, slow-motion psychic earthquake rumbling just beyond the border of normal perception, like a band of angels were shaking the Earth. It lasted a day, in terms of peak intensity, but it is still happening years later.","Body, Mind & Spirit",916,N/A,0,en
The Hierophancy Files,Richard Leviton,iUniverse,2018-09-27,"Beneath the surface details of our planet lies a numbers matrix, and somebody just stole its key, putting our world in jeopardy. In 2050, geomancers and Light grid engineers at the Hierophancy in Sun Valley, Idaho, perfected an algorithm that runs all the Earth’s psychic affairs. In 2065, somebody stole it. This is the account of how they got it back. They had to get it back because in the wrong hands, this math formula could take over or end the planet. The Hierophancy is a secret group that works with the planet’s subtle energy terrain. You’ll know its outer expression as a landscape of sacred sites. Their job is to reveal the Holy Light that comes out of these many nodes and to fix it when there’s a problem. Why? They’re Hierophants—think of them as engineers of the planet’s Light grid. In April 2065, they discovered there was problem, a big one. Hierophancy staff member Frederick Atkinson narrates what they did about it. It’s a fairly wild ride involving unsuspected levels of planetary reality, routine cooperation of extraterrestrial colleagues, lots of angels, Ascended Masters, and even a guest consultation with the Chief Architect of All Reality. The result is a concentrated detective hunt across time and space to find that stolen mathematics. The quest for the stolen arithmetic takes the team to sites in Bolivia, Canada, Japan, and Iceland and back to the planet’s earliest days and other key moments in its geomantic life as they probe the engineering intricacies that comprise the Earth’s esoteric reality. An awful lot is at stake—namely, the fate of five related planets across this and other galaxies because they’re directly tied into the Earth and they need those numbers back too.","Body, Mind & Spirit",918,N/A,0,en
The White Staff Nudge,Richard Leviton,iUniverse,2017-10-03,"This is a story of how a sages staff that blossomed in white petals two thousand years ago gave the Earth and humanity a valuable spiritual nudge in 2054. The sage was Joseph of Arimathea, famous for providing a tomb for the crucified Jesus. But hes also legendary for arriving in Celtic Glastonbury in the first century AD, where he established the first Apostolic church in Britain. Joseph also introduced the Grail Knight Fellowship and the Christ Light transmission. Immortal, hes been the chief magus of the Quest for the Holy Grail ever since and the leader of an esoteric academy spanning the centuries that trains people to use the authentic Christ Light to rebalance the planet. It all comes down to a flowering white staff, and its a staff made of Light. Its blossoms are blazing diamond-white fire, and its called the White Crown. But Joseph is not the only one with a staff. All Grail Knights have one, and thats how they combine Christ alignment with Earth energies, as Edward Burbage found out. Hes an established Boston book editor who sets off with two companions on a four-year immersion in the powers and uses of the flowering white staff. The story begins in the year 2050, and the world is still reorganizing itself along better lines than it has seen in millennia since the Golden Age finally began in 2020. But it still needs a few expert nudges from the white staff to keep it on track. Edwards initiation into how you do this with the white staffs power takes him to Nebraska, Iowa, Glastonbury, Ireland, Gozo, and Greece. Along the way, he learns the true story of the Holy Grail, how Irelands original gods brought the Grail from the Andromeda Galaxy, and how their allies, the famously enigmatic 24 Elders, guide the Earths secret destiny. But Edward will have to deal with their enemy, Klingsor, the trickiest, nastiest, most deviously clever Grail Killer.","Body, Mind & Spirit",981,N/A,0,en

They were commissioned by the Lord of Death himself, some call him Hades, and joined by a uniquely qualified spirit who knew that landscape well, the famous magus known as Merlin. It turns out hes served as the top Underworld guide to many cultures since death began, and he wrote The Tibetan Book of the Dead about how they do things there in the Bardo. Their job was to come up with ways to make death and the afterlife experience easier. Nothing there was working right anymore, nobody understood the place, people were getting lost and confused, complaints were mounting, and all this was slowing up Earths progress and the daytime life of living humans. The team included Blaise, a mysterious wisecracker who spends a lot of his timeoff-planet, mostly in the Pleiades; Edward, a sensible Boston book editor; Frederick, once a mythology professor but now a freelance Gnostic; Philomena, his wife who ascended into a Light body ten years earlier; Matthew, a reclusive meditator who consorts with Thunderbirds; Pipaluk, a very old shaman from Greenland; Tommy, teenager who died 20 years ago and now knows the Land of the Dead firsthand; and Merlin, explainer of Mysteries and everyones favorite afterlife guide. Nothing is exempt from their Bardo retrofit. No job is safe; no way of doing things is secure. Everything about the afterlife will change.

Ordinary Sacred,Kent Nerburn,New World Library,2012-01-31,"There is a hidden meaning, a hidden beauty, in life’s most ordinary moments. It is the beauty of the human heart revealed, where what we have in common is greater than what keeps us apart. If we can learn to see the beauty in these moments, whether they are in the light or in the shadow, we become witnesses to the spiritual, testimonies to the sacred. We become true artists of the ordinary, and our life becomes a masterpiece, painted in the colors of the heart. A chance encounter with a boy on a bicycle, a young girl’s graduation from eighth grade; these and other small moments are the subjects of this beautifully written collection.

The Mertowney Mountain Interviews,Richard Leviton,iUniverse,2014-07-16,"You see, Edward, editor and budding Grail Knight, youre part of the Merlin myth, and you have been for a long time, said Merlin enigmatically. The figure of Merlin, magician, enchanter, trickster, strategist of King Arthurs Camelot, wise old man of Celtic myth, has intrigued and enthralled readers for centuries, but who, really, was he? Did he ever actually exist? Boston editor Edward Burbage is given a unique opportunity to find out. Hes invited to Merlins home on Mertowney Mountain to interview him. The invitation includes free transportation, and Merlins mountain is not in this world, and for that matter, how on Earth could Burbage be talking to Merlin anyway? Merlin is supposed to be only a character from an old myth, isnt he? Over the course of five years, starting in 2034, Burbage conducts his interviews, and the revelations Merlin makes are astounding. He has been many mythic figures, taken on many guises, such as the Irish Cuchulainn, the Egyptian Anubis, the Navaho Monster Slayer, the Greek Herakles, the Polynesian Maui, and even a few holy men like Saint Columba of Iona and John the Evangelist of Patmos, author of Revelation. Hes worked as initiator, war-god, slayer of inimical spirits, prophet, seer, a guide to the soul in the after-life, geomancer, terraformer, a fisher up of islands, and especially a devoted field agent to the Great Mother, Herself operating under many guises such as Morrigan, Isis, Changing Woman, and Hera. But why has Edward Burbage been brought to Mertowney Mountain? Its not just so Merlin can tell his true story. Merlin has a plan for him, and hes preparing things all the time hes recounting his exploits. Edward Burbage has a key role to play in the next installment of the long life of Merlin. Hes about to step onto the world stage of myth disclosing a long withheld mystery, the secret of the Mer-Line, the truth and power behind Merlin himself.","Body, Mind & Spirit",619,N/A,0,en

The Bavarian Illuminati,René Le Forestier,Simon and Schuster,2022-02-15,"• Details the rise and fall of this famous and infamous Order, including its penetration of Bavarian society and its destruction by the Bavarian government • Explains the Bavarian Illuminati’s grades, rituals, ceremonies, and fundamental philosophies and examines the leaders of the Order • Contains the only surviving record of documents that were destroyed during the two World Wars The Bavarian Order of the Illuminati is the most celebrated secret society in the world. Though officially lasting only 11 years, the powerful spell and shadow cast by the Illuminati still looms in the present day, where its influence can be seen in current conspiracy beliefs and actions by powerful individuals working in the shadows. The original Order of the Illuminati was founded by Bavarian professor Adam Weishaupt in 1776. Although the order was banned and brought down by the Bavarian Elector in 1787--when he became aware of the extent to which it had infiltrated the courts, schools, and his own administration--its legend and deep influence lives on to this day. Charting the rise and fall of this infamous order, this book--first published in French in 1915 and never before available in English--remains the definitive history of the Order of the Bavarian Illuminati. It also offers a revealing look at the world that spawned and shaped it: a ceaseless ferment of revolutionary and occult ideas and the ceaseless attempts by crown and church to suppress them. Other secret societies that shared the stage with the Illuminati during these years include the Templar Strict Observance, von Hund’s Templar Freemasonry, and other Masonic lodges the Illuminati targeted to subvert for their own purposes. Many of the documents the author consulted for the writing of this book were destroyed during the two World Wars, making this book the only surviving record of many of the order’s secrets. The author explains the Bavarian Illuminati’s grades, rituals, and ceremonies as well as its fundamental philosophies. He paints vivid portraits of the leaders of the order, including Weishaupt, Baron Knigge, and Xavier von Zwack. He reveals how Weishaupt early on decided to subvert the existing German Freemason Lodge as a shortcut to gain esoteric hegemony over the occult world, all in order to extend Illuminati influence into the society at large and the government. The author also provides extensive detail of the order’s eventual destruction by the Bavarian government. In addition to its revelation of little-known secrets of the Illuminati Order, the author also sheds new light on much of the occult life of this time, including the activities of figures such as Cagliostro and Mirabeau and other active groups such as Freemason chapters, the Rosicrucians, and the Martinists.","Body, Mind & Spirit",882,5,1,en

The Fourteen Holy Helpers,Christiane Stamm,Simon and Schuster,2022-02-01,"• Shares modern updated versions of the medieval prayers of the Holy Helpers, one prayer for each of the 14 saints and one prayer to call on all of them together • Explains how, even though these 14 saints are connected to Catholic belief, they are universal in their powers of assistance and will come to the aid of anyone who calls on them • Recommends a healing stone to enhance the effect of each prayer and explains how to use the prayers to create protective amulets for you and your home and write a letter of invocation for love and success The art of invocation--calling on spirits and higher forces for assistance--has been practiced in folk magic traditions for centuries, with roots going back to early pagan and shamanic times. Called on for more than 1,000 years, the Fourteen Holy Helpers are a group of Catholic saints venerated together because their intercession has been shown to be particularly effective in difficult times. Although they are part of the Christian tradition, these spiritual helpers are universal in their powers of assistance and will come to the aid of anyone who calls on them. In this guide to invoking the Fourteen Holy Helpers, Christiane Stamm presents modern updated versions of the medieval prayers of the Holy Helpers, which were transmitted to her directly from the spirit world. She explains how, even though these 14 saints are connected to Catholic belief, their invoked powers connect to the original energies dwelling within humans and the Earth and calling on them works as a form of natural magic. She shares short biographies of each saint and details how to access their powers of healing and protection through writing out and reciting their specific prayers during the full moon. The author shares 15 prayers--one for each Holy Helper, used to support healing for specific ailments or issues, and one prayer that is especially powerful because it calls on all 14 Helpers together. For each prayer she recommends a healing stone that can be added to further enhance the effect. The author also explains how to use the prayers to create protective amulets for you and your home and write a letter of invocation for love and success. Offering a step-by-step method to call for spiritual assistance, this book helps us realize the profound power of prayer and belief and reveals how magic still exists in our modern world.","Body, Mind & Spirit",125,N/A,0,en

Based on these studies, she demonstrates how conventional and holistic medicine often fall short in times of need. Both systems rely upon a logical approach to curing illness when there is nothing reasonable about the emotional, psychological, or spiritual influences behind any ailment.

"Culture, Diversity and Health in Australia","Tinashe Dune, Kim McLeod, Robyn Williams",Routledge,2021-05-30,"Australia is increasingly recognised as a multicultural and diverse society. Nationally, all accrediting bodies for allied health, nursing, midwifery and medical professions require tertiary educated students to be culturally safe with regards to cultural and social diversity. This text, drawing on experts from a range of disciplines, including public health, nursing and sociology, shows how the theory and practice of cultural safety can inform effective health care practices with all kinds of diverse populations. Part 1 explores key themes and concepts, including social determinants of health and cultural models of health and health care. There is a particular focus on how different models of health, including the biomedical and Indigenous perspectives, intersect in Australia today. Part 2 looks at culturally safe health care practice focusing on principles and practice as well as policy and advocacy. The authors consider the practices that can be most effective, including meaningful communication skills and cultural responsiveness. Part 3 examines the practice issues in working with diverse populations, including Indigenous Australians, Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Australians, Australians with disabilities, Australians of diverse sexual orientation and gender identity, and ageing Australians. Part 4 combines all learnings from Parts 1–3 into practical learning activities, assessments and feedback for learners engaging with this textbook. Culture, Diversity and Health in Australia is a sensitive, richly nuanced and comprehensive guide to effective health practice in Australia today and is a key reference text for either undergraduate or postgraduate students studying health care. It will also be of interest to professional health care practitioners and policy administrators.",Medical,404,N/A,0,en
Tourism and Citizenship,"Raoul Bianchi, Marcus Stephenson",Routledge,2014-02-24,"More than sixty years since the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights first enshrined the right to freedom of movement in an international charter of human rights, the issue of mobility and the right to tourism itself have become increasingly significant areas of scholarly interest and political debate. However, despite the fact that cross-border travel implies certain citizenship rights as well as the material capacity to travel, the manifold intersections between tourism and citizenship have not received the attention they deserve in the literature. This book endeavours to fill this gap by being the first to fully examine the role of tourism in wider society through a critically-informed sociological reflection on the unfolding relationships between international tourism and distinct renderings of citizenship, with particular emphasis on the ideological and political alignments between the freedom of movement and the right to travel. The text weaves its analysis of citizenship and travel in the context of addressing large-scale societal transformations engendered by globalization, neoliberalism and the geopolitical realignments between states, as well as comprehending the internal reconfiguring of the relationship between citizens and states themselves. By doing so, it focuses on key themes including: tourism and social citizenship rights; race, culture and minority rights; states, markets and the freedom of movement; tourism, peace and geo-politics; consumerism and class; and, ethical tourism, global citizenship and cosmopolitanism. The book concludes that the advancement of genuinely democratic and just forms of tourism must be commensurate with demands for distributive justice and a democratic politics of mobility encompassing all of humanity. This timely and significant contribution to the sociology and politics of international tourism through the lens of citizenship is a must read for students and scholars in both in the fields of tourism and social science. The royalties received from this book will be donated to the International Porter Protection Group.",Business & Economics,326,N/A,0,en

The Twilight of Pluto,John Michael Greer,Simon and Schuster,2022-02-01,"• Explains in detail how the demotion or proved nonexistence of a planet marks the beginning of a roughly 30-year period in which that planet’s influence wanes • Explores Pluto’s arc of influence on individual and collective life in depth, from its discovery in 1930 to the end of its influence in 2036 • Offers examples from other demoted planets, such as Ceres, whose fifty-year reign as a planet corresponds very closely to the Romantic Era of history Recent research in astrology has shown that the discovery of a new planet correlates with the emergence of a new set of influences in individual and collective life. As John Michael Greer reveals, the opposite is also true: the demotion of a planet correlates with the decline of a set of influences into the background. Exploring the waxing and waning of planetary influences in astrology, Greer explains in detail how the demotion or proved nonexistence of a planet marks the beginning of a roughly 30-year period in which that planet’s influence fades out. He examines several examples of planet demotion, including Ceres, whose influence began to take shape some 30 years before its discovery in 1801 and gradually faded over the three decades following its demotion in the 1850s. Examining Pluto’s astrological influence in depth, from the beginning of the search for “Planet X” in 1900 to the end of its influence in 2036, the author shows how during the Plutonian era the concept of cosmos--from the ancient Greek meaning “that which is beautifully ordered”--was in eclipse. Pluto’s influence led to the rejection of unity, beauty, and order, exemplified through the splitting of the atom by physicists, the splitting of the individual into conscious and subconscious halves by psychoanalysts, and the splitting of the world into warring camps by politicians. Offering an essential guide not only to the astrology of the future but also to the twilight of the Plutonian era, Greer shows how as Pluto’s influence fades out in the years ahead, a great many disruptive phenomena of the recent past will fade with it.","Body, Mind & Spirit",226,N/A,0,en

Scientific Vortex Information,"Pete A. Sanders, Jr.",Light Technology Publishing,2005-04-01,"This book was originally written to help those visiting Sedona, Arizona who could not attend my regular Scientific Vortex Information Training Class (see www.freesoul.net). It teaches how to rapidly, easily, and effectively tap Sedona's famous meditation sites. It also contains a system for finding vortexes closer to your home area. Understanding vortexes and how to tap them is a key asset for exploring your ""dimensions beyond"" described in Superstrings Physics. Even more important, however, is knowing how to weave that knowledge into a method for ""Living life AS a Soul."" When you are having difficulty accessing deeper spiritual skills, or are facing intense inner hurts, vortex energies can provide portals to new insights. People tend to be drawn to upflow areas to feel the exhilaration of tapping those dimensions beyond. What they are also craving (in many cases without even realizing it) is to escape the worries, hurts, angers, and fears created by the Limbic Brain. The Soul-shift technique (contained in this book) makes tapping the vortexes easier, primarily because it gets the meditator out of their limbic brain focus. It allows you to create an inner upflow vortex, where ever you are. The brain science technique for natural mood elevation contained in my book, Access Your Brain's Joy Center (soon also available as an e-book), teaches how to counter limbic brain effects anywhere, anytime without having be in a meditative state. That makes it possible to self-generate that inner upflow effect in ALL of life (eyes open, moving, etc.). As you read through this book, see the bigger picture. Imagine having the ability to live accessing ALL of your dimensions beyond and ALL your spiritual skills, without having to physically be in the enhanced energy sites. Enjoy exploring the unlimited potentials that ARE your birthright As a Free Soul.","Body, Mind & Spirit",81,N/A,0,en

Becoming a Garment of Isis,Naomi Ozaniec,Simon and Schuster,2022-03-08,"• Details the nine stages of the ancient Egyptian initiatory path, describing each stage’s powers as well as the culminating ceremony called “The Crown of Isis” • Provides profound guided meditations for each of the nine stages and illustrates the manifestation of this path’s principles through stories of awakening • Shares the author’s personal journey as a Garment of Isis and her own powerful interactions with Isis, which culminated in her serving as Oracle of Isis at the Parliament of World Religions in Chicago in 1993 The Sacred Science of ancient Egypt was an initiatory spiritual system, a technology of consciousness designed to birth a mystical communion with the divinities, an embodied union of being between the eternal and the mortal. After initiation was completed, the re-identified being, now divinely possessed, was known as a Garment of Isis, signifying that the goddess Isis dwelt within them. Offering a practical guide to the key principles within the Egyptian temple tradition, Naomi Ozaniec explores the process of creating and developing a personal relationship with the Neteru, the divinities and forces of creation of ancient Egypt. She details the nine stages of this initiatory path, which are divided into three phases--heartmind, spiritmind, and soulmind. This step-by-step, interactive process culminates in a ceremony called The Crown of Isis. The author provides profound guided meditations and illustrates the manifestation of the initiate’s powers through stories of awakening brought on by this spiritual path. She also shares her personal journey as a Garment of Isis and her own powerful interactions with Isis. An accessible yet substantive guide to initiation into the Egyptian Mysteries, this book details how to gradually awaken and attune your mind to the symbolic, open access to higher realms of consciousness, and enter into a mystical marriage between personal and divine consciousness.","Body, Mind & Spirit",447,N/A,0,en

Peacock Angel,Peter Lamborn Wilson,Simon and Schuster,2022-03-08,"• Explains how the Yezidis worship Melek Ta’us, the Peacock Angel, an enigmatic figure often identified as “the devil” or Satan, yet who has been redeemed by God to rule a world of beauty and spiritual realization • Examines Yezidi antinomian doctrines of opposition, their cosmogony, their magical lore and taboos, the role of angels, ritual, and symbology, and how the Yezidi faith relates to other occult traditions such as alchemy • Presents the first English translation of the poetry of Caliph Yazid ibn Muawiya, venerated by the Yezidis as Sultan Ezi The Yezidis are an ancient people who live in the mountainous regions on the borders of Turkey, Syria, Iraq, and Iran. This secretive culture worships Melek Ta’us, the Peacock Angel, an enigmatic figure often identified as “the devil” or Satan, hence the sect is known as devil-worshippers and has long been persecuted. Presenting a study of the interior, esoteric dimensions of Yezidism, Peter Lamborn Wilson examines the sect’s antinomian doctrines of opposition, its magical lore and taboos, and its relation to other occult traditions such as alchemy. He explains how the historical founder of this sect was a Sufi of Ummayad descent, Sheik Adi ibn Musafir, who settled in this remote region around 1111 AD and found a pre-Islamic sect already settled there. Sheik Adi was so influenced by the original sect that he departed from orthodox Islam, and by the 15th century the sect was known to worship the Peacock Angel, Melek Ta’us, with all its “Satanic” connotations. Revealing the spiritual flowering that occurs in an oral culture, the author examines Yezidi cosmogony, how they are descended from the androgynous Adam--before Eve was created--as well as the role of angels, ritual, alchemy, symbology, and color in Yezidi religion. He also presents the first English translation of the poetry of Caliph Yazid ibn Muawiya, venerated by the Yezidis as Sultan Ezi. Showing the Yezidi sect to be a syncretic faith of pre-Islamic, Zoroastrian, Christian, Pagan, Sufi, and other influences, Wilson reveals how these worshippers of the Peacock Angel do indeed worship “the Devil”--but the devil is not “evil.” God has redeemed him, and he rules a world of beauty and spiritual realization.","Body, Mind & Spirit",377,N/A,0,en

She shares her in-depth interviews with ten contemporary practitioners of spirit marriage, including a Faery Seer, a Shakta Tantric, a West African Shrine Keeper, a New Orleans Voodoo Mambo, Haitian Vodou practitioners, and a ceremonial magician. Through these respectful interviews, the spirit-marriage practitioners tell their stories of initiation and of having a spouse who is both otherworldly and able to assist in waking- world activities. They offer intimate insight into this growing global practice and its larger evolutionary purpose. We learn about their experiences of first contact, the decision to marry, how the relationship is upheld by their community, and the impact on their other relationships. We also learn about the risks and challenges as well as one example of divorcing a spirit. Sharing her personal experience, the author discusses in detail her own spirit marriage, including the erotic nature of being “spirit filled” and her encounters with her Faery beloved. She explains how to cultivate a spirit marriage, sharing precautions and practices to spiritually prepare yourself, interpret your paranormal encounters, and navigate the potential challenges of spirit marriage. Presenting the first study of the transcultural, shamanistic practice of spirit marriage, this book shows how bonded relationships with spirits are needed now more than ever to assist with spiritual evolution.","Body, Mind & Spirit",448,N/A,0,en

Spells Like Teen Spirit,Kate M. Williams,Delacorte Press,2021-09-21,"The final installment in the hilarious, action-packed Babysitters Coven series that Refinery29 calls ""candy for 90's girls and Gen Z'ers alike,"" featuring a coven of witchy babysitters sworn to protect the innocent and defend the world from an onslaught of evil--all before bedtime. Ever since Esme met Cassandra Heaven and discovered the truth about their shared legacy--that they're Sitters, supernaturally gifted teens tasked with protecting the innocent from evil--her life has been moving at 90 mph. During the day, she chases wild toddlers, and at night, she employs a different skill set for a different kind of demon. Like, literal ones. And sometimes it's almost fun. Her spells are getting better, her telekinesis is on point, and now that Esme's dad and her best friend Janis know the truth, she's no longer lying to the people she loves. She's also learned that there's a way to undo her mother's curse, and with the Synod out of the picture, she might even have a chance to do it. If she could just figure out how. But she can't, and even with her mom living at home again, Esme can't shake the feeling that she's failing. Throw in the fact that Pig is still gone, Esme's crush is MIA, and it's cold, slushy February, and she's in bummer city. Esme needs a serious pick-me-up, and Janis has a plan: a Galentine's stay-cation, with the Sitter friends Esme and Cassandra made at the Summit. Except things are getting weird in Spring River again. Esme and Cassandra just discovered a new band, and not in a good way: these guys reek of Red Magic, and their music sucks. Trouble is brewing, and if Esme's not careful, this show might be her last--and no one likes a one-hit wonder.",Young Adult Fiction,401,N/A,0,en

Alchemy,Diana Fernando,Sterling Publishing Company Incorporated,1998,"From Alchimistiches Medaillon to Zuccari, delve into the mysteries of alchemy -- the ancient mystical art considered to be one of the four esoteric paths to enlightenment. Closely related to witchcraft, alchemy is neither a science nor a philosophy, but rather a striving for perfection on a physical and metaphysical level. Alchemy is about transforming materials -- metals as well as people. This generously illustrated dictionary features entries on laboratory operations and well-known alchemists as well as information on the framework that made alchemy possible -- the brotherhoods, the sacred places, the transmitters, collectors and patrons, the texts and publishers, and something of the language, including cabalistic and glyphic. A great deal of emphasis is laid on pictures and emblems, which are keys to understanding the path of alchemy. Anyone interested in exploring the marvels of this elusive pursuit will find this unique volume to be an invaluable resource.","Body, Mind & Spirit",192,N/A,0,en

This volume, featuring contributions from an international and interdisciplinary group of distinguished researchers and scholars, explores how our increasing knowledge of the brain can elucidate the concept of the will and whether or to what extent it is free. It also examines how brain science can inform our normative judgments of moral and criminal responsibility for our actions. Some chapters point out the different respects in which mental disorders can compromise the will and others show how different forms of neuromodulation can reveal the neural underpinning of the mental capacities associated with the will and can restore or enhance them when they are impaired.",Psychology,309,N/A,0,en

And with so many recent advances in brain studies, questions of mind and consciousness have become critically important for both theorists and hard scientists. Are we ""nothing but a pack of neurons"" that will in due course reveal their secrets in the laboratory? Or do our conscious mind and self-awareness stem from some dimension beyond material investigation? How, too, are we to account for ""parapsychological"" phenomena in which consciousness seems to defy space and time boundaries? These latest contributions to the debate--selected from the annual ""Beyond the Brain"" conferences--show that it is time for radical rethinking of our theories and methods in investigating phenomena of the human mind.",Philosophy,296,N/A,0,en

Heart Of The Soul,"Gary Zukav, Linda Francis",Simon and Schuster,2012-12-11,"In THE SEAT OF THE SOUL, Gary Zukav brilliantly set forth his concepts, explaining how the expansion of human perception beyond the five senses leads to a new understanding of 'authentic power'. Then, in SOUL STORIES, he revealed how such concepts as intuition, harmony, sharing and forgiveness actually express themselves in other people's lives. And now, in THE HEART OF THE SOUL, Zukav, together with his coauthor and spiritual partner, Linda Francis, takes the next important step in showing us how to actually apply these crucial concepts in our daily lives. Zukav reveals how true emotional awareness can transform the human experience. Although it is challenging and difficult, because it means becoming aware of suppressed pain, it is also enormously rewarding. But first the determination to explore every aspect of consciousness, and to cultivate those that contribute the most to life, must replace the desire to bury painful emotions. Ultimately emotional awareness can free us from the compulsions, fixations, obsessions and addictions that block our spiritual development - among them anger, workaholism, perfectionism, obsessive eating, alcohol, drugs, sex - and allow us to live a fulfilling and meaningful life. THE HEART OF THE SOUL will be a revelation for readers - a soul tool with which we can forge a greater emotional awareness to enable us to use our emotions in the creation of authentic power. It is a book to read not once, but several times, for it is a life-changing work that can transform our lives for the better.",Self-Help,330,N/A,0,en

We learn about the ten perfections as well as how śrāvakas, solitary realizers, and bodhisattvas progress along the paths of their respective vehicles to ultimate bodhicitta. A sophisticated schema of the five paths (of accumulation, preparation, seeing, meditation, and no more learning) and of the eight and ten grounds of the Fundamental Vehicle and the Bodhisattva Vehicle, respectively, serves as a concise framework for studying a grounds-and-path text in depth.
