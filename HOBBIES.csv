Hobbies,Steven M. Gelber,Columbia University Press,1999-06-25,"Whether it's needlepoint or woodworking, collecting stamps or dolls, everyone has a hobby, or is told they need one. But why do we fill our leisure time with the activities we do? And what do our hobbies say about our culture? Steven Gelber here traces the history and significance of hobbies from the mid-nineteenth century through the 1950s. Although hobbies are often touted as a break from work, Gelber demonstrates that they reflect and reproduce the values and activities of the workplace by bringing utilitarian rationality into the home, imitating the economic stratification of the marketplace, and reinforcing traditional gender roles. Drawing on a wide array of social and cultural theory, Hobbies fills a critical gap in American cultural history and provides a compelling new perspective on the meaning of leisure.",Social Science,396,4,1,en

The Rocket Years,Elizabeth Segran,HarperCollins,2020-03-31,"The Defining Decade for the #Adulting generation—a book that blends storytelling and data to unpack the choices you make in your twenties, why they matter, and how to turn those critical years into a launchpad for the life you want. We tend to think of our twenties as a playground for life: A time for low-consequence experimentation and delaying big decisions. But the truth is that while you’re muddling through those years—exploring new cities, dating the wrong people, hopping between jobs—a small shift in your flight path can mean the difference between landing on Mars or Saturn. As the data shows, the choices we make (or put off) during this critical decade about our career, marriage, health, friends, even downtime have the greatest impact on how our lives play out. For example, did you know that people who marry between the ages of 28 and 32 have the lowest risk of divorce? And that the average 25 year old has 20 close friends, but this will shrink to 8 after age 40? And that most of us don’t acquire new hobbies after we hit our thirties? Rather than prescribing one correct path (who are we kidding, there’s no such thing anyway!), Elizabeth Segran invites readers to think critically and holistically about the life they want to build. With signature warmth and humor, Segran is the guide we all wish we had to show us the way. Blending insightful anecdotes with research from economics, sociology, and political science, The Rocket Years is an empowering exploration of these exciting, confusing, wonderful years.",Self-Help,241,N/A,0,en

However, while the identity and motivation of those who donate comes under increasingly close scrutiny, little is known about the motivation and characteristics of the ‘askers’, despite almost every donation being solicited or prompted in some way.

There is a growing awareness of the importance of object oriented techniques, methods and tools to support information systems engineering. The term information systems implies that the computer based systems are designed to provide adequate and timely information to human users in organizations. The term engineering implies the application of a rigorous set of problem solving approaches analogous to those found in traditional engineering disciplines. The intent of this conference is to present a selected number of those approaches which favor an object oriented view of systems engineering. oms '98 is the fifth edition of a series of conferences. Starting in 1994 in London, this series evolved from a British audience to a truly European one.

No More Laughing at the Deaf Boy,Geoffrey Ball,Haymon Verlag,2012-06-29,"Hearing loss affects countless millions of people, yet few sufferers even seek help, let alone try to find a cure. This is the story of a man who took on that daunting task and ultimately invented the world's most successful middle ear implant. Geoffrey Ball's adventure in technology began in the legendary Silicon Valley of California, the birthplace of so many innovations that have transformed our world, and ultimately led him to the mountains of Austria, where he now lives and continues his work. Ball's deafness was diagnosed early, but even as a child he knew that sign language and conventional hearing aids were not the answer. Despite his proficiency in lipreading, he wanted more - a better fix. Meanwhile, Ball never let his disability stand in his way. He became a kind of modern Renaissance man with interests that ranged from literature to sports to music, all coupled with an undeniable talent for entrepreneurship and invention. The author introduces us to family and friends, surfing buddies and lab rats, business partners and fellow inventors, computer and Internet legends, a brilliant, larger-than-life mentor who gave him his start, and the woman who ultimately saved his brainchild. He intersperses insights into technology, funding and business acumen with personal, often humorous anecdotes and fascinating accounts of successes, failures and near misses along the way. Today, every hour, somewhere in the world, one of his ground- breaking devices improves the quality of life of a hearing-impaired person. No one is laughing at the deaf boy now, and we haven't heard the last of Geoffrey Ball.",Biography & Autobiography,303,N/A,0,en
Pressure Proofing,Sam Klarreich,Routledge,2012-01-26,"Do you feel uneasy when you try to relax? Are you overwhelmed by the deadlines you have to meet? Do you get rattled when things don’t go your way? Are you inpatient with people who work more slowly than you? Do you often get angry? Do you feel things are hopeless? Do you feel like not getting out of bed, instead pulling the covers over your head? More and more people have these reactions, in spite of the fact that we know more about pressure, anxiety, anger, and depression, and in spite of the fact that computers are supposed to make our lives and jobs easier. For the individual, these unhealthy reactions can lead to deteriorating health and a variety of social problems. For an organization, it often means low employee morale and declining productivity. In Pressure Proofing, Dr. Klarreich tackles the many people problems in the workplace and anywhere else for that matter. He shows how to identify the thoughts that bring on unhealthy reactions, and how to turn those thoughts around by debunking. Drawing on years of experience as a clinical psychologist, Dr. Klarreich then shows us, using quizzes, case histories, and practical programs, how these reactions can be conquered so that we can regain our health, productivity, and personal effectiveness.

Think in English,"Nilam Pathak, Anshuman Sharma",Aegis India PL,2021-11-04,"English is an international language, which means that the communication with most people other than your fellow native speakers would be in English. The present time requires us to interact with other people either digitally or physically for business, education, social or personal purposes. This fact itself is enough to present the importance of English in our life. Governments, educational boards, universities and institutions have made sure that English remains an important part of the curriculum. Kids accept English as one of their major subjects since the beginning of their education. For years, they learn about various segments of the English language, with a constant increase in complexity. There are taught grammar, sentence formation, word power, pronunciation and writing paragraphs in English. It is logical to assume that all these students will easily be able to converse in English, but that is the pain point. Most people with a native language other than English have difficulty communicating with others in spoken English. It is ironic to know that a person with the ability to write in English and well conversant in grammar rules would struggle to speak in English fluently. But this truth is faced by a large percentage of people who aspire to speak fluent English. Where is the problem? The problem is in realizing the truth about learning languages. English is the second language for most people, except native English speakers in countries like England, the United States of America, Australia and Canada. The difficulty of learning a second language is that it is learned by keeping the native language at the foundation. This means that English will be learned with reference from their native language, like translations, similarities in syntax, grammar rules, words and sentence formations. It is also dependent on the education system which focuses on training grammar rules, translations and written English. It is assumed that spoken English will come naturally to the students, sadly that never happens. It is easy to find students in English medium schools and colleges struggling to present a topic in English. Most will avoid interactions in English, using the native language as the fundamental language of communication. Another fact is known to all, one of the top skills required to get any decent job is fluency in spoken English. The solution is the realization that spoken and written English have equal importance but must be taught differently. The methodology specified in the book is based on the philosophy that the language should be taught and learned like the native speaker, just the way we learned our native language. The idea will be explained and discussed in detail in the coming chapters.",Education,199,N/A,0,en

Australian Falcons,Stephen Debus,CSIRO PUBLISHING,2022-11-02,"Falcons are stunning and iconic birds. Australia has six falcon species, with two endemic to the continent and two others endemic to the Australasian region. They are important indicators of the health of our ecosystems, due to their position at the top of the food chain. But several species are declining, with two species threatened in some states. In Australian Falcons: Ecology, Behaviour and Conservation, Dr Stephen Debus provides a 30-year update of knowledge on these six species, as well as a falcon-like hawk, the Black-shouldered Kite. This book is based partly on the author’s field studies, as well as being a supplement to the Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic Birds (HANZAB) and recent global treatises. It offers up-to-date information on the Australian species, including their behaviours, ecology and biology. It reviews their population status and threats, and suggests what needs to be done to ensure the future of these spectacular birds. Australian Falcons is an invaluable resource for raptor biologists, birdwatchers, wildlife rescuers and carers, raptor rehabilitators and zookeepers.",Science,247,N/A,0,en

Planning Your Time in Retirement,Robert A. Stebbins,Rowman & Littlefield,2013-09-05,"Much of what is written about getting old has a negative feel to it, which is certainly not entirely unjustified. Health may begin to fail. Finances may become tighter as income dwindles or stops altogether. Family and friends may move away or move on. But the retirement years do not have to be negative or bleak. Within this “dark scenario,” a positive existence is possible. Planning Your Time in Retirement focuses on the variety of free-time activities available to retirees as related to their physical, social, and economic situation in old age, helping readers find out what their passions are, what the possibilities might be, and how to cultivate their own leisure lifestyle. For some retirees, a post-work existence consisting of fun works well, for they have managed to shape an interesting casual leisure lifestyle based on easygoing activities that make them happy. Seldom included in the popular image of leisure, however, are other types of leisure that are also widely available to retirees. Regardless of means, the retirement years can consist of activities and pastimes that fulfill the interests and pursuits of any retiree. A variety of exciting leisure activities exists, which retirees may pursue within their financial, physical, mental, and geographic limits. This book provides a guide—the serious leisure perspective—for exploring these activities and choosing those that fit one’s tastes, aptitudes, and abilities. At its most appealing, a leisure lifestyle includes a balance of easy-to-do casual interests as well as serious ones that require knowledge, effort, and perseverance. For some, enjoyment and fulfillment may come from engaging in volunteer work, while for others it may involve leisure activities from which they gain some form of payment. By employing the notion of positive simplicity—simple living in the domain of leisure—many people at this stage of life can delight in these final years. While time and money cannot be ignored, finding those activities that allow for engagement, reward, and simplicity can result in days, even years, of leisure that is meaningful, enjoyable, healthy, and empowering.",Self-Help,185,N/A,0,en

"Brave New Digital Classroom, Second Edition",Robert J. Blake,Georgetown University Press,2013-03-28,"Brave New Digital Classroom examines the most effective ways to utilize technology in language learning. The author deftly interweaves the latest results of pedagogical research with descriptions of the most successful computer-assisted language learning (CALL) projects to show how to implement technology in the foreign-language curriculum to assist the second language acquisition process. This fully updated second edition includes new chapters on the latest electronic resources, including gaming and social media, and discusses the realities and potential of distance learning for second language acquisition. The author examines the web, CALL applications, and computer-mediated communication (CMC), and suggests how the new technologically assisted curriculum will work for the foreign-language curriculum. Rather than advocating new technologies as a replacement for activities that can be done equally well with traditional processes, the author envisions a radical change as teachers rethink their strategies and develop their competence in the effective use of technology in language teaching and learning. Directed at all language teachers, from the elementary school to postsecondary levels, the book is ideal for graduate-level courses on second language pedagogy.

It has three central themes: the nature of working-class culture and working-class organization; the relationships between the working class and other classes; and the role of both World Wars and the state in shaping class relations. Ross McKibbin examines different aspects of British political, social, and economic history to give an integrated explanation of the development of modern British society, and the ideological assumptions on which it is based. Attitudes to work and leisure are also explored, to build a coherent picture of the ideological world of Britain's social classes.",,326,N/A,0,en

Reversing the Cult of Speed in Higher Education,"Jonathan Chambers, Stephannie S. Gearhart",Routledge,2018-10-26,"A collection of essays written by arts and humanities scholars across disciplines, this book argues that higher education has been compromised by its uncritical acceptance of our culture’s standards of productivity, busyness, and speed. Inspired by the Slow Movement, contributors explain how and why university culture has come to value productivity over contemplation and rapidity over slowness. Chapter authors argue that the arts and humanities offer a cogent critique of fast culture in higher education, and reframe the discussion of the value of their fields by emphasizing the dialectic between speed and slowness.",Education,264,N/A,0,en

Wars, famine and plague were the prime causes of human misery in the centuries gone by. Over the last couple of decades, we have been able to ward off diseases, income levels and life expectancy have increased, and the world has seen its most peaceful time ever. But, instead of being happy and joyful we are stressed – a lot. Why did that happen? The change over the last few years had been rapid, and none of us were ready for it. We embraced everything that the changing world threw at us without realizing the deep impact it had caused. It is time to pause, reflect and take action before stress becomes the plague of this century. Why is stress becoming the cause of misery and ailments in this era? What is stress exactly, and what are its major causes? How does social networking in the virtual world create stress? How can one manage stress to mitigate its effect? All these questions and many more get answered in this book that helps you identify your causes of distress and help you de-stress.",Self-Help,208,N/A,0,en
Family Life in 20th-Century America,"Marilyn Coleman Ph.D., Lawrence H. Ganong, Kelly Warzinik",Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2007-04-30,"No other century promoted such rapid change in American families than the twentieth century did. Through most of the first half of the century families were two-parent plus children units, but by the 1980s and 1990s divorce was common in half of the homes and many families were single-parent or included step-parents, step-siblings and half-siblings. The major changes in opinions and even some laws on race, gender and sexuality during the 1960s and 1970s brought change to families as well. Some families were headed by gay parents, lived in communes or other non-traditional homes, were of mixed race, or had adopted children. Family life had changed dramatically in less than 50 years. The change in the core make-up of what was considered a family ushered in new celebrations and holidays, ways of cooking, eating, and entertainment, and even daily activities. In this detailed look at family life in America, Coleman, Ganong and Warzinick discuss home and work, family ceremonies and celebrations, parenting and children, divorce and single-parent homes, gay and lesbian families, as well as cooking and meals, urban vs. suburban homes, and ethnic and minority families. Reference resources include a timeline, sources for further reading, photographs and an index. Volumes in the Family Life in America series focus on the day-to-day lives and roles of families throughout history. The roles of all family members are defined and information on daily family life, the role of the family in society, and the ever-changing definition of the term family' are discussed. Discussion of the nuclear family, single parent homes, foster and adoptive families, stepfamilies, and gay and lesbian families are included where appropriate. Topics such as meal planning, homes, entertainment and celebrations, are discussed along with larger social issues that originate in the home like domestic violence, child abuse and neglect, and divorce. Ideal for students and general readers alike, books in this series bring the history of everyday people to life.",History,345,N/A,0,en

Natural Kingdoms,Rajan Sankaran,Penguin UK,2014-09-15,"In this book, Dr Rajan Sankaran explores why a single pattern repeats itself through every sphere of an individual’s life, despite every effort to change it. Using the Sensation Method of diagnosis, Dr Sankaran explains that an individual’s perception of stress is shaped by an inner pattern, or song, which is connected to one of the three kingdoms in nature—animal, plant or mineral. This fundamental identification can be used by homeopaths to cure ailments at their root. Insightful, approachable and lucid, Natural Kingdoms demonstrates how awareness of your inner song can reduce stress, and bring about better health and harmony in your life.","Body, Mind & Spirit",231,N/A,0,en

Getting it Right @60,Bipin Gupta,Sankalp Publication,2020-10,"“Getting it Right@60” - A Common Man’s Perspective There are a lot of books available on life after retirement but I wanted to write one from the perspective of a common man. This is a book for every Common Man who is already retired or retiring. Common Man is conceived as one from the middle class, a person who has spent all this time in doing his job diligently and honestly but in this process could not pursue his hobbies. He could as well not nurture well his family and personal relationships, despite a strong inclination and all resources at his disposal. While definition of Hobby is so wide, encompassing anything and everything, it is at the same time, difficult to identify one’s hobby at-least amongst middle class Indians, for giving it its due after he is retiring. At this stage of life, most of them are unaware about the areas which give them passion and enchantment. This book will help readers from middle class society, address this dilemma. An attempt has also been made to address issues of various fears in the mind of retiring persons as regards their health, finances, uncaring children, unsettled children, sexlessness, loneliness etc. Once retired, with all the time in the world, and limited responsibilities, sometimes, we find ourselves lost in search of purpose. This book will address this aspect of dilemma also. It is endeavoured that each page of this book connects well with senior citizens and interests them. I would not claim that my readers will find some startling revelations about happy retired life from this short book, but I am confident that once a reader reads this, he will be better equipped to lead a more fulfilling retired life. I hope my honest attempt will provide readers with inspiration and zeal to re-prioritise their journey of life, and take retirement as a chosen milestone to start attending to one’s non lucrative but highly satisfying pursuits.",Juvenile Nonfiction,167,N/A,0,en

Hobbies For Men,D. L. Haley,N/A,2019-11-09,"Revised for 2019. Now with 108 hobbies for manly men. GREAT GIFT UNDER 10 DOLLARS With black and white pictures in the print edition and reduced price A hobby gives a man freedom to pursue his passions and is an outlet for the facets of life that are not stimulated by career or personal obligations. Pursuing a manly hobby says you are a guy with a sense of adventure and the desire to expand his creative forces. The measure of manliness is very subjective. Is it defined by physical strength? Confidence? Compassion? Intelligence? No matter your thoughts, most of us can probably agree that at least in some measure a man is defined by what he does. Work and family, of course, are likely the things that occupy most of a man's time but then there are activities that are an outlet for other talents and creativity - his hobbies. A hobby gives a man freedom to pursue his passions and is an outlet for the facets of life that are not stimulated by career or personal obligations.

Talent in Action,Georges Anthoon,Lannoo Uitgeverij,2007-12-17,"This is the perfect book to turn your career and your life into a success. Every active professional, whether just graduated or in the middle or at the end of his career, needs to have this book on his or her bedside table. It is quite unique that an active manager and staff director delves into his personal font of wisdom and gives away all his secrets and tricks. Georges Anthoon hands out tactics and strategies to steer your career into the direction that you yourself want. He warns for pitfalls and risks and showers you with countless tips and tricks to avoid misfortune. At the same time he explains how you can avoid stress at work and how private happiness and professional success can be matched. Thanks to an abundance of personal stories complete with testimonies of colleagues this book will not bore you for one second. Georges Anthoon gives you the chance to have a peek into an experienced HR-manager's head. His approach is surprisingly original, every bit of information a source of enrichment. The feelgood@work and feelgood@life toolboxes should encourage you to get going yourself. Two chapters have been written for specific target groups: executives or people managers, and ambitious high-potentials. Georges Anthoon is a director of Human Resources, Intern Communication and Building & Facilities at AXA Belgium, a function he also used to have at Belgacom, Coopers & Lybrand, Shell and AIB-Vinçotte. He also teaches Human Resources, Intern Communication and Change Management at the Vlerick Management School, UAMS Management School and EHSAL. In 2001 he received the HR Manager of the Year Award. 'All in all a no-nonsense book. Interesting for everyone who wants to balance his professional and personal life based on realistic goals, action plans and priorities, rather than just wait and see.' Westlandsche Courant 'Talent in action is an outstandingly entertaining book, that's the least we can say. The fact is that author Georges Anthoon draws from his own experience and motives. He interlaces his story with lots of 'asides', illustrative anecdotes of colleagues, staff members, friends. All this makes it a pleasure to read.' HR Magazine",,290,N/A,0,en

The criticisms and estimates of the different players' abilities, except in cases where credit is given, are the author's own. The biographical facts, interviews, and anecdotes were obtained from various sources. They have in all cases been carefully verified, and the imaginings of the press agent have been scrupulously ruled out. In selecting the list of persons to be considered in the work, those actors most prominent on the American stage today were given the preference, and consequently it was found necessary to omit a number whose past achievements give them high rank in their profession. - v. 1 Preface.",Actors,416,N/A,0,en

Index Data Structures in Object-Oriented Databases,"Thomas A. Mueck, Martin L. Polaschek",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Object-oriented database management systems (OODBMS) are used to imple ment and maintain large object databases on persistent storage. Regardless whether the underlying database model follows the object-oriented, the rela tional or the object-relational paradigm, a key feature of any DBMS product is content based access to data sets. On the one hand this feature provides user-friendly query interfaces based on predicates to describe the desired data. On the other hand it poses challenging questions regarding DBMS design and implementation as well as the application development process on top of the DBMS. The reason for the latter is that the actual query performance depends on a technically meaningful use of access support mechanisms. In particular, if chosen and applied properly, such a mechanism speeds up the execution of predicate based queries. In the object-oriented world, such queries may involve arbitrarily complex terms referring to inheritance hierarchies and aggregation paths. These features are attractive at the application level, however, they increase the complexity of appropriate access support mechanisms which are known to be technically non-trivial in the relational world.",Computers,186,N/A,0,en

The Structure of the Relational Database Model,"Jan Paredaens, Paul De Bra, Marc Gyssens, Dirk van Gucht",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This book presents an overview of the most fundamental aspects of the theory that underlies the Relational Database Model. As such it is self-contained though experience with formal models and abstract data manipulating on the one hand and with the practical use of a relational system on the other hand can help the reader. Such experience will offer the reader a better understanding of and a motivation for the different concepts, theories and results mentioned in the book. We have focussed on the most basic concepts and aspects of the relational model, without trying to give a complete overview of the state of the art of database theory. Recently a lot of books on databases in general and on the relational model in particular have been published. Most of them describe the use of database systems. 'Some clarify how information has to be structured and organized before it can be used to build applications. Others help the user in writing down his applications or in finding tricky ways to optimize the running time or the necessary space. Another category of books treat more fundamental and more general aspects such as the description of the relational model, independent of any implementation, the decomposition in normal forms or the global design of distributed databases. Few, however, are the books that describe in a formal way some of the subjects mentioned above.",Computers,242,N/A,0,en
"To Every Parent, To Every School","V Raghunathan, Meena Raghunathan",Penguin Random House India Private Limited,2024-05-31,"As cliched as it may sound, the world is rapidly changing. Preparing our children for the challenges that these changes may bring in their wake is non-negotiable. Preparation isn’t just about acquiring specific knowledge or skills, as we can’t predict the challenges ahead. What is essential is cultivating attitudes and mindsets that enable us to confront whatever obstacles lie ahead. To Every Parent, To Every School addresses the challenges posed by our swiftly changing VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous) world. It goes beyond mere knowledge acquisition or curriculum revisions, which are necessary and continuous processes; nor is it about swapping topics in and out of curricula. While these adjustments are necessary, they aren’t sufficient. What is crucial is empowering our children with the capacity to anticipate and adapt to rapid changes as they occur. The authors, both veteran educators and thought leaders, offer a variety of insights and action points making this book a valuable addition to the library of every parent and school.",Education,294,N/A,0,en

Critical Literacy Approach to English as a Foreign Language,Nizar Kamal Ibrahim,Springer Nature,2022-06-13,"This book discusses how to approach critical literacy in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) contexts. It responds to the concerns of educators who get enthusiastic about teaching critical literacy, but become perplexed when they start reading about its theories. This causes some to avoid it altogether and leads others to argue for practicing it without theory. The book argues that both positions should be reconsidered and capitalizes on the notion of praxis, a notion introduced by Freire to explicate the various subtle connections between theory and practice. The book instills the theoretical assumptions of critical literacy with as little jargon as possible, with many practical illustrations. It will be of interest to graduate and undergraduate students, language teachers, program and material developers, researchers, and educational policy makers.",Education,173,N/A,0,en

Abandoned at three—whose parents want a kid who sees ghosts?—I learned the world is quick to punish misfits. I try my best to be a normal, boring human, but the call of the supernatural just won't be ignored. When a stranger shows up on my doorstep in the middle of the night, it's no sexy tryst. Instead, I'm off to the graveyard, digging up the corpse of a murder victim at the demand of the local vampire coven—and that small felony is just the start. The spirit of the woman has gone missing—something that shouldn't be possible—and everyone is looking to me for answers. There's Kase, a vampire who's both terrifying and secretive. Grant, a mage with a bad attitude and a lot of power. Troy, the possessive werewolf-detective next door and Hunter, a mysterious bad boy who isn't even close to human. It's a race not just against time but against everything to figure out where the spirits are going, who's behind it and if I can trust the men who now share my bed. And all because of a little grave robbing...",Fiction,226,N/A,0,en

The Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death,Corinne May Botz,"The Monacelli Press, LLC",2004-09-28,"The Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death offers readers an extraordinary glimpse into the mind of a master criminal investigator. Frances Glessner Lee, a wealthy grandmother, founded the Department of Legal Medicine at Harvard in 1936 and was later appointed captain in the New Hampshire police. In the 1940s and 1950s she built dollhouse crime scenes based on real cases in order to train detectives to assess visual evidence. Still used in forensic training today, the eighteen Nutshell dioramas, on a scale of 1:12, display an astounding level of detail: pencils write, window shades move, whistles blow, and clues to the crimes are revealed to those who study the scenes carefully. Corinne May Botz's lush color photographs lure viewers into every crevice of Frances Lee's models and breathe life into these deadly miniatures, which present the dark side of domestic life, unveiling tales of prostitution, alcoholism, and adultery. The accompanying line drawings, specially prepared for this volume, highlight the noteworthy forensic evidence in each case. Botz's introductory essay, which draws on archival research and interviews with Lee's family and police colleagues, presents a captivating portrait of Lee.",Social Science,226,N/A,0,en

Hooked,Sutton Foster,Hachette UK,2021-10-12,"From the 2-time Tony Award-winner and the star of TV’s Younger, funny and intimate stories and reflections about how crafting has kept her sane while navigating the highs and lows of family, love, and show business (and how it can help you, too). Whether she’s playing an “age-defying” book editor on television or dazzling audiences on the Broadway stage, Sutton Foster manages to make it all look easy. How? Crafting. From the moment she picked up a cross stitch needle to escape the bullying chorus girls in her early performing days, she was hooked. Cross stitching led to crocheting, crocheting led to collages, which led to drawing, and so much more. Channeling her emotions into her creations centered Sutton as she navigated the significant moments in her life and gave her tangible reminders of her experiences. Now, in this charming and poignant collection, Sutton shares those moments, including her fraught relationship with her agoraphobic mother; a painful divorce splashed on the pages of the tabloids; her struggles with fertility; the thrills she found on the stage during hit plays like Thoroughly Modern Millie, Anything Goes, and Violet; her breakout TV role in Younger; and the joy of adopting her daughter, Emily. Accompanying the stories, Sutton has included crochet patterns, recipes, and so much more! Witty and poignant, Hooked will leave readers entertained as well as inspire them to pick up their own cross stitch needles and paintbrushes.",Biography & Autobiography,209,N/A,0,en

It’s time to rethink our perspectives on money and possessions. In this thoroughly researched classic, Randy Alcorn shows us how to view these things accurately—as God’s provision for our good, the good of others, and his glory. Alcorn presents a biblical and comprehensive view of money and possessions, including the following: Why is money so important to God? Is prosperity theology right or wrong? How can we be liberated from materialism? What should we do about debt? How much does God want us to give? How can we best help the poor and reach the lost? What about gambling? Investing? Insurance? Saving? Retirement? Inheritance? How can we leave our children a true heritage? How can we use money in ways that God rewards? This practical and refreshing theology of money contains topical and Scripture indexes, a study guide, and five helpful appendices.",Religion,495,N/A,0,en

The American Reader,Paulo Sergio Santos Negrete,Clube de Autores,2021-07-18,"Welcome to Suggestopedia and the New developments of Neuroscience This wonderful method, which has its origins in the science of Suggestology, accelerates the learning process up to 10 times more than any conventional method. It has several positive by-products, such as psychotherapeutic and psychohygienic effects in the Suggestopedic environment created in the classroom. During my years of teaching English as a foreign Language, I could never accept the fact that my students needed so many years to start speaking a new language with confidence. Some others, even with years of study and dedication could not develop, despite my efforts to create better classes and activities. Others had constantly to review the verb to be . The results? The students were afraid of speaking and learning. Many people may ask: But how can it be possible to learn effectively in a short time? What s the secret? Others say: That s impossible! It is just propaganda! But actually, we are beings with an incredible power to learn, but the Social Suggestive Norms so present in our pedagogical system for centuries dictates how much we can learn and how long we need to. But I ask you: How did we learn our mother language? How could our brain collect, organize, understand and reproduce words and sentences when we were children? No one went to school to learn to speak. Our parents or who may have raised us never taught us grammar in order to make us speak. We can realize that we are missing something in our system of foreign language teaching. It does not use the resources available in our brain/mind. Our way of teaching in the present is not structured to follow the way the brain receives stores and processes information. So, why not to change the whole system? The answer is quite simple. Who wants to train teachers? Change textbooks and methods? How long would it take? But the fact is that more scientists are discovering what Dr. Lozanov did decades ago when he didn t have the technology we have today. Our researchers have noticed that our system is not the best approach to learn. That s why so many so-called accelerated learning systems or brain-friendly approaches have appeared. The main problem is that most of them have never been really tested. They have not had a follow up for decades to check if they would not harm the students. Suggestopedia is the ONLY method that had a scientific and medical background. Before publishing his results Dr. Lozanov accompanied his students for 10 years to be sure that nobody would have any negative by-product. On the contrary, his students became healthier and more intelligent. Prof. Paulo Negrete Academic Director Certified in Desuggestive Pedagogy",Foreign Language Study,318,N/A,0,en

The Yin-Yang Military,"Jacqueline Heeren-Bogers, René Moelker, Esmeralda Kleinreesink, Jan Van der Meulen, Joseph Soeters, Robert Beeres",Springer Nature,2020-09-07,"This book examines change processes and the challenge of ambidexterity in military organizations. It discusses how military organizations can better adapt to the complex, and at times chaotic, environments they operate in by developing organizational ambidexterity. The authors identify various multiple tasks and functions of military organizations that require multi-dimensional and often contradictory operational, technological, cultural, and social skills. In analogy to the often-opposed functions performed by the right and left hand of the body, modern military organizations are no longer one-dimensional fighting machines, but characterized by a duality of tasks, such as fighting and peacekeeping which often make part and parcel of one and the same mission. The military is both a “hot” and a “cold” organization (a crisis management organization and a bureaucracy). As such, the book argues that these dualities are not necessarily opposed but can serve as complementary forces, like the yin and yang, to better the overall performance of these organizations. As a consequence, ambidextrous organizations excel at complex tasking and are adaptable to new challenges. Divided into four parts: 1) structures and networks; 2) cultural issues; 3) tasks and roles; 4) nations and allies, it appeals to scholars of military studies and organization studies as well as professionals working for governmental or military organizations.",Political Science,247,N/A,0,en

Postmodifying Attributive Adjectives in English,Lars M. Blöhdorn,Peter Lang,2009,"This study investigates three different postmodifying adjective constructions in the English language. While English adjectives generally precede the entities they modify, they may also occur in postmodifying position. This study assumes that the different postmodifying constructions are a positional variation of attributive premodification. The support for this claim is derived from a detailed analysis of the general syntax and semantics of adjectives as well as a cross-check of previous theories with a wide range of actual language examples taken from computerized corpora. An approach from the Prague School 'Functional Sentence Perspective' enables this study to accomplish an integrated view of adjectival postmodification.",Foreign Language Study,224,N/A,0,en

Handbook of Behavior Therapy in Education,"S.N. Elliott, F. Gresham, J.C. Witt",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-11-11,"What do we know about behavioral analysis and intervention in educational settings? Given that educational institutions were among the first to embrace the new technology of behavior change in the late 1950s and early 1960s, it is apparent that we have had the opportunity to learn a great deal. The evolution of the field of behavior therapy has witnessed a change in the behavior therapist from an adolescent fascination with repeatedly demonstrating the effectiveness of the new technology to a mature recognition of the complex implications of the behav ioral paradigm for individuals, systems, and society. Many ""facts"" now taken for granted were considered impossibilities a mere two decades ago. In her 1986 presidential address to Division 25 of the American Psychological Association, Beth Sulzer-Azaroff reviewed a number of changes in attitude in education that were strongly influenced by behavior therapy. Most educators now agree that (a) everyone can learn, (b) complex skills can be taught, (c) precise, general, and durable performance can be taught, and (d) barriers to learning can be overcome. In addition, we would add that behavior therapy is being applied to increasingly more complex human problems, such as social skill deficits, internalizing disorders, and dysfunctional systems and organizations.",Psychology,832,N/A,0,en

Fostering Social Work Gerontology Competence,"Catherine J. Tompkins, Anita L. rosen",Routledge,2013-12-19,"Inspire the next generation of gerontological social workers The growing number of people over the age of 65 in the United States has increased the demand for social workers who are trained to work with the elderly—a demand that’s in danger of not being met. Fostering Social Work Gerontology Competence presents innovative techniques and strategies to help educators infuse aging content into their graduate and undergraduate curriculums in an effort to produce a new generation of social work practitioners who are up to the task of working with an older population. Recent surveys show that there has been a decline in the number of aging specialties and courses offered by schools of social work. Fostering Social Work Gerontology Competence offers a renewed focus on the promotion of gerontological social work education, presenting papers that grew out of the first National Gerontological Social Work Conference (NGSWC), held in 2003. This unique book is invaluable to anyone who educates future social workers, leads staff training sessions, and/or teaches continuing education courses on aging. Leading gerontologists examine teaching research, community collaboration, and social work competencies, while focusing on special populations and issues including end-of-life care, elder abuse, grief counseling, cultural diversity, cultural competence, and the effects of spirituality and social support on the well being of the elderly. Fostering Social Work Gerontology Competence examines: curricular and organizational change developing intergenerational projects involving older persons in the educational process uniting field practice with theory strategies to promote student interest identifying geriatric competencies intergenerational service learning developing an aging prepared community emerging trends in aging and health care end-of-life care and death education environmental issues affecting elder abuse victims mental health services for older persons in rural communities kinship care and much more Fostering Social Work Gerontology Competence is a vital resource for social work educators and practitioners, gerontology educators and practitioners, and students.",Medical,518,N/A,0,en

Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth Through Age 8,"National Research Council, Institute of Medicine, Board on Children, Youth, and Families, Committee on the Science of Children Birth to Age 8: Deepening and Broadening the Foundation for Success",National Academies Press,2015-07-23,"Children are already learning at birth, and they develop and learn at a rapid pace in their early years. This provides a critical foundation for lifelong progress, and the adults who provide for the care and the education of young children bear a great responsibility for their health, development, and learning. Despite the fact that they share the same objective - to nurture young children and secure their future success - the various practitioners who contribute to the care and the education of children from birth through age 8 are not acknowledged as a workforce unified by the common knowledge and competencies needed to do their jobs well. Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth Through Age 8 explores the science of child development, particularly looking at implications for the professionals who work with children. This report examines the current capacities and practices of the workforce, the settings in which they work, the policies and infrastructure that set qualifications and provide professional learning, and the government agencies and other funders who support and oversee these systems. This book then makes recommendations to improve the quality of professional practice and the practice environment for care and education professionals. These detailed recommendations create a blueprint for action that builds on a unifying foundation of child development and early learning, shared knowledge and competencies for care and education professionals, and principles for effective professional learning. Young children thrive and learn best when they have secure, positive relationships with adults who are knowledgeable about how to support their development and learning and are responsive to their individual progress. Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth Through Age 8 offers guidance on system changes to improve the quality of professional practice, specific actions to improve professional learning systems and workforce development, and research to continue to build the knowledge base in ways that will directly advance and inform future actions. The recommendations of this book provide an opportunity to improve the quality of the care and the education that children receive, and ultimately improve outcomes for children.",Social Science,587,N/A,0,en

Spanish Sentence Builders - A Lexicogrammar Approach,"Dylan Viñales, Gianfranco Conti",Independently Published,2021-05,"This is the newly updated SECOND EDITION! This version has been fully re-checked for accuracy and re-formatted to make it even more user-friendly, following feedback after a full year of classroom use by thousands of teachers across the world. Spanish Sentence Builders is a workbook aimed at beginner to pre-intermediate students co-authored by two modern languages educators with over 40 years of extensive classroom experience between the two, both in the UK and internationally. This 'no-frills' book contains 19 units of work on very popular themes, jam-packed with graded vocabulary-building, reading, translation, retrieval practice and writing activities. Key vocabulary, lexical patterns and structures are recycled and interleaved throughout. Each unit includes: 1) A sentence builder modelling the target constructions; 2) A set of vocabulary building activities; 3) A set of narrow reading texts exploited through a range of tasks focusing on both the meaning and structural levels of the text; 4) A set of retrieval-practice translation tasks; 5) A set of writing tasks targeting essential micro-skills such as spelling, lexical retrieval, syntax, editing and communication of meaning. Based on the Extensive Processing Instruction (E.P.I.) principle that learners learn best from comprehensible and highly patterned input flooded with the target linguistic features, the authors have carefully designed each and every text and activity to enable the student to process and produce each item many times over. This occurs throughout each unit of work as well as in smaller grammar, vocabulary and question-skills micro-units located at regular intervals in the book, which aim at reinforcing the understanding and retention of the target grammar, vocabulary and question patterns.",,194,N/A,0,en

Poor But Spritied In Karimnagar,Sumita Dawra,Harper Collins,2013-12-01,"The difficulty of finding solutions After six decades of policy-making and planning that appear perfect on paper, vast pockets of poverty persist across the country, accompanied by low human development indices. In Poor but Spirited in Karimnagar, Sumita Dawra recounts her experiences as collector in the district of Karimnagar in Andhra Pradesh, and grapples with the question of why even with crores of rupees of government funding, well-meaning implementing agencies and constructive action, this wide gap between intention and results continues. The stories cover diverse populations, from child labour to cotton farmers, from coal miners to malnourished power loom weavers. They traverse the thick Naxal-infested forests, course along the Godavari, and meander through the 'multiple urban worlds' of Ramagundem and the dry upland areas of Sircilla, examining the key issues that need to be addressed. Each chapter, divided into three sections - identifying the problem, providing the context, and offering the solution, along with a useful statistical guide that provides a quick overview - looks at the key points of lacunae in service delivery in the concerned areas and provides a starting point for a more effective engagement in the tackling of the problems. Based on successful models of governance within the country and elsewhere, this book from a seasoned bureaucrat offers a fresh, contemporary perspective on administration and governance.",Political Science,206,5,1,en

"Vague Language, Elasticity Theory and the Use of ‘Some’","Grace Qiao Zhang, Nhu Nguyet Le",Bloomsbury Publishing,2018-06-28,"In Vague Language, Elasticity Theory and the Use of 'Some', Nguyet Nhu Le and Grace Qiao Zhang present the first comprehensive study of the word 'some', focusing on its elasticity. In particular, they consider how 'some' is both a quantifier and a qualifier, has positive or negative meanings, and has local and global interpretations. They show that the word is used across a meaning continuum and can be used to convey a range of states, including approximation, uncertainty, politeness, and evasion. Finally, they demonstrate that the functions of 'some' are also multi-directional and non-categorical, consisting of four major functions (right amount of information, mitigation, withholding information, and discourse management). Based on naturally-occurring classroom data of L1 (American English) and L2 (Chinese- and Vietnamese-speaking learners of English) speakers, Vague Language shows that L2 speakers used 'some' more than L1 speakers and explores the significance of this, particularly taking account of speakers' language ability and cultural backgrounds. While this book focuses on the single word 'some', the authors' discussion has important implications for language studies more generally, as they call for a rethinking of our approaches to language study and more attention to its elasticity.",Language Arts & Disciplines,217,N/A,0,en

Lexical Availability in English and Spanish as a Second Language,Rosa María Jiménez Catalán,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-09-06,"​ This volume contributes to the research in two different research areas: lexical availability studies and vocabulary research in second or foreign languages. Lexical availability is defined as the words that immediately come to mind as a response to a stimulus provided by topics related to domains closely connected to daily life: for instance animals, food and drink, daily activities, politics, or poverty. Lexical availability is a dimension of learners’ receptive and productive lexical competence, and, consequently, an important variable of learners’ communicative competence. Written by leading researchers in Spanish and English applied linguistics, the studies presented in this volume offer the reader findings and insights from studies conducted in learners with different mother tongues, who learn English or Spanish as their second or third language. “This book made me aware of an approach to vocabulary acquisition which has a long tradition in European research, but has been somewhat neglected by English-speaking researchers. The methodology was pioneered in France where it developed into the Francais Fondamental project - an influential approach to the vocabulary needs of learners of French. It was also taken up by Spanish researchers, and more recently developed by the team at La Rioja University. Where English-language research has focused on the frequency of words in large corpora and the implications of this feature for L2 vocabulary acquisition, the lexical availability tradition takes a much more learner-centred approach to L2 vocabulary skills, directly reflecting learners' needs and learners' ability to do things with small, effective vocabularies. This leads to a set of research priorities that look refreshingly different from the ones we are used to. Read this book. It might change the way you think about vocabulary research.” Paul Meara, Swansea University, Wales, UK",Education,213,N/A,0,en

Concreteness and Specificity in Clinical Psychology,Luciano L'Abate,Springer,2015-04-10,"This provocative volume updates L' Abate's signature ideas, focusing in particular on the concepts of concreteness and specificity as basic tenets of evaluation and therapy. Noting society's growing familiarity with technology, current concerns about treatment accessibility, and widespread interest in wellness promotion, he argues for remote-writing exercises targeted to specific client issues and monitored by the clinician instead of relying on traditional talk-based therapy. This attention to concreteness and specificity in baseline evaluation, post-treatment evaluation, and follow-up, the author asserts, is central to making treatment replicable, less subject to impasses or missteps, and more professional, with the potential of changing how therapy is conducted as well as how clinicians are trained and practice. The book's framework includes rationales, models, empirical data, and examples of prescriptive remote-writing exercises. Featured in the coverage: Online interventions: here to stay and to grow. Verifiability in clinical psychology practices. Present status and future perspectives for personality and family assessment. Practice without theory/combining theory with practice. Toward a unifying framework of human relationships PIPES: Programmed Interactive Practice Exercise and Prescriptions. Concreteness and Specificity in Clinical Psychology will bring a new level of discussion and debate among clinical psychology practitioners and practicing psychotherapists in private practice and the public sector.",Psychology,363,N/A,0,en

Business Organization,"Dr. Sunita Chauhan, Dr. Priyanka Singh, Dr. Namrata Gupta",Navi International Book Publication house,2024-08-22,"Business organization refers to the structured arrangement of people, processes, and resources within a company aimed at achieving specific goals and objectives. It encompasses the formulation and implementation of strategies to efficiently allocate resources, optimize productivity, and enhance competitiveness in the marketplace. Various types of business organizations exist, including sole proprietorships, partnerships, corporations, and limited liability companies, each with distinct legal and operational frameworks. The choice of a business organization impacts several factors, such as liability, taxation, and the ability to raise capital. For instance, corporations offer limited liability to their shareholders and are capable of raising significant capital through the sale of stock, but they also face double taxation on earnings. In contrast, sole proprietorships and partnerships offer simplicity and pass-through taxation but expose owners to unlimited liability. Effective business organization involves clear communication, well-defined roles and responsibilities, and efficient decision-making processes. It also requires adaptability to respond to changes in the external environment, such as technological advancements, regulatory shifts, and evolving consumer preferences. The role of leadership and management is crucial in steering the organization towards its strategic objectives while fostering a culture of innovation and continuous improvement",Business & Economics,253,N/A,0,en

Understanding the Purpose and Power of Men,Myles Munroe,Whitaker House,2017-06-06,"The male is in crisis. Traditional roles once gave men stability and continuity from generation to generation. Today, the world is sending out conflicting signals about what it means to be a man. Many men are questioning who they are and what roles they fulfill in life—as a male, a husband, and a father—leaving them frustrated and causing them to live far below their potential. Best-selling author Dr. Myles Munroe examines cultural attitudes toward men and addresses critical issues such as: How can men gain their footing in the ever-shifting environment of cultural expectations? What does it mean to be male? What definition of masculinity should men adopt? What roles should men fulfill-in the workplace and in the home? What do gender roles have to do with the male's purpose? What are the differences between males and females? How are men and women meant to relate to one another? How can a man build a better life for himself, his family, and the world? When men understand the purpose God has given them and the true design of their relationship with women, they will be free to fulfill their destiny and potential.

ENGLISH FOR SECRETARY AND OFFICE STAFF A PRACTICAL GUIDE FOR PROFESSIONALS,"Dr. Sayit Abdul Karim, S.Pd., M.Pd., Laely Nur Fadillah",Cipta Media Nusantara,N/A,"According to Wiktionary, the word ‘secretary’ comes from Latin word ‘secretarius’ which means a confidential clerk or secretary. A secretary is a person who maintains a company’s secret documents or files. There are several titles that can be used to refer to a company secretary, including a department secretary, an administrative assistant, a personal secretary, a secretary to the management, a senior secretary or an executive secretary. Secretary is considered to be one of the most significant roles in any company. It seems that a busy employer hires a secretary to help with overload work. Her role is to facilitate the management’s ability to perform the truly critical tasks. As a result, a good secretary needs to be adaptable, skilled, precise, efficient, and always eager to learn new things.",Bibles,196,N/A,0,en
Adult Learning and Relationships,"Paris S. Strom, Robert D. Strom",IAP,2011-04-01,"The communication and technology revolution presents each age group of adults with new expectations for learning. This book describes how education for young adults (20 to 40 years of age), persons of middle age (40 to 60 years of age) and older adults (age 60 +) can be differentiated to fulfill changing role demands emerging in response to social transformation. Developmental tasks for a society of longevity are defined including why youth should be seen as essential sources of learning for adults. Themes for each generation are school, work, family, and personal identity. The way to ensure consideration of cultural evolution and cultural preservation is for intergenerational communication to become a common obligation. Reliance on age-segregated communication is popular and comfortable because peer conversations have greater agreement and less uncertainty. However, this practice prevents reflection on views regarded as important by other age groups. When greater amounts of time are devoted to intergenerational dialogue, the usual outcomes are reciprocal learning, mutual respect, and harmony. This book identifies and elaborates the conditions of learning needed to motivate an age-integrated society. This book is for several audiences. Faculty and students studying development will find insights on learning at successive ages. Counselors will learn about client needs across the full age range of adulthood. Social service providers will recognize transition in family relationships. Nurses and administrators will discover ways to help assisted living residents maintain mental abilities and build social networks.

Game Wizards,Jon Peterson,MIT Press,2021-10-12,"The story of the arcane table-top game that became a pop culture phenomenon and the long-running legal battle waged by its cocreators. When Dungeons & Dragons was first released to a small hobby community, it hardly seemed destined for mainstream success--and yet this arcane tabletop role-playing game became an unlikely pop culture phenomenon. In Game Wizards, Jon Peterson chronicles the rise of Dungeons & Dragons from hobbyist pastime to mass market sensation, from the initial collaboration to the later feud of its creators, Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. As the game's fiftieth anniversary approaches, Peterson--a noted authority on role-playing games--explains how D&D and its creators navigated their successes, setbacks, and controversies. Peterson describes Gygax and Arneson's first meeting and their work toward the 1974 release of the game; the founding of TSR and its growth as a company; and Arneson's acrimonious departure and subsequent challenges to TSR. He recounts the ""Satanic Panic"" accusations that D&D was sacrilegious and dangerous, and how they made the game famous. And he chronicles TSR's reckless expansion and near-fatal corporate infighting, which culminated with the company in debt and overextended and the end of Gygax's losing battle to retain control over TSR and D&D. With Game Wizards, Peterson restores historical particulars long obscured by competing narratives spun by the one-time partners. That record amply demonstrates how the turbulent experience of creating something as momentous as Dungeons & Dragons can make people remember things a bit differently from the way they actually happened.",Games & Activities,401,N/A,0,en

The Evolution of the Future,Frank W.

He asserts that simple trend analysis is devoid of both explicit theory and any sense of history, for while eschewing historical or theoretical frameworks, the futurist is free to select or create trends from singular events that correspond to personal hopes or fears. The volume evaluates futurist projections in terms of their consistency with history and theory and concludes that the processes of technological development are rooted in our industrial past and present.",Business & Economics,168,N/A,0,en

Predicting Personality,"Drew D'Agostino, Greg Skloot",John Wiley & Sons,2019-11-12,"The ultimate playbook for using artificial intelligence to communicate effectively, build teams, and win customers Not long ago, we imagined a hyper-connected world full of trust and openness—a world where effortless communication would bring about a new understanding between people everywhere. Judging from our current environment, this vision of the future may have been overly optimistic. With infinite channels and countless voices flooding them with messages, most people have become highly skeptical and guarded by necessity. As a result, communication is much harder than ever before. Despite the unprecedented connectivity enabled by modern technology, we are far less likely to trust and to invest the time needed to build strong relationships. How can we use technology to reverse this trend? A groundbreaking new branch of artificial intelligence—Personality AI—may be the answer. Combining traditional machine learning, data analytics, and behavioral psychology, Personality AI helps professional communicators tear down walls, establish trust with their audiences, and utilize data to build meaningful relationships, strengthen empathy, and win more customers. Predicting Personality is a practical, real-world playbook for any individual or business whose success hinges on the ability to communicate effectively and build teams. Authors Drew D’Agostino and Greg Skloot—CEO and President, respectively, of Crystal, the app that tells you anyone's personality—show you how businesses can leverage Personality AI and machine learning to grow faster and communicate more effectively than was previously possible. This reader-friendly guide teaches you what Personality AI is, how it works, and demonstrates its practical applications in both life and business. This book: ● Explains how to understand personality types in various contexts, including sales, recruiting, coaching ● Provides guidelines for using personality data to learn and execute ● Explores ethics and compliance considerations surrounding the use of Personality AI ● Offers valuable insights from a leader in the business applications of Personality AI Predicting Personality: Using AI to Understand People and Win More Business is a must-have guide for C-suite executives, sales and marketing professionals, coaches, recruiters, and business owners.",Business & Economics,254,N/A,0,en

How Stella Got Her Groove Back,Terry McMillan,Penguin,2004-01-06,"How Stella Got Her Groove Back is full of Terry McMillan's signature humor, heart, and insight. More than a love story, it is ultimately a novel about how a woman saves her own life—and what she must risk to do it. Stella Payne is forty-two, divorced, a high-powered investment analyst, mother of eleven-year-old Quincy- and she does it all. In fact, if she doesn't do it, it doesn't get done, from Little League carpool duty to analyzing portfolios to folding the laundry and bringing home the bacon. She does it all well, too, if her chic house, personal trainer, BMW, and her loving son are any indication. So what if there's been no one to share her bed with lately, let alone rock her world? Stella doesn't mind it too much; she probably wouldn't have the energy for love—and all of love's nasty fallout—anyway. But when Stella takes a spur-of-the-moment vacation to Jamaica, her world gets rocked to the core—not just by the relaxing effects of the sun and sea and an island full of attractive men, but by one man in particular. He's tall, lean, soft-spoken, Jamaican, smells of citrus and the ocean—and is half her age. The tropics have cast their spell and Stella soon realizes she has come to a cataclysmic juncture: not only must she confront her hopes and fears about love, she must question all of her expectations, passions, and ideas about life and the way she has lived it.",Fiction,417,4,1,en

The Attention Merchants,Tim Wu,Vintage,2017-09-19,"From the author of the award-winning The Master Switch, who coined the term ""net neutrality”—a revelatory, ambitious and urgent account of how the capture and re-sale of human attention became the defining industry of our time. ""Dazzling."" —Financial Times Ours is often called an information economy, but at a moment when access to information is virtually unlimited, our attention has become the ultimate commodity. In nearly every moment of our waking lives, we face a barrage of efforts to harvest our attention. This condition is not simply the byproduct of recent technological innovations but the result of more than a century's growth and expansion in the industries that feed on human attention. Wu’s narrative begins in the nineteenth century, when Benjamin Day discovered he could get rich selling newspapers for a penny. Since then, every new medium—from radio to television to Internet companies such as Google and Facebook—has attained commercial viability and immense riches by turning itself into an advertising platform. Since the early days, the basic business model of “attention merchants” has never changed: free diversion in exchange for a moment of your time, sold in turn to the highest-bidding advertiser. Full of lively, unexpected storytelling and piercing insight, The Attention Merchants lays bare the true nature of a ubiquitous reality we can no longer afford to accept at face value.",Business & Economics,434,N/A,0,en

Probable Impossibilities,Alan Lightman,Vintage,2021-02-09,"The acclaimed author of Einstein’s Dreams tackles ""big questions like the origin of the universe and the nature of consciousness ... in an entertaining and easily digestible way” (Wall Street Journal) with a collection of meditative essays on the possibilities—and impossibilities—of nothingness and infinity, and how our place in the cosmos falls somewhere in between. Can space be divided into smaller and smaller units, ad infinitum? Does space extend to larger and larger regions, on and on to infinity? Is consciousness reducible to the material brain and its neurons? What was the origin of life, and can biologists create life from scratch in the lab? Physicist and novelist Alan Lightman, whom The Washington Post has called “the poet laureate of science writers,” explores these questions and more—from the anatomy of a smile to the capriciousness of memory to the specialness of life in the universe to what came before the Big Bang. Probable Impossibilities is a deeply engaged consideration of what we know of the universe, of life and the mind, and of things vastly larger and smaller than ourselves.",Science,209,N/A,0,en

Dark Tales,Shirley Jackson,Penguin,2017-10-10,"For the first time in one volume, a collection of Shirley Jackson’s scariest stories, with a foreword by PEN/Hemingway Award winner Ottessa Moshfegh After the publication of her short story “The Lottery” in the New Yorker in 1948 received an unprecedented amount of attention, Shirley Jackson was quickly established as a master horror storyteller. This collection of classic and newly reprinted stories provides readers with more of her unsettling, dark tales, including the “The Possibility of Evil” and “The Summer People.” In these deliciously dark stories, the daily commute turns into a nightmarish game of hide and seek, the loving wife hides homicidal thoughts and the concerned citizen might just be an infamous serial killer. In the haunting world of Shirley Jackson, nothing is as it seems and nowhere is safe, from the city streets to the crumbling country pile, and from the small-town apartment to the dark, dark woods. There’s something sinister in suburbia. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Serious Leisure,Robert A. Stebbins,Routledge,2017-07-28,"Serious Leisure offers a comprehensive view and analysis of the current state of the sociology of leisure. Defining and differentiating the way people use their free time, Stebbins divides such activity into categories of serious, casual, and project-based leisure that he further separates into a variety of types and subtypes. Together they comprise what he calls serious leisure.In this perspective, serious leisure constitutes systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial and interesting in nature and requiring special skills, knowledge, and experience. Casual leisure, though immediately, intrinsically rewarding, is by contrast a relatively short-lived pleasurable activity, requiring little or no special training to enjoy it. Project-based leisure is a short-term, reasonably complicated, occasional creative undertaking carried out in free time. Stebbins sets out the basic concepts and propositions that make up the three forms, focusing on their essential elements. He takes stock of the serious leisure literature as well as that for casual and project-based leisure.Stebbins sees serious leisure realized by way of a set of foundational concepts--organization, community, history, lifestyle, and culture--and several of their component areas. He reviews the history and background of the concept of serious leisure and then adds historical commentary on, first, casual leisure and, then, project-based leisure. Finally, he examines the future and the importance of the serious leisure perspective in a globalizing world, and some of its critical links with other fields of knowledge and practice, notably the nonprofit sector and preventive medicine.Together with its original insights, Serious Leisure offers a single, handy, coherent, comprehensive resource. It will be of interest to sociologists, labor studies specialists, and economists.",Social Science,184,N/A,0,en

The Behavior of the Earth,Claude J. Allègre,Harvard University Press,1988,"Well over a century after Darwin gave biology its unifying theory of evolution, the earth sciences experienced a similar revolution and the theory of plate tectonics took hold. Plate tectonics posed the idea that the earth's crust is divided into a number of large, thin plates always in motion relative to one another. In The Behavior of the Earth, world-renowned earth scientist Claude Allègre sets forth the exciting events in this contemporary revolution from its first stirrings in the nineteenth-century and Alfred Wegener's original model of continental drift (1912) through the development of its full potential in modern plate-tectonic theory. Few scientific theories have been so all-encompassing, and none has surpassed plate tectonics in explaining such a wide variety of geological phenomena, from the origins of mountain building to the formation of the ocean floor. As it integrated our knowledge of the earth's surface with the investigation of its interior, plate tectonics fused two previously autonomous strains of scientific inquiry. Continental mobility changed for all time our view of the earth from a static globe to an evolving, living planet, and allowed us to see that changes in the earth's surface are but exterior manifestations of a dynamic interplay of forces within the crust and the mantle.Allègre casts his lucid exposition of this scientific theory within the historical context of its struggle for acceptance. As he introduces us to the huge cast of personalities and researchers who contributed to the theory, he illuminates the complex role that the scientific community plays in the proliferation and acceptance of new ideas. Allègre is as insightful in discussing the human motivation for scientific endeavor as he is skillful in presenting the science that results from this effort. Richly illustrated and including a glossary, this book offers the reader rare access both to the central theory of plate tectonics and to the constellation of problems and possibilities that preoccupy earth scientists today.",Science,302,N/A,0,en

The history of intellectual thought abounds with claims that knowledge is valued and sought, yet individuals and groups often choose not to know. We call the conscious choice not to seek or use knowledge (or information) deliberate ignorance. When is this a virtue, when is it a vice, and what can be learned from formally modeling the underlying motives? On which normative grounds can it be judged? Which institutional interventions can promote or prevent it?

The Ethnicity of Neurons : Nationalism a Self-Esteem of Fools,Darko Pozder,Xlibris Corporation,2023-03-06,"Nationalism is nothing less than a psychological self destruction. When one goes beyond the need of identity, a strong sense of security and wellbeing often demonstrates in confidence and self control resulting in showing empathy and trust in others. Trust and empathy unite our societies, while fear, low self esteem, anxiety and primitivism as well as an illusion of control results in new nations, new religions, new states and countries, rarely without bloody wars and human suffering. To conclude, nationalism is nothing more than a self esteem of fools, a very dangerous cognitive or psychological error created by our faulty thinking patterns. So far it caused nothing more than horrible, irreversable and devastating damage to human race. Einstein was wrong when he sad that nationalism is just an infantile disease, in my eyes, nationalism is not only an illusion with no future, it is the cancer to human race. I am shocked by the fact that every second two people die from war conflict around the globe, while cancer takes a life every 14 seconds. Nationalism is constantly promoted and on the rise, even 28 times more deadlier than cancer. As a rational human being I felt the urge to write this book which will hopefully create an impact on the humanity and save lives of many. As mentioned earlier in my previous books, fight against the nature is the mission impossible, however, we all must give our best in that regard. In Hemingway’s novel, The old man and sea, an old fisherman Santiago didn’t give up fighting the nature and I think we should all follow his steps at all costs.",Psychology,160,N/A,0,en

The credit for articulating the topic and presenting is it more dressed manner goes to my mentor, Priyanka Behl.

Psychiatrists will find the logical structure, substantive questions, and thorough explanations provided by the Study Guide for the Psychiatry Board Examination to be as reassuring as they are educational. Although readers are advised to consult a range of resources in preparation for the examination, this guide is indispensable. It is the first and only guide to reflect the revisions contained in DSM-5®, and it will ably assume a primary role in the study and review process. The guide is designed for maximum usefulness, with specific features and attributes to support knowledge recall and successful examination performance. * The authors are from a cross-section of accomplished students, fellows, and junior and senior faculty, all of whom have faced or will face the board examination and who understand its importance to the profession.* Topics were determined by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology Certification Examination in Psychiatry 2015 Content Blueprint.* The approximately 400 questions were formulated from information extracted from widely available American Psychiatric Publishing textbooks and accurately reflect the accepted psychiatric knowledge base.* Each multiple choice question is followed by an explanation of why the correct answer is correct and the others are incorrect, and every question and explanation is referenced, directing the reader to the primary material for more in-depth learning and study.* The volume was designed as a study guide for both the initial psychiatry board examination and the recertification examination. The process of working through the study guide will allow the reader to identify areas of strength and weakness, initiate further study, and test and retest knowledge, ultimately preparing for the examination's rigors. Only the Study Guide for the Psychiatry Board Examination offers support for the new, DSM-5® -- compatible examination, and that alone renders it essential.",Medical,500,N/A,0,en

This genetic difference has resulted in many subsidiary differences that are, among other things, related to grammar. Compared with typologically related languages, cross-linguistic contrast of English and Chinese is more challenging yet promising. The main theme of this book lies in its focus on cross-linguistic contrast of aspect-related grammatical categories, or, grammatical categories that contribute to aspectual meaning – both situation aspect at the semantic level and viewpoint aspect at the grammatical level – in English and Chinese. The unique strength of this volume lies in that it is first corpus-based book contrasting English and Chinese.

Mastering the Power of Your Emotions,Elisha O. Ogbonna,FriesenPress,2014-07-17,"The Greek stoic philosopher Epictetus believed that what happened to an individual was not as important as how that individual reacted to it. Some two thousand years later, Aldous Huxley put it this way: ""Experience is not what happens to you; it's what you do with what happens to you."" It is only when the events and obstacles of the world around us are mapped onto our emotional landscapes that they truly become part of us. To alter your emotional landscape, therefore, is to profoundly alter who you are and who you are capable of becoming. Elisha Ogbonna has spent years delving into the subject of emotions, recognizing that the ability to master your emotions is tantamount to controlling your experience and shaping the world around you. For Ogbonna, the Huxley observation could be fashioned into a simple yet profound goal: controlling what happens in you irrespective of what happens to you. In Mastering the Power of Your Emotions you will be presented with an instructive map of the emotional landscapes so many of us are forced to navigate. Furthermore, you will be introduced to Five Major Laws of Emotion and be afforded insights on how to command your emotions and break old patterns of behaviour and response. Don't live at the mercy of your emotions. Learn to harness your potential and shape your life into an experience worthy of you.",Health & Fitness,171,N/A,0,en

"Being Together, Working Apart","Barbara Schneider, Linda J. Waite",Cambridge University Press,2005-02-24,"Despite the fact that most parents are employed, how work affects the lives and well-being of parents and their children remains relatively unexplored. A recent study of 500 dual-career families in 8 communities across the US provides a holistic view of the complexities of work and family life experienced by parents and their children. Drawing on the study, this book explores how dual-earner families cope with the stresses and demands of balancing work and family life, whether the time parents spend working is negatively affecting their children, how mothers feel managing both work and household responsibilities, and what role fathers are taking in family life. In answering these questions the authors argue for a new balance between work and family life.

Science as a Carreer Choice,"Bernice T. Ediuson, Linda Beckman",Russell Sage Foundation,1973-09-28,"How can we identify the young men and women who, as social and behavioral scientists of tomorrow, will do the needed research to resolve our burgeoning social problems? How can the most promising be attracted to an investigatory career? How can they become identified with the behaviors, attitudes and values that persons in science share? A provocative body of literature about the psychology of the scientist and his career emerged in the post-Sputnik era. Drs. Eiduson and Beckman bring together more than seventy of the most significant and representative studies. These range over childhood and family influences, academic experiences, motivations, interests, and intellectual and personality strengths that have been examined as precursors for choosing science as adult work. The psychological mechanisms involved in socializing a young person toward a scientific career are suggested in readings from the outstanding theoreticians in the field. Selections on scientific career lines, decisions and options at various stages of work, and factors influencing goals and career development contribute to the understanding of the psychological life of the highly endowed and well-functioning professional adult. Through showing the certain completeness of effort of what has been learned about the psychology of scientists to date, the authors anticipate a resurgence of interest in the creative individual, a renewed enthusiasm for application, and a refocusing of research on the issues unique to the social and behavioral research scientist.",Education,752,N/A,0,en

Talking Shop Via E-mail,Seppo Tella,N/A,1992,"The linguistic purposes of this research were to focus on content, themes and topics, and to analyze the way the target language (English) was used in e-mail. Communicativeness and the roles of the communicator (writer-reader) became central, emphasizing the multidirectional character of e-mail communication. The basic tenet of communicativeness and a naturalistic communicative learning environment in classrooms was connected to the question of the degree of initiative and free negotiable topic choice. The research problems included issues concerning content (themes and topics) and language used in e-mail communication. Research methodology was an ethnographic approach complemented by a thematic and linguistic analysis on content and language. The Finnish participants consisted of six classes in three senior secondary schools with four teachers of English. The foreign participants consisted of schools in Britain and the United States with further contacts in Austria, Canada, Germany, Iceland, Japan, and Sweden. Data were gathered during fieldwork (November 1989-May 1990). Results of the study indicated that process-led collaborative e-mail communication encouraged writing and exchanging ideas across the world; a collaborative effort made writing more public, bringing social and negotiation skills into focus; modes of writing became more versatile; e-mail formed a new repository of teaching and learning materials; e-mail written on-line resembled oral communication while off-line writing showed more textual and linguistic coherence and organization; phatic use of language was essential to the functionality of the communication channel; and artistic, emotive, and poetic language was widely used as well as referential or informative use of the target language. Twenty-one of the 98 references are in English. An abstract in Finnish is also provided. (Author/ALF).",Electronic mail messages,320,N/A,0,en

Causes of Delinquency,Travis Hirschi,Routledge,2017-07-28,"In Causes of Delinquency, Hirschi attempts to state and test a theory of delinquency, seeing in the delinquent a person relatively free of the intimate attachments, the aspirations, and the moral beliefs that bind most people to a life within the law. In prominent alternative theories, the delinquent appears either as a frustrated striver forced into delinquency by his acceptance of the goals common to us all, or as an innocent foreigner attempting to obey the rules of a society that is not in position to make the law or define conduct as good or evil. Hirschi analyzes a large body of data on delinquency collected in Western Contra Costa County, California, contrasting throughout the assumptions of the strain, control, and cultural deviance theories. He outlines the assumptions of these theories and discusses the logical and empirical difficulties attributed to each of them. Then draws from sources an outline of social control theory, the theory that informs the subsequent analysis and which is advocated here.Often listed as a Citation Classic, Causes of Delinquency retains its force and cogency with age. It is an important volume and a necessary addition to the libraries of sociologists, criminologists, scholars and students in the area of delinquency.",Social Science,336,N/A,0,en

Ao explorar diferentes maneiras de lidar com a solidão, é possível descobrir estratégias que vão além da simples busca por companhia externa.

Learning English in Japan,Takunori Terasawa,N/A,2018,"Multiple discourses circulate Japanese society surrounding the relationship between Japanese people and the English language. For example, 'Japanese people are the worst English speakers in Asia, ' 'Japanese women love the English language' and 'learning English leads to increased income and career opportunities.' From a sociological perspective, this book tests the veracity of these discourses, using social statistical data. The aim here is to paint an accurate picture of society to assist the argument for evidence-based policy in English language education, and to challenge the myths about Japanese people and the English language propagated by various interest groups, including the government and the business community. This important book reveals that the English language discourses that exist in Japan today are largely based on misconceptions, pointing to the urgent need to challenge the education policies based on such falsehoods.

Until this study was published in 1976, barely any evidence existed against which to assess the claim that gambling had become a major social problem. The authors present data drawn from area surveys carried out in Swansea, Sheffield, Wanstead and Woodford, and explore how well previous sociological theories of gambling agree with their findings, particular in connection with certain aspects of work and leisure. Examining different forms of gambling, including betting, bingo and gaming machines, the chapters consider how gambling choices vary between different social groups, and how much time and money is spent on them. With the internet making it easier than ever before to place bets, this title is especially relevant, and provides a systematic basis for an explanation of gambling in relation to social structure.",Social Science,230,N/A,0,en

No product, no experience, no technology, no business plan -- no problem. You could still get $40 million from investors to start up your dot-com. And you could get people to work around the clock for stock options and the promise of millions. Then, around April 2000, it all came crashing down. Smart investors, esteemed analysts, and the business press found themselves asking: Who knew people wouldn't rush out to trade in their U.S. dollars for a virtual currency called Flooz? Who knew people wouldn't blow all their Flooz on a used car from the guys at iMotors.com? And who needed a used car from iMotors.com when they could just sit at home and have 40-lb. bags of dog food delivered to them by a sock puppet? F'd Companies captures the waste, greed, and human stupidity of more than 100 dot-com companies. Written in Philip J. Kaplan's popular, cynical style, these profiles are filled with colorful anecdotes, factoids, and information unavailable anywhere else.

English Corpus Linguistics in Japan,,BRILL,2016-09-12,"The existence of corpus-based linguistic research in Japan has until now mainly been hidden from the view of overseas researchers - partly by the language barrier, and partly by the continuing dominance of generative grammar in Japan. At last, this volume lifts the veil to reveal the current condition of corpus-based research in Japan. English Corpus Linguistics in Japan contains a collection of twenty papers written by Japanese linguists, reflecting the state of art in English corpus linguistics in Japan. The volume covers an impressively wide range, showcasing the diversity and creativity of corpus-based research in this country, from studies drawing on the ‘old faithful’ Brown and LOB Corpora as well as the more recent Frown, FLOB, the Bank of English and the British National Corpus to studies based on more specific historical, literary, spoken, and learner corpora; from investigations of major levels of language description, including prosody, lexis, morphology, syntax, and semantics to investigations of language variation; from explorations of single variables to those of multivariant dimensions; and from pedagogical applications to software applications. The papers are grouped into four sections: 1) Corpus-based studies of contemporary English, 2) Historical and diachronic studies of English, 3) English corpora and English language teaching, 4) Software for analyzing corpora. This volume will inspire still further corpus explorations in the future both in Japan and abroad.",Language Arts & Disciplines,340,N/A,0,en

Change in Contemporary English,"Geoffrey Leech, Marianne Hundt, Christian Mair, Nicholas Smith",Cambridge University Press,2009-10-22,"Based on the systematic analysis of large amounts of computer-readable text, this book shows how the English language has been changing in the recent past, often in unexpected and previously undocumented ways. The study is based on a group of matching corpora, known as the 'Brown family' of corpora, supplemented by a range of other corpus materials, both written and spoken, drawn mainly from the later twentieth century. Among the matters receiving particular attention are the influence of American English on British English, the role of the press, the 'colloquialization' of written English, and a wide range of grammatical topics, including the modal auxiliaries, progressive, subjunctive, passive, genitive and relative clauses. These subjects build an overall picture of how English grammar is changing, and the linguistic and social factors that are contributing to this process.",Language Arts & Disciplines,371,N/A,0,en

The Principles of Mathematics Revisited,Jaakko Hintikka,Cambridge University Press,1998-04-28,"This book, written by one of philosophy's pre-eminent logicians, argues that many of the basic assumptions common to logic, philosophy of mathematics and metaphysics are in need of change. It is therefore a book of critical importance to logical theory. Jaakko Hintikka proposes a new basic first-order logic and uses it to explore the foundations of mathematics. This new logic enables logicians to express on the first-order level such concepts as equicardinality, infinity, and truth in the same language. The famous impossibility results by Gödel and Tarski that have dominated the field for the last sixty years turn out to be much less significant than has been thought. All of ordinary mathematics can in principle be done on this first-order level, thus dispensing with the existence of sets and other higher-order entities.",Mathematics,308,N/A,0,en

The Nature of Homosexuality,Erik Holland,iUniverse,2004-11,"Some biological correlates of homosexuality can be dismissed with little difficulty but others are hard to explain away. Some specific family environments and childhood experiences have been reported as more common among homosexuals than heterosexuals. Homosexual behaviors or interests tend to be unstable in some individuals and this has been interpreted as suggesting that some people chose to be homosexual. Additionally, homosexuality in some contexts was socially tolerated and not extremely uncommon, as in classical Greece, Tokugawa Japan, and some other societies, i.e., homosexuality could be socially constructed. Given diverse potential sources of homosexuality, is a parsimonious explanation of what makes one a homosexual possible?",Homosexuality,737,2,7,en

Neotropical Birds of Prey,David F Whitacre,Cornell University Press,2013-03-01,"Until recently, surprisingly little has been known about the biology and behavior of tropical forest raptors, including such basic aspects as diets, breeding biology, habitat requirements, and population ecology, information critical to the development of conservation efforts. The Peregrine Fund conducted a significant eight-year-long research program on the raptor species, including owls, in Tikal National Park in Guatemala to learn more about Neotropical birds of prey. Impressive and unprecedented in scale, this pioneering research also involved the development of new methods for detecting, enumerating, and studying these magnificent but often elusive birds in their forest home. Beautifully illustrated with photographs of previously little-known species, the resulting book is the most important single source for information on the lowland tropical forest raptor species found in Central America. Neotropical Birds of Prey covers twenty specific species in depth, including the Ornate Hawk-Eagle, the Barred Forest-Falcon, the Bat Falcon, and the Mexican Wood Owl, offering thorough synopses of all current knowledge regarding breeding biology and behavior, diet, habitat use, and spatial needs. Contributors to this landmark work also show how the populations fit together as a community with overlapping habitat and prey needs that can put them in competition with reptiles and mammalian carnivores as well, yet differ from one another in their nesting or feeding behaviors and population dynamics. The work's substantive original data offer interesting comparisons between tropical and temperate zone species, and provide a basis for establishing conservation measures based on firsthand research. Making available for the first time new data on the biology, ecology, behavior, and conservation of the majestic owls and raptors of the New World tropics, this book will appeal to a wide ornithological readership, especially the many raptor enthusiasts around the world.",Nature,455,N/A,0,en

The Decentring of the Traditional University,Russell Francis,Routledge,2012-08-21,"The Decentring of the Traditional University provides a unique perspective on the implications of media change for learning and literacy that allows us to peer into the future of (self) education. Each chapter draws on socio-cultural and activity theory to investigate how resourceful students are breaking away from traditional modes of instruction and educating themselves through engagement with a globally interconnected web-based participatory culture. The argument is developed with reference to the findings of an ethnographic study that focused on university students’ informal uses of social and participatory media. Each chapter draws attention to the shifting locus of agency for regulating and managing learning and describes an emergent genre of learning activity. For example, Francis explores how students are cultivating and nurturing globally distributed funds of living knowledge that transcend institutional boundaries and describes students learning through serious play in virtually figured worlds that support radically personalised lifelong learning agendas. These stories also highlight the challenges and choices learners confront as they struggle to negotiate the faultlines of media convergence and master the new media literacies required to exploit the full potential of Web 2.0 as a learning resource. Overall, this compelling argument proposes that we are witnessing a period of historic systemic change in the culture of university learning as an emergent web-based participatory culture starts to disrupt and displace a top-down culture industry model of education that has evolved around the medium of the book. As a result, Francis argues that we need to re-conceive higher education as an identity-project in which students work on their projective identities (or imagined future selves) through engagement with both formal and informal learning activities.",Education,169,N/A,0,en

Advanced Signature Indexing for Multimedia and Web Applications,"Yannis Manolopoulos, Alexandros Nanopoulos, Eleni Tousidou",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-09-08,"Advanced Signature Indexing for Multimedia and Web Applications presents the latest research developments in signature-based indexing and query processing, specifically in multimedia and Web domains. These domains now demand a different designation of hashing information in bit-strings (i.e., signatures), and new indexes and query processing methods. The book provides solutions to these issues and addresses the resulting requirements, which are not adequately handled by existing approaches. Examples of these applications include: searching for similar images, representing multi-theme layers in maps, recommending products to Web-clients, and indexing large Web-log files. Special emphasis is given to structure description, implementation techniques and clear evaluation of operations performed (from a performance perspective). Advanced Signature Indexing for Multimedia and Web Applications is an excellent reference for professionals involved in the development of applications in multimedia databases or the Web and may also serve as a textbook for advanced level courses in database and information retrieval systems.",Computers,197,N/A,0,en

Gospel Doctrine Selections From The Sermons And Writings Of Joseph F. Smith,Joseph F. Smith,BoD – Books on Demand,2023-12-01,"The essential work ""Gospel Doctrine"" was written by Joseph F. Smith, a pivotal figure in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Some stories are violent and strange, while others creep up on you and slowly suck you in. The plot is full of unexpected twists and turns that will keep the reader engaged. Readers are compelled to keep reading because the title character is so self-indulgent. This book is intended for LDS Church members as foundational literature, providing a detailed summary of their faith's fundamental beliefs and ideals. Smith's ""Gospel Doctrine"" delves into various areas of LDS theology, including God's nature, the plan of redemption, the role of Jesus Christ, the importance of prophets, and the value of temple ordinances. It also addresses moral and ethical issues, emphasizing the need of living a virtuous, Christ-like life. The book is extensively utilized as a resource for Sunday School classes and individual study within the LDS Church, making it an essential tool for members seeking to broaden their understanding of their religious beliefs. Smith's writing style is straightforward and friendly, making complex theological themes accessible to a broad readership.",Psychology,514,N/A,0,en

Handbook of Gender Research in Psychology,"Joan C. Chrisler, Donald R. McCreary",Springer Science & Business Media,2010-03-12,"Donald R. McCreary and Joan C. Chrisler The Development of Gender Studies in Psychology Studies of sex differences are as old as the ?eld of psychology, and they have been conducted in every sub?eld of the discipline. There are probably many reasons for the popularity of these studies, but three reasons seem to be most prominent. First, social psychological studies of person perception show that sex is especially salient in social groups. It is the ?rst thing people notice about others, and it is one of the things we remember best (Fiske, Haslam, & Fiske, 1991; Stangor, Lynch, Duan, & Glass, 1992). For example, people may not remember who uttered a witty remark, but they are likely to remember whether the quip came from a woman or a man. Second, many people hold ?rm beliefs that aspects of physiology suit men and women for particular social roles. Men’s greater upper body strength makes them better candidates for manual labor, and their greater height gives the impression that they would make good leaders (i. e. , people we look up to). Women’s reproductive capacity and the caretaking tasks (e. g. , breastfeeding, baby minding) that accompany it make them seem suitable for other roles that require gentleness and nurturance. Third, the logic that underlies hypothesis testing in the sciences is focused on difference. Researchers design their studies with the hope that they can reject the null hypothesis that experimental groups do not differ.",Social Science,715,N/A,0,en
Positive Leisure Science,Teresa Freire,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-15,"This book extends positive psychology by embedding leisure into the positive science field, following a new paradigm and aggregating various domains and fields. Positive science can be applied to the field of leisure and, in turn, leisure can serve as an arena to study some of the most important optimal functioning variables. The book presents knowledge on a diverse range of topics about optimizing socio-cognitive processes and behaviors, places and contexts, societies and cultures through leisure. These topics are unified by an underlying continuum that extends from individuals and subjective experiences to social worlds. The contributions highlight components of everyday life, showing that subjective experience and life trajectories are structured and social goals and life purposes are defined and achieved within interactions between individuals and their lived contexts and environments in daily life. .",Psychology,235,N/A,0,en

Digital Intermediation,Jonathon Hutchinson,Taylor & Francis,2023-05-31,"Digital Intermediation offers a new framework for understanding content creation and distribution across automated media platforms – a new mediatisation process. This book draws on empirical and theoretical research to carefully identify and describe a number of unseen digital infrastructures that contribute to a predictive media production process through technologies, institutions and automation. Field data is drawn from several international sites, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, London, Amsterdam, Munich, Berlin, Hamburg, Sydney and Cartagena. By highlighting an increasingly automated content production and distribution process, this book responds to a number of regulatory debates on the societal impact of social media platforms. It highlights emerging areas of key importance that shape the production and distribution of social media content, including micro-platformisation and digital first personalities. This book explains how technologies, institutions and automation are used within agencies to increase exposure for the talent they manage while providing inside access to the processes and requirements of producers who create content for platform algorithms. Finally, it outlines user agency as a strategy for those who seek diversity in the information they access on automated social media content distribution platforms. The findings in this book provide key recommendations for policymakers working within digital media platforms and will be invaluable reading for students and academics interested in automated media environments.",Social Science,198,N/A,0,en

Images and Idols,"Thomas J Terry, J. Ryan Lister",Moody Publishers,2018-10-02,"Christians ought to be leading the way in creativity, but we rarely do. God is the Creator of all things, and He created us in His image. Creativity is woven into the very fabric of our humanity. Therefore, Christians should value and champion creativity as a vital part of our image-bearing role. Instead Christians often don’t know what to do with creatives and creatives don’t know what to do with Christianity. On one side you have Christians who neglect or discount art, imagination, and beauty altogether. On the other, you have artists who make idols out of each of these good things. Ryan Lister, a theology professor, and Thomas Terry, a spoken word artist and founder of Humble Beast, team up to help restore the connection between creativity and theology. Images & Idols is a theological and artistic exploration of creativity in the Christian life. It will help creatives build a strong theological foundation for their art, while challenging the church to embrace a theology of beauty and creativity.",Religion,138,N/A,0,en

One hundred sixty-eight children residing in nonmetropolitan and rural northern California participated. Each child was taken on a Neighborhood Walk, and then several measures of social-emotional functioning were administered. Cross-sectional data form the empirical basis for a developmental perspective on sources of support, the structure of social-emotional functioning, and the relationship between sources of support and social emotional functioning during middle childhood. The child's perception of support was found relevant to predicting the social-emotional functioning of children growing up in relatively secure and low-stress conditions in modern American sy.",Psychology,132,N/A,0,en

Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph F. Smith,The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,2000,"President Joseph F. Smith served for 52 years as a General Authority of the Church—as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, as a Counselor to four Church Presidents, and for 17 years as the President of the Church. He taught the restored gospel of Jesus Christ with eloquence, tenderness, and conviction, calling for the people to “live in harmony with the designs of our Heavenly Father.” His ministry was marked by his powerful witness of Jesus Christ: “I have received the witness of the Spirit in my own heart, and I testify before God, angels and men… that I know that my Redeemer lives.” Today his messages and sermons continue to give divine direction on our path of eternal progress. Our work in this world, said President Smith, “is to do good, to put down iniquity under our feet, to exalt righteousness, purity, and holiness in the hearts of the people, and to establish in the minds of our children, above all other things, a love for God and his word.” He declared that “to be a Latter-day Saint requires the sacrifice of worldly aims and pleasures; it requires fidelity, strength of character, love of truth, integrity to principle, and zealous desire to see the triumphant, forward march of truth.” The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles have established the series Teachings of Presidents of the Church to help Church members deepen their understanding of gospel doctrines and draw closer to Jesus Christ through the teachings of the prophets in this dispensation. This book features the teachings of President Joseph F. Smith, who said: “To be Latter-day Saints, men or women must be thinkers, and workers; they must be men and women who weigh matters in their minds, men and women who consider carefully their course of life and the principles that they have espoused. … When people understand the gospel of Jesus Christ, you will see them walking straightforward, according to the word of the Lord, and the law of God, strictly in accordance with that which is consistent, just, righteous, and in every sense acceptable to the Lord.” Each chapter in this book includes four sections: (1) a statement that briefly summarizes the focus of the chapter; (2) “From the Life of Joseph F. Smith,” which illustrates the chapter’s teachings by an example from President Smith’s life or his wisdom; (3) “Teachings of Joseph F. Smith,” which presents important doctrines from his many messages and sermons; and (4) “Suggestions for Study,” which encourages personal review and inquiry, further discussion, and application to our lives today through questions.",Latter Day Saint churches,510,N/A,0,en

F My Life,"Maxime Valette, Guillaume Passaglia, Didier Guedj",Villard,2009-06-09,"Today, my boss fired me via text message. I don’t have a text messaging plan. I paid 25 cents to get fired. Your girlfriend dumped you, your car broke down, your boss passed you up for the big promotion. Life’s not fair, but there is one sure-fire way to ease your pain–laughing at someone else who had an even worse day than you did. Enter the devastatingly funny world of F My Life, where calamity is comedy. Covering every disastrous pratfall in love, work, family-life, and more, F My Life proffers other people’s ruinous, real-life happenings to brighten your gloomiest day: someone getting dumped through a greeting card, ignored at their birthday party, or insulted by their own grandmother. Spanning everything from ironic twists of fate to down-right shameful moments, F My Life’s squirm-inducing stories are schadenfreude at its finest. So today, take solace in knowing that at least you’re not that guy. There now, don’t you feel better? Today, my boyfriend broke up with me. I cried and told him that I loved him. He gave me a quarter and told me to call someone who cared. I threw the quarter in his face and ran. I waited for the bus, but when I got on, I realized I was 25 cents short of the fare. I walked home in the rain. Today, my mom walked in on me looking at a 1978 Playboy. She asked if I found it in the basement. I said yes. Then I realized she was the centerfold. Today, I got in line at the grocery store. The woman in front of me looked right at me, turned to her friend, and said “That reminds me, I forgot to get acne cream.”",Humor,290,5,4,en

Scrappy Little Nobody,Anna Kendrick,Simon and Schuster,2016-11-15,"The New York Times bestselling collection of humorous autobiographical essays by the Academy Award nominated actress and star of Up in the Air and Pitch Perfect. Even before she made a name for herself on the silver screen starring in films like Pitch Perfect, Up in the Air, Twilight, and Into the Woods, Anna Kendrick was unusually small, weird, and “10 percent defiant.” At the ripe age of thirteen, she had already resolved to “keep the crazy inside my head where it belonged. Forever. But here’s the thing about crazy: It. Wants. Out.” In Scrappy Little Nobody, she invites readers inside her brain, sharing extraordinary and charmingly ordinary stories with candor and winningly wry observations. With her razor-sharp wit, Anna recounts the absurdities she’s experienced on her way to and from the heart of pop culture as only she can—from her unusual path to the performing arts (Vanilla Ice and baggy neon pants may have played a role) to her double life as a middle-school student who also starred on Broadway to her initial “dating experiments” (including only liking boys who didn’t like her back) to reviewing a binder full of butt doubles to her struggle to live like an adult woman instead of a perpetual “man-child.” Enter Anna’s world and follow her rise from “scrappy little nobody” to somebody who dazzles on the stage, the screen, and now the page—with an electric, singular voice, at once familiar and surprising, sharp and sweet, funny and serious (well, not that serious).",Biography & Autobiography,304,4.5,3,en

We tell ourselves we'd like to read more, get to the gym regularly, try new hobbies, and accomplish all kinds of goals. But then we give up because there just aren't enough hours to do it all. Or if we don't make excuses, we make sacrifices- taking time out from other things in order to fit it all in. There has to be a better way...and Laura Vanderkam has found one. After interviewing dozens of successful, happy people, she realized that they allocate their time differently than most of us. Instead of letting the daily grind crowd out the important stuff, they start by making sure there's time for the important stuff. When plans go wrong and they run out of time, only their lesser priorities suffer.

Essentialism,Greg McKeown,Crown Currency,2014-04-15,"THE LIFE-CHANGING NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • MORE THAN TWO MILLION COPIES SOLD • Now in a 10th anniversary edition featuring a new introduction and bonus 21-day challenge. “Essentialism holds the keys to solving one of the great puzzles of life: How can we do less but accomplish more?”—Adam Grant, bestselling author of Think Again Essentialism isn’t about getting more done in less time. It’s about getting only the right things done. Have you ever found yourself stretched too thin? Are you often busy but not productive? Do you feel like your time is constantly being hijacked? If you answered yes to any of these, the way out is the Way of the Essentialist. Essentialism is more than a time-management technique. It is a systematic discipline for discerning what is absolutely essential, then eliminating everything that is not, so we can make the highest possible contribution toward the things that really matter. By forcing us to apply more selective criteria for where to spend our precious time and energy, the disciplined pursuit of less empowers us to reclaim control of our own choices, instead of giving others the implicit permission to choose for us. Essentialism is not one more thing to do. It’s a whole new way of doing less, but better, in every area of our lives. Join the millions of people who have used Essentialism to change their outlook on the world.",Business & Economics,305,3,1,en

Bayesian Designs for Phase I-II Clinical Trials,"Ying Yuan, Hoang Q. Nguyen, Peter F. Thall",CRC Press,2017-12-19,"Reliably optimizing a new treatment in humans is a critical first step in clinical evaluation since choosing a suboptimal dose or schedule may lead to failure in later trials. At the same time, if promising preclinical results do not translate into a real treatment advance, it is important to determine this quickly and terminate the clinical evaluation process to avoid wasting resources. Bayesian Designs for Phase I–II Clinical Trials describes how phase I–II designs can serve as a bridge or protective barrier between preclinical studies and large confirmatory clinical trials. It illustrates many of the severe drawbacks with conventional methods used for early-phase clinical trials and presents numerous Bayesian designs for human clinical trials of new experimental treatment regimes. Written by research leaders from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, this book shows how Bayesian designs for early-phase clinical trials can explore, refine, and optimize new experimental treatments.

While many questions are answered, many more are raised for which we do not yet have the answers. The book provides inspiration to readers conducting their own research and helps to answer their questions. The care of children with systemic autoimmune diseases is moving forward at a rapid pace. The systemic autoimmune diseases of childhood have always represented a special problem for the physicians and scientists who care for the affected children and study their diseases. Some conditions, such as Kawasaki disease, are virtually unique to childhood, while systemic lupus erythematosus, progressive systemic sclerosis, and juvenile onset spondyloarthropathies may be thought of as the early onset of the same disease which is seen in adults. The autoinflammatory disorders appear to be of clear genetic origin, accounting for their frequent discovery in childhood.

Forming Winning Strategies,Po L.

Our habitual domains (HDs) grow and go wherever we go and have great impact on our behavior and decision making. When we are vital and growing our HDs are expanding and flexible; and when we find ourselves in ruts, not growing, it is because our HDs have become rigid and inflexible, as in death. This book discusses all aspects of habitual domains: their foundations, expansion, dynamics and applications to various nontrivial decision problems in our lives, including effective decision making, effective goal setting, cooperation, conflict resolution, negotiation and career management.

Katachi ? Symmetry,"Tohru Ogawa, Koryo Miura, Takashi Masunari, Denes Nagy",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"In Japanese culture the concept of katachi has special significance, connoting relationships and connectedness. Although katachi cannot be translated precisely, it corresponds most closely to ""form,"" ""shape,"" ""pattern,"" or ""Gestalt"". The contemporary study of katachi is interdisciplinary and encompasses virtually all scientific and aesthetic endeavors. Katachi research seeks to bridge the gap between cultures - whether the ""two cultures"" of C.P. Snow or the contrasting cultures of East and West. To help achieve this aim and to foster international cooperation, the interdisciplinary symposium titled ""Katachi ""U"" Symmetry"" was convened in Tsukuba, Japan, November 21 - 25, 1994. With many participants from differing backgrounds and cultural perspectives, the symposium was the culmination of 15 years of work in the field. Like-minded researchers and philosophers came together from two movements in interdisciplinary studies of katachi and symmetry that arose in the 1980s, one in Japan, the other in Hungary. The proceedings of the symposium will stimulate and provoke the interest of scientists and mathematicians, engineers and architects, philosophers and semioticians - indeed, all those with a lively sense of curiosity and a wide-ranging intellect.",Science,412,N/A,0,en

William C. Van Horne,Valerie Knowles,Dundurn,2010-05-31,"William C. Van Horne was one of North America’s most accomplished men. Born in Illinois in 1843, Van Horne started working in the railway business at a young age. In 1881 he was lured north to Canada to become general manager of the fledgling Canadian Pacific Ralway. The railroading general pushed through construction of the CPR’s transcontinental line and then went on to become the company’s president. During his time with the CPR, Van Horne developed a telegraph service, launched the Empress line of Pacific steamships in 1891, and founded CP Hotels. He capped his career by opening up Cuba’s interior with a railway. A man of prodigious energy and many talents, he also became Canada’s foremost art collector and one of the country’s leading financiers. For all of his amazing accomplishments, Van Horne was knighted in 1894. When he died church bells throughout the length and breadth of Cuba tolled to mark his passing, and when his funeral train made its way across Canada, all traffic on the CPR system was suspended for five minutes.",Biography & Autobiography,217,N/A,0,en

Prosecutors and Investigators Professional Courses Training Manual (Ethiopia),Didi Wamukoya,Didi Wamukoya,2023-06-01,"Constant changes in modus operandi of criminals and wildlife criminals working in organized groups coupled with illegal online trade and the large sums of money changing hands between criminals have made wildlife cases more complex than they were before. The role of a prosecutor and investigator in the criminal justice system is pivotal. The prosecutor and investigator must work closely together for successful cases. The prosecutor represents society and the public interest in criminal cases, taking into account both the rights of the individual and the need for an effective criminal justice system. As such, it is important that the prosecutor possess knowledge and skills necessary to perform his/her daily duties in accordance with the law and to the country’s prosecution policies. To ensure continuing education and that prosecutors maintain desired standards of practice, the On-the-Job Support Training (OJT) comes in as an integral part of prosecutor training and skills development. The investigator, on the other hand, is responsible for putting together a solid criminal case to ensure effective prosecution and deterrent sentencing. The Investigator’s roles include managing crime scenes, proper identification, acquisition, storage, chain of custody of evidence and proper case management. It is therefore paramount that a wildlife crime investigator properly understands all facets of wildlife crime including modus operandi of offenders. The investigator also must keep abreast with new techniques and methods used to resolve crimes and manage cases. The OJTs ensure that wildlife crime prosecutors and investigators have the best competencies to deal with wildlife crimes and emerging related crimes that exacerbate wildlife crimes including transnational organized crime, cybercrime, corruption and money laundering. The OJTs aim at identifying weaknesses and knowledge and skill gaps among wildlife crime prosecutors and investigators and curing those weaknesses. They also aim at improving communication and collaboration among prosecutors and law enforcement agencies. In addition, the value of OJTs can be related to specific outcomes such as properly worked case files, prosecution guided investigations, use of supporting legislation, proper investigation and prosecution and ultimately deterrence of wildlife offenders. The aim of the OJTs is to ensure the successful investigation and prosecution of wildlife cases leading to deterrent sentencing. The OJTs impart the necessary knowledge and skills in the investigation and prosecution of wildlife crimes, develop professional, ethical, impartial and independent investigators and prosecutors, foster better professional cooperation among investigators, prosecutors and the judiciary and broaden investigators and prosecutors’ knowledge of regional and international best practices. The OJTs also aim at overcoming any weaknesses in the law and in practice that may hamper the success of investigation and prosecution of wildlife crimes. The continuous mentorship and enhancement of investigators and prosecutors’ knowledge and skills will result in stronger prosecutions and deterrent sentences for wildlife crimes. The general objective of the OJT is to broaden and deepen the investigators and prosecutor’s knowledge and skills in the investigation and prosecution of wildlife crimes. It is expected that at the end of the OJTs, the investigators and prosecutors will have acquired knowledge and skills on: a) Evidentiary and procedural considerations when investigating and prosecuting wildlife crimes. b) Professional and ethical practices in the investigation and prosecution of wildlife crimes. c) Trial advocacy and written and oral advocacy in prosecution of wildlife crimes. d) Evidence and case management in wildlife crimes. e) Professional networking and cooperation. f) Regional practices and international best practices.",Law,339,N/A,0,en

Life skills are psychosocial and personal skills that help people live positively, engage effectively with others, develop coping skills and manage themselves in a way that leads to progress and success in their lives. Module 3 of the OJT intends to impart key life skills in prosecutors, who, by the nature of their jobs are faced with many life challenges due to constant interaction with people including criminal offenders as well as the heavy workload that they deal with on a daily basis.

English Corpus Linguistics in Japan,"Toshio Saito, Junsaku Nakamura, Shunji Yamazaki",Rodopi,2002,"The existence of corpus-based linguistic research in Japan has until now mainly been hidden from the view of overseas researchers - partly by the language barrier, and partly by the continuing dominance of generative grammar in Japan. At last, this volume lifts the veil to reveal the current condition of corpus-based research in Japan. English Corpus Linguistics in Japan contains a collection of twenty papers written by Japanese linguists, reflecting the state of art in English corpus linguistics in Japan. The volume covers an impressively wide range, showcasing the diversity and creativity of corpus-based research in this country, from studies drawing on the 'old faithful' Brown and LOB Corpora as well as the more recent Frown, FLOB, the Bank of English and the British National Corpus to studies based on more specific historical, literary, spoken, and learner corpora; from investigations of major levels of language description, including prosody, lexis, morphology, syntax, and semantics to investigations of language variation; from explorations of single variables to those of multivariant dimensions; and from pedagogical applications to software applications. The papers are grouped into four sections: 1) Corpus-based studies of contemporary English, 2) Historical and diachronic studies of English, 3) English corpora and English language teaching, 4) Software for analyzing corpora.

Conducted by the Institute of Criminology at the University of Tübingen, it compares the biographies of young adult inmates with a random sampling of young men from the general population and considers the results in the light of other studies of a similar nature, primarily from the Anglo-American literature. The significance of this study lies not only in the data presented, but also in the conclusions the author draws concerning subject matter and methods of criminology as an autonomous, integrated science. This leads to a practice- oriented applied criminology based on the evaluation of specific criminological criteria. For the practitioner, such an approach allows a differential assessment of the individual offender in the context of his social relationships with conclusions regarding prognosis and therapeutic effects.",Medical,314,N/A,0,en

Empire of Imagination,Michael Witwer,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2015-10-06,"The life story of Gary Gygax, godfather of all fantasy adventure games, has been told only in bits and pieces. Michael Witwer has written a dynamic, dramatized biography of Gygax from his childhood in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin to his untimely death in 2008. Gygax's magnum opus, Dungeons & Dragons, would explode in popularity throughout the 1970s and '80s and irreversibly alter the world of gaming. D&D is the best-known, best-selling role-playing game of all time, and it boasts an elite class of alumni--Stephen Colbert, Robin Williams, and Junot Diaz all have spoken openly about their experience with the game as teenagers, and some credit it as the workshop where their nascent imaginations were fostered. Gygax's involvement in the industry lasted long after his dramatic and involuntary departure from D&D's parent company, TSR, and his footprint can be seen in the genre he is largely responsible for creating. But as Witwer shows, perhaps the most compelling facet of his life and work was his unwavering commitment to the power of creativity in the face of myriad sources of adversity, whether cultural, economic, or personal. Through his creation of the role-playing genre, Gygax gave two generations of gamers the tools to invent characters and entire worlds in their minds. Told in narrative-driven and dramatic fashion, Witwer has written an engaging chronicle of the life and legacy of this emperor of the imagination.",Biography & Autobiography,337,N/A,0,en
A Methodology for Developing Multimodal User Interfaces of Information Systems,Adrian Stanciulescu,Presses univ. de Louvain,2008,"The Graphical User Interface (GUI), as the most prevailing type of User Interface (UI) in today's interactive applications, restricts the interaction with a computer to the visual modality and is therefore not suited for some users (e.g., with limited literacy or typing skills), in some circumstances (e.g., while moving around, with their hands or eyes busy) or when the environment is constrained (e.g., the keyboard and the mouse are not available). In order to go beyond the GUI constraints, the Multimodal (MM) UIs apear as paradigm that provide users with great expressive power, naturalness and flexibility. In this thesis we argue that developing MM UIs combining graphical and vocal modalities is an activity that could benefit from the application of a methodology which is composed of: a set of models, a method manipulating these models and the tools implementing the method. Therefore, we define a design space-based method that is supported by model-to-model colored transformations in order to obtain MM UIs of information systems. The design space is composed of explicitly defined design options that clarify the development process in a structured way in order to require less design effort. The feasability of the methodology is demonstrated through three case studies with different levels of complexity and coverage. In addition, an empirical study is conducted with end-users in order to measure the relative usability level provided by different design decisions.",Business & Economics,323,N/A,0,en
Mapping the Travel Behavior Genome,"Konstadinos G. Goulias, Adam W. Davis",Elsevier,2019-10-29,"Mapping the Travel Behavior Genome covers the latest research on the biological, motivational, cognitive, situational, and dispositional factors that drive activity-travel behavior. Organized into three sections, Retrospective and Prospective Survey of Travel Behavior Research, New Research Methods and Findings, and Future Research, the chapters of this book provide evidence of progress made in the most recent years in four dimensions of the travel behavior genome. These dimensions are Substantive Problems, Theoretical and Conceptual Frameworks, Behavioral Measurement, and Behavioral Analysis. Including the movement of goods as well as the movement of people, the book shows how traveler values, norms, attitudes, perceptions, emotions, feelings, and constraints lead to observed behavior; how to design efficient infrastructure and services to meet tomorrow's needs for accessibility and mobility; how to assess equity and distributional justice; and how to assess and implement policies for improving sustainability and quality of life. Mapping the Travel Behavior Genome examines the paradigm shift toward more dynamic, user-centric, demand-responsive transport services, including the ""sharing economy,"" mobility as a service, automation, and robotics. This volume provides research directions to answer behavioral questions emerging from these upheavals. - Offers a wide variety of approaches from leading travel behavior researchers from around the world - Provides a complete map of the methods, skills, and knowledge needed to work in travel behavior - Describes the state of the art in travel behavior research, providing key directions for future research",Transportation,736,N/A,0,en

The Hidden Rules of Successful Negotiation and Communication,Marc O. Opresnik,Springer,2014-06-17,"Negotiations in professional or private life often take an unsatisfactory course due to stress, confrontation with aggressive or unfair behavior, or because of overwhelming situations. Negotiations generally require a thorough preparation, strategy and a sophisticated tactic to make us feel safe in the presentation of our goals and arrive at a mutually satisfactory outcome. Conventional books about negotiations are usually limited to strategies and techniques, but leave out elements of psychological communication and emotional intelligence, which include non-verbal communication and empathy, which in turn are essential for successful negotiation. Therefore, this book on the one hand constitutes the essential techniques and strategies in the context of negotiation, but also considers ""soft skills"" without which negotiations cannot be successful. This book presents practical examples in dealing with situations such as salary, contract and sales negotiations. In particular on context and time appropriate negotiation techniques; analyzing negotiation partners and their motives; interpret group processes, and how to successfully implement negotiation psychology.",Business & Economics,144,N/A,0,en

The work is strengthened by provision of review chapters that keep the reader in sight of the forest rather than the trees."" —Earl Hunt, University of Washington Without an informed cognitive understanding of intelligence as a construct, the technology of intelligence testing will make little to no progress. Psychologists with a more psychometric background need detailed knowledge about the cognitive processes underlying intelligent behavior. Likewise, psychologists with a more cognitive or experimental background need to make more use of applied knowledge from psychometric research. Earl Hunt, Without an informed cognitive understanding of intelligence as a construct, the technology of intelligence testing will make little to no progress. Psychologists with a more psychometric background need detailed knowledge about the cognitive processes underlying intelligent behavior. Likewise, psychologists with a more cognitive or experimental background need to make more use of applied knowledge from psychometric research. The Handbook of Understanding and Measuring Intelligence provides an overview of recent studies on intelligence to help readers develop a sound understanding of results and perspectives in intelligence research. In this volume, editors Oliver Wilhelm and Randall W. Engle bring together a group of respected experts from two fields of intelligence research, cognition and methods, to summarize, review, and evaluate research in their areas of expertise. The chapters in this book present state-of-the-art examinations of a particular domain of intelligence research and highlight important methodological considerations, theoretical claims, and pervasive problems in the field. The Handbook provides those with a broad interest in individual differences, cognitive abilities, intelligence, educational measurement, thinking, reasoning, or problem solving with a comprehensive description of the status quo and prospects of intelligence research. The book is divided into two parts that are intended to build upon and relate to one another. Part I, the cognitive section, explores several theoretical viewpoints on intelligence and Part II, the methodological section, addresses fundamental statistical problems and pragmatic assessment problems in measuring intelligence. Key Features The volume editors provide a general introduction and conclude the book with an integrative epilogue. Contributors to this volume are experts in intelligence with a background in methodology or theory who offer current theoretical perspectives and recent empirical results, which are of interest to a broad audience. In addition to contributions from U.S. intelligence experts, authors from Europe and Australia provide an international perspective and articulate viewpoints and results not otherwise readily available to an American audience. Developments in theory are described with respect to their implications at the measurement level, and developments on the methodological level are evaluated with respect to their contribution to the theoretical understanding of intelligence. The Handbook is designed for scholars and psychology professionals interested in intelligence, cognitive abilities, educational testing and measurement, reasoning, and problem solving. It can also be used by advanced undergraduate and graduate students studying intelligence or the psychology of individual differences. In addition, the Handbook will be a welcome addition to any academic library.",Psychology,553,N/A,0,en

Cyclical Change,Elly van Gelderen,John Benjamins Publishing,2009,"Linguistic Cycles are ever present in language change and involve a phrase or word that gradually disappears and is replaced by a new linguistic item. The most well-known cycles involve negatives, where an initial single negative, such as ""not, "" is reinforced by another negative, such as ""no thing,"" and subjects, where full pronouns are reanalyzed as endings on the verb. This book presents new data and insights on the well-known cyclical changes as well as on less well-known ones, such as the preposition, auxiliary, copula, modal, and complementation cycles. Part I covers the negative cycle with chapters looking in great detail at the steps that are typical in this cycle. Part II focuses on pronouns, auxiliaries, and the left periphery. Part III includes work on modals, prepositions, and complementation. The book ends with a psycholinguistic chapter.

Predation in Vertebrate Communities,"Bogumila Jedrzejewska, Wlodzimierz Jedrzejewski",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-11-11,"Predation, one of the most dramatic interactions in animals' lives, has long fascinated ecologists. This volume presents carnivores, raptors and their prey in the complicated net of interrelationships, and shows them against the background of their biotic and abiotic settings. It is based on long-term research conducted in the best preserved woodland of Europe's temperate zone. The role of predation, whether limiting or regulating prey (ungulate, rodent, shrew, bird, and amphibian) populations, is quantified and compared to parts played by other factors: climate, food resources for prey, and availability of other potential resources for predators.",Science,463,N/A,0,en

Variational Analysis and Set Optimization,"Akhtar A. Khan, Elisabeth Köbis, Christiane Tammer",CRC Press,2019-06-07,"This book contains the latest advances in variational analysis and set / vector optimization, including uncertain optimization, optimal control and bilevel optimization. Recent developments concerning scalarization techniques, necessary and sufficient optimality conditions and duality statements are given. New numerical methods for efficiently solving set optimization problems are provided. Moreover, applications in economics, finance and risk theory are discussed. Summary The objective of this book is to present advances in different areas of variational analysis and set optimization, especially uncertain optimization, optimal control and bilevel optimization. Uncertain optimization problems will be approached from both a stochastic as well as a robust point of view. This leads to different interpretations of the solutions, which widens the choices for a decision-maker given his preferences. Recent developments regarding linear and nonlinear scalarization techniques with solid and nonsolid ordering cones for solving set optimization problems are discussed in this book. These results are useful for deriving optimality conditions for set and vector optimization problems. Consequently, necessary and sufficient optimality conditions are presented within this book, both in terms of scalarization as well as generalized derivatives. Moreover, an overview of existing duality statements and new duality assertions is given. The book also addresses the field of variable domination structures in vector and set optimization. Including variable ordering cones is especially important in applications such as medical image registration with uncertainties. This book covers a wide range of applications of set optimization. These range from finance, investment, insurance, control theory, economics to risk theory. As uncertain multi-objective optimization, especially robust approaches, lead to set optimization, one main focus of this book is uncertain optimization. Important recent developments concerning numerical methods for solving set optimization problems sufficiently fast are main features of this book. These are illustrated by various examples as well as easy-to-follow-steps in order to facilitate the decision process for users. Simple techniques aimed at practitioners working in the fields of mathematical programming, finance and portfolio selection are presented. These will help in the decision-making process, as well as give an overview of nondominated solutions to choose from.",Business & Economics,244,N/A,0,en

I Know How She Does It,Laura Vanderkam,Penguin,2017-01-03,"Everyone has an opinion, anecdote, or horror story about women and work. Now the acclaimed author of What the Most Successful People Do Before Breakfast shows how real working women with families are actually making the most of their time. “Having it all” has become the subject of countless books, articles, debates, and social media commentary, with passions running high in all directions. Many now believe this to be gospel truth: Any woman who wants to advance in a challenging career has to make huge sacrifices. She’s unlikely to have a happy marriage, quality time with her kids (assuming she can have kids at all), a social life, hobbies, or even a decent night’s sleep. But what if balancing work and family is actually not as hard as it’s made out to be? What if all those tragic anecdotes ignore the women who quietly but consistently do just fine with the juggle? Instead of relying on scattered stories, time management expert Laura Vanderkam set out to add hard data to the debate. She collected hour-by-hour time logs from 1,001 days in the lives of women who make at least $100,000 a year. And she found some surprising patterns in how these women spend the 168 hours that every one of us has each week. Overall, these women worked less and slept more than they assumed they did before they started tracking their time. They went jogging or to the gym, played with their children, scheduled date nights with their significant others, and had lunches with friends. They made time for the things that gave them pleasure and meaning, fitting the pieces together like tiles in a mosaic—without adhering to overly rigid schedules that would eliminate flexibility and spontaneity. Vanderkam shares specific strategies that her subjects use to make time for the things that really matter to them. For instance, they . . . * Work split shifts (such as seven hours at work, four off, then another two at night from home). This allows them to see their kids without falling behind professionally. * Get creative about what counts as quality family time. Breakfasts together and morning story time count as much as daily family dinners, and they’re often easier to manage. * Take it easy on the housework. You can free up a lot of time by embracing the philosophy of “good enough” and getting help from other members of your household (or a cleaning service). * Guard their leisure time. Full weekend getaways may be rare, but many satisfying hobbies can be done in small bursts of time. An hour of crafting feels better than an hour of reality TV. With examples from hundreds of real women, Vanderkam proves that you don’t have to give up on the things you really want. I Know How She Does It will inspire you to build a life that works, one hour at a time.",Self-Help,321,N/A,0,en

Bullshit Jobs,David Graeber,Simon & Schuster,2019-05-07,"From David Graeber, the bestselling author of The Dawn of Everything and Debt—“a master of opening up thought and stimulating debate” (Slate)—a powerful argument against the rise of meaningless, unfulfilling jobs…and their consequences. Does your job make a meaningful contribution to the world? In the spring of 2013, David Graeber asked this question in a playful, provocative essay titled “On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs.” It went viral. After one million online views in seventeen different languages, people all over the world are still debating the answer. There are hordes of people—HR consultants, communication coordinators, telemarketing researchers, corporate lawyers—whose jobs are useless, and, tragically, they know it. These people are caught in bullshit jobs. Graeber explores one of society’s most vexing and deeply felt concerns, indicting among other villains a particular strain of finance capitalism that betrays ideals shared by thinkers ranging from Keynes to Lincoln. “Clever and charismatic” (The New Yorker), Bullshit Jobs gives individuals, corporations, and societies permission to undergo a shift in values, placing creative and caring work at the center of our culture. This book is for everyone who wants to turn their vocation back into an avocation and “a thought-provoking examination of our working lives” (Financial Times).",Social Science,368,N/A,0,en

The Ten Commandments of Financial Happiness,Jean Chatzky,Penguin,2005-01-04,"Millions of Americans have turned to Jean Chatzky for financial advice, thanks to her weekly appearances on NBC's Today and her column in Money magazine. Now, in The Ten Commandments of Financial Happiness (published in hardcover as You Don't Have to Be Rich), she analyzes the results of a unique survey in which she questioned 1,500 Americans about their financial attitudes and behaviors. She looks at how much money people actually do need to guarantee a happy, comfortable life. And gets down to the nitty-gritty, isolating behaviors that—if adopted—can significantly improve a life. The results of this proprietary survey—conducted with the help of the Roper Center—are remarkable. Chatzky found that while a certain amount of money buys comfort, money can't make you happy—at least not in the way most people believe it can. But it can make you miserable, if you're managing it wrong. That's why it's time to make a change. In her frank, engaging style, Chatzky explains how to ""own your money"" to create a happy and comfortable life. She outlines the financial habits of happy people and shows how anyone can be a part of this group, no matter what they earn. Filled with fresh insights and real life examples, The Ten Commandments of Financial Happiness reaffirms that finances don't have to be a source of stress and that living within your means can be extremely rewarding.",Business & Economics,260,N/A,0,en

Advanced Data Management,Lena Wiese,Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG,2015-10-29,"Advanced data management has always been at the core of efficient database and information systems. Recent trends like big data and cloud computing have aggravated the need for sophisticated and flexible data storage and processing solutions. This book provides a comprehensive coverage of the principles of data management developed in the last decades with a focus on data structures and query languages. It treats a wealth of different data models and surveys the foundations of structuring, processing, storing and querying data according these models. Starting off with the topic of database design, it further discusses weaknesses of the relational data model, and then proceeds to convey the basics of graph data, tree-structured XML data, key-value pairs and nested, semi-structured JSON data, columnar and record-oriented data as well as object-oriented data. The final chapters round the book off with an analysis of fragmentation, replication and consistency strategies for data management in distributed databases as well as recommendations for handling polyglot persistence in multi-model databases and multi-database architectures. While primarily geared towards students of Master-level courses in Computer Science and related areas, this book may also be of benefit to practitioners looking for a reference book on data modeling and query processing. It provides both theoretical depth and a concise treatment of open source technologies currently on the market.",Computers,374,N/A,0,en

The Next Phase in Heritage Language Studies: Methodological Considerations and Advancements,"Fatih Bayram, Maki Kubota, Sergio Miguel Pereira Soares",Frontiers Media SA,2024-03-27,"Over the past three decades studies investigating heritage speaker (HS) linguistic competencies have shown, time and again that, despite being L1 or 2L1 native speakers of their home language(s), HS outcomes display variation across a wide spectrum of differences as compared to each other, other types of bilinguals as well as their monolingual peers. Studies have traditionally used—mostly behavioral—methodologies rooted in adjacent established fields (e.g., L1 acquisition, adult L2 acquisition) offering, in addition to documenting and describing HS performance, important insights for linguistic theory and challenges related to (home/minority) language maintenance, contact, policy and more. A birds-eye view makes it clear that the methodologies one uses to tap into HSs’ linguistic knowledge areas, if not more, are important than the phenomena under investigation, especially in light of how their unique experiences with their heritage and other languages are present across a continuum.",Science,376,N/A,0,en

Nurturing Pillars of Society,Francis Wing-lin Lee,Hong Kong University Press,2010-11-01,"The younger generation - those under the age of 25 - account for more than a quarter of Hong Kong's population. A much misunderstood group, these people have special characteristics and needs, and some are particularly vulnerable. Substance abuse among young people is on the rise, and juveniles make up a third of total arrests every year. Extra effort and attention is required of policy-makers, educators, and social workers to help this group make a positive contribution to society. This book seeks to promote understanding of Hong Kong's younger generation and offers strategies for working with them and their families towards healthy and productive development. Divided into three parts - youth in general, youth-at-risk, and young offenders - the book draws on international literature and empirical studies from within Hong Kong. Its focus is on action, always stressing the practical question of how to build a new model for working effectively with them. This book will be essential reading for seasoned professionals as well as undergraduate students in criminology, social policy, and social work, and postgraduates intending to practise in these areas. Francis Wing-lin Leeis an associate professor in the Department of Social Work and Social Administration in the University of Hong Kong. ""The younger generation today has to face complex and diverse life challenges, ranging from dysfunctional family systems, unemployment, hurdles of social mobility, stressful school life and the bombardments of the new social media. To help young people cope with these challenges, they have to be given opportunities and choices for holistic growth, and to acquire independent thinking and global vision. This book provides thorough analysis and practical reference for youth workers that can enhance their understanding to work with our young people."" - Christine Fang, Chief Executive, The Hong Kong Council of Social Service",Social Science,214,N/A,0,en

Pharmacology of the Skin II,,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The recent interest in the pharmacology of the skin and the treatment of its diseases has come about for two reasons. The first is a realisation that many aspects of pharmacology can be studied as easily in human skin as in animal models, where they may be more relevant to human physiology and disease. Examples of this are the action of various vasoactive agents and the isolation of mediators of inflammation after UV irradiation and antigen-induced dermatitis. The second reason is the fortuitous realisation that a pharmacological approach to the treatment of skin disease need not always await the full elucidation of aetiology and mechanism. For example, whilst the argument continued un resolved as to whether the pilo-sebaceous infection which constitutes acne was due to a blocked duct or to a simple increase in sebum production, 13-cis retinoic acid, was found quite by chance totally to ablate the disease; again, whilst cyclosporin, fresh from its triumphs in organ transplantation, has been found able to suppress the rash of psoriasis, it has resuscitated the debate on aetiology. We are therefore entering a new era in which the pharmacology and clinical pharmacology of skin are being studied as a fascinating new way of exploring questions of human physiology and pharmacology as well as for the development and study of new drugs, use of which will improve disease control and at the same time help to define pathological mechanisms.",Medical,602,N/A,0,en

Working-Class Comic Book Heroes,Marc DiPaolo,Univ. Press of Mississippi,2018-04-19,"Contributions by Phil Bevin, Blair Davis, Marc DiPaolo, Michele Fazio, James Gifford, Kelly Kanayama, Orion Ussner Kidder, Christina M. Knopf, Kevin Michael Scott, Andrew Alan Smith, and Terrence R. Wandtke In comic books, superhero stories often depict working-class characters who struggle to make ends meet, lead fulfilling lives, and remain faithful to themselves and their own personal code of ethics. Working-Class Comic Book Heroes: Class Conflict and Populist Politics in Comics examines working-class superheroes and other protagonists who populate heroic narratives in serialized comic books. Essayists analyze and deconstruct these figures, viewing their roles as fictional stand-ins for real-world blue-collar characters. Informed by new working-class studies, the book also discusses how often working-class writers and artists created these characters. Notably Jack Kirby, a working-class Jewish artist, created several of the most recognizable working-class superheroes, including Captain America and the Thing. Contributors weigh industry histories and marketing concerns as well as the fan community's changing attitudes towards class signifiers in superhero adventures. The often financially strapped Spider-Man proves to be a touchstone figure in many of these essays. Grant Morrison's Superman, Marvel's Shamrock, Alan Moore and David Lloyd's V for Vendetta, and The Walking Dead receive thoughtful treatment. While there have been many scholarly works concerned with issues of race and gender in comics, this book stands as the first to deal explicitly with issues of class, cultural capital, and economics as its main themes.",Social Science,269,N/A,0,en

The Works of William H. Beveridge,Various,Routledge,2021-02-25,"William Beveridge (1879-1963) was a key figure in the modernization of British economic and social policy who published widely on unemployment and social security. Among his most notable works and reprinted in this set are, Full Employment in a Free Society (1944), and Pillars of Security (1943). Beveridge’s Report on social insurance was published in 1942. It proposed that all people of working age should pay a weekly national insurance contribution. In return, benefits would be paid to people who were sick, unemployed, retired or widowed. Beveridge included as one of three fundamental assumptions the fact that there would be a National Health Service of some sort. Beveridge's arguments were widely accepted. He argued that welfare institutions would increase the competitiveness of British industry in the post-war period, not only by shifting labour costs like healthcare and pensions onto the public account but also by producing healthier, wealthier and more productive workers. Beveridge saw full employment as the pivot of the social welfare programme he expressed in the 1942 report. As well as making available some of Beveridge’s key, and in some case, lesser known works, this set includes as its final volume an indispensable overview of Beveridge and his prolific work.",Business & Economics,1944,N/A,0,en

Marc H. Bornstein has published widely in experimental, methodological, comparative, developmental, and cultural science as well as neuroscience, pediatrics, and aesthetics. In this volume, he has collected an integrated series of his papers on parenting. Many disciplines over many centuries have expounded on parenting, but theory and opinion have prevailed. Bornstein initiated efforts to make parenting an evidence-based field of study through his journal Parenting: Science and Practice, the Handbook of Parenting, and two monograph series, Monographs in Parenting and Studies in Parenting. In addition, Bornstein has undertaken empirical studies that address the determinants, nature, scope, and consequences of parenting. The writings selected for this collection symbolize the development of an empirical parenting science and the meaning and importance of parenting for the lives and well-being of children, parents, and society. Including a specially written introduction, in which Marc Bornstein reflects on the importance of parenting and contextualizes both the field and the evolution of his wide-ranging career, this collection will serve as a valuable resource for students and researchers of parenting, developmental science, and all disciplines from anthropology to zoology concerned with nurturing, socializing, and educating the next generation.",Family & Relationships,523,N/A,0,en

Logic and Relational Theory,C. J. Date,Technics Publications,2020-06-06,"This book is a revised, upgraded, and hugely improved version of an earlier one called Logic and Databases. Although it’s effectively a brand new book, therefore, the following remarks from that earlier book are still relevant here. First, logic and databases are inextricably intertwined. The relational model itself is essentially just elementary logic, tailored to database needs. Now, if you’re a database professional, this won’t be news to you—but you still might not realize just how much everything we do in the database world is (or should be!) affected by logic. Logic is fundamental, and everywhere. As a database professional, therefore, you owe it to yourself to understand the basics of formal logic, and you ought to be able to explain (and perhaps defend) the connections between formal logic and database technology. And that’s what this book is about. What it does is show, through a series of partly independent, partly interrelated essays, just how various crucial aspects of database technology—some of them very familiar, others maybe less so—are solidly grounded in formal logic. Overall, the goal is to help you realize the importance of logic in everything you do, and also, I hope, to help you see that logic can be fun.",Computers,358,N/A,0,en

A misquoted verse here, and an extrapolation there: one wonders when the dust will finally settle, and a spiritually, and scripturally accurate picture will begin to emerge.

Who (or what) is the antichrist? Who is the false prophet; and Who (or what) is the whore of Babylon? With the Bible in one hand, and a prayer for Guidance ever on his lips, Jack Smith has discovered, and here reveals, the answer to those questions.

Smart Robust Operation and Trading of Integrated Energy Systems with Low Pollution Goals,"Kaiping Qu, Yue Zhou, Xin Fang, Shuli Wen, Shiwei Xie",Frontiers Media SA,2024-09-23,"To mitigate two major environmental concerns of global warming and air pollution, renewable energies with uncertainty are increasingly deployed in power systems, which challenge the system's secure operation. A single system usually has limited adjusting ability. In contrast, integrated energy systems such as electricity-gas, electricity-traffic, electricity-heat, and transmission-distribution coordinated systems enhance the regulating ability of renewable energy accommodation and environmental protection. The operation of integrated energy systems will meet three essential requirements: low-pollution attribute, robustness, and cooperativity. However, the diversity of uncertainty conditions, the complementarity of new energy accommodation among systems, the conflict of interest between systems, and the dispatch autonomy of systems challenge the requirements mentioned above. The main goal of this Research Topic includes: 1. Propose more effective trading mechanisms or control strategies for carbon and air pollutant emissions. 2. Fully use complementary effects between electric power, natural gas, heat, hydrogen, and traffic systems. 3. Realize the coordinated operation of integrated energy systems with limited information interaction and ensured dispatch autonomy. 4. Improve the robustness of integrated energy systems under diversified uncertainty conditions. 5. Apply data-based reinforcement learning methods for the dynamic decision of smart integrated energy systems under complex environments.",Technology & Engineering,320,N/A,0,en

Logic and Databases,C. J. Date,Trafford Publishing,2007,"Logic and databases are inextricably intertwined. The relational model in particular is essentially just elementary predicate logic, tailored to fit the needs of database management. Now, if you're a database professional, I'm sure this isn't news to you; but you still might not realize just how much everything we do in the database world is - or should be! - affected by predicate logic. Logic is everywhere. So if you're a database professional you really owe it to yourself to understand the basics of formal logic, and you really ought to be able to explain (and perhaps defend) the connections between formal logic and database management. And that's what this book is about. What it does is show, through a series of partly independent and partly interrelate essays, just how various crucial aspects of database technology-some of them very familiar, others maybe less so- are solidly grounded in formal logic. It is divided into five parts: *Basic Logic *Logic and Database Management *Logic and Database Design *Logic and Algebra *Logic and the Third Manifesto There's also a lengthy appendix, containing a collection of frequently asked questions (and some answers) on various aspects of logic and database management. Overall, my goal is to help you realize the importance of logic in everything you do, and also- I hope- to help you see that logic can be fun.",Computers,461,N/A,0,en

Ageing in Advanced Industrial States,"Shripad Tuljapurkar, Naohiro Ogawa, Anne H.

The 21st century is likely to see the end to world population growth and become the century of population aging, marked by low fertility and ever-increasing life expectancy. These trends have prompted many to predict a gloomy future caused by an unprecedented economic burden of population aging. In response, industrialized nations will need to implement effective social and economic policies and programs. This is the final volume in a series of three. The papers included explore many examples and strengthen the basis for effective economic and social policies by investigating the economic, social, and demographic consequences of the transformations in the structures of population and family. These consequences include changes in economic behavior, both in labor and financial markets, and with regard to saving and consumption, and intergenerational transfers of money and care.",Social Science,333,N/A,0,en

Ultralearning,Scott H. Young,HarperCollins,2019-08-06,"Now a Wall Street Journal bestseller. Learn a new talent, stay relevant, reinvent yourself, and adapt to whatever the workplace throws your way. Ultralearning offers nine principles to master hard skills quickly. This is the essential guide to future-proof your career and maximize your competitive advantage through self-education. In these tumultuous times of economic and technological change, staying ahead depends on continual self-education—a lifelong mastery of fresh ideas, subjects, and skills. If you want to accomplish more and stand apart from everyone else, you need to become an ultralearner. The challenge of learning new skills is that you think you already know how best to learn, as you did as a student, so you rerun old routines and old ways of solving problems. To counter that, Ultralearning offers powerful strategies to break you out of those mental ruts and introduces new training methods to help you push through to higher levels of retention. Scott H. Young incorporates the latest research about the most effective learning methods and the stories of other ultralearners like himself—among them Benjamin Franklin, chess grandmaster Judit Polgár, and Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynman, as well as a host of others, such as little-known modern polymath Nigel Richards, who won the French World Scrabble Championship—without knowing French. Young documents the methods he and others have used to acquire knowledge and shows that, far from being an obscure skill limited to aggressive autodidacts, ultralearning is a powerful tool anyone can use to improve their career, studies, and life. Ultralearning explores this fascinating subculture, shares a proven framework for a successful ultralearning project, and offers insights into how you can organize and exe - cute a plan to learn anything deeply and quickly, without teachers or budget-busting tuition costs. Whether the goal is to be fluent in a language (or ten languages), earn the equivalent of a college degree in a fraction of the time, or master multiple tools to build a product or business from the ground up, the principles in Ultralearning will guide you to success.",Business & Economics,278,N/A,0,en

Drug Use for Grown-Ups,Dr. Carl L. Hart,Penguin,2021-01-12,"“Hart’s argument that we need to drastically revise our current view of illegal drugs is both powerful and timely . . . when it comes to the legacy of this country’s war on drugs, we should all share his outrage.” —The New York Times Book Review From one of the world's foremost experts on the subject, a powerful argument that the greatest damage from drugs flows from their being illegal, and a hopeful reckoning with the possibility of their use as part of a responsible and happy life Dr. Carl L. Hart, Ziff Professor at Columbia University and former chair of the Department of Psychology, is one of the world's preeminent experts on the effects of so-called recreational drugs on the human mind and body. Dr. Hart is open about the fact that he uses drugs himself, in a happy balance with the rest of his full and productive life as a researcher and professor, husband, father, and friend. In Drug Use for Grown-Ups, he draws on decades of research and his own personal experience to argue definitively that the criminalization and demonization of drug use--not drugs themselves--have been a tremendous scourge on America, not least in reinforcing this country's enduring structural racism. Dr. Hart did not always have this view. He came of age in one of Miami's most troubled neighborhoods at a time when many ills were being laid at the door of crack cocaine. His initial work as a researcher was aimed at proving that drug use caused bad outcomes. But one problem kept cropping up: the evidence from his research did not support his hypothesis. From inside the massively well-funded research arm of the American war on drugs, he saw how the facts did not support the ideology. The truth was dismissed and distorted in order to keep fear and outrage stoked, the funds rolling in, and Black and brown bodies behind bars. Drug Use for Grown-Ups will be controversial, to be sure: the propaganda war, Dr. Hart argues, has been tremendously effective. Imagine if the only subject of any discussion about driving automobiles was fatal car crashes. Drug Use for Grown-Ups offers a radically different vision: when used responsibly, drugs can enrich and enhance our lives. We have a long way to go, but the vital conversation this book will generate is an extraordinarily important step.",Social Science,304,N/A,0,en

American Twilight,"Kristopher Woofter, Will Dodson",University of Texas Press,2021-06-01,"Tobe Hooper's productions, which often trespassed upon the safety of the family unit, cast a critical eye toward an America in crisis. Often dismissed by scholars and critics as a one-hit wonder thanks to his 1974 horror classic The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Hooper nevertheless was instrumental in the development of a robust and deeply political horror genre from the 1960s until his death in 2017. In American Twilight, the authors assert that the director was an auteur whose works featured complex monsters and disrupted America’s sacrosanct perceptions of prosperity and domestic security. American Twilight focuses on the skepticism toward American institutions and media and the articulation of uncanny spaces so integral to Hooper’s vast array of feature and documentary films, made-for-television movies, television episodes, and music videos. From Egg Shells (1969) to Poltergeist (1982), Djinn (2013), and even Billy Idol’s music video for “Dancing with Myself” (1985), Tobe Hooper provided a singular directorial vision that investigated masculine anxiety and subverted the idea of American exceptionalism.",Performing Arts,313,N/A,0,en
Giving the Devil His Due,"Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock, Regina M. Hansen",Fordham University Press,2021-10-05,"Finalist, 2021 Bram Stoker Awards (Superior Achievement in Non-Fiction) The first collection of essays to address Satan’s ubiquitous and popular appearances in film Lucifer and cinema have been intertwined since the origins of the medium. As humankind’s greatest antagonist and the incarnation of pure evil, the cinematic devil embodies our own culturally specific anxieties and desires, reflecting moviegoers’ collective conceptions of good and evil, right and wrong, sin and salvation. Giving the Devil His Due is the first book of its kind to examine the history and significance of Satan onscreen. This collection explores how the devil is not just one monster among many, nor is he the “prince of darkness” merely because he has repeatedly flickered across cinema screens in darkened rooms since the origins of the medium. Satan is instead a force active in our lives. Films featuring the devil, therefore, are not just flights of fancy but narratives, sometimes reinforcing, sometimes calling into question, a familiar belief system. From the inception of motion pictures in the 1890s and continuing into the twenty-first century, these essays examine what cinematic representations tell us about the art of filmmaking, the desires of the film-going public, what the cultural moments of the films reflect, and the reciprocal influence they exert. Loosely organized chronologically by film, though some chapters address more than one film, this collection studies such classic movies as Faust, Rosemary’s Baby, The Omen, Angel Heart, The Witch, and The Last Temptation of Christ, as well as the appearance of the Devil in Disney animation. Guiding the contributions to this volume is the overarching idea that cinematic representations of Satan reflect not only the hypnotic powers of cinema to explore and depict the fantastic but also shifting social anxieties and desires that concern human morality and our place in the universe.

A Man's Got to Have a Hobby,William McInnes,Hachette Australia,2010-07-01,"William McInnes' bestselling memoir, A Man's Got To Have A Hobby, takes us back to the long summer holidays of the 1960s and 70s, and the last of the baby-boomer childhoods. William writes with humour and affection about his family, and especially his mum and dad, who talked to the TV set and enjoyed life in their house near the bay. William McInnes is a talented writer and a natural storyteller. A tail-end baby boomer, he recalls summer holidays that seemed to go on forever, when he and his mates would walk down to fish in the bay; a time when the Aussie battler stood as the local Labor candidate and looked out for his mates; and a time when the whole family would rush into the lounge room to watch a new commercial on TV. He writes about his father - a strong character who talks to the furniture, dances with William's mother in the kitchen, and spends his free time fixing up the house and doing the best for his family. In William's writing you can hear his father speaking and listen to his mother singing. This is a book about people who aren't famous but should be.

Thinking in Systems,Donella Meadows,Chelsea Green Publishing,2008-12-03,"The classic book on systems thinking—with more than half a million copies sold worldwide! ""This is a fabulous book... This book opened my mind and reshaped the way I think about investing.""—Forbes ""Thinking in Systems is required reading for anyone hoping to run a successful company, community, or country. Learning how to think in systems is now part of change-agent literacy. And this is the best book of its kind.""—Hunter Lovins In the years following her role as the lead author of the international bestseller, Limits to Growth—the first book to show the consequences of unchecked growth on a finite planet—Donella Meadows remained a pioneer of environmental and social analysis until her untimely death in 2001. Thinking in Systems is a concise and crucial book offering insight for problem solving on scales ranging from the personal to the global. Edited by the Sustainability Institute’s Diana Wright, this essential primer brings systems thinking out of the realm of computers and equations and into the tangible world, showing readers how to develop the systems-thinking skills that thought leaders across the globe consider critical for 21st-century life. Some of the biggest problems facing the world—war, hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation—are essentially system failures. They cannot be solved by fixing one piece in isolation from the others, because even seemingly minor details have enormous power to undermine the best efforts of too-narrow thinking. While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology. Donella Meadows was known as much for nurturing positive outcomes as she was for delving into the science behind global dilemmas. She reminds readers to pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable, to stay humble, and to stay a learner. In a world growing ever more complicated, crowded, and interdependent, Thinking in Systems helps readers avoid confusion and helplessness, the first step toward finding proactive and effective solutions.",Science,242,4.5,4,en

Packed with top grade information, insightful analysis and fascinating anecdotes, Alexander's interesting and controversial book sets the gold standard for titles on this subject."" –Nick Pope, author of Open Skies, Closed Minds ""Changes the playing field for both true believers and skeptics alike. Alexander strongly warns, be careful what you wish for when asking for presidential intervention. Success could set the field of ufology back decades."" --George Noory, host of Coast to Coast AM While still on active duty in the U.S. Army during the 1980s, Colonel John B. Alexander, Ph.D. created an interagency group to explore the controversial topic of UFOs. All members held Top Secret clearance. What they discovered was not at all what was expected. UFOs covers the numerous cases they saw, and answers questions like: • What was really in Hanger 18? • Did a UFO land at Holloman Air Force Base? • What happened at Roswell? • What is Majestic 12? • What is the Aviary? • What does the government know about UFOs? • What has happened with disclosure in other countries? • Has the U.S. reverse engineered a UFO? • Why don't presidents get access to UFO info? UFOs is at once a complete account of Alexander's findings, and a call to action. There are no conspiracy theories here—only hard facts—but they are merely the beginning. Foreword by Jacques F.

I’ve hit rock bottom, officially named Kormane’s hot mess. While I’m trying to manage morning sickness and meet orders from my loyal customers at the B&B, hiding my secret is wearing, especially when Logan proves to be a great guy as well as my nemesis. Is there a way to meet in the middle? Logan Heather’s the town’s good girl with a delightfully naughty side—not that I’m likely to experience it again.

Matchmaker Mysteries Series The Complete Series,elise sax,13 Lakes Publishing,2019-01-24,"Perfect for fans of Janet Evanovich and Jana DeLeon, Elise Sax’s wickedly funny Matchmaker Mysteries series proves that the road to love comes with a few dead ends. The complete Series Boxed Set is a page-turning beach read and a small town mystery romance of ten novels, two novellas, and the book of Grandma Zelda’s advice. ""Elise Sax will win your heart.""--New York Times bestselling author Jill Shalvis * ""Sax will make you laugh. Her larger-than-life characters jump off the page and make crazy seem like a fun place to hang out.""—New York Times bestselling author Christie Craig * “Elise Sax belongs on every bookshelf.”—New York Times bestselling author Melissa Foster * ""With quirky characters reminiscent of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series and a small-town heroine redolent of Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse"" --RT Book Reviews * ""Fans of laugh-out-loud romantic suspense will enjoy this new author as she joins the ranks of Janet Evanovich.""--Booklist, on An Affair to Dismember An Affair to Dismember: * Three months has been Gladie Burger’s limit when it comes to staying in one place. That’s why Gladie is more than a little skeptical when her Grandma Zelda—who is more than a little psychic—recruits her into the family’s matchmaking business in the quaint small town of Cannes, California. What’s more, Gladie is also highly unqualified, having a terrible track record with romance. Still, Zelda is convinced that her granddaughter has her clairvoyant “gift.” But when the going gets tough, Gladie wonders if this gift has a return policy. * When Zelda’s neighbor drops dead in his kitchen, Gladie is swept into his bizarre family’s drama. Despite warnings from the (distractingly gorgeous) chief of police to steer clear of his investigation, Gladie is out to prove that her neighbor’s death was murder. It’s not too long before she’s in way over her head—with the hunky police chief, a dysfunctional family full of possible killers, and yet another mysterious and handsome man, whose attentions she’s unable to ignore. Gladie is clearly being pursued—either by true love or by a murderer. Who will catch her first? * Citizen Pain: * Since joining the family matchmaking business run by her eccentric and psychic Grandma Zelda, Gladie is always looking for love. But when an unbearable toothache knocks her out of commission and into the dentist’s chair, she prays only for relief. No such luck. Emerging from an anesthetic haze, Gladie awakes to find that not only is her tooth still throbbing, but her dentist is dead—and the lead suspect in the murder, office receptionist Belinda, just so happens to be Gladie’s first real client. Now it’s up to Gladie to find Belinda a man and keep her from being locked up behind bars. * As if that weren’t enough distraction, two gorgeous men are vying for Gladie’s attention: Spencer, the playboy chief of police, and Holden, Gladie’s secretive, gorgeously muscled neighbor. Still, Gladie’s not complaining about having a helping hand or two when the case leads her to a dangerously bizarre cult. She may have met her match—and if she’s not careful, it could be her last. * The Wizard of Saws: * Five months have passed since Gladie Burger came to Cannes, California, to join her eccentric Grandma Zelda in the family matchmaking business, and Gladie is quickly mastering the rules of attraction. Her latest fix-up is still going strong and Gladie’s bank account is back in the black—until a rival matchmaker arrives in town and has both Gladie and Zelda seeing red. * Not only is self-proclaimed psychic Luanda Laughing-Eagle stealing Grandma Zelda’s clients, but Zelda is convinced that Luanda’s ESP is total BS. She tasks Gladie with exposing Luanda as a fraud, but Gladie’s attention is diverted when murder comes a-calling. Spencer Bolton, the gorgeous chief of police and Gladie’s on-again, off-again flame, wants her to stay out of the investigation–and away from the deliciously chiseled detective who also aims to win Gladie’s heart. But the one thing Gladie’s learned is that in business, love and murder . . . it’s always personal. * Field of Screams: * Since joining the family matchmaking business run by her eccentric and psychic Grandma Zelda, Gladie has had little success. Involved on one level or another—hot sex, almost committed, and crying in her pillow—with three men, Gladie distracts herself by giving up on matchmaking and starting a new career. But when Gladie stumbles on body parts of dead baseball players all over town, she’s dragged into solving yet another murder mystery. With her life in chaos and the killer getting closer, Gladie has to come to terms with the fact that love is murder. * From Fear to Eternity: * It’s still up in the air whether Gladie really has her psychic grandmother’s “gift,” but she’s determined to finally give matchmaking her best shot. She’s also determined to give her new relationship with hottie Police Chief Spencer Bolton a shot…that is, if she can find him. * Despite her good intentions, Gladie is being sued by a matchmaking client, but even with bankruptcy around the corner, that’s not her biggest problem. There seems to be a rash of dead senior citizens popping up at the tea shop owner’s family home. Gladie is recruited to find the murderer, but this time she may have met her match—and if she’s not careful, it could be her last. * West Side Gory: * Life is going great for Gladie Burger. She’s having lots of sex with her hottie boyfriend, Chief of Police Spencer Bolton, she’s settled into her matchmaking career, she’s got a new car, and it’s been over two weeks since she’s stumbled on a dead body. It seems like she’s finally got her life on track, since she moved in with her psychic grandmother to help her with her matchmaking business. * But when a stomach ache proves to be more serious, she finds herself in West Side Hospital, preparing for surgery. Befriending the woman in the next bed in her hospital room, she becomes distressed when the woman vanishes. Alerting the hospital staff, they tell her that the woman never existed. Has Gladie lost her mind, or is something more sinister happening at West Side Hospital? * Scareplane: * Gladie is nervous about her upcoming vacation with hottie police chief Spencer Bolton. She’s never flown before, and she’s not looking forward to the experience. Her fear is heightened when a plane crashes into the house across the street. But there’s little time to think about it because their town is hosting a law enforcement conference, where Southern California’s finest are coming to discuss law and order. Everything is going to plan. Spencer is hailed as a great police chief, and Gladie is fixing up half of the town…until one of the guests—a famous police czar—drops dead. Now everyone is a suspect, and Gladie is being prevented from investigating the death by the new police detective on the force…a hottie female cop who thinks Gladie is enemy #1 and Spencer is marriage material. * It Happened one Fright: * Spencer might have marriage on his mind, but Gladie is distracted by her best friend’s troubles and a busy matchmaking month. The father of Bridget’s baby is threatening to take custody away from her, and when he winds up murdered, Bridget becomes the top suspect. Now, Gladie must juggle her own love life, her matchmaking, and proving that Bridget is innocent, not to mention dealing with the town’s attempt to break the world record for the largest Easter egg hunt. But poking around is dangerous, and Gladie could be next on the killer’s hit list. * The Big Kill: * Progress is being made on Gladie’s house and her impending wedding. Meanwhile, her best friend Bridget is ready to give birth. But all of that takes a backseat to Gladie’s discovery in her grandmother’s attic about her father. It looks like her father’s motorcycle accident when she was a child was no accident, and now Gladie is thrust into her father’s world, where his best friends could have been his murderers. Will Gladie find the killer before she’s next? * It’s a Wonderful Knife: * It’s wedding time in Cannes. Gladie’s wedding. But once again, love has to take a backseat to murder. Will Gladie’s wedding go off without a hitch? Ha! Just kidding. Enjoy the mayhem as Gladie and Spencer finally say their vows and realize their happily ever after. * Ship of Ghouls: * Gladie and Spencer are finally married. After they’re gifted a honeymoon cruise, they’re on their way into international waters. But the ship is less than luxurious, and the ship’s crew isn’t what they seem. When Gladie stumbles on a dead body, the newlyweds are thrust into a life-or-death mystery. Gladie’s “gift” could come in handy to find the killer, but she might find herself overboard before justice is served. * Road to Matchmaker: * A month before Gladie Burger moves to the small town of Cannes, California to help in her grandmother’s matchmaking business, she’s busy moving from one temporary job to the next. Living in Los Angeles in a studio apartment over an Italian restaurant, she works in a used book store doing inventory, but she spends most of her time reading the collection of old murder mysteries. After an accident involving the books, Gladie has lost her memory and believes she’s the detective in the last book that she read. Determined to track down her arch nemesis, Gladie finds herself in a real-life mystery and an adventure of a lifetime. * Matchmaking Advice From Your Grandma Zelda: * The complete collection of Grandma Zelda’s matchmaking advice from the bestselling Matchmaking Mysteries series. All of her words of wisdom are here, and as a bonus, Yiddish definitions and introductions by Elise Sax and Grandma Zelda are included. Zelda’s humorous words of wisdom about love and life are a shot of happiness, sure to brighten anyone’s day.",Fiction,2220,N/A,0,en

Expose Your Hidden Talents,Angela Usher,Xlibris Corporation,2010-10-22,"I am an advocate of 'self-improvement, the straightening out process and the bigger picture where spirituality is concerned. Even though it may appear; Im a controversial writer, the reality is: I only state clear and precise true facts. In these modern times, I believe that too many people become seriously caught up in this 'global fast paced world' of technology. Most people are trapped in error. Many people dont creatively thrive. Many people are not consciously aware that they are programmed and conditioned to think in a humanistic robotic fast pace way. People become trapped in their ruts. The world is seriously confused. This is a world that is dangerously losing its way. Christian values seriously need to be brought back into the world. In this book, I encourage hobbies and therapy techniques, for the purpose of logic and constructive thoughts. I also analyze conscious thought, open-mindedness and new awarenesss through natural logic and reasoning. In order for a person to break away from distracted error; (a person should use their own intelligence, logic and common sense, find out the absolute truth involving the facts; also use Gods Wisdom; pray, be open minded, find true spiritual direction, also become self educated, learn new awareness & find graceful hope with God.) As a writer, I continue working towards the cause of: a better world. I created some amazing profound parts of this book, through divine providence granted to me from the grace of God.",Self-Help,333,3,2,en
Reimagining Intervention in Young Lives,"Karen R. Foster, Dale C. Spencer",UBC Press,2012-08-15,"Poverty and unemployment are on the rise among Canadian youth. Clearly something needs to change, but current social-assistance models are based on problematic assumptions about the lives and possible trajectories of ""risky"" young people. Reimagining Intervention in Young Lives explores the difficulties many marginalized young people encounter with the ""support system"" available to them, as well as the social forces that push them to the margins in the first place. Drawn from interviews with forty-five patrons of a youth drop-in centre, this important work resituates the nexus of the problem from the identification of individual ""risk factors"" to the recognition of the contradictions and barriers contained in the very social-aid structures that are meant to bring their target populations back in to the fold of ""normal"" society. Intervention is indeed necessary, but more to challenge the prevailing structures that incorrectly presume how youth themselves interpret risk, poverty, and, most important of all, their own potential.",Social Science,198,N/A,0,en

An Experiment in Love,Hilary Mantel,Holt Paperbacks,2007-04-01,"A New York Times Book Review Notable Book of the Year It was the year after Chappaquiddick, and all spring Carmel McBain had watery dreams about the disaster. Now she, Karina, and Julianne were escaping the dreary English countryside for a London University hall of residence. Interspersing accounts of her current position as a university student with recollections of her childhood and an ever difficult relationship with her longtime schoolmate Karina, Carmel reflects on a generation of girls desiring the power of men, but fearful of abandoning what is expected and proper. When these bright but confused young women land in late 1960s London, they are confronted with a slew of new preoccupations--sex, politics, food, and fertility--and a pointless grotesque tragedy of their own. Hilary Mantel's magnificent novel examines the pressures on women during the early days of contemporary feminism to excel--but not be too successful--in England's complex hierarchy of class and status.",Fiction,257,2.5,3,en
Falling Star,Rachel Schurig,Rachel Schurig,2019-07-07,"It should be a dream come true—three months of rent-free living in a Hollywood Hills mansion with a mega-hot, internationally famous movie star for a roommate. There’s only one problem. That mega-hot movie star? He’s my boss’s client. He’s also a mega-jerk. The only way to get the promotion I’ve been working towards for years is to spend the next three months babysitting a spoiled, snarky movie star. Killian Cooper is on his last chance in Hollywood. He can either get his life together and stay sober while filming his next movie, or he can kiss his acting career goodbye. The studio isn’t taking any chances—they decide that Killian needs a full-time accountability partner, and I’m the not-so-lucky girl chosen for the job. Unless I can keep this bad boy celeb on the straight and narrow, my Hollywood dreams will go down the drain, right along with his career. All I need to do is keep Killian company in his massive—and surprisingly lonely—mansion, accompany him to the movie set each day, and keep a tight lock on the wine cellar. Easy peasy, right? Not so fast. Killian isn’t happy with the babysitting arrangement, and he seems determined to drive me crazy with his near constant snark and totally crappy attitude. Even worse, when he’s not actively trying to make my life difficult, he’s strutting around the house, tempting me with that hot action-star body and those broody, way-too-beautiful-to-handle eyes. Don’t even get me started on the shirtless push-ups… Getting to know Killian Cooper is proving to be a dangerous endeavor—the more time I spend with him, the less obnoxious he seems. When his walls start to come down, I realize there’s more to this falling star than meets the eye. And he might just be my Hollywood dream come true after all.",Fiction,321,N/A,0,en
Dictionary of Typical Command Phrases,Richard W. Wetherill,The Alpha Publishing House,2009-08-26,"Unchain Your Brain! Release Illogical Thoughts! If you have problems you cannot seem to solve or relationships you cannot seem to work out, you should get this book. People unknowingly lock their brains in chains. As Wetherill makes clear in HOW TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AND PREVENT TROUBLE, people's behavioral problems are caused by their emotionally charged commands to themselves. You can ""unthink"" your way out of problems. Introduction: ""Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart."" Those words are often quoted but seldom understood. What they mean is that we think our way into trouble. Most of us are proud of our brainpower, but we are not proud of our ability to get into trouble. That is something we do inadvertently until we understand. The process by which we do it is extremely subtle. Lust, for example, is an emotion that has the effect of driving a person in a wrong direction while reducing his intelligence. He is busy with consideration of what he wants. Therefore, he does not realize what he is doing to his mind. As everybody who understands the law of absolute right is aware, he is installing distortions of logic. What is a distortion of logic? It is a wrong idea accepted as a right idea, an untruth accepted as a truth, an emotional command to self. Once installed, it operates as if by compulsion. ""If ever I get the chance,"" a young person might say to himself, ""I'll certainly take advantage of it!"" He or she may suppose he is engaged in harmless but pleasant reverie; instead, he is moving into a mental trap. He may assert that by today's standards sexuality is no sin, and he may argue that fantasizing about it has no really harmful effects, but such considerations are beside the point. The point is that he has deprived himself of volition on that topic.","Body, Mind & Spirit",302,N/A,0,en

The Love Curse of the Rumbaughs,Jack Gantos,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux (BYR)",2008-06-24,"On an unseasonably warm Easter Sunday, a young girl named Ivy discovers a chilling secret in the basement of the Rumbaugh pharmacy across the street from the hotel where she lives with her mother. The discovery reveals a disturbing side to the eccentric lives of family friends Abner and Adolph Rumbaugh, known throughout their small western Pennsylvania town simply as the Twins. It seems that Ab and Dolph have been compelled by a powerful mutual love for their deceased mother to do something extraordinary, something that in its own twisted way bridges the gap between the living and the dead. Immediately, Ivy's discovery provokes the revelation of a Rumbaugh family curse, a curse that, as Ivy will learn over the coming years, holds a strange power over herself and her own mother. In his third book for young adults, Jack Gantos has scripted a completely original drama. With gothic flavor and black humor, he depicts a group of people bound together by love, compulsion . . . and a passion for taxidermy.",Young Adult Fiction,162,N/A,0,en

Wish I Were Here,Mark Kingwell,McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP,2019-04-08,"Are you bored of the endless scroll of your social media feed? Do you swipe left before considering the human being whose face you just summarily rejected? Do you skim articles on your screen in search of intellectual stimulation that never arrives? If so, this book is the philosophical lifeline you have been waiting for. Offering a timely meditation on the profound effects of constant immersion in technology, also known as the Interface, Wish I Were Here draws on philosophical analysis of boredom and happiness to examine the pressing issues of screen addiction and the lure of online outrage. Without moralizing, Mark Kingwell takes seriously the possibility that current conditions of life and connection are creating hollowed-out human selves, divorced from their own external world. While scrolling, swiping, and clicking suggest purposeful action, such as choosing and connecting with others, Kingwell argues that repeated flicks of the finger provide merely the shadow of meaning, by reducing us to scattered data fragments, Twitter feeds, Instagram posts, shopping preferences, and text trends captured by algorithms. Written in accessible language that references both classical philosophers and contemporary critics, Wish I Were Here turns to philosophy for a cure to the widespread unease that something is amiss in modern waking life.",Philosophy,225,N/A,0,en
The Church of Baseball,Ron Shelton,Vintage,2023-06-20,"LA TIMES BESTSELLER • From the award-winning screenwriter and director of cult classic Bull Durham, the extremely entertaining behind-the-scenes story of the making of the film, and an insightful primer on the art and business of moviemaking. ""This book tells you how to make a movie—the whole nine innings of it—out of nothing but sheer will.” —Tony Gilroy, writer/director of Michael Clayton and The Bourne Legacy ""The only church that truly feeds the soul, day in, day out, is the church of baseball.""—Annie in Bull Durham Bull Durham, the breakthrough 1988 film about a minor league baseball team, is widely revered as the best sports movie of all time. But back in 1987, Ron Shelton was a first-time director and no one was willing to finance a movie about baseball—especially a story set in the minors. The jury was still out on Kevin Costner’s leading-man potential, while Susan Sarandon was already a has-been. There were doubts. But something miraculous happened, and The Church of Baseball attempts to capture why. From organizing a baseball camp for the actors and rewriting key scenes while on set, to dealing with a short production schedule and overcoming the challenge of filming the sport, Shelton brings to life the making of this beloved American movie. Shelton explains the rarely revealed ins and outs of moviemaking, from a film’s inception and financing, screenwriting, casting, the nuts and bolts of directing, the postproduction process, and even through its release. But this is also a book about baseball and its singular romance in the world of sports. Shelton spent six years in the minor leagues before making this film, and his experiences resonate throughout this book. Full of wry humor and insight, The Church of Baseball tells the remarkable story behind an iconic film.",Biography & Autobiography,257,N/A,0,en
License to Parent,"Christina Hillsberg, Ryan Hillsberg",Penguin,2021-06-08,"""If Mr. and Mrs. Smith had kids and wrote a parenting book, this is what you'd get: a practical guide for how to utilize key spy tactics to teach kids important life skills--from self-defense to effective communication to conflict resolution."" --Working Mother Christina was a single, successful CIA analyst with a burgeoning career in espionage when she met fellow spy, Ryan, a hotshot field operative who turned her world upside down. They fell in love, married, and soon they were raising three children from his first marriage, and later, two more of their own. Christina knew right away that there was something special about the way Ryan was parenting his kids, although she had to admit their obsession with surviving end-of-world scenarios and their ability to do everything from archery to motorcycle riding initially gave her pause. More than that, Ryan's kids were much more security savvy than most adults she knew. She soon realized he was using his CIA training and field experience in his day-to-day child-rearing. And why shouldn't he? The CIA trains its employees to be equipped to deal with just about anything. Shouldn't parents strive to do the same for their kids? As Christina grew into her new role as a stepmom and later gave birth to their two children, she got on board with Ryan's unique parenting style--and even helped shape it using her own experiences at the CIA. Told through honest and relatable parenting anecdotes, Christina shares their distinctive approach to raising confident, security-conscious, resilient children, giving practical takeaways rooted in CIA tradecraft along the way. License to Parent aims to provide parents with the tools necessary to raise savvier, well-rounded kids who have the skills necessary to navigate through life.",Family & Relationships,289,N/A,0,en

"Migration, Prostitution, and Human Trafficking",Min Liu,Transaction Publishers,2013-02-28,"Migration, Prostitution, and Human Trafficking examines the nature, magnitude, and gravity of prostitution and sex trafficking—and the relationship between them—in contemporary China. By researching the backgrounds, circumstances, and other factors that drive Chinese women to migrate to Shenzhen, China, Liu hopes to shed light on the underlying reasons for their entry into the sex industry. She details Chinese legislation and governmental practices for dealing with human trafficking and prostitution. Liu argues that the Chinese government is not aware of the severity of this problem due to lack of information. The author begins by examining the historical roots of prostitution in China and provides the theoretical framework and historical background for the topic. She then explores the methodology of the study conducted—in-depth interviews, statistics, government documents, and personal observation. Data collected examines the lives of individual women before they became involved in prostitution and after. And finally, she discusses prostitution laws in China and draws conclusions about motivations for human trafficking—both from the perspective of the trafficker and the victim. This imaginative effort provides a comprehensive look at Chinese migrant women in Shenzhen, China, and how they have become involved in prostitution and human trafficking. It is the author’s hope that increased awareness will lead to legislation that will stop this kind of exploitation. Prostitution is a global issue; its special dimensions in an expanding, market-driven economy encased in a communist political system are explored with candor and understanding. Liu deals with inherited issues and current practices in an entirely unique manner.",Social Science,217,N/A,0,en

Pillow Talk,Craig Conover,Simon and Schuster,2022-03-29,"Perfect for fans of One Day You’ll Thank Me and Capital Gaines, the star of Southern Charm and cofounder and CMO of Sewing Down South reveals how he turned his passion for sewing into a profitable enterprise and a fulfilling life, while also taking us behind-the-scenes of one of Bravo’s most popular shows. As a young boy sitting at a sewing machine in home economics class, Craig Conover had no idea that this hobby would one day change his life for the better. Growing up in Delaware, Conover experienced cruel bullying and suffered from severe anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. But while law school in Charleston seemed to provide the direction he needed, Conover spent years searching for meaning and passion in life. The chance to become a cast member on Bravo’s Southern Charm promised to provide that. Though the show gave Conover a shot at fame and fortune, it also offered destructive temptations that fed his insecurities. As the show increased in popularity, he sank deeper into self-doubt. Unable to take control of his life, Conover quickly lost his job, his girlfriend, and his motivation. Then, at his lowest point, Conover turned to his passion—sewing—and slowly pulled himself out of the spiral. A chance phone call from an old friend gave Conover the support he needed to turn his hobby into a business. Soon after, Sewing Down South was born and became an overnight success, with Conover launching a multi-state “Pillow Party Tour,” being featured on HSN, and opening a retail store in downtown Charleston. Now, Conover reveals the full story of the drama that swirled around him on the show—both on screen and off—and how it led to the founding of Sewing Down South. He also talks about how he was able to turn his passion into his work and reclaim the direction of his life and what lessons we can learn from his experience.",Biography & Autobiography,265,N/A,0,en

The Science of Boredom,Sandi Mann,Robinson,2016-03-22,"Are we living in an age where we are more boredom-prone? Or are other people boring us? Or could we be that boring person?! In our current information age, we are constantly connected to technology, and have so many varied ways to spend our leisure time that we should all surely never know what boredom feels like. Yet, boredom appears to be on the rise; it seems that the more we have to stimulate us, the more stimulation we crave. In a quest to relieve our boredom, we engage in dangerous risk-taking - from extreme sports to drugs to gambling to anti-social behaviour, or we overindulge in shopping or eating. The Science of Boredom explores the causes and consequences of boredom in the fast-paced twenty-first century. Parents are desperate to keep their children entertained during every waking moment, the education system is geared towards interactivity, and attention spans are dropping as we use multiple devices at all times. But the world of work can be increasingly repetitive and routine, and we are losing the ability to tolerate this everyday tedium. Using Sandi Mann's own ground-breaking research into boredom, this book tells the story of how we act, react and cope when we are bored, and argues that there is a positive side to boredom. It can be a catalyst for humour, fun, reflection, creativity and inspiration. The radical solution to the 'boredom problem' is to harness it rather than try to avoid it. Allowing yourself time away from constant stimuli can enrich your life. We should all embrace our boredom and see the upside of our downtime.",Psychology,229,N/A,0,en

But when the Sandrisson Drive activated, every automated system crashed, the nuclear reactor itself shut down, and only the reflexes and training of a racing pilot saved the test vessel Holy Grail from crashing into the impossible wall that had appeared before them, a wall which is just part of a monstrous enclosure surrounding a space 20,000 kilometers across.

A Woman's Guide to Claiming Space,Eliza VanCort,Berrett-Koehler Publishers,2023-02-21,"For too long, women have been told to confine themselves-physically, socially, and emotionally. Eliza VanCort says now is the time for women to stand tall, raise their voices, and claim their space. Women fight the pressure to make themselves small in private, professional, and public spaces. VanCort, a teacher, consultant, and speaker, provides the necessary tools for women to rewrite the rules and create the stories of their choosing safely and without apology. VanCort identifies the five key behaviors of all Space-Claiming Queens: use your voice and posture to project confidence and power, end self-sabotage, forge connections, neutralize unsafe spaces, and unite across differences. Through personal narrative, research, and actionable strategies, VanCort provides how-tos on combating challenges, such as antimentors and microaggressions, and gives advice for building up your old girls club, asking for what you're worth, and owning your space without apology. Bold, fun, and enlightening, this book is birthed from VanCort's incredible story. Having a mother with schizophrenia forced VanCort to learn to be small and invisible at an early age, and suffering a traumatic brain injury as an adult required her to rethink communication from the ground up. Drawing on these experiences, and those of real women everywhere, VanCort empowers women to claim space for themselves and for their sisters with courage, empathy, and conviction because when we rise together, we rise so much higher.",Self-Help,342,N/A,0,en

I Remember,Karl Rahner,N/A,1985,"Karl Rahner refused to write his memoirs. He used to say that his life had been uneventful, that his bibliography -four thousand items in various languages - was his life. But he did agree in the end to a series of interviews that constitute a lengthy, sustained reflection on his life and thought. In this book he talks about his childhood in Freiburg, his family life and religious background, the terror of life under the Nazis, the war years, and all that came after. There are delightful cameo portraits of Martin Heidegger, Alfred Delp and Cardinal Ottaviani; candid comments about the church and its future, about old age and the approach of death. But what comes through strongest of all is the clear and simple expression of the faith of a spiritual master who has been called 'the mystical doctor' and 'the theologian of everyday life'.""",Biography & Autobiography,130,N/A,0,en

Health Attitude,John R. Patrick,N/A,2015-03-18,"After John R. Patrick's career at IBM, he took a seat on the board of a teaching hospital. He was surprised to learn how hospitals and physicians lagged at adopting information technology, and appalled at the needless complexity of healthcare delivery processes. Instead of shaking his head and walking away, Patrick took action. The result is a revealing look at the cultural, attitudinal, and technological barriers holding back the United States from achieving a more affordable, accessible, and effective healthcare system. Patrick sees the inability to share personal healthcare information between hospitals, specialists, and primary care doctors as a major problem. He believes increasing collaboration for more effective healthcare is not a technical problem, it is attitudinal. The reliance of the uninsured on expensive emergency care instead of preventive care is not limited by healthcare capabilities, but by the attitude of healthcare policymakers and politicians. Patrick argues we need new attitudes about healthcare to achieve true reform. His vision includes a system focused on patients and uses an accountability oriented, fee for value model. Patrick promotes an attitude that provides incentives for wellness, not sickness.",Health care reform,322,N/A,0,en

Risk,"General Stanley McChrystal, Anna Butrico",Penguin,2021-10-05,"From the bestselling author of Team of Teams and My Share of the Task, an entirely new way to understand risk and master the unknown. Retired four-star general Stan McChrystal has lived a life associated with the deadly risks of combat. From his first day at West Point, to his years in Afghanistan, to his efforts helping business leaders navigate a global pandemic, McChrystal has seen how individuals and organizations fail to mitigate risk. Why? Because they focus on the probability of something happening instead of the interface by which it can be managed. In Risk, General McChrystal offers a battle-tested system for detecting and responding to risk. Instead of defining risk as a force to predict, McChrystal and coauthor Anna Butrico show that there are in fact ten dimensions of control we can adjust at any given time. Drawing on examples ranging from military history to the business world, and offering practical exercises to improve preparedness, McChrystal illustrates how these ten factors are always in effect, and how by considering them, individuals and organizations can exert mastery over every conceivable sort of risk that they might face. We may not be able to see the future, but with McChrystal’s hard-won guidance, we can improve our resistance and build a strong defense against what we know—and what we don't.",Business & Economics,369,N/A,0,en

Urticaria,"Beate M. Henz, Torsten Zuberbier, Jürgen Grabbe, Eugene Monroe",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Urticaria is one of the most common dermatological and allergological cutaneous reactions and, compared to other diseases, it is easily recognized by patients and physicians alike. Nevertheless, the disease is highly complex regarding its eliciting causes, its clinical manifestations and its therapy. Thus, a famous New York dermatologist once mentioned that he would rather have a lion than a patient with chronic urticaria walk into his office. This may seem surprising since, to the uninitiated, different types of urticaria look alike, and the pathomechanisms are rather well understood, with mast cells being almost invariably the main effector cells. In 1986, a monograph of the first editor (Prof. Czarnetzki, now with the married name Henz) appeared, giving a detailed and thorough review of the then current state of knowledge regarding all aspects of the disease. Since then, two updates of this book have appeared in the German language, with coworkers of the clinic of Prof. Henz helping in the revision of the various chapters of the old monograph, and with particular emphasis on practical aspects of the disease. The present book is mainly a translation of the second German edition, with only minor updates and with more citations from the literature since the 1986 monograph is no longer available for purchase.",Medical,188,N/A,0,en

The Heart Between Us,Lindsay Harrel,HarperChristian + ORM,2018-03-13,"“Lindsay Harrel has penned a charming story that is sure to touch the hearts of her readers. Through the stories of Megan and her sister Crystal, readers get a glimpse of adventure, restoration, conquered fears, and realized dreams. Lindsay will no doubt win readers with this heartfelt story.” —Lauren K. Denton, USA TODAY bestselling author of The Hideaway and Hurricane Season, on The Heart Between Us From award-winning author Lindsay Harrel comes a powerful story of adventure, healing, and learning how to live life to the fullest. Megan Jacobs always wished for a different heart. Her entire childhood was spent in and out of hospitals, sitting on the sidelines while her twin sister Crystal played all the sports, got all the guys, and had all the fun. But even a heart transplant three years ago wasn’t enough to propel Megan’s life forward. She’s still working as a library aide and living with her parents in her small Minnesota hometown, dreaming of the adventure she plans to take “once she’s well enough.” Meanwhile, her sister is a successful architect with a handsome husband and the perfect life—or so Megan thinks. When her heart donor’s parents give Megan their teenage daughter’s journal—complete with an unfulfilled bucket list—Megan connects with the girl she meets between the pages and is inspired to venture out and check off each item. Caleb—a friend from her years in and out of the hospital—reenters her life and pushes her to find the courage to take the leap and begin her journey. She’s thrown for a loop when Crystal offers to join her for reasons of her own, but she welcomes the company and the opportunity to mend their tenuous relationship. As Megan and Crystal check items off the bucket list, Megan fights the fears that have been instilled in her after a lifetime of illness. She must choose between safety and adventure and learn to embrace the heart she’s been given so that she can finally share it with the people she loves most. “A sweet story of sisterhood, familial bonds, sacrificial love, and finding your own identity amidst the storms of life. Poignant with tender moments, as well as laughter, The Heart Between Us is a touching novel that is sure to please.” —Catherine West, author of Where Hope Begins “I love this story of facing our fears. Harrel pens a clever, well-written love story between two sisters, the men in their lives and the dreams of a heart donor. Life is more f letting than we know, and this timeless story reminds us to love well.” —Rachel Hauck, New York Times bestselling author, on The Heart Between Us “The Heart Between Us is an absolute gem of a story. The intriguing premise drew me in from the start, but it was the authentic characters and their relatable struggles that kept me reading. I especially loved getting to travel vicariously through Megan and Crystal! A heart-tugging, not-to-be-missed book from an author who belongs on your keeper shelf.” —Melissa Tagg, author of the Walker Family series",Fiction,334,N/A,0,en

Maintaining Social Well-Being and Meaningful Work in a Highly Automated Job Market,"Hai-Jew, Shalin",IGI Global,2020-04-03,"In mainstream media, there has been wide discussion on what the world will look like when the artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics incursions into traditional human work result in fewer jobs in manufacturing, service industries, and other domains. Turning to automation is a practical endeavor for corporations because of the efficiencies and increased performance it fosters, but these changes have a major impact on humanity. The resulting lack of work has been linked to social ills and human failure to thrive. Maintaining Social Well-Being and Meaningful Work in a Highly Automated Job Market is a pivotal reference source that explores how the world will re-shape as one with less demand for human labor and how to potentially balance how people engage as part-workers and as consumers of others’ creations. Additionally, the book looks at how people will co-create meaningful lives at micro, meso, and macro levels. While highlighting topics such as mobile technology, positive psychological capital, and human capital, this book is ideally designed for technologists, AI designers, robotics designers, policymakers, social engineers, CIOs, politicians, executives, economists, researchers, and students.",Business & Economics,333,N/A,0,en

Holograms,Sean F. Johnston,Oxford University Press,2015-12-03,"Holograms have been in the public eye for over a half-century, but their influences have deeper cultural roots. No other visual experience is quite like interacting with holograms; no other cultural product melds the technological sublime with magic and optimism in quite the same way. As holograms have evolved, they have left their audiences alternately fascinated, bemused, inspired or indifferent. From expressions of high science to countercultural art to consumer security, holograms have represented modernity, magic and materialism. Their most pervasive impact has been to galvanise hopeful technological dreams. Engineers, artists, hippies and hobbyists have played with, and dreamed about, holograms. This book explores how holograms found a place in distinct cultural settings. It is aimed at readers attracted to pop culture, visual studies and cultural history, scholars concerned with media history, fine art and material studies and, most of all, cross-disciplinary audiences intrigued about how this ubiquitous but still-mysterious visual medium grew up in our midst and became entangled in our culture. This book explores the technical attractions and cultural uses of the hologram, how they were shaped by what came before them, and how they have matured to shape our notional futures. Today, holograms are in our pockets (as identity documents) and in our minds (as gaming fantasies and 'faux hologram' performers). Why aren't they more often in front of our eyes?",Science,328,N/A,0,en

A Guide to the Formulation of Plans and Goals in Occupational Therapy,"Sue Parkinson, Rob Brooks",Routledge,2020-11-29,"This practical guide for occupational therapists introduces a tried and tested method for moving from assessment to intervention, by formulating plans and measurable goals using the influential Model of Human occupation (MOHO). Section 1 introduces the concept of formulation – where it comes from, what it involves, why it is important, and how assessment information can be guided by theoretical frameworks and organised into a flowing narrative. Section 2 provides specific instructions for constructing occupational formulations using the Model of Human Occupation. In addition, a radically new way for creating aspirational goals is introduced - based on a simple acronym - which will enable occupational therapists to measure sustained changes rather than single actions. Section 3 presents 20 example occupational formulations and goals, from a wide range of mental health, physical health and learning disability settings, as well as a prison service, and services for homeless people and asylum seekers. Designed for practising occupational therapists and occupational students, this is an essential introduction for all those who are looking for an effective way to formulate plans and goals based on the Model of Human Occupation.",Medical,230,N/A,0,en

Chronomics and Continuous Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring,"Kuniaki Otsuka, Germaine Cornelissen, Franz Halberg",Springer,2016-03-05,"This fascinating volume applies the concept of chronomics to the medical treatment of hypertension. It starts with the recent updates on chronomics, the analytic techniques, and their application to community-based assessments. The authors advocate the use of 7-day/24-h records of blood pressure, which is effective for finding masked hypertension, masked morning surge, and other rhythm abnormalities. Most organisms, from cyanobacteria to mammals, are known to use the circadian mechanism. However, our body systems also demonstrate circaseptan (roughly weekly), circannual (roughly yearly), and even longer rhythms. Chronomics monitors the physiological data and then analyzes the superimposed rhythms, isolating the cycles mathematically to determine how organisms and their environment interact. It is the study of interactions among time structures (chronomes) in and around us.",Medical,934,N/A,0,en
Advanced Design,John Reis,Springer Nature,2022-04-17,"This book is about design. Everybody does design, from artists to engineers, from interior designers to industrial designers. We design our days and we design our lives. This book presents the three universal activities that everyone uses, no matter who they are or what they do. These three activities are 1.) clarify an ambiguous project, 2.) generate ideas, and 3.) select one idea for implementation. This book also presents how the psychology of design impacts our effectiveness with each of these three activities, from creativity through decision making, intuition through analysis, and cognitive enhancement through design biases. Although the examples provided in this book primarily target the diverse disciplines of art (painting) and engineering, they can be easily understood and adapted by designers in any discipline. This book helps advanced design students and working professionals in any discipline to understand why and when the basic design principles they were taught work or do not work and, as a result, improve their design effectiveness.",Technology & Engineering,224,N/A,0,en

Behavioural Ecology of Western Palearctic Falcons,Giovanni Leonardi,Springer Nature,2020-12-07,"This monograph is the result of eight years of bibliographical and field research concerning several behavioural ecology aspects of the Palaearctic falcons. For a while, this book grew along with “The Lanner falcon” published in 2015 and revised in 2017. In both books the main aim was to provide a clear overview of the biology and ecology of these species. In fact in the last 20 years, the number of publications on falcons has grown tremendously and, in parallel, also those belonging to the so-called ""grey literature"". The number of people involved is also increased by including both academics and nature lovers. Many previously published books emphasized identification, and offered little insights on the behavioural and ecological aspects of the species. Very often, the research on behavioural ecology remains closed within the confines of academic community. By contrast, a multitude of basic data is scattered in countless articles published in local magazines. Many falcon species are easy to observe and study (such as kestrels) but others are more rare and localized. In order to understand the survival strategies adopted by this group of avian predators, it is necessary not to lose sight of the overall picture. This book tries to explain the different survival strategies by examining, through a few essential chapters, some crucial aspects for all species. The first chapter provides information on the genus Falco, its genetics, evolution and morphological peculiarities. The other chapters deal with reproductive strategies, competition, exploitation of resources, dispersal patterns, communication and sociality. One of the main objectives of this book is to produce an accessible but scholarly curated source of reference. By understanding the most common species, it is possible to provide a working framework for rarer, and especially threatened, falcon species.",Science,214,N/A,0,en
J. T. Wilson and the Fraternity of Duckmaloi,Patricia Morison,Rodopi,1997,"In the 1890s four young scientists at Sydney University - two Scots, a Londoner and an Australian - began sustained research into Australian native fauna for which each was awarded the FRS. They all went on to pursue notable careers in the biological sciences, concluding in London 46-8 and Cambridge. This book follows their careers and enduring friendship exploring in detail the life of its senior member, J.T. Wilson (1861-1945), who was professor of anatomy at Sydney University (1890-1920) and Cambridge (1920-1933) and had abiding interests in science, philosophy, education and military affairs. The narrative is mainly concerned with issues of historical interest to scientists and medical educationists though some, like Empire relations and the contribution of Scots to Australia's development, will interest a wider readership. Many of the preoccupations of Wilson and his colleagues remain topical: the debate between biological science and religion; the struggle to interpret Darwin's theory without placing ""Homo sapiens"" at the top of an evolutionary tree; pure versus applied science; vocationalism versusscholarship in university education.",Medical,492,N/A,0,en

Niko's Nature,Hans Kruuk,OUP Oxford,2003-11-13,"A charismatic naturalist, bird-watcher, teacher, artist, photographer, film-maker, and winner of the Nobel Prize, Niko Tinbergen was a prominent and influential scientist. Jointly with Konrad Lorenz, he laid the foundation for a new science, the biological study of animal behaviour. 'Ethology', and his talent for devising behaviour-testing experiments, provided an outlet for Niko's enthusiasm for gulls and sticklebacks, snow-buntings and foxes, wasps and falcons, and even children. This first full-length biography of Niko Tinbergen, lavishly illustrated with many of Niko's own drawings, describes his background in Holland, a naturalists' paradise, and the beginnings of his investigations into the behaviour of birds, fish, and insects. Hans Kruuk also explores is Niko's relationship with his colleague and co-Nobelist Konrad Lorenz. These were two men full of contrasts: Niko a charming, self-effacing field man and experimenter; Konrad a flamboyant and egocentric German, always full of new ideas. Niko's Nature goes on to follow Niko's progress in Oxford after the Second World War, where he became the world authority on the behaviour of animals in the wild: his inspiring book The Study of Instinct remains an all-time classic. As a scientist Niko will always be known for the four fundamentally different ways in which he asked the question 'why does an animal do this?' These questions, about physiology, development, evolution, and function, became known as 'Tinbergen's four whys'. But Niko's successes came at a price - severe and devastating depressions that were to plague him throughout his career. In this fascinating and engaging story, Niko's long-time friend and student Hans Kruuk argues that his impact as a scientist and naturalist was in large part due to his skills as a communicator, photographer, and film-maker. Niko's Nature is an intimate and insightful portrait of an extraordinary figure.",Biography & Autobiography,740,N/A,0,en

"Entertainment, Leisure and Identities",Alyson Brown,Cambridge Scholars Publishing,2009-03-26,"This wide-ranging collection of essays seeks to challenge the ‘common-sense’ assumption that entertainment activities have no function but to fill up otherwise empty moments. As such it builds on the term – coined by the Victorians – ‘Recreation’, and argues that in the entertainments people pursue they do not simply divert themselves, but actively create and re-create their identities. The collection shows this process can only take place for those who enjoy the benefits of leisure; hence, in the medieval period leisure and entertainments are largely confined to the wealthy minority. In periods of rapid social change, like 19th century Britain, the inter-linked question of identity and entertainment became an issue of great concern. Orderly and respectable activities were seen by many commentators as the key to containing the potential menace of the new urban population. In the 20th century the development of new forms of mass entertainment, such as cinema, radio and television, has generated new debates, in particular about the potential of these new media to manipulate their audiences. The essays, arranged in broadly chronological order, give fascinating and detailed ‘snapshots’ of these processes as they unfold from the middle ages to the present-day. As such the collection makes a very valuable contribution to the historical study of the social and, broadly defined, political role played by entertainments in shaping and reinforcing identities. 'In recent years the history of leisure and, more particularly, the history of leisure pursuits, amusements and ""entertainments"", has engaged the attention of social historians who, as well as highlighting their intrinsic interests, have demonstrated the contribution which such studies can make to an understanding on social identities and class relationships. This collection of essays explores a wide and eclectic range of ""entertainments"" - from medieval pet-keeping, Victorian chess tournaments and late 19th century museums of curiosities to French anarchist theatre and the career of Harry Belafonte - themes which until now received little or no scholarly analysis. As such it fills a significant gap in the historical literature.' G. R.

Magnetic Partners,Stephen Betchen,Simon and Schuster,2010-05-18,"Do you and your partner argue about the same things over and over again? Are you often confused about why your partner is so angry with you? Are things getting worse and worse even though you’ve tried everything you can think of to make them better? In this breakthrough guide to repairing romantic relationships, therapist and marriage researcher Dr. Stephen Betchen presents a powerful new explanation of what leads to this kind of escalating conflict in couples and how you can repair your relationship and find a whole new level of happiness. Based on his extensive experience as a couples’ therapist, Dr. Betchen has discovered that the prevailing idea that opposites attract is wrong. Instead, one of the strongest forces that attracts people to one another is that they share a hidden, inner conflict in their lives—an unconscious struggle within themselves that each of them developed growing up—which he calls a ""master conflict."" The fact that a couple shares a master conflict acts as an almost magnetic force of attraction, but, over time, master conflicts often begin to push a pair apart—many of the very things you most appreciated about each other start to grate on you, producing increasing hostility. The good news is that by identifying the master conflict that you share, you and your partner can take the steps to break the cycle of fighting and come to a new place of understanding and happiness in your relationship. Often, just the realization that you have this hidden conflict acts as a powerful cure, allowing you to appreciate each other once again and to be empathetic about the things that have been irritating you both. From his years of work with couples, Betchen has identified the nineteen most common master conflicts—such as getting your needs met vs. caretaking; giving vs. withholding; commitment vs. freedom; power vs. passivity—and for each he provides vivid stories of couples who have struggled with them, as well as simple tests that help you to: • Identify the core master conflict that is causing your relationship problems • Understand the origins of your conflict and how it drew you to your partner • Diagnose how the conflict is now pushing you apart • Come to new terms with the conflict to save your relationship As Dr. Betchen writes, knowledge of a master conflict is power, and Magnetic Partners is an empowering guide that will help you not only to identify and control your master conflict, but also to bring your relationship to a new level based on deeper understanding, ultimately leading to greater fulfillment and long-term resilience.

Il frappe plus fort encore avec Somnanbule. » Les Echos Au volant de son camping-car, accompagné de Flip, son fidèle pitbull, Will Bear sillonne les routes d'une Amérique ravagée par les coupures de courant et envahie de drones géants. En tant que mercenaire itinérant, il accomplit sous de multiples identités diverses missions, parfois au péril de sa vie : assassinats, pose d'explosifs, transport de prisonniers...

Fleishman a des ennuis,Taffy Brodesser-Akner,Calmann-Lévy,2020-06-03,"« Dans le premier roman de Taffy Brodesser-Akner, Fleishman a des ennuis, Updike, Roth et Franzen ne sont pas juste des références, ils sont remis au goût du jour ». The New Yorker Toby et Rachel, couple juif privilégié vivant dans les quartiers chics de Manhattan, se séparent. Après quinze ans de vie commune et deux enfants, ils ne parviennent plus à se comprendre. Pour Toby, simple médecin d’hôpital, c’est une forme de libération. Rachel était devenue agressive et méprisante avec sa carrière bien plus florissante que la sienne. Toby s’accommode donc assez bien de ce divorce, et de son nouveau célibat de quadra dans une ville qui foisonne de femmes célibataires. Mais tout bascule quand Rachel disparaît littéralement de la circulation : elle ne vient pas chercher les enfants comme prévu pour les emmener en vacances et surtout, ne donne plus le moindre signe de vie. Toby se retrouve donc à devoir jongler entre les enfants, son métier très prenant et ses nombreuses conquêtes. Peu à peu, il endosse le rôle de la mère et du père tout en enchaînant des situations plus cocasses les unes que les autres. Plus attachant de page en page, on le quitte subitement vers la fin du roman pour découvrir le point de vue de Rachel, et la vérité sur sa disparition. Un revers de médaille plus qu’inattendu qui nous plonge dans une immense émotion. Le roman d’un divorce à l’humour piquant irrésistible qui finit par nous embarquer dans une réflexion profonde sur l’égalité des sexes au sein du couple.",Fiction,512,N/A,0,fr

Sur cette lettre ornée des cinq anneaux olympiques, on lit ces quelques lignes : « [...] Les jeux olympiques d’hiver sont une manifestation quelque peu particulière, étant donné que pour des raisons tout simplement climatiques et géographiques, ils ne conviennent pas à certains pays du monde, que ce soit au niveau de l’organisation ou de la participation. » À sa lecture, Lamine Guèye est d’abord choqué puis révolté. Mais il veut surtout comprendre. Comment peut-on autant bafouer l’esprit de la charte olympique en véhiculant de tels propos ? Qui sont ces gens du CIO coupables d’une telle discrimination ? Comment fonctionne cette organisation très particulière ? Autant de questions qui vont conduire Lamine à démêler les mécanismes de la nébuleuse olympique et y constater des dysfonctionnements fondamentaux majeurs.

L'âme sœur,Agnès Karinthi,L'Astre Bleu Editions,2018-06-29,"Le passé oublié d'Anne ressurgit avec l'arrivée de Philippe qui, lui ne l'a jamais oubliée... « Tu n’imagines pas ce que je ressens, Maman. Ma vie a commencé quand j’avais neuf ans, au milieu des blouses blanches de l’hôpital. Avant, c’est le trou noir. J’ai perdu ma sœur. Nous devions être très proches, mais je ne le sais pas. J’ai perdu mon père. Il devait être le plus merveilleux des papas, mais je ne me rappelle pas. J’ai perdu mes camarades de classe. Ce devait être une super classe, puisque vingt ans après, il y a un certain Philippe qui débarque chez moi dans le but de refaire connaissance. Mais comment savoir ? Quand le ciel nous est tombé sur la tête à toi et à moi, tu m’as coupée de mon passé. Je me suis construite sur du néant. Aucun repère... À part toi, bien sûr. » Lorsque Philippe frappe à la porte d’Anne, elle ne le reconnaît pas. Elle ne se souvient plus de sa demande en mariage l’année de leurs huit ans. Tout s’est évanoui dans l’amnésie qui a suivi le grave accident dont sa famille a été victime. Philippe, lui, ne l’a jamais oubliée et dorénavant, il n’aura plus qu’une obsession : entrer définitivement dans sa vie. Mais Philippe et Anne peuvent-ils avoir un avenir commun ? Quel est le prix à payer pour faire renaître le passé ? Avec ce roman, Agnès Karinthi nous entraîne dans une quête angoissante où chacun traîne sa part d’ombres et de secrets. Plongez dans une quête angoissante où chacun traîne sa part d'ombres et de secrets, et découvrez l'histoire de Philippe et Anne : quel est le prix à payer pour faire renaître leur passé commun ? EXTRAIT Aux premiers mots d’Anne, ses amis ont repris le contrôle sur eux-mêmes. Ils saluent Philippe avec un naturel aux antipodes de leur stupéfaction première. Matéo lui offre une cordiale poignée de main. « Sa femme, Léa, enseignante également, fait souffrir les CM2 de l’école Paul Bert, notre ancienne école. » Léa fait un signe à Philippe puis interroge Anne, surprise. « Tu te rappelles avoir été à l’école avec lui ? Mais alors, tu as retrouvé la mémoire ? – Non, non. C’est Philippe qui m’a raconté tout ça. Depuis qu’il a débarqué chez moi, il est bien décidé à réveiller mes souvenirs. Il a même apporté une vieille photo de classe pour remuer mes neurones. Grâce à lui, j’ai déjà appris des tas de choses sur mon enfance. – C’est génial ! Philippe, tu vas servir de mémoire à Anne. On compte sur toi, hein ? – Promis. Je m’y efforce en tout cas. A PROPOS DE L'AUTEUR Agnès Karinthi est née en France en 1969, mais son berceau familial est la Hongrie, Budapest précisément, où son grand-père et son arrière-grand-père sont de célèbres écrivains. D’un caractère profondément rationnel, bien qu’attirée par la littérature dès son plus jeune âge, elle a développé une prédilection pour la chimie ; elle s’est consacrée à des études scientifiques et une carrière industrielle. Aujourd’hui, elle accompagne les entreprises à la prévention des risques professionnels. Pourtant, durant toutes ces années, elle continuait à dévorer livre sur livre.

Exploring the Psychology of Interest,Paul J. Silvia,Oxford University Press,2006-04-13,"Psychologists have always been interested in interest, and so modern research on interest can be found in nearly every area of the field: Researchers studying emotions, cognition, development, education, aesthetics, personality, motivation, and vocations have developed intriguing ideas about what interest is and how it works. Exploring the Psychology of Interest presents an integrated picture of how interest has been studied in all the wide-ranging areas of psychology. Using modern theories of cognition and emotion as an integrative framework, Paul Silvia examines the nature of interest, what makes things interesting, the role of interest in personality, and the development of peoples idiosyncratic interests, hobbies, and avocations. His examination reveals deep similarities between seemingly different fields of psychology and illustrates the profound importance of interest, curiosity, and intrinsic motivation for understanding why people do what they do. The most comprehensive work of its kind, Exploring the Psychology of Interest will be a valuable resource for student and professional researchers in cognitive, social, and developmental psychology.",Psychology,272,5,1,en

Elle débarque à New York en 1977 et s’installe à Soho, haut lieu de la scène artistique, où elle fréquente une tribu dissolue d’artistes rêveurs, narcisses qui la soumettent à une éducation intellectuelle et sentimentale. Reno entame alors une liaison avec l’artiste Sandro Valera, fils d’un grand industriel milanais qu’elle suit en Italie où ils sont bientôt emportés dans le tourbillon de violence des années de plomb.

American Political Music,Danny O. Crew,McFarland,2005-12-01,"Since the years before the Revolutionary War, American composers have expressed their political passions and viewpoints in song. Music inspired by political themes and politicians can reveal a great deal about significant people and events that have shaped our national political atmosphere. American Political Music provides a state-by-state inventory of thousands of songs about American political personalities from 1756 through 2004. The book documents music for all political offices except president. Within each state and the District of Columbia, the names of elected politicians, candidates for public office and other high-profile individuals appear in alphabetical order with a detailed listing of published songs that relate to them. Also included under each state where applicable is a “miscellaneous” section containing general political topics about that state—everything from temperance (“Vote Our California Dry”) to the women’s vote (“Rally Song for the Ohio Suffragist”) to the introduction of Boston’s first public water system (“Cochituate Grand Quick Step”). Under each person or topic are listed related songs, with title, tune, composer and lyricist, publisher, copyright year, and information on where a particular song or its lyrics may be found (i.e., broadsides, sheet music, songbooks, songs published in newspapers, wax cylinders, piano rolls, vinyl records, CDs, internet or mp3 files). Also included is an appendix of parodied songs demonstrating, among other things, the durability of Battle Hymn of the Republic and Yankee Doodle as fertile and favored ground for the parodist. The book also includes a list of publishers by city and indexes of song titles; authors and composers; politicians; and subjects and offices.",History,895,N/A,0,en

But do we? To find out, 11 anthropologists each spent 16 months living in communities in Africa, Asia, Europe and South America, focusing on the take up of smartphones by older people. Their research reveals that smartphones are technology for everyone, not just for the young. The Global Smartphone presents a series of original perspectives deriving from this global and comparative research project. Smartphones have become as much a place within which we live as a device we use to provide ‘perpetual opportunism’, as they are always with us. The authors show how the smartphone is more than an ‘app device’ and explore differences between what people say about smartphones and how they use them. The smartphone is unprecedented in the degree to which we can transform it. As a result, it quickly assimilates personal values. In order to comprehend it, we must take into consideration a range of national and cultural nuances, such as visual communication in China and Japan, mobile money in Cameroon and Uganda, and access to health information in Chile and Ireland – all alongside diverse trajectories of ageing in Al Quds, Brazil and Italy.

The Defining Decade,Meg Jay,Twelve,2012-04-17,"The Defining Decade has changed the way millions of twentysomethings think about their twenties—and themselves. Revised and reissued for a new generation, let it change how you think about you and yours. Our ""thirty-is-the-new-twenty"" culture tells us the twentysomething years don't matter. Some say they are an extended adolescence. Others call them an emerging adulthood. In The Defining Decade, Meg Jay argues that twentysomethings have been caught in a swirl of hype and misinformation, much of which has trivialized the most transformative time of our lives. Drawing from more than two decades of work with thousands of clients and students, Jay weaves the latest science of the twentysomething years with behind-closed-doors stories from twentysomethings themselves. The result is a provocative read that provides the tools necessary to take the most of your twenties, and shows us how work, relationships, personality, identity and even the brain can change more during this decade than at any other time in adulthood—if we use the time well. Also included in this updated edition: Up-to-date research on work, love, the brain, friendship, technology, and fertility What a decade of device use has taught us about looking at friends—and looking for love—online 29 conversations to have with your partner—or to keep in mind as you search for one A social experiment in which ""digital natives"" go without their phones A Reader's Guide for book clubs, classrooms, or further self-reflection",Psychology,251,3,4,en

"Social Support: Theory, Research and Applications",I.G. Sarason,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-11-11,"""No one is rich enough to do without a neighbor."" Traditional Danish Proverb This bit of Danish folk wisdom expresses an idea underlying much of the current thinking about social support. While the clinical literature has for a long time recognized the deleterious effects of unwholesome social relationships, only more recently has the focus broadened to include the positive side of social interaction, those interpersonal ties that are desired, rewarding, and protective. This book contains theoretical and research contributions by a group of scholars who are charting this side of the social spectrum. Evidence is increasing that maladaptive ways of thinking and behaving occur disproportionately among people with few social supports. Rather than sapping self-reliance, strong ties with others particularly family members seem to encourage it. Reliance on others and self-reliance are not only compatible but complementary to one another. While the mechanism by which an intimate relationship is protective has yet to be worked out, the following factors seem to be involved: intimacy, social integration through shared concerns, reassurance of worth, the opportunity to be nurtured by others, a sense of reliable alliance, and guidance. The major advance that is taking place in the literature on social support is that reliance is being -placed less on anecdotal and clinical evidence and more on empirical inquiry. The chapters of this book reflect this important development and identify the frontiers that are currently being explored.",Medical,518,N/A,0,en

So Good They Can't Ignore You,Cal Newport,Grand Central Publishing,2012-09-18,"In an unorthodox approach, Georgetown University professor Cal Newport debunks the long-held belief that ""follow your passion"" is good advice, and sets out on a quest to discover the reality of how people end up loving their careers. Not only are pre-existing passions rare and have little to do with how most people end up loving their work, but a focus on passion over skill can be dangerous, leading to anxiety and chronic job hopping. Spending time with organic farmers, venture capitalists, screenwriters, freelance computer programmers, and others who admitted to deriving great satisfaction from their work, Newport uncovers the strategies they used and the pitfalls they avoided in developing their compelling careers. Cal reveals that matching your job to a pre-existing passion does not matter. Passion comes after you put in the hard work to become excellent at something valuable, not before. In other words, what you do for a living is much less important than how you do it. With a title taken from the comedian Steve Martin, who once said his advice for aspiring entertainers was to ""be so good they can't ignore you,"" Cal Newport's clearly written manifesto is mandatory reading for anyone fretting about what to do with their life, or frustrated by their current job situation and eager to find a fresh new way to take control of their livelihood. He provides an evidence-based blueprint for creating work you love, and will change the way you think about careers, happiness, and the crafting of a remarkable life.",Business & Economics,163,4,1,en

(K)information,Maren Klotz,Campus Verlag,2014-05-15,"Openness about sperm and egg donation and the regulation of donor anonymity or non-anonymity are new phenomena. How do affected families, clinics, and regulators deal with information about gamete donors and the donation itself? And how does this knowledge management contribute to the creation and enactment of kinship? Addressing these questions in Germany and Britain, this ethnography makes a comparative contribution to the empirical and theoretical analysis of kin-formation and social change. Maren Klotz reveals a contemporary renegotiation of the values of privacy, information-sharing, and connectedness as they relate to the social, clinical, and regulatory management of kinship information. Transparency, not genetics, is the moral imperative, and instead of an unambiguously discernible ""geneticization,"" her findings on donor non-anonymity and parental openness display a pattern of ""transparentization."" This pattern represents a shift in authority over kinship away from the sometimes highhanded reproductive medical profession towards concerned groups, parents-by-donation, and policymakers. Bekommt ein Paar ein Kind mithilfe von gespendeten Ei- und Samenzellen, stellt sich die Frage, wie diese Familie mit dem Wissen um die Spende im Alltag umgeht. Maren Klotz untersucht, wie Verwandtschaft vor diesem Hintergrund konstruiert wird. Sie zeichnet ein Bild von Familiengründung im 21. Jahrhundert, das weniger von einer Relevanz genetischen Wissens geprägt ist, als vielmehr von Transparenz und Informationsfreiheit als neuem moralischem Gebot. Ausgezeichnet mit dem Humboldt-Preis 2013 der Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin.",Social Science,385,N/A,0,en

Research in Chinese as a Second Language,Istvan Kecskes,Walter de Gruyter,2013-05-28,"The book aims to address one of the main problems of Chinese language teaching: lack of research base. The rapidly growing interest in Chinese language teaching has not resulted in the development of a strong research background. This book attempts to change the current situation. The volume consists of three chapters. Chapter I: Research Base for Practice contains three papers, each of which uses research findings as a basis for solving issues connected with practical language teaching. Chapter II: Integrating Culture and Language is about one of the most intriguing topics of current language-oriented research: how to integrate culture into the process of language teaching. Chapter III: Acquisition of Language Structures consists of studies that investigate the acquisition of certain grammatical structures in Chinese. There are only a few papers in the literature on this issue, so the articles in this chapter are especially important for further research. One of the most important features of the volume is that each paper makes an attempt to bring together theory and practice by focusing on theory-building based on practice or theory application in practice. Thus the book can be recommended to both researchers and practitioners.",Language Arts & Disciplines,294,N/A,0,en

The Post-Apocalyptic Primer,K. Bradbury,K. Scott Bradbury,2011-01-24,"While no one looks forward to what comes after Doomsday, author K. Scott Bradbury prompts readers to consider what will happen and how to mentally and physically prepare. In his debut work of nonfiction, The Post-Apocalyptic Primer, he examines what life might look like after the end of the world and it's not as abysmal as some might fear. In ten chapters including: Assessing Your Existing Survival Skills, Civilization After the Fall of Civilization, and Eat, Drink, and Be Wary, Bradbury offers commonsense strategies that exponentially boost one's chances of a bright future. Among other Apocalyptic scenarios, he describes what one might expect after a seismic catastrophe, an ice age event, nuclear war, and alien invasion as well as the stages of disorder, which he breaks down into Instant, Coming Soon, and Slow-Burn events. Where someone lives makes a big difference, but besides new threats, there are also new careers, new hobbies, and a whole new adventure, the only trick is to be ready for it.",Reference,75,N/A,0,en

Disability in Higher Education,"Nancy J. Evans, Ellen M. Broido, Kirsten R. Brown, Autumn K. Wilke",John Wiley & Sons,2017-03-06,"Create campuses inclusive and supportive of disabled students, staff, and faculty Disability in Higher Education: A Social Justice Approach examines how disability is conceptualized in higher education and ways in which students, faculty, and staff with disabilities are viewed and served on college campuses. Drawing on multiple theoretical frameworks, research, and experience creating inclusive campuses, this text offers a new framework for understanding disability using a social justice lens. Many institutions focus solely on legal access and accommodation, enabling a system of exclusion and oppression. However, using principles of universal design, social justice, and other inclusive practices, campus environments can be transformed into more inclusive and equitable settings for all constituents. The authors consider the experiences of students, faculty, and staff with disabilities and offer strategies for addressing ableism within a variety of settings, including classrooms, residence halls, admissions and orientation, student organizations, career development, and counseling. They also expand traditional student affairs understandings of disability issues by including chapters on technology, law, theory, and disability services. Using social justice principles, the discussion spans the entire college experience of individuals with disabilities, and avoids any single-issue focus such as physical accessibility or classroom accommodations. The book will help readers: Consider issues in addition to access and accommodation Use principles of universal design to benefit students and employees in academic, cocurricular, and employment settings Understand how disability interacts with multiple aspects of identity and experience. Despite their best intentions, college personnel frequently approach disability from the singular perspective of access to the exclusion of other important issues. This book provides strategies for addressing ableism in the assumptions, policies and practices, organizational structures, attitudes, and physical structures of higher education.",Education,544,N/A,0,en

Drug Use for Grown-Ups,Dr. Carl L. Hart,Penguin,2022-01-11,"“Hart’s argument that we need to drastically revise our current view of illegal drugs is both powerful and timely . . . when it comes to the legacy of this country’s war on drugs, we should all share his outrage.” —The New York Times Book Review From one of the world's foremost experts on the subject, a powerful argument that the greatest damage from drugs flows from their being illegal, and a hopeful reckoning with the possibility of their use as part of a responsible and happy life Dr. Carl L. Hart, Ziff Professor at Columbia University and former chair of the Department of Psychology, is one of the world's preeminent experts on the effects of so-called recreational drugs on the human mind and body. Dr. Hart is open about the fact that he uses drugs himself, in a happy balance with the rest of his full and productive life as a researcher and professor, husband, father, and friend. In Drug Use for Grown-Ups, he draws on decades of research and his own personal experience to argue definitively that the criminalization and demonization of drug use--not drugs themselves--have been a tremendous scourge on America, not least in reinforcing this country's enduring structural racism. Dr. Hart did not always have this view. He came of age in one of Miami's most troubled neighborhoods at a time when many ills were being laid at the door of crack cocaine. His initial work as a researcher was aimed at proving that drug use caused bad outcomes. But one problem kept cropping up: the evidence from his research did not support his hypothesis. From inside the massively well-funded research arm of the American war on drugs, he saw how the facts did not support the ideology. The truth was dismissed and distorted in order to keep fear and outrage stoked, the funds rolling in, and Black and brown bodies behind bars. Drug Use for Grown-Ups will be controversial, to be sure: the propaganda war, Dr. Hart argues, has been tremendously effective. Imagine if the only subject of any discussion about driving automobiles was fatal car crashes. Drug Use for Grown-Ups offers a radically different vision: when used responsibly, drugs can enrich and enhance our lives. We have a long way to go, but the vital conversation this book will generate is an extraordinarily important step.",Social Science,305,N/A,0,en

Mohanty,Multilingual Matters,2018-11-01,"This book is a multidisciplinary analysis of the meaning and dynamics of multilingualism from the perspectives of multilingual societies and language communities in the margins, who are trapped in a vicious circle of disadvantage. It analyses the social, psychological and sociolinguistic processes of linguistic dominance and hierarchical relationships among languages, discrimination, marginalisation and assertive maintenance in multilingualism characterised by a Double Divide, and shows the relationship between educational neglect of languages, capability deprivation and poverty, and loss of linguistic diversity. Its comparative analysis of language-in-education policies and practices and applications of multilingual education (MLE) in diverse contexts shows some promises and challenges in the education of indigenous/tribal/minority children. This book will be of interest to students, researchers, educators and practitioners in sociolinguistics, educational linguistics, psycholinguistics, multilingualism and bilingual/multilingual education.",Language Arts & Disciplines,452,N/A,0,en

Design for Strengths,John K. Coyle,N/A,2018-03-26,"This book is for anyone who has worked very hard at something--in business, life, sport, music, hobbies--and stopped seeing progress. In these pages, John K. Coyle explores the intersection of two popular frameworks¿Design Thinking and Strengths-finding¿and shows how they can be combined to achieve breakthrough performance. Coyle demonstrates how to leverage the mindset and process of Design Thinking to define the ¿right¿ problem, and to ask and answer a ¿better question.¿ Instead of ¿how do I fix my weaknesses,¿ he re-defines the central challenge of ¿how can I design for my strengths?¿ To illuminate these concepts, Coyle weaves a fascinating thread from ¿Imaginariums"" as a student under Stanford's David Kelley, to world-class racing as a cyclist and speedskater, to applying Design Thinking to emerging business problems. With contributions from more than a dozen leading experts, including Steven Kotler, David Kelley, David Eagleman, Daniel Coyle and Chip Conley, as well as Olympic gold medalists, Apolo Ohno and Meryl Davis, this book will engage, entertain and inform.At its core, this book is about sharing the tools and mindsets required to find and reveal hidden potential, and imparting the belief that each and every one of us contains the capacity to do something extraordinary - if we design for it.",Sports & Recreation,272,N/A,0,en

Mini Habits,Stephen Guise,Selective Entertainment LLC,2013-12-22,"Discover the Life-Changing Strategy of This Worldwide Bestseller in 17 Languages! Lasting Change For Early Quitters, Burnouts, The Unmotivated, And Everyone Else Too When I decided to start exercising consistently 10 years ago, this is what actually happened: I tried ""getting motivated."" It worked sometimes.I tried setting audacious big goals. I almost always failed them.I tried to make changes last. They didn't. Like most people who try to change and fail, I assumed that I was the problem. Then one afternoon--after another failed attempt to get motivated to exercise--I (accidentally) started my first mini habit. I initially committed to do one push-up, and it turned into a full workout. I was shocked. This ""stupid idea"" wasn't supposed to work. I was shocked again when my success with this strategy continued for months (and to this day). I had to consider that maybe I wasn't the problem in those 10 years of mediocre results. Maybe it was my prior strategies that were ineffective, despite being oft-repeated as ""the way to change"" in countless books and blogs. My suspicions were correct. Is There A Scientific Explanation For This? As I sought understanding, I found a plethora of scientific studies that had answers, with nobody to interpret them correctly. Based on the science--which you'll find peppered throughout Mini Habits--we've been doing it all wrong. You can succeed without the guilt, intimidation, and repeated failure associated with such strategies as ""getting motivated,"" New Year's Resolutions, or even ""just doing it."" In fact, you need to stop using those strategies if they aren't giving you great results. Most popular strategies don't work well because they require you to fight against your subconscious brain (a fight not easily won). It's only when you start playing by your brain's rules and taking your human limitations seriously--as mini habits show you how to do--that you can achieve lasting change. What's A Mini Habit? A mini habit is a very small positive behavior that you force yourself to do every day; its ""too small to fail"" nature makes it weightless, deceptively powerful, and a superior habit-building strategy. You will have no choice but to believe in yourself when you're always moving forward. The barrier to the first step is so low that even depressed or ""stuck"" people can find early success and begin to reverse their lives right away. And if you think one push-up a day is too small to matter, I've got one heck of a story for you! Aim For The First Step They say when you aim for the moon, you'll land among the stars. Well, that doesn't make sense, as the moon is closer than the stars. I digress. The message is that you should aim very high and even if you fall short, you'll still get somewhere. I've found the opposite to be true in regards to productivity and healthy behaviors. When you aim for the moon, you won't do anything because it's too far away. But when you aim for the step in front of you, you might keep going and reach the moon. I've used the Mini Habits strategy to get into the best shape of my life, read 10x more books, and write 4x as many words. It started from requiring one push-up from myself every day. How ridiculous is that? Not so ridiculous when you consider the science of the brain, habits, and willpower. The Mini Habits system works because it's how our brains are designed to change. Note: This book isn't for eliminating bad habits (some principles could be useful for breaking habits). Mini Habits is a strategy to create permanent healthy habits in: exercise, writing, reading, thinking positively, meditating, drinking water, eating healthy foods, etc. Lasting change won't happen until you take that first step into a strategy that works. Give Mini Habits a try. You won't look back.",Self-Help,206,N/A,0,en

The Authentic Swing,Steven Pressfield,Black Irish Entertainment LLC,2013-09-24,"The Story Behind THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE If you've read his books THE WAR OF ART and TURNING PRO, you know that for thirty years Steven Pressfield (GATES OF FIRE, THE AFGHAN CAMPAIGN etc.) wrote spec novel after spec novel before any publisher took him seriously. How did he finally break through? Ignoring just about every rule of commercial book publishing, Pressfield's ""first"" novel not only became a major bestseller (over 250,000 copies sold), it was adapted into a feature film directed by Robert Redford and starring Matt Damon, Will Smith, and Charlize Theron. Where did he get the idea? What magical something did THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE have that his previous manuscripts lacked? Why did Pressfield decide to write a novel when he already had a well established screenwriting career? How does writing a publishable novel really work? Taking a page from John Steinbeck's classic JOURNAL OF A NOVEL, Steven Pressfield offers answers for these and scores of other practical writing questions in THE AUTHENTIC SWING.",Self-Help,147,N/A,0,en
ARTistic Pursuits Early Elementary K-3 Book One,Brenda Ellis,N/A,2013-01-28,"This book is sure to delight young children with over 185 colorful illustrations and great Master paintings. Lessons capture each child's interests and imagination while introducing the fundamental principles of the visual arts. Parents read a simple ten-minute lesson with their child that includes art appreciation. The topic is pointed out in a full – color work of art by well-known Masters like Rivera, Chagall, De Hooch, Van Gogh and more. This time is followed with a project that allows children to immediately apply their new knowledge of the subject, while creating works of art from their own experiences and observations, making each piece produced personal and unique. The first section covers the activities artists engage in when making art (composing, imagining, looking, etc.,) how to use the materials of an artist (watercolor crayons, pastels, pencil), and the various types of subjects artists work from (landscapes, people, still-life, etc.) Activities broaden children’s awareness of the world they live in. The second section of the book covers the elements that artists use in two-dimensional and three-dimensional work such as shape, form, line, and color. The third section is a comprehensive study of ancient art as children are introduced to different kinds of art that we see such as art in caves, pyramids, cathedrals, and more. This section covers early cave paintings and figurines from Jordon to tapestries and book illumination of the Middle Ages. Children's ideas about art are greatly expanded as they learn how ancient cultures used art. The hands-on projects help them remember what materials the culture used or the major ideas of the culture. This book provides lessons for the completion of thirty-six finished drawings, paintings, and sculptures that are both original and wholly the child’s own. “The instruction is so well-suited to the book’s audience of kindergarten to 3rd graders. Mrs. Ellis uses a conversational style of writing that is so appealing to younger children, yet her curriculum never “talks down” to them nor does it go over their heads!” - Homeschool Parent – Jenny Thompson / Florida",,95,N/A,0,en

As a brown immigrant from Mexico, assimilation had been demanded of her since the moment she set foot in San Antonio, Texas, in 1994. She’d spent so much time getting rid of her accent so no one could tell English was her second language that in that moment she felt those words—you sound like a white girl?—were a compliment. As a child, she didn’t yet understand that assimilating to “American” culture really meant imitating “white” America—that sounding like a white girl was a racist idea meant to tame her, change her, and make her small. She ran the race, completing each stage, but never quite fit in, until she stopped running altogether. In this dual polemic and manifesto, Julissa dives into and tears apart the lie that assimilation leads to belonging. She combs through history and her own story to break down this myth, arguing that assimilation is a moving finish line designed to keep Black and brown Americans and immigrants chasing racist American ideals. She talks about the Lie of Success, the Lie of Legality, the Lie of Whiteness, and the Lie of English—each promising that if you obtain these things, you will reach acceptance and won’t be an outsider anymore. Julissa deftly argues that these demands leave her and those like her in a purgatory—neither able to secure the power and belonging within whiteness nor find it in the community and cultures whiteness demands immigrants and people of color leave behind. In You Sound Like a White Girl, Julissa offers a bold new promise: Belonging only comes through celebrating yourself, your history, your culture, and everything that makes you uniquely you. Only in turning away from the white gaze can we truly make America beautiful. An America where difference is celebrated, heritage is shared and embraced, and belonging is for everyone. Through unearthing veiled history and reclaiming her own identity, Julissa shows us how to do this.",Social Science,140,N/A,0,en

In Every Mirror She's Black,Lolá Ákínmádé Åkerström,"Sourcebooks, Inc.",2021-09-07,"A Good Morning America Buzz Pick! As seen in Vulture, Essence, Good Morning America, The Independent, Goodreads, PureWow, and many more! ""A sexy, surprising, searing debut about love, loss, desire, and the many dimensions of Black womanhood.""—Deesha Philyaw, 2020 National Book Award Finalist & award-winning author of The Secret Lives of Church Ladies An arresting debut for anyone looking for insight into what it means to be a Black woman in the world. Three Black women are linked in unexpected ways to the same influential white man in Stockholm as they build their new lives in the most open society run by the most private people. Successful marketing executive Kemi Adeyemi is lured from the U.S. to Sweden by Jonny von Lundin, CEO of the nation's largest marketing firm, to help fix a PR fiasco involving a racially tone-deaf campaign. A killer at work but a failure in love, Kemi's move is a last-ditch effort to reclaim her social life. A chance meeting with Jonny in business class en route to the U.S. propels former model-turned-flight-attendant Brittany-Rae Johnson into a life of wealth, luxury, and privilege—a life she's not sure she wants—as the object of his unhealthy obsession. And refugee Muna Saheed, who lost her entire family, finds a job cleaning the toilets at Jonny's office as she works to establish her residency in Sweden and, more importantly, seeks connection and a place she can call home. Told through the perspectives of each of the three women, In Every Mirror She's Black is a fast-paced, richly nuanced yet accessible contemporary novel that touches on important social issues of racism, classism, fetishization, and tokenism, and what it means to be a Black woman navigating a white-dominated society. Praise for In Every Mirror She's Black: ""In Every Mirror She's Black is a wise and complicated exploration of the lives of three Black women in America and Sweden. Lola Akinmade Åkerström offers a sharply written story with messy, deeply moving characters, raising brutal questions and steering clear of easy answers. A book that will stick with you long after you've turned the last page."" —Taylor Jenkins Reid, New York Times bestselling author of Daisy Jones & The Six and Malibu Rising ""In Every Mirror She's Black highlights the struggles of three women fighting to assimilate into a society that ignores their worth. These characters will pull at your heartstrings. Lola writes with a contemporary flair, highlighting the layered subtleties of the Black woman's plight. In Every Mirror She's Black will stay with readers for a long time."" —Nicole Dennis-Benn, author of bestselling novels Here Comes the Sun and Patsy ""In her debut novel, Lola Akinmade Akerstrom has given us a story that is at once enjoyable and disturbing as it explores the painful price millions of women around the world pay for walking around with black skin."" —Imbolo Mbue, New York Times bestselling author of Behold the Dreamers",Fiction,319,N/A,0,en

The Way I Saw It,Harold A Stein M D Msc (Oph) Frcsc,AuthorHouse,2013-04-02,"""My walk through life in words and pictures."" HS Dr. Harold Stein grew up in the small border town of Niagara Falls, Canada and went on to become a world authority in ophthalmology. Not all the things he learned along the way came from a text book or lecture as he illustrates in his memoirs. Follow along as he traces his early years, dodging across moving trains to get to school, trading a rifle for bugle in high school and the life changing encounter which inspired him to choose medicine as a career. While ophthalmology is a serious specialty, Dr. Stein never loses sight of his sense of humor, sharing his own faux pas in investments, family life and medicine. His stories are also a journey through history: the pre war years in Canada, of the post-war years at university as Toronto grew to become a world class city. In those years society, culture and technology changes and Dr. Stein gives us a front row seat through the 1950s and 1960s as he pursues his studies at the world famous Mayo Clinic and later Oxford University before starting at a suburban hospital built on a dirt road and surrounded by farms. Join him as he travels the world, sometimes for pleasure, sometimes to give back by using his skills to treat patients in the third world who would otherwise be blind or go blind. It's an adventure of a lifetime with lots of laughs along the way. HAROLD A.

Sick children are cared for at home, in children's units and hospitals, and sometimes in adult wards. In addition, children with disabilities may need nursing care while at special schools or in residential settings. This book provides a clinical manual of common practices. Each practice is research-based and presented in a common format which covers: - Objectives - Rationale - Factors to note - Guidelines - Positioning - Equipment - Method - Special observations and possible complications - References and further reading The guidelines have been written specifically for children's nursing by contributors from well-known children's units. They are not simply adaptations from adult practices and therefore recognise the unique differences between adult and children's nursing. The introductory section covers common concepts and infection control. There is also a chapter on complementary therapies and an appendix on the use of play as a distraction. All hospital and community nurses dealing with children, whether at home, in specialised units or in community settings, will find the book of great practical help. - The common format of each practice makes the book easy to use and refer to in a clinical setting. - Each practice is based on the latest research to ensure it is evidence-based and up to date - Introductory chapters cover issues common to all practices to make the book easier to use. - The appendix on play reinforces its common usage as a distraction technique - A chapter on complementary therapies explains these as they are becoming more widespread - All practices have been reviewed by regional centres to avoid parochialism - Content reorganised to reflect the Essential Skills Clusters from the NMC - New chapter on communicating with children - All chapters updated to reflect the current evidence base",Medical,502,N/A,0,en

Culturally Responsive Pedagogy,"Fatima Pirbhai-Illich, Shauneen Pete, Fran Martin",Springer,2017-03-03,"This book convincingly argues that effective culturally responsive pedagogies require teachers to firstly undertake a critical deconstruction of Self in relation to and with the Other; and secondly, to take into account how power affects the socio-political, cultural and historical contexts in which the education relation takes place. The contributing authors are from a range of diaspora, indigenous, and white mainstream communities, and are united in their desire to challenge the hegemony of Eurocentric education and to create new educational spaces that are more socially and environmentally just. In this venture, the ideal education process is seen to be inherently critical and intercultural, where mainstream and marginalized, colonized and colonizer, indigenous and settler communities work together to decolonize selves, teacher-student relationships, pedagogies, the curriculum and the education system itself. This book will be of great interest and relevance to policy-makers and researchers in the field of education; teacher educators; and pre- and in-service teachers.",Education,265,N/A,0,en

Are you curious how to get or keep the job of your dreams? Do you want to become a more popular person? This book will show you how to do all that by raising your likeability factor—or how much other people like you. After all, life is a series of popularity contests.

This book will show you how to raise that likeability factor by teaching you how to boost four critical elements of your personality: •Friendliness: your ability to communicate liking and openness to others •Relevance: your capacity to connect with others’ interests, wants, and needs •Empathy: your ability to recognize, acknowledge, and experience other people’s feelings •Realness: the integrity that stands behind your likeability and guarantees its authenticity What happens when you improve in these areas and boost your likeability factor? •You bring out the best in others •You survive life’s challenges •You have better health—and even improve others’ health, too •You outperform in your daily roles •You win the popularity contests that define your life Join me for a few hours and I’ll share the results of hundreds of thousands of pages of research, numerous seminars, and hundreds of interviews with people just like you!

Different Childhoods,"Lindsay O'Dell, Charlotte Brownlow, Hanna Bertilsdotter-Rosqvist",Routledge,2017-10-10,"Different Childhoods: Non/Normative Development and Transgressive Trajectories opens up new avenues for exploring children’s development as contextual, provisional and locally produced, rather than a unitary, universal and consistent process. This edited collection frames a critical exploration of the trajectory against which children are seen to be ‘different’ within three key themes: deconstructing ‘developmental tasks’, locating development and the limits of childhood. Examining the particular kinds of ‘transgressive’ development, contributors discuss instances of ‘difference’ including migration, work, assumptions of vulnerability, trans childhoods, friendships and involvement in crime. Including both empirical and theoretical discussions, the book builds on existing debates as part of the interrogation of ‘different childhoods’. This book provides essential reading for students wishing to explore notions of development while also being of interest to both academics and practitioners working across a broad area of disciplines such as developmental psychology, sociology, childhood studies and critical criminology.",Psychology,209,N/A,0,en
The Media and the Models of Masculinity,Mark Moss,Lexington Books,2012-07-10,"Mark Moss's The Media and the Models of Masculinity details the impact that the mass media has upon men's sense of identity, style, and deportment. From advertising to television shows, mass consumer culture defines and identifies how men select and sort what is fashionable and acceptable. Utilizing a large mine of mediated imagery, men and boys construct and define how to dress, act, and comport themselves. By engaging critical discussions on everything from fashion, to domestic space, to sports and beyond, readers are privy to a modern and fascinating account of the diverse and dominant perceptions of and on Western masculine culture. Historical tropes and models are especially important in this construction and influence and impact contemporary variations.",Social Science,220,N/A,0,en

Serious Leisure,Robert A. Stebbins,Transaction Publishers,2011-12-31,"Serious Leisure offers a comprehensive view and analysis of the current state of the sociology of leisure. Defining and differentiating the way people use their free time, Stebbins divides such activity into categories of serious, casual, and project-based leisure that he further separates into a variety of types and subtypes. Together they comprise what he calls ""serious leisure."" In this perspective, serious leisure constitutes systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial and interesting in nature and requiring special skills, knowledge, and experience. Casual leisure, though immediately, intrinsically rewarding, is by contrast a relatively short-lived pleasurable activity, requiring little or no special training to enjoy it. Project-based leisure is a short-term, reasonably complicated, occasional creative undertaking carried out in free time. Stebbins sets out the basic concepts and propositions that make up the three forms, focusing on their essential elements. He takes stock of the serious leisure literature as well as that for casual and project-based leisure. Stebbins sees ""serious leisure"" realized by way of a set of foundational concepts--organization, community, history, lifestyle, and culture--and several of their component areas. He reviews the history and background of the concept of serious leisure and then adds historical commentary on, first, casual leisure and, then, project-based leisure. Finally, he examines the future and the importance of the serious leisure perspective in a globalizing world, and some of its critical links with other fields of knowledge and practice, notably the nonprofit sector and preventive medicine. Together with its original insights, Serious Leisure offers a single, handy, coherent, comprehensive resource. It will be of interest to sociologists, labor studies specialists, and economists.",Social Science,177,N/A,0,en

Overwhelmed,Brigid Schulte,A&C Black,2014-03-13,"______________________ 'Too much to do? Stop and read this' - Guardian 'For a fresh take on an eternal dilemma, Overwhelmed is worth a few hours of any busy woman's life – if only to ensure that she doesn't drop off the bottom of her own “To Do” list' - Mail on Sunday ______________________ In her attempts to juggle work and family life, Brigid Schulte has baked cakes until 2 a.m., frantically (but surreptitiously) sent important emails during school trips and then worked long into the night after her children were in bed. Realising she had become someone who constantly burst in late, trailing shoes and schoolbooks and biscuit crumbs, she began to question, like so many of us, whether it is possible to be anything you want to be, have a family and still have time to breathe. So when Schulte met an eminent sociologist who studies time and he told her she enjoyed thirty hours of leisure each week, she thought her head was going to pop off. What followed was a trip down the rabbit hole of busy-ness, a journey to discover why so many of us find it near-impossible to press the 'pause' button on life and what got us here in the first place. Overwhelmed maps the individual, historical, biological and societal stresses that have ripped working mothers' and fathers' leisure to shreds, and asks how it might be possible for us to put the pieces back together. Seeking insights, answers and inspiration, Schulte explores everything from the wiring of the brain and why workplaces are becoming increasingly demanding, to worldwide differences in family policy, how cultural norms shape our experiences at work, our unequal division of labour at home and why it's so hard for everyone – but women especially – to feel they deserve an elusive moment of peace. ______________________ 'Every parent, every caregiver, every person who feels besieged by permanent busyness, must read this book' - Anne-Marie Slaughter, author of Why Women Still Can't Have It All",Biography & Autobiography,398,N/A,0,en

Show Your Work!,Austin Kleon,Workman Publishing,2014-03-06,"In his New York Times bestseller Steal Like an Artist, Austin Kleon showed readers how to unlock their creativity by “stealing” from the community of other movers and shakers. Now, in an even more forward-thinking and necessary book, he shows how to take that critical next step on a creative journey—getting known. Show Your Work! is about why generosity trumps genius. It’s about getting findable, about using the network instead of wasting time “networking.” It’s not self-promotion, it’s self-discovery—let others into your process, then let them steal from you. Filled with illustrations, quotes, stories, and examples, Show Your Work! offers ten transformative rules for being open, generous, brave, productive. In chapters such as You Don’t Have to Be a Genius; Share Something Small Every Day; and Stick Around, Kleon creates a user’s manual for embracing the communal nature of creativity— what he calls the “ecology of talent.” From broader life lessons about work (you can’t find your voice if you don’t use it) to the etiquette of sharing—and the dangers of oversharing—to the practicalities of Internet life (build a good domain name; give credit when credit is due), it’s an inspiring manifesto for succeeding as any kind of artist or entrepreneur in the digital age.",Self-Help,225,N/A,0,en
All American Boys,"Jason Reynolds, Brendan Kiely",Simon and Schuster,2015-09-29,"A 2016 Coretta Scott King Author Honor book, and recipient of the Walter Dean Myers Award for Outstanding Children’s Literature. In this New York Times bestselling novel, two teens—one black, one white—grapple with the repercussions of a single violent act that leaves their school, their community, and, ultimately, the country bitterly divided by racial tension. A bag of chips. That’s all sixteen-year-old Rashad is looking for at the corner bodega. What he finds instead is a fist-happy cop, Paul Galluzzo, who mistakes Rashad for a shoplifter, mistakes Rashad’s pleadings that he’s stolen nothing for belligerence, mistakes Rashad’s resistance to leave the bodega as resisting arrest, mistakes Rashad’s every flinch at every punch the cop throws as further resistance and refusal to STAY STILL as ordered. But how can you stay still when someone is pounding your face into the concrete pavement? There were witnesses: Quinn Collins—a varsity basketball player and Rashad’s classmate who has been raised by Paul since his own father died in Afghanistan—and a video camera. Soon the beating is all over the news and Paul is getting threatened with accusations of prejudice and racial brutality. Quinn refuses to believe that the man who has basically been his savior could possibly be guilty. But then Rashad is absent. And absent again. And again. And the basketball team—half of whom are Rashad’s best friends—start to take sides. As does the school. And the town. Simmering tensions threaten to explode as Rashad and Quinn are forced to face decisions and consequences they had never considered before. Written in tandem by two award-winning authors, this four-starred reviewed tour de force shares the alternating perspectives of Rashad and Quinn as the complications from that single violent moment, the type taken directly from today’s headlines, unfold and reverberate to highlight an unwelcome truth.",Young Adult Fiction,229,4,4,en

I'M NOT A... BUT I CAN BECOME A...,Edna Moore,"Fulton Books, Inc.",2022-09-28,"Words of encouragement help children become the person God created them to be. Changing the words ""i'm not a ..."" to ""i am a ..."" is critical to building a positive self-concept. Children are less likely to focus on their imperfections, negative thoughts, and shortcomings when they have talents, skills, hobbies, and special interests. Children paint a mental picture of themselves from the words significant others say to them: parents, teachers, ministers.",Self-Help,57,N/A,0,en
Debating Otaku in Contemporary Japan,"Patrick W. Galbraith, Thiam Huat Kam, Björn-Ole Kamm",Bloomsbury Publishing,2015-05-21,"With the spread of manga (Japanese comics) and anime (Japanese cartoons) around the world, many have adopted the Japanese term 'otaku' to identify fans of such media. The connection to manga and anime may seem straightforward, but, when taken for granted, often serves to obscure the debates within and around media fandom in Japan since the term 'otaku' appeared in the niche publication Manga Burikko in 1983. Debating Otaku in Contemporary Japan disrupts the naturalization and trivialization of 'otaku' by examining the historical contingency of the term as a way to identify and contain problematic youth, consumers and fan cultures in Japan. Its chapters, many translated from Japanese and available in English for the first time – and with a foreword by Otsuka Eiji, former editor of Manga Burikko – explore key moments in the evolving discourse of 'otaku' in Japan. Rather than presenting a smooth, triumphant narrative of the transition of a subculture to the mainstream, the edited volume repositions 'otaku' in specific historical, social and economic contexts, providing new insights into the significance of the 'otaku' phenomenon in Japan and the world. By going back to original Japanese documents, translating key contributions by Japanese scholars and offering sustained analysis of these documents and scholars, Debating Otaku in Contemporary Japan provides alternative histories of and approaches to 'otaku'. For all students and scholars of contemporary Japan and the history of Japanese fan and consumer cultures, this volume will be a foundation for understanding how 'otaku', at different places and times and to different people, is meaningful.",History,233,N/A,0,en

Journey of a Believer,Bob Reinsch,"Covenant Books, Inc.",2023-12-05,"A map almost ruined our honeymoon. It was our second day of marriage, and as we were driving up the Olympic Peninsula to Port Angeles, I found it difficult to read the map and drive at the same time. So I handed the map to my Debbie and asked her to tell me where to turn. As a new believer, I felt like Debbie: Someone hands you a Bible and expects you to know how to read it. Jesus had transformed me into a new creation, but I was a baby who did childish things and needed a parent to nurture me along and stimulate my spiritual development. I hope that in a way, I can be that for you as you read the lessons I learned in my pursuit to be a follower of Christ, such as learning to effectively tell people how Jesus changed my life, becoming consistent in spending time alone with God, letting prayer be a vital part of my life, discovering what helps grow my faith, finding an easy way to study the Bible, and mastering sin in my life. I thank my heavenly Father and Lord Jesus for my journey because with each lesson, I have grown closer to Them. As that intimacy deepens, so does the longing to be with Them in heaven. My prayer is that this will happen to you as I share my journey with you.",Religion,229,N/A,0,en

I'm Here to Offend,Keith Sanks,Dorrance Publishing,2024-08-20,"In this gripping book, you're about to embark on a rollercoaster ride through the raw and unfiltered moments of my life. Get ready for a no-holds-barred exploration of the challenges that have shaped me. From turbulent family dynamics to grappling with the shadows of depression, I peel back the layers on my journey. Childhood memories, those defining incidents, and the seismic moments that shook my beliefs – it's all laid bare, exposing the profound impact of trauma on my world view. But this isn't just a recounting of events; it's a gutsy attempt to redefine my convictions, to challenge the status quo that life handed me. Amidst the uncertainties, join me in a search for meaning that takes unexpected turns. Feel the weight of isolation, navigate the intricate dance of independence, and grapple with the bittersweet truth that true connection often remains elusive, even in the lap of financial autonomy. And woven into the fabric of these experiences is the undeniable realization that the falsehoods my parents hold so dear have been unquestionably shattered by the trials I've faced. As the threads of my life are woven together, I invite you not just to read but to immerse yourself. Brace for the unexpected as I find my footing through intense self-reflection in the face of life's relentless challenges.",Biography & Autobiography,293,N/A,0,en

Culture and Customs of the United States [2 volumes],Benjamin F. Shearer,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2007-12-30,"American life and culture is truly unique in that it was born from many other cultures around the world. When immigrants migrated to the Land of Opportunity, they brought with them pieces of their own heritage: foods, religions, holidays, festivals, music, and art, just to name a few. Through time, these customs have developed into what we now know as American life. Explore how even within the US, various cultures and customs differ from New England to the Midwest to the Pacific. Discover how many religions are practiced all over the country, and how each sect differs in its celebration. Learn how gender plays an important role in American society, and how things have changed and progressed in the past century. Readers will learn about American holidays-religious, federal, and even those fabricated by Hallmark and television! Sports, leisure activities, and fashion also play a major role in American culture, as discussed in this all-encompassing work. Discover how American cuisine has evolved from other cultures, such as Italian, Greek, Mexican, Chinese, Indian, and West Africa, and how each region has its own indigenous dishes, including New England clam chowder, Southern jambalaya, and Mid-western lutefisk. Contemporary and classic literature is also discussed, along with the evolution of poetry. Readers will learn about the development of mass media, as well as the growth of cinema and films from the first silent film to today's popular blockbuster trilogy Pirates of the Caribbean. Music and dance are also discussed in detail, covering the New York Philharmonic to Woodstock.

Marital Relationships and Parenting: Intimate relations and their correlates,Ami Rokach,Routledge,2018-11-09,"Romantic relationships, especially good ones, are desired of almost all humans. However, what makes such relationships good and nourishing? For the most part, it is the support and intimacy that exists within the couple, and their ability to experience life and face difficulties together. This book is divided into two sections, one focusing on the couple and their intimate relationship, and the other on how that relationship influences their offspring. Part one examines whether sacrificing in an intimate relationship is always beneficial and whether it help strengthen the marital/couple unit? Attachment theory has had a significant influence on how we view relationships in childhood as well as in adulthood. The book sheds light on the mechanisms that mediate attachment style and the quality of the intimate relationships, exploring the relationship between one’s ability to express empathy and that person’s ability to offer social support to his/her partner. The second part of the book explores what young adults think about marriage, influenced by their parental relationship; how parental relationships affect children’s social experience in school; how parental approaches to children affect their sibling relationship; the parental role in childhood eating disturbances; and how the family climate affects children’s loneliness. All in all, the book affords a thorough review not only of what marital/couple intimacy is and what can affect it, but how significant it is in affecting their children, in and out of the house.

They say beauty is only skin-deep, but there is power in embracing your outward beauty as the first step in living with internal boldness, confidence, and renewed joy. An outside-in approach to beauty isn’t for other people’s perception of you, but for your interpretation of yourself and how much you’re willing to explore. Sachse has confirmed the unmistakable link between external appearance and self-confidence, and she wants to show you how to rekindle both. In the pages of this book, Sachse offers a vulnerable look into her own mistakes and imperfections and explains how making over her outward appearance resulted in a happier and healthier version of herself—emotionally, spiritually, and physically. Filled with confidence-boosting wisdom about cultivating rest and lifegiving hobbies, Sachse shows you: how making small changes to your outward appearance can be a pathway to building confidence and making other new transformations in your life practical tips about hair, makeup, and fashion from an expert the benefits of taking bold risks – your life is too valuable to be left on autopilot how to analyze your past and see where you self-sabotaged, and look for traits that served you well and can serve you in the future Sachse knows no amount of makeup can compare to the look of a confident, classy, and kind woman, and that there’s nothing like the glow that comes from inner beauty.

Careerealism,J. T. O'Donnell,Dog Ear Publishing,2008-04,"Why are so many people unhappy on-the-job? . As many as 7 out of 10 Americans are currently dissatisfied with their careers. . Expensive college degrees are seen by our society as a requirement to enter the American workforce. Yet, many students fail to graduate with the skills and knowedge necessary to embark on a satisfying career path.The result is an unprepared individual, saddled with debt, and frustrated with a system that has left them hanging with respect to making good career decisions. . The concept of work-life balance continues to elude our society as thousands of workers complain of 'living to work' instead of 'working to live.' It's no secret that career satisfaction eludes much of the American working population, but what's worse is the lack of resources and coaching to help today's employee find the career satisfaction they seek. In this innovative, step-by-step guide, workplace expert, professional development specialist, and nationally syndicated career advice columnist, J.T. O'Donnell (www.jtodonnell.com) unlocks the secrets to working smarter when it comes to creating a career you can get excited about.With more than 15 years experience, having coached thousands of individuals, O'Donnell will show you how to develop an authentic definition of professional success that will get you results. Here's what readers have to say: Her strategic approach really helped me flesh out what traits and experience I brought to the table for a potential employer in a different field. Her methods, encouragement and continued support have led me to find the right career path.- Helen D. I hated my job, wanted out, and didn't know where to begin. I had a decision to make: I could continue on the track to working my 9-5 job in front of a desk and let it define me and make me miserable, or look for something different. J.T.showed me that it's not your job that defines you at all;it's you who defines your job. She worked with me to figure out my strengths and work on my weaknesses. J.T.helped me learn that who I am is far more than the paycheck I bring in. Through that exploration of my own real desires, J.T.helped me to realize that I needed a far more creative outlet to be successful in.

18 Minutes,Peter Bregman,Business Plus,2011-09-28,"Based upon his weekly Harvard Business Review columns (which is one of the most popular columns on HBR.com, receiving hundreds of thousands of unique page views a month), 18 Minutes clearly shows how busy people can cut through all the daily clutter and distractions and find a way to focus on those key items which are truly the top priorities in our lives. Bregman works from the premise that the best way to combat constant and distracting interruptions is to create productive distractions of one's own. Based upon a series of short bite-sized chapters, his approach allows us to safely navigate through the constant chatter of emails, text messages, phone calls, and endless meetings that prevent us from focusing our time on those things that are truly important to us. Mixing first-person insights along with unique case studies, Bregman sprinkles his charming book with pathways which help guide us --pathways that can get us on the right trail in 18 minutes or less.",Business & Economics,176,4,2,en

Concern about the aging population tends to focus on the adequacy of Medicare and Social Security, retirement of older Americans, and the need to identify policies, programs, and strategies that address the health and safety needs of older workers. Older workers differ from their younger counterparts in a variety of physical, psychological, and social factors. Evaluating the extent, causes, and effects of these factors and improving the research and data systems necessary to address the health and safety needs of older workers may significantly impact both their ability to remain in the workforce and their well being in retirement. Health and Safety Needs of Older Workers provides an image of what is currently known about the health and safety needs of older workers and the research needed to encourage social polices that guarantee older workers a meaningful share of the nation's work opportunities.",Social Science,319,N/A,0,en

Politics Is for Power,Eitan Hersh,Scribner,2020-01-14,"A brilliant condemnation of political hobbyism—treating politics like entertainment—and a call to arms for well-meaning, well-informed citizens who consume political news, but do not take political action. Who is to blame for our broken politics? The uncomfortable answer to this question starts with ordinary citizens with good intentions. We vote (sometimes) and occasionally sign a petition or attend a rally. But we mainly “engage” by consuming politics as if it’s a sport or a hobby. We soak in daily political gossip and eat up statistics about who’s up and who’s down. We tweet and post and share. We crave outrage. The hours we spend on politics are used mainly as pastime. Instead, we should be spending the same number of hours building political organizations, implementing a long-term vision for our city or town, and getting to know our neighbors, whose votes will be needed for solving hard problems. We could be accumulating power so that when there are opportunities to make a difference—to lobby, to advocate, to mobilize—we will be ready. But most of us who are spending time on politics today are focused inward, choosing roles and activities designed for our short-term pleasure. We are repelled by the slow-and-steady activities that characterize service to the common good. In Politics Is for Power, pioneering and brilliant data analyst Eitan Hersh shows us a way toward more effective political participation. Aided by political theory, history, cutting-edge social science, as well as remarkable stories of ordinary citizens who got off their couches and took political power seriously, this book shows us how to channel our energy away from political hobbyism and toward empowering our values.",Political Science,288,N/A,0,en

I wrote it because I believe everyone deserves a place to belong and I didn't want poor social skills to hold anyone back from friendship and community. even if they struggle with social skills. I know firsthand how hard it is to struggle socially. Growing up, I was bullied, harassed, and excluded -- no matter how hard I tried to fit in. It wasn't until I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome that I put the puzzle pieces together. I realized I struggled socially because I didn't have any social skills -- and just like any other skill, social skills can be learned. So I started to learn them. It took hard work, but I soon started to see improvement in my ability to interact with others. Eventually I was able to start making wonderful friends and today I feel comfortable and confident in all sorts of social interactions.On January 1st, 2012, I launched ImproveYourSocialSkills.com to share what I'd learned with the world. Hundreds of thousands of people visit the site every year, and I'm excited to help even more with the Improve Your Social Skills Kindle guide.The guide you're about to read is a compilation of the social principles I've learned during my lifetime of personal social skills study, as well as the techniques I developed while offering hundreds of hours of social skills coaching. These principles led me to a life full of close friendship, satisfying connection, and tender romance.I believe that with these principles, you can live a life full to the brim with friendship, connection, and love. I hope that after reading Improve Your Social Skills, you'll believe that too.",,218,N/A,0,en

Have You Seen Marie?,Sandra Cisneros,Vintage,2012-10-02,"The internationally acclaimed author of The House on Mango Street and winner of the PEN/Nabokov Award for Achievement in International Literature gives us a deeply moving tale of loss, grief, and healing: a lyrically told, richly illustrated fable for grown-ups about a woman’s search for a cat who goes missing in the wake of her mother’s death. The word “orphan” might not seem to apply to a fifty-three-year-old woman. Yet this is exactly how Sandra feels as she finds herself motherless, alone like “a glove left behind at the bus station.” What just might save her is her search for someone else gone missing: Marie, the black-and-white cat of her friend, Roz, who ran off the day they arrived from Tacoma. As Sandra and Roz scour the streets of San Antonio, posting flyers and asking everywhere, “Have you seen Marie?” the pursuit of this one small creature takes on unexpected urgency and meaning. With full-color illustrations that bring this transformative quest to vivid life, Have You Seen Marie? showcases a beloved author’s storytelling magic, in a tale that reminds us how love, even when it goes astray, does not stay lost forever.",Fiction,152,5,1,en

Obliquity,John Kay,Profile Books,2011-02-03,"If you want to go in one direction, the best route may involve going in another. This is the concept of 'obliquity': paradoxical as it sounds, many goals are more likely to be achieved when pursued indirectly. The richest men and women are not the most materialistic; the happiest people are not necessarily those who focus on happiness, and the most profitable companies are not always the most profit-oriented as the recent financial crisis showed us. Whether overcoming geographical obstacles, winning decisive battles or meeting sales targets, history shows that oblique approaches are the most successful, especially in difficult terrain.

Searching for God Knows What,"Don Miller, Donald Miller",HarperChristian + ORM,2010-05-24,"With equal parts wit and wisdom, New York Times bestselling author Donald Miller invites you to reconnect with your faith. Miller shares what he's learned firsthand--that our relationship with God is designed to teach us about redemption, grace, healing, and so much more. Searching for God Knows What weaves together timeless stories and fresh perspectives on the Bible to capture one man's journey to discover an authentic faith that's worth believing. Along the way, Miller poses his own questions about faith, religion, and community, asking: What if the motive behind our theology was relational? What if our value exists because God takes pleasure in us? What if the gospel of Jesus is an invitation to know God? Maybe you're a Christian wondering what faith you signed up for. Or maybe you don't believe anything and are daring someone to show you a genuine example of genuine faith. Somewhere beyond the self-help formulas, fancy marketing, and easy promises, there is a life-changing experience with God waiting for you--it just takes a little bit of searching. Praise for Searching for God Knows What: ""Like a shaken snow globe, Donald Miller's newest collection of essays creates a swirl of ideas about the Christian life that eventually crystallize into a lovely landscape...[He] is one of the evangelical book market's most creative writers."" --Christianity Today ""If you have felt that Jesus is someone you respect and admire--but Christianity is something that repels you--Searching for God Knows What will give you hope that you still can follow Jesus and be part of a church without the trappings of organized religion."" --Dan Kimball, author of The Emerging Church and Pastor of Vintage Faith Church, Santa Cruz, CA ""For fans of Blue Like Jazz, I doubt you will be disappointed.

Oil and Dust,Jami Fairleigh,Kitsune Publishing,2021-09-01,"When all has been lost, we find ourselves… Out of the ashes of destruction, a new world has arisen. The plagues of the past—the worship of greed and pursuit of power—are gone. Now, the communities that remain in this post-apocalyptic world focus on creating connections, on forging futures filled with family and love. And all with the help of hard work, hope… and a little bit of magic. Artist Matthew Sugiyama knows this well. Traveling the countryside in search of the family he lost as a child, he trades his art for supplies—and uses his honed magic to re-draw the boundaries of reality, to fashion a world that is better for those he meets. Following glimpses of visions half-seen, Matthew—and the friends he encounters along the way—will travel a path from light to darkness and back again. A road where things lost in the past can only be found in the love of the present, and the hope for the future. And he will travel this path wherever it leads. From joy to sorrow, from tears to laughter. Because Matthew is the Elemental Artist, and he knows that though dangers arise, humanity will always triumph… in a world he has painted in shades of Oil and Dust.

Between a Rock and a Hard Place,Aron Ralston,Simon and Schuster,2004-09-15,"One of the most extraordinary survival stories ever told -- Aron Ralston's searing account of his six days trapped in one of the most remote spots in America, and how one inspired act of bravery brought him home. It started out as a simple hike in the Utah canyonlands on a warm Saturday afternoon. For Aron Ralston, a twenty-seven-year-old mountaineer and outdoorsman, a walk into the remote Blue John Canyon was a chance to get a break from a winter of solo climbing Colorado's highest and toughest peaks. He'd earned this weekend vacation, and though he met two charming women along the way, by early afternoon he finally found himself in his element: alone, with just the beauty of the natural world all around him. It was 2:41 P.M. Eight miles from his truck, in a deep and narrow slot canyon, Aron was climbing down off a wedged boulder when the rock suddenly, and terrifyingly, came loose. Before he could get out of the way, the falling stone pinned his right hand and wrist against the canyon wall. And so began six days of hell for Aron Ralston. With scant water and little food, no jacket for the painfully cold nights, and the terrible knowledge that he'd told no one where he was headed, he found himself facing a lingering death -- trapped by an 800-pound boulder 100 feet down in the bottom of a canyon. As he eliminated his escape options one by one through the days, Aron faced the full horror of his predicament: By the time any possible search and rescue effort would begin, he'd most probably have died of dehydration, if a flash flood didn't drown him before that. What does one do in the face of almost certain death? Using the video camera from his pack, Aron began recording his grateful good-byes to his family and friends all over the country, thinking back over a life filled with adventure, and documenting a last will and testament with the hope that someone would find it. (For their part, his family and friends had instigated a major search for Aron, the amazing details of which are also documented here for the first time.) The knowledge of their love kept Aron Ralston alive, until a divine inspiration on Thursday morning solved the riddle of the boulder. Aron then committed the most extreme act imaginable to save himself. Between a Rock and a Hard Place -- a brilliantly written, funny, honest, inspiring, and downright astonishing report from the line where death meets life -- will surely take its place in the annals of classic adventure stories.",Biography & Autobiography,368,3.5,14,en
The Great Society Subway,Zachary M. Schrag,JHU Press,2014-08,"As Metro stretches to Tysons Corner and beyond, this paperback edition features a new preface from the author. Drivers in the nation's capital face a host of hazards: high-speed traffic circles, presidential motorcades, jaywalking tourists, and bewildering signs that send unsuspecting motorists from the Lincoln Memorial into suburban Virginia in less than two minutes. And parking? Don't bet on it unless you're in the fast lane of the Capital Beltway during rush hour. Little wonder, then, that so many residents and visitors rely on the Washington Metro, the 106-mile rapid transit system that serves the District of Columbia and its inner suburbs. In the first comprehensive history of the Metro, Zachary M. Schrag tells the story of the Great Society Subway from its earliest rumblings to the present day, from Arlington to College Park, Eisenhower to Marion Barry. Unlike the pre–World War II rail systems of New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia, the Metro was built at a time when most American families already owned cars, and when most American cities had dedicated themselves to freeways, not subways. Why did the nation's capital take a different path? What were the consequences of that decision? Using extensive archival research as well as oral history, Schrag argues that the Metro can be understood only in the political context from which it was born: the Great Society liberalism of the Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon administrations. The Metro emerged from a period when Americans believed in public investments suited to the grandeur and dignity of the world's richest nation. The Metro was built not merely to move commuters, but in the words of Lyndon Johnson, to create ""a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community."" Schrag scrutinizes the project from its earliest days, including general planning, routes, station architecture, funding decisions, land-use impacts, and the behavior of Metro riders. The story of the Great Society Subway sheds light on the development of metropolitan Washington, postwar urban policy, and the promises and limits of rail transit in American cities.",Architecture,380,N/A,0,en
Neurofunctional Prudence and Morality,Marcus Arvan,Routledge,2020-01-29,"Philosophers across many traditions have long theorized about the relationship between prudence and morality. Few clear answers have emerged, however, in large part because of the inherently speculative nature of traditional philosophical methods. This book aims to forge a bold new path forward, outlining a theory of prudence and morality that unifies a wide variety of findings in neuroscience with philosophically sophisticated normative theorizing. The author summarizes the emerging behavioral neuroscience of prudence and morality, showing how human moral and prudential cognition and motivation are known to involve over a dozen brain regions and capacities. He then outlines a detailed philosophical theory of prudence and morality based on neuroscience and lived human experience. The result demonstrates how this theory coheres with and explains the behavioral neuroscience, showing how each brain region and capacity interact to give rise to prudential and moral behavior. Neurofunctional Prudence and Morality: A Philosophical Theory will be of interest to philosophers and psychologists working in moral psychology, neuroethics, and decision theory.

Community Capacity and Resilience in Latin America,"Paul R. Lachapelle, Isabel Gutierrez-Montes, Cornelia Butler Flora",Routledge,2020-05-20,"Community Capacity and Resilience in Latin America addresses the role of communities in building their capacity to increase resiliency and carry out rural development strategies in Latin America. Resiliency in a community sense is associated with an ability to address stress and respond to shock while obtaining participatory engagement in community assessment, planning and outcome. Although the political contexts for community development have changed dramatically in a number of Latin American countries in recent years, there are growing opportunities and examples of communities working together to address common problems and improve collective quality of life. This book links scholarship that highlights community development praxis using new frameworks to understand the potential for community capacity and resiliency. By rejecting old linear models of development, based on technology transfer and diffusion of technology, many communities in Latin America have built capacity of their capital assets to become more resilient and adapt positively to change. This book is an essential resource for academics and practitioners of rural development, demonstrating that there is much we can learn from the skills of self-diagnosis and building on existing assets to enhance community capitals.

On Perl,Jugal Kalita,Universal-Publishers,2003-12,"The book has an introductory chapter that gets the reader started quickly with programming in Perl. The initial part of the book discusses Perl expressions, statements, control flow, built-in data types such as arrays and hashes, and complex data structures built using references. On Perl has several chapters covering specialized topics. The chapter on socket-based network programming deals with forking and using fork to write complex interactive client-server programs. There is a chapter with in-depth discussion of CGI programming including error-handling and security issues that arise. The chapter on web-client programming deals with writing programs that access Web pages, fill up GET and POST forms, handle cookies and redirected Web pages. The book has several unique chapters not found in any other book on Perl in the market. The chapter on security discusses hashes such as MD5, message authentication codes (MACs), digital signature schemes, and encryption techniques such as DES, Rijndael, and RSA. Other chapters deal with writing recursive programs that work with files and directories; this chapter also discusses predefined modules that deal with portability in file names and paths across operating systems, recursive traversal of file hierarchies and tarring and untarring of filles. The chapter on functional programming illustrates that Perl functions are first-class, can be used to write closures and can be composed to form more complex functions. In particular, this can be useful for programming in artificial intelligence.",Computers,664,5,1,en

Turning the Tide of Male Juvenile Delinquency,"Lawrence C. Grebstein, PhD, ABPP, Judy A. Van Wyk, PhD",Springer Publishing Company,2015-07-13,"Research evidence now supports the prediction that juvenile delinquents fare significantly better in rehabilitative programs than in youth prisons or home confinement. This book constitutes a groundbreaking, how-to roadmap for developing and implementing an effective rehabilitative program for delinquent youth. Based on a landmark study on the treatment of juvenile delinquents, the book describes a multidisciplinary approach toward solving social problems and illustrates how an integrative model of family counseling can be applied in a residential setting. This program hones the most effective strategies into a single unified evolutionary approach to rehabilitation that will be useful to psychologists, social workers, counselors, and students working with juvenile delinquents. The authors have culled information from sociology, psychology, criminology, and social justice to explain why juveniles commit crimes and have developed strategies toward rehabilitation that directly address the causes. Analyzing data that spans 31 years from a large study of youth offenders that incorporates information from multiple sources, they describe in detail how this model residential treatment and education program provides a viable alternative to youth prison. Chapters address the historical context for present-day treatment of juvenile delinquency and the main components of the program at Ocean Tides, including its underlying philosophy, detailed descriptions of effective interventions, practical strategies for interviewing and working with adolescent male juvenile delinquents, and training programs that can be used in other settings. The book also includes new and important data on the effects of family violence and includes descriptions of how outside consultants can be used to inform treatment and rehabilitation. KEY FEATURES: Describes a proven, multidisciplinary approach to significantly reducing violent behavior among juveniles Based on a landmark study of an effective rehabilitative program Includes new and important data on the effects of family violence Guides professionals in replicating the success of the Ocean Tides program Provides readers with practical strategies for interviewing and working with adolescent male juvenile delinquents",Psychology,327,N/A,0,en

The Routledge International Handbook of Walking,"C. Michael Hall, Yael Ram, Noam Shoval",Routledge,2017-07-28,"Walking is an essentially human activity. From a basic means of transport and opportunity for leisure through to being a religious act, walking has served as a significant philosophical, literary and historical subject. Thoreau’s 1851 lecture on Walking or the Romantic walks of the Wordsworths at Grasmere in the early 19th Century, for example, helped create a philosophical foundation for the importance of the act of walking as an act of engagement with nature. Similarly, and sometimes inseparable from secular appreciation, pilgrimage trails provide opportunities for finding self and others in the travails of the walk. More recently, walking has been embraced as a means of encouraging greater health and well-being, community improvement and more sustainable means of travel. Yet despite the significance of the subject of walking there is as yet no integrated treatment of the subject in the social science literature. This handbook therefore brings together a number of the main themes on the study of walking from different disciplines and literatures into a single volume that can be accessed from across the social sciences. It is divided into five main sections: culture, society and historical context; social practices, perceptions and behaviours; hiking trails and pilgrimage routes; health, well-being and psychology; and method, planning and design. Each of these highlights current approaches and major themes in research on walking in a range of different environments. This handbook carves out a unique niche in the study of walking. The international and cross-disciplinary nature of the contributions of the book are expected to be of interest to numerous academic fields in the social and health sciences, as well as to urban and regional planners and those in charge of the management of outdoor recreation and tourism globally.",Business & Economics,568,N/A,0,en

Second Sister,Chan Ho-Kei,Grove Press,2020-02-11,"A reclusive Hong Kong PI and hacker investigates a teenager’s mysterious death in this technological thriller by the author of The Borrowed. A schoolgirl—Siu-Man—has committed suicide, leaping from her twenty-second floor window to the pavement below. Siu-Man is an orphan and the librarian older sister who’s been raising her refuses to believe there was no foul play—nothing seemed amiss. She contacts a man known only as N.—a hacker, and an expert in cybersecurity and manipulating human behavior. But can Nga-Yee interest him sufficiently to take her case, and can she afford it if he says yes? What follows is a cat and mouse game through the city of Hong Kong and its digital underground, especially an online gossip platform, where someone has been slandering Siu-Man. The novel is also populated by a man harassing girls on mass transit; high school kids, with their competing agendas and social dramas; a Hong Kong digital company courting an American venture capitalist; and the Triads, market women and noodle shop proprietors who frequent N.’s neighborhood of Sai Wan. In the end it all comes together to tell us who caused Siu-Man’s death and why, and to ask, in a world where online and offline dialogue has increasingly forgotten about the real people on the other end, what the proper punishment is. “Readers will savor every twist and turn of Chan Ho-Kei’s tour de force. . . .

"Taxation, Virtual Currency and Blockchain",Aleksandra Bal,Kluwer Law International B.V.,2018-11-29,"The emergence of convertible decentralized virtual currency schemes confronts tax authorities with unprecedented questions, among them are the status of virtual currency for tax purposes, which virtual transactions may bene?t from a VAT exemption and determining the most optimal method of tax regulation. This ?rst book-length treatment of this major current topic provides an in-depth and comprehensive analysis of the tax implications of virtual currency transactions. Seeking to ascertain whether virtual currency requires additional regulation or whether the law as it stands is adequate to administer its usage, the analysis not only thoroughly explains the nature of the underlying blockchain technology and its regulatory and judicial treatment so far but also identi?es best practices for virtual currency transactions and makes recommendations for the improvement of the existing tax systems. Among the aspects of the phenomenon covered are the following: – particular aspects of virtual currency use such as smart contracts and initial coin offerings; – comparative review of income tax consequences of virtual currency transactions in Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States; – VAT/sales tax treatment of transactions involving virtual currency in the European Union and the United States; – methodology for creating an effective regulatory framework for the taxation of virtual currency; and – the future of blockchain. The book has three parts and an annex that describes tax regulations, administrative rulings and court decisions concerning virtual currency in twenty countries. In its in-depth analysis of tax implications of virtual currency transactions in major economies, detailed overview of recent tax developments that affect virtual currency transactions and evaluation of tax policies related to virtual currencies, this book has no peers. Especially in view of the OECD's examination of the tax challenges presented by the digital economy as part of its base erosion and pro?t shifting (BEPS) project, this clear and comprehensive explanation of the functioning of virtual currency and blockchain technology will be welcomed by tax administration of?cials and by persons mining and transacting in virtual currencies needing to know their compliance obligations.",Law,356,N/A,0,en

Intercultural Issues in Online Communication: A German-Egyptian Comparison,"Verena Wiedmaier, Britt Söder",diplom.de,2007-02-01,"Inhaltsangabe:Abstract: In these times of rapid increase of internet usage, the question arises for multinational companies (MNCs) whether to standardise or adapt their internet presence to different cultural groupings or even subcultures. The overall target of this research is therefore to assist MNCs by producing recommendations concerning the promotion of products and services for a particular transnational consumer group. Therefore, country-specific websites of companies rooted in different cultural origins are selected for this research, namely EgyptAir, Mercedes-Benz and SonyEricsson. This analysis follows the inductive research approach embedding elements of an ethnographic and exploratory research method. The main part of the empirical study is conducted by means of an online-behaviourist questionnaire following the quantitative research approach and complementary a culture-related questionnaire following the qualitative research approach. The sample size is composed of Egyptian students from the Misr International University in Cairo and German students from Heilbronn University forming the selected samples. Even though Egypt is a developing country and Germany an industrialised one, the samples are comparable due to the similar social and educational backgrounds. The research results are applied to the lifestyle typology segmentation method, namely the Euro-Social-Styles of the GfK thus creating a new model of six lifestyle typologies in which the two samples are categorised. It is revealed by the main findings that the respective companies deal despite the different nationalities of the samples, with a transnational consumer group which is characterised by a relative homogeneity. Nevertheless, not all values and traits are similar within this consumer group and it therefore requires a certain degree of adaptation of marketing activities. It was possible to identify within the scope of this research that, in general, companies enjoying a high brand awareness and reputation are not exposed to the urge of adaptation, especially when selling culture-free products and services. Finally, one should continuously bear in mind that generalisations must not be made at any stage. Moreover, due to the small sample size, this research only represents a starting point for further research.

The Global Vampire,"Cait Coker, Donald E. Palumbo, C.W.

Wicked,Gregory Maguire,Harper Collins,2009-10-13,"The New York Times bestseller and basis for the Tony-winning hit musical, soon to be a major motion picture starring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande With millions of copies in print around the world, Gregory Maguire’s Wicked is established not only as a commentary on our time but as a novel to revisit for years to come. Wicked relishes the inspired inventions of L. Frank Baum’s 1900 novel, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, while playing sleight of hand with our collective memories of the 1939 MGM film starring Margaret Hamilton (and Judy Garland). In this fast-paced, fantastically real, and supremely entertaining novel, Maguire has populated the largely unknown world of Oz with the power of his own imagination. Years before Dorothy and her dog crash-land, another little girl makes her presence known in Oz. This girl, Elphaba, is born with emerald-green skin—no easy burden in a land as mean and poor as Oz, where superstition and magic are not strong enough to explain or overcome the natural disasters of flood and famine. Still, Elphaba is smart, and by the time she enters Shiz University, she becomes a member of a charmed circle of Oz’s most promising young citizens. But Elphaba’s Oz is no utopia. The Wizard’s secret police are everywhere. Animals—those creatures with voices, souls, and minds—are threatened with exile. Young Elphaba, green and wild and misunderstood, is determined to protect the Animals—even if it means combating the mysterious Wizard, even if it means risking her single chance at romance. Ever wiser in guilt and sorrow, she can find herself grateful when the world declares her a witch. And she can even make herself glad for that young girl from Kansas. Recognized as an iconoclastic tour de force on its initial publication, the novel has inspired the blockbuster musical of the same name—one of the longest-running plays in Broadway history. Popular, indeed. But while the novel’s distant cousins hail from the traditions of magical realism, mythopoeic fantasy, and sprawling nineteenth-century sagas of moral urgency, Maguire’s Wicked is as unique as its green-skinned witch.",Fiction,430,4,3,en

The Wedding Veil,Kristy Woodson Harvey,Simon and Schuster,2022-03-29,"This “masterfully woven…literary home run” (New York Journal of Books) follows four women across generations, bound by a beautiful wedding veil and a connection to the famous Vanderbilt family from the New York Times bestselling author of the Peachtree Bluff series. Four women. One family heirloom. A secret connection that will change their lives—and history as they know it. Present Day: Julia Baxter’s wedding veil, bequeathed to her great-grandmother by a mysterious woman on a train in the 1930s, has passed through generations of her family as a symbol of a happy marriage. But on the morning of her wedding day, something tells her that even the veil’s good luck isn’t enough to make her marriage last forever. Overwhelmed, she escapes to the Virgin Islands to clear her head. Meanwhile, her grandmother, Babs, is also feeling shaken. Still grieving the death of her beloved husband, she decides to move into a retirement community. Though she hopes it’s a new beginning, she does not expect to run into an old flame, dredging up the same complicated emotions she felt a lifetime ago. 1914: Socialite Edith Vanderbilt is struggling to manage the luxurious Biltmore Estate after the death of her cherished husband. With 250 rooms to oversee and an entire village dependent on her family to stay afloat, Edith is determined to uphold the Vanderbilt legacy—and prepare her free-spirited daughter Cornelia to inherit it—despite her family’s deteriorating financial situation. But Cornelia has dreams of her own, and as she explores more of the rapidly changing world around her, she’s torn between upholding tradition and pursuing the exciting future that lies beyond Biltmore’s gilded gates. In the vein of Therese Anne Fowler’s A Well-Behaved Woman and Jennifer Robson’s The Gown, The Wedding Veil is “a sparkling, fast-paced joy of a book that celebrates love, family, and the right to shape one’s own destiny” (Kristin Harmel, New York Times bestselling author).",Fiction,464,N/A,0,en

The Girl on the Wall,Jean Baggott,Icon Books Ltd,2011-03-03,"Jean Baggott is 'the girl on the wall' - a 1948 photograph taken of her when she was eleven - whose life was never going to be remarkable and the pinnacle of whose achievements would come from being a wife and a mother. Almost 60 years later, with her children gone, dealing with the loss of the love of her life, Jean began the education denied to her as a girl. Inspired by ceilings of Lincolnshire's Burghley House and by the History degree she had begun, Jean began to stitch a tapestry which looked back at her life and the changing world around her. It took sixteen months to complete. The tapestry consists of over 70 intersecting circles, each telling some aspect of her life. Some represent extraordinary events such as the moon landings or world historical news stories like the Cuban Missile Crisis; some circles comment on famous people and places she remembers, others about the music she loves - Pink Floyd - and the games she played as a child, and growing up during the second world war with her brothers. Each chapter of ""The Girl on the Wall"" features a circle from the tapestry and Jean's accompanying narrative, exploring the circle and the memories it evokes. It reveals an ordinary life in extraordinary detail. The result is a truly unique, touching portrait of a seemingly average British woman's life. To stand back and look at the tapestry is to be struck by the richness of one human journey - from 1940 to the present day. The girl on the wall would be proud.

Each chapter gives you a backdrop to become your own “case study” with thought questions to create awareness of the impact your life has on others and how in turn their lives inspire and constrain you. Separate chapters are dedicated to the impact of health, choice of life values, self-esteem and family relocation as constraints on your life cycle involvements. The goal in writing this book has been to empower the reader to view his or her life in a fresh, new personal perspective.",Family & Relationships,138,N/A,0,en

This remarkable work serves as a beacon of hope in these turbulent times, offering a comprehensive exploration of the core curricula dilemma and paving the way for transformative change.

The Handbook of LGBTQIA-Inclusive Hospice and Palliative Care,Kimberly D. Acquaviva,Columbia University Press,2023-10-10,"Hospice and palliative care professionals are experts at caring for individuals and families experiencing serious or life-limiting illnesses. Not everyone feels safe seeking out their expertise, however: LGBTQIA+ people may be deterred from seeking support because of barriers—both overt and subtle—that hospice and palliative care programs and professionals erect through their policies and practices. This book is an accessible, expert guide to incorporating LGBTQIA-inclusive practices into end-of-life care. It equips both new and experienced hospice and palliative care professionals with the knowledge they need to ensure that all people receive high-quality care. Kimberly D. Acquaviva surveys fundamental concepts and the latest clinical developments, integrating relatable anecdotes and poignant personal reflections. She discusses her own experience caring for her wife, Kathy, who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2019. Unable to find a local hospice with an LGBTQIA-inclusive nondiscrimination statement, let alone one whose staff had been trained to provide nondiscriminatory care to LGBTQIA+ people, Kathy died at home six months later without hospice care. Acquaviva offers clear, actionable strategies for palliative care and hospice physicians, physician associates, advanced-practice registered nurses, registered nurses, social workers, counselors, chaplains, and others. She also emphasizes how incorporating LGBTQIA-inclusive practices can transform work with every person receiving care. Anchored in the evidence and written in plain language, this book is the definitive guide for hospice and palliative care professionals seeking to deliver exceptional care to all the patients and families they serve.",Health & Fitness,355,N/A,0,en

The New Advisor Guidebook,"Pat Folsom, Franklin Yoder, Jennifer E. Joslin",John Wiley & Sons,2015-08-21,"This is an exciting time to be an academic advisor—a time in which global recognition of the importance of advising is growing, research affirms the critical role advising plays in student success, and institutions of higher education increasingly view advising as integral to their missions and essential for improving the quality of students' educational experiences. It is essential that advisors provide knowledgeable, realistic counsel to the students in their charge. The New Advisor Guidebook helps advisors meet this challenge. The first and final chapters of the book identify the knowledge and skills advisors must master. These chapters present frameworks for setting and benchmarking self-development goals and for creating self-development plans. Each of the chapters in between focuses on foundational content: the basic terms, concepts, information, and skills advisors must learn in their first year and upon which they will build over the lengths of their careers. These chapters include strategies, questions, guidelines, examples, and case studies that give advisors the tools to apply this content in their work with students, from demonstrations of how student development theories might play out in advising sessions to questions advisors can ask to become aware of their biases and avoid making assumptions about students to a checklist for improving listening, interviewing, and referral skills. The book covers various ways in which advising is delivered: one-to-one, in groups, and online. The New Advisor Guidebook serves as an introduction to what advisors must know to do their jobs effectively. It pairs with Academic Advising Approaches: Strategies That Teach Students to Make the Most of College, also from NACADA, which presents the delivery strategies successful advisors can use to help students make the most of their college experience.",Education,400,N/A,0,en

Yes So I Said Yes,David Ireland,Bloomsbury Publishing,2022-02-01,"It's harder to kill people when there's a peace process on. Ulster Loyalist Alan Black is kept awake every night by his neighbour McCorrick's dog barking. To add to his difficulties, McCorrick refuses to acknowledge that he even owns a dog, let alone one that is creating a disturbance. In a Northern Ireland he barely recognises, where politics has proved just to be the continuation of war by other means, a disconsolate Alan sets out to rid himself of the incessant noise. As he seeks help from authority figures, he finally – as a very last resort – turns to the only voice he can really trust, Eamonn Holmes... Coinciding with the 100th anniversary of the partition of Ireland and the foundation of Northern Ireland, Yes So I Said Yes is a blackly comic, ferocious, dystopian satire about what it's like to feel alone in a place where everyone else is conspiring to erase you and your history.

Film Composers in America,Clifford McCarty,N/A,2000,"Film Composers in America is a landmark in the history of film. Here, renowned film scholar Clifford McCarty has attempted to identify every known composer who wrote background musical scores for films in the United States between 1911 and 1970. With information on roughly 20,000 films, the book is an essential tool for serious students of film and a treasure trove for film fans. It spans all types of American films, from features, shorts, cartoons, and documentaries to nontheatrical works, avant-garde films, and even trailers. Meticulously researched over 45 years, the book documents the work of more than 1,500 composers, from Robert Abramson to Josiah Zuro, including the first to score an American film, Walter C. Simon. It includes not only Hollywood professionals but also many composers of concert music--as well as popular music and other genres--whose cinematic work has never before been fully catalogued. The book also features an index that lets readers quickly find the composer for any American film through 1970. To recover this history, much of which was lost or never recorded, McCarty corresponded with or interviewed hundreds of composers, arrangers, orchestrators, musical directors, and music librarians. He also conducted extensive research in the archives of the seven largest film studios--Columbia, MGM, Paramount, RKO, 20th Century-Fox, Universal, and Warner Bros.--and wherever possible, he based his findings on the most reliable evidence, that of the manuscript scores and cue sheets (as opposed to less accurate screen credits). The result is the definitive guide to the composers and musical scores for the first 60 years of American film.",Music,554,N/A,0,en

Music Therapy in Mental Health for Illness Management and Recovery,Michael J. Silverman,Oxford University Press,2022-04-11,"Many music therapists work in adult mental health settings after qualifying. For many, it will be a challenging and even daunting prospect. Yet until now, there has been no psychiatric music therapy text providing advice on illness management and recovery. The new edition of this established and acclaimed text provides the necessary breadth and depth to inform readers of the psychotherapeutic research base and show how music therapy can effectively and efficiently function within a clinical scenario. The book takes an illness management and recovery approach to music therapy specific to contemporary group-based practice. It is also valuable for administrators of music therapy, providing innovative theory-based approaches to psychiatric music therapy, developing and describing new ways to conceptualize psychiatric music therapy treatment, educating music therapists, stimulating research and employment, and influencing legislative policies. For the new edition, all chapters have been updated, and 2 new chapters added - on substance abuse, and the therapeutic alliance. An important aim of the book is to stimulate both critical thought and lifelong learning concerning issues, ideas, and concepts related to mental illness and music therapy. Critical thinking and lifelong learning have been - and will likely continue to be - essential aspirations in higher education. Moreover, contemporary views concerning evidence-based practice rely heavily upon the clinician's ability to think critically, seek a breadth of contradicting and confirmatory evidence, implement meta-cognition to monitor thoughts throughout processes, and synthesize and evaluate knowledge to make informed clinical decisions relevant and applicable to idiosyncratic contextual parameters. For both students and clinicians in music therapy, this is an indispensable text to help them learn, develop, and hone their skills in music therapy.",Psychology,457,N/A,0,en

With the rise of the economy, people are able to keep a form of independence. Education and economic status promote individuality. The need to commit yourself to another person becomes less important. In many countries’ women get more space to have their own career and education. The male dominance is fading increasingly everywhere. One of the most important facts in history is the decrease of religious practice promoting male dominance with a following obedient female. Since only around 50+ years women begin to develop a strong sense of independence and are able to get a social position. The social stigma of a single woman is disappearing. One important reason why women more often chose for a single live position is due to the lack of “good” suitable men. Men have built philosophies, religions and believe that women should be followers and obedient to men. When they designed these moral repressive ideas, they did not consider the fact that women could develop above their level. Now many men get hit by their own ancestors.

The Scaffold Effect,"Harold S. Koplewicz, MD",Harmony,2021-02-02,"Prevent and counteract the general anxiety and emotional fragility prevalent in children and teenagers today—a new parenting philosophy and strategies that give children the tools to flourish on their own. “A master synthesizer of attachment science, medical practice, and his own experience as a father, Harold Koplewicz capably and compassionately leads us through the art of scaffolding, from early childhood through the important adolescent period.”—Daniel J. Siegel, MD, author of The Whole Brain Child Just as sturdy scaffolding is necessary when erecting a building and will come down when the structure grows stable, good parenting provides children with steady and warm emotional nourishment on the path toward independence. Never-ending parental problem-solving and involvement can have the opposite effect, enabling fragility and anxiety over time. In The Scaffold Effect, world-renowned child psychiatrist Harold Koplewicz introduces the powerful and clinically tested idea that this deliberate build-up and then gradual loosening of parental support is the single most effective way to encourage kids to climb higher, try new things, grow from mistakes, and develop character and strength. Explaining the building blocks of an effective scaffold from infancy through young adulthood, he expertly guides parents through the strategies for raising empowered, capable people, including: • Lay a solid foundation: The parent-child relationship needs to be made from the concrete mixture of emotional availability, positive reinforcement, clear messaging, and consistent rules. From this supportive base, your will forge a bond that will survive adolescence and grow stronger into adulthood. • Empower growth: Skyscraper or sprawling ranch—the style of your child’s construction is not up to you! Scaffold parenting validates and accommodates the shape the child is growing into. Any effort to block or control growth will actually stunt it. • Stay on their level: Imagine being on the ground floor of a house and trying to talk to someone on the roof. The person on the roof will have to “talk down” to you or yell. If your child’s building and your scaffold are on the same level, you can speak directly, look each other in the eye, and keep the lines of communication open. Drawing on Dr. Koplewicz’s decades of clinical and personal experience, The Scaffold Effect is a compassionate, street-smart, and essential guide for the ages. All of the author’s proceeds from the sale of this book will be donated to the Child Mind Institute.",Family & Relationships,273,N/A,0,en

However, little research is currently available on this topic. This study attempts to ll the knowledge gap in existing research by exploring the patterns of substance use, expectations and treatment needs of people with a migration background in four Belgian target groups (the Turkish community in Ghent; the Eastern European communities in Ghent; the Congolese community in Brussels; and asylum applicants, refugees and undocumented migrants). Substance users with a migration background can be particularly dicult for researchers to reach, so community researchers were recruited to interview substance users from within their own network. Over 200 people were interviewed. The project was carried out in close collaboration with the respective communities and with stakeholders in addiction care. This book presents the ndings of the study, together with recommendations for health care policy and the practice of addiction care. It also details the explorative and qualitative community-based participatory research design (CBPR) that was used to facilitate the study.",Social Science,326,N/A,0,en

This book, using sources such as diaries, autobiographies, newspaper accounts, films, posters, and route books, first considers the popular media's presentation of these performers as unnatural and scandalous--as well as romantic and thrilling. Next are the stories told by circus women, which contradict and complicate other versions of their lives. Across America in those years an array of acts featured women, such as tableaux, freak shows, girlie shows, tiger acts, and aerial performances, all involving special skills and all detailed here.

When a precious jewel known as the ""Blue Water"" goes missing, Beau leaves Britain to join the French Foreign Legion, followed by his brothers, Digby (his twin) and John.

Confederate Sheet Music,E. Lawrence Abel,McFarland,2015-06-14,"During the American Civil War, songs united and inspired people on both sides. The North had a well-established music publishing industry when the war broke out, but the South had no such industry. The importance of music as an expression of the South's beliefs was obvious; as one music publisher said, ""The South must not only fight her own battles but sing her own songs and dance to music composed by her own children."" Southern entrepreneurs quickly rose to the challenge. This reference book is distinguished by three major differences from previously published works. First, it lists sheet music that is no longer extant (and listed nowhere else). Second, it gives complete lyrics for all extant songs, a rich source for researchers. And third, a brief historical background has been provided for many of the songs. Each entry provides as much of the following as possible (staying faithful to the typography of each title page): the title as published, names of all lyricists, composers and publishers; dates of publication; cities of publication; and if applicable, the names of catalogs or magazines in which the song appeared.

This updated edition of the 1994 account recalls that groundbreaking success. It also chronicles many achievements since, including the first Everest success by an Irishwoman, Clare O'Leary, and Pat Falvey's ascents by two different routes. In 2012, Irishman Noel Hanna completed his fifth Everest ascent. Other highlights include ascents of Lhotse, Cho Oyu, Kanchenjunga, Broad Peak and K2. Mike Barry became the first Irish person to walk to the South Pole, and an Irish crew completed the first east–west circumnavigation of the Arctic in a small yacht. Members of the first Everest expedition still climb and Irish adventurers continue to attempt objectives such as the North Pole on foot.

Her family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education, and no one to intervene when one of Tara’s older brothers became violent. When another brother got himself into college, Tara decided to try a new kind of life. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge University. Only then would she wonder if she’d traveled too far, if there was still a way home. “Beautiful and propulsive . . .

Insomniac City,Bill Hayes,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2017-02-14,"Amazon's Best Biographies and Memoirs of the Year List A moving celebration of what Bill Hayes calls ""the evanescent, the eavesdropped, the unexpected"" of life in New York City, and an intimate glimpse of his relationship with the late Oliver Sacks. ""A beautifully written once-in-a-lifetime book, about love, about life, soul, and the wonderful loving genius Oliver Sacks, and New York, and laughter and all of creation.""--Anne Lamott Bill Hayes came to New York City in 2009 with a one-way ticket and only the vaguest idea of how he would get by. But, at forty-eight years old, having spent decades in San Francisco, he craved change. Grieving over the death of his partner, he quickly discovered the profound consolations of the city's incessant rhythms, the sight of the Empire State Building against the night sky, and New Yorkers themselves, kindred souls that Hayes, a lifelong insomniac, encountered on late-night strolls with his camera. And he unexpectedly fell in love again, with his friend and neighbor, the writer and neurologist Oliver Sacks, whose exuberance--""I don't so much fear death as I do wasting life,"" he tells Hayes early on--is captured in funny and touching vignettes throughout. What emerges is a portrait of Sacks at his most personal and endearing, from falling in love for the first time at age seventy-five to facing illness and death (Sacks died of cancer in August 2015). Insomniac City is both a meditation on grief and a celebration of life. Filled with Hayes's distinctive street photos of everyday New Yorkers, the book is a love song to the city and to all who have felt the particular magic and solace it offers.",Literary Collections,305,N/A,0,en

For a rising generation young women, the sky is the limit. Women can be anything and have everything. They are outpacing their male peers in higher education and earning the corner office at work. Smart, driven, assertive women are succeeding at just about everything they do--except romance. Why are so many men afraid to date smart women? Modern men claim to want smarts, success, and independence in romantic partners. Or so says the data collected by scientists and dating websites.

Journalist Jenna Birch has finally named the perplexing reason: ""the love gap""--or that confusing rift between who men say they want to date and who they actually commit to. Backed by extensive data, research, in-depth interviews with experts and real-life relationship stories, The Love Gap is the first book to explore the most talked-about dating trend today.

The Dawn of the Deed,John A. Long,University of Chicago Press,2012-10-22,"“[A] deliciously written account of the evolution of sex, in all of its bizarre manifestations” by a noted paleontologist—""Read, blush, and enjoy!” (Jared Diamond, author of Guns, Germs, and Steel). We all know about the birds and the bees, but what about the ancient placoderm fishes and the dinosaurs? In 2008, paleontologist John A. Long and a team of researchers announced their discovery of a 380-million-year-old placoderm fish fossil, known as “the mother fish,” which revealed the earliest known example of internal fertilization. As a result, placoderms are now considered to be the first species to have had intimate sexual reproduction, or sex as we know it—sort of. Inspired by this incredible find, Long began a quest to uncover the evolutionary history of copulation and insemination. In The Dawn of the Deed, he takes readers on a lively tour through the sex lives of ancient fish and the unusual mating habits of arthropods, tortoises, and even a well-endowed Argentine Duck. Long discusses these discoveries alongside what we know about reproductive biology and evolutionary theory, using the fossil record to provide a provocative account of prehistoric sex. The Dawn of the Deed also explores fascinating revelations about animal reproduction, from homosexual penguins to monogamous seahorses to the difficulties of dinosaur romance.",Science,296,N/A,0,en

"A Handbook for the Assessment of Children's Behaviours, Includes Wiley Desktop Edition","Jonathan O. H. Williams, Peter D. Hill",John Wiley & Sons,2012-05-29,"Handbook for the Assessment of Children’s Behaviours with Wiley Desktop Edition This ground-breaking book takes a new approach to the assessment of behaviour in children and adolescents. Written by an expert author team, combining one (Jonathan Williams) with higher qualifications in general practice, child neuropsychiatry, and child and adolescent psychiatry, with one (Peter Hill) with higher qualifications in medicine, paediatrics and child and adolescent psychiatry, the book draws on many thousands of multidisciplinary case discussions, at Great Ormond Street Hospital, in the Children’s Multispecialty Assessment Clinic in North London, and in private practice. The book is ideal for the busy mental health professional working in a small team. Organised to allow rapid look-up of behaviours with comprehensive lists of their possible causes, it synthesizes research evidence and clinical experience. The authors interpret behaviour broadly, including not just voluntary actions, but also actions whose voluntary nature is questionable (such as drop attacks, personal preferences, and pseudobehaviours). They also include problems that lead to referral through their behavioural manifestations (e.g. aggression, anxiety, or a poor relationship with mother). Overall, the book spans the behavioural, cognitive, social and emotional problems of children and adolescents. With the child and family in the room, and with detailed school reports and psychometric results available, it is usually possible to identify causes of symptoms that are specific to the child and his environment, and which can guide behavioural, cognitive, social, and family interventions. Purchasers of the book will also be entitled to a Wiley Desktop Edition—an interactive digital version featuring downloadable text and images, highlighting and note taking facilities, in-text searching, and linking to references and glossary terms.",Medical,623,N/A,0,en

Violence and Mental Health,"Jutta Lindert, Itzhak Levav",Springer,2015-02-25,"Violence is one of the most important challenges, not only for public health systems, but also for public mental health. Violence can have immediate as well as long-term and even transgenerational effects on the mental health of its victims. This book provides a comprehensive and wide-ranging assessment of the mental health legacy left by violence. It addresses the issues as they affect states, communities and families, in other words at macro-, meso- and microlevels, beginning by describing the impact of violence on neurobiology and mental health, as well as the spectrum of syndromes and disorders associated with different forms of violence. The work moves on to tackle violence at the international—and intranational—level before zeroing in on the nature of violence in communities such as villages or city districts. It also examines the results of violence in the family. Each type of violence has distinct effects on mental health and in each chapter specific groups are explored in depth to demonstrate the heterogeneity of violence as well as the diversity of its outcomes in the realm of public mental health. Finally, the book addresses the notion of ‘undoing violence’ by detailing case studies of effective interventions and prevention occurring in countries, communities and families. These cases give us pause to reflect on the nature of resilience and dignity in the context of violence and mental health. All the chapters have been written by leading authors in the field and provide a state-of-the-art perspective. The authors, from different fields of expertise, facilitate interdisciplinary and international insights into the impact of violence on mental health.",Medical,423,N/A,0,en

Daughter of the Dragon: Anna May Wong's Rendezvous with American History,Yunte Huang,Liveright Publishing,2023-08-22,"One of the Atlantic's ""Books to Get Lost in This Summer"" Best Books of August 2023: New York Times Book Review, Christian Science Monitor, InsideHook, BookRiot, WNET AllArts, Arlington Magazine A trenchant reclamation of the Chinese American movie star, whose battles against cinematic exploitation and endemic racism are set against the currents of twentieth-century history. Born into the steam and starch of a Chinese laundry, Anna May Wong (1905–1961) emerged from turn-of-the-century Los Angeles to become Old Hollywood’s most famous Chinese American actress, a screen siren who captivated global audiences and signed her publicity photos—with a touch of defiance—“Orientally yours.” Now, more than a century after her birth, Yunte Huang narrates Wong’s tragic life story, retracing her journey from Chinatown to silent-era Hollywood, and from Weimar Berlin to decadent, prewar Shanghai, and capturing American television in its infancy. As Huang shows, Wong’s rendezvous with history features a remarkable parade of characters, including a smitten Walter Benjamin and (an equally smitten) Marlene Dietrich. Challenging the parodically racist perceptions of Wong as a “Dragon Lady,” “Madame Butterfly,” or “China Doll,” Huang’s biography becomes a truly resonant work of history that reflects the raging anti-Chinese xenophobia, unabashed sexism, and ageism toward women that defined both Hollywood and America in Wong’s all-too-brief fifty-six years on earth.",Biography & Autobiography,371,N/A,0,en

On Liberty contains a rational justification of the freedom of the individual in opposition to the claims of the state to impose unlimited control, and has become a classic of libertarian philosophy. Warning against the tyranny of the majority, this treatise argues that in the past the danger had been that monarchs held power at the expense of the common people and the struggle was one of gaining liberty by limiting such governmental power. But now that power has largely passed into the hands of the people at large through democratic forms of government, the danger is that the majority denies liberty to individuals, whether explicitly through laws ... or more subtly through morals and public opinion.",Religion,98,N/A,0,en

From Playgrounds to Playstation,Carroll Pursell,Johns Hopkins University Press+ORM,2015-04-23,"This “engaging social history of play” explores how technology and culture have shaped toys, games, and leisure—and vice versa (Choice). In this romp through the changing landscape of nineteenth- and twentieth-century American toys, games, hobbies, and amusements, technology historian Carroll Pursell poses a simple but interesting question: What can we learn by studying the relationship between technology and play? From Playgrounds to PlayStation explores how play reflects and drives the evolution of American culture. Pursell engagingly examines the ways in which technology affects play and play shapes people. The objects that children (and adults) play with and play on, along with their games and the hobbies they pursue, can reinforce but also challenge gender roles and cultural norms. Inventors—who often talk about “playing” at their work, as if motivated by the pure fun of invention—have used new materials and technologies to reshape sports and gameplay, sometimes even crafting new, extreme forms of recreation, but always responding to popular demand. Drawing from a range of sources, including scholarly monographs, patent records, newspapers, and popular and technical journals, the book covers numerous modes and sites of play. Pursell touches on the safety-conscious playground reform movement, the dazzling mechanical innovations that gave rise to commercial amusement parks, and the media’s colorful promotion of toys, pastimes, and sporting events. Along the way, he shows readers how technology enables the forms, equipment, and devices of play to evolve constantly, both reflecting consumer choices and driving innovators and manufacturers to promote toys that involve entirely new kinds of play—from LEGOs and skateboards to beading kits and videogames.",Technology & Engineering,277,N/A,0,en

Stephen Knott's fascinating study explores the curious and unexpected attributes of things made outside standardised models of mass production, arguing that amateur craft practice is 'differential' – a temporary moment of control over work that both departs from and informs our productive engagement with the world. Knott's discussion of the theoretical aspects of amateur craft practice is substantiated by historical case studies that cluster around the period 1850–1950. Looking back to the emergence of the modern amateur, he makes reference to contemporary art and design practice that harnesses or exploits amateur conditions of making. From Andy Warhol to Simon Starling, such artistic interest elucidates the mercurial qualities of amateur craft. Invaluable for students and researchers in art and design, contemporary craft, material culture and social history, Amateur Craft counters both the marginalisation and the glorification of amateur craft practice. It is richly illustrated with 41 images, 14 in colour, including 19th century ephemera and works of contemporary art.",Design,193,N/A,0,en

Personality and Disease,Christoffer Johansen,Academic Press,2018-06-29,"A tremendous amount of research has been performed looking at the relationship between personality and disease. Research on this topic has been spread throughout scientific journals on psychology, behavioral health, psychoneuroimmunology, oncology, and epidemiology. Personality and Disease brings this research together in one place for the first time. With contributions from world experts, the book summarizes research findings on personality as it relates to cancer, heart disease, diabetes, asthma and allergies, dementia, and more. Is there such a thing as a cancer- prone personality? Do sadness, anger, stress, or shyness affect the likelihood that we will fall ill to specific diseases? Can we protect ourselves from disease through a positive outlook? This book will address both what we know, and what we persist in believing despite evidence to the contrary, and why such beliefs persist in the face of evidence. - Investigates whether and how personality affects disease generally - Includes cancer, heart disease, diabetes, asthma, allergies, and dementia - Separates fact from fiction, evidence from beliefs - Collates research from a wide variety of scientific domains - Contains international perspectives from top scholars",Psychology,278,N/A,0,en

Homeopathy for Today's World,Dr. Rajan Sankaran,Simon and Schuster,2011-06-23,"Discover the “inner song” that triggers your ailments and underlies your fundamental nature and response to stress • Reveals the 7 levels of experience and how to apply them to reach the core experience behind our physical and mental symptoms • Explains how to decode the ways we describe our pain and emotions to determine what animal, plant, or mineral is “singing” within • Shows how awareness of the “inner song” can reduce its negative impact on our emotions, dreams, ambitions, careers, and relationships The most important development in homeopathy since its discovery in the late 18th century by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, the Sensation Method of diagnosis developed by Dr. Rajan Sankaran explains that our experience and perceptions of life’s stresses are shaped by an inner pattern, or “song,” connected to one of the three kingdoms in nature--animal, plant, or mineral. Revealing itself as a constant underlying sensation felt in both the mind and the body and expressed through illness and chronic ailments, this inner song of reoccurring reactive patterns--be it that of a competitive lion, a sensitive daisy, or structured phosphorus--drives our emotions, dreams, ambitions, careers, and relationships and is the underlying factor behind why stress affects each of us so differently. Explaining that there are 7 levels to our experiences, Dr. Sankaran provides techniques to decode the words and gestures we use to describe our pain, emotions, and health conditions, allowing us to probe deeper into our experiences of stress and illness to determine what animal, plant, or mineral is “singing” within us. Showing how this core identity can be used by homeopathic physicians to treat our problems at their source, he reveals how becoming aware of our inner song can reduce the intensity of its negative effects, leading to less stress, better health, and more harmony in our lives.",Health & Fitness,238,N/A,0,en

Dynamic Process Methodology in the Social and Developmental Sciences,"Jaan Valsiner, Peter C. M. Molenaar, Maria C.D.P. Lyra, Nandita Chaudhary",Springer Science & Business Media,2009-07-09,"All psychological processes—like biological and social ones—are dynamic. Phenomena of nature, society, and the human psyche are context bound, constantly changing, and variable. This feature of reality is often not recognized in the social sciences where we operate with averaged data and with homogeneous stereotypes, and consider our consistency to be the cornerstone of rational being. Yet we are all inconsistent in our actions within a day, or from, one day to the next, and much of such inconsistency is of positive value for our survival and development. Our inconsistent behaviors and thoughts may appear chaotic, yet there is generality within this highly variable dynamic. The task of scientific methodologies—qualitative and quantitative—is to find out what that generality is. It is the aim of this handbook to bring into one framework various directions of construction of methodology of the dynamic processes that exist in the social sciences at the beginning of the 21st century. This handbook is set up to bring together pertinent methodological scholarship from all over the world, and equally from the quantitative and qualitative orientations to methodology. In addition to consolidating the pertinent knowledge base for the purposes of its further growth, this book serves the major educational role of bringing practitioners—students, researchers, and professionals interested in applications—the state of the art know-how about how to think about extracting evidence from single cases, and about the formal mathematical-statistical tools to use for these purposes.",Psychology,688,N/A,0,en

Applications of Flow in Human Development and Education,Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi,Springer,2014-08-08,"The third volume of the collected works of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi covers his work on the application of flow in areas that go beyond the field of leisure where the concept was first applied. Based on his personal experience with schooling and learning, as well as that of many others and contrary to what Cicero claimed, Csikszentmihalyi arrived at the conclusion that instead of taking pride in making the roots of knowledge as bitter as possible, we should try to make them sweeter. Just as flow became a popular and useful concept in voluntary activities, it could likewise be applied in education with the end result of young people being more likely to continue learning not just because they have to but because they want to. This volume brings together a number of articles in which Csikszentmihalyi develops ideas about how to make education and more generally the process of learning to live a good life, more enjoyable. Since theory is the mother of good practice, the first eleven chapters are devoted to theoretical reflections. Some are general and explore what it means to be a human being, what it means to be a person, when we look at life from the perspective of flow. Others are more narrowly focused on such topics as consumption, education, teaching and learning. They help laypeople reflect how they can arrange their lives in such a way as to leave a small ecological footprint while getting the most enjoyment. The second section of the volume contains a dozen empirical articles on similar topics. They deal with the development of identity and self-worth; with the formation of goals and motivation; with loneliness and family life.",Psychology,500,N/A,0,en

Quality of Life after Open Heart Surgery,P.J. Walter,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"primary goal of all forms of therapy is not just prolonging life, but improving the quality of life, has forced analysis of what constitutes quality of life, a concept whose structure pervades all walks of life and eludes definition. Global well being, happiness, morale, vitality, fullness of social life, and satisfaction must be integrated and assessed for the effects of the disease and the therapy, in the context of specific personality traits, attitudes to life, family situation, and socio-economic and political freedom. A growing inter est in research on this subject has led to a clearer understanding of the components which come to determine quality of a patient's life, and how they can be measured in a reproducible manner so that valid comparisons can be made. Keeping these recommendations of analysing quality of life within the context of patients who have undergone open heart surgery, it seemed appro priate to me to separate the influence of various forms of open heart surgery into five aspects of life which can comprehensively reflect the quality of life outcome of the operation. These five 'components' are (1) Physiological state, which summarises the traditionally reported incidence of operative mortality and morbidity, objectively and subjectively measured physical ca pacity, and the residual symptoms, treatment and long-term survival.

Deconstructing LEGO,Jonathan Rey Lee,Springer Nature,2020-09-08,"This book investigates a paradox of creative yet scripted play—how LEGO invites players to build ‘freely’ with and within its highly structured, ideologically-laden toy system. First, this book considers theories and methods for deconstructing LEGO as a medium of bricolage, the creative reassembly of already-significant elements. Then, it pieces together readings of numerous LEGO sets, advertisements, videogames, films, and other media that show how LEGO constructs five ideologies of play: construction play, dramatic play, digital play, transmedia play, and attachment play. From suburban traffic patterns to architectural croissants, from feminized mini-doll bodies to toys-to-life stories, from virtual construction to playful fan creations, this book explores how the LEGO medium conveys ideological messages—not by transmitting clear statements but by providing implicit instructions for how to reassemble meanings it had all along.",Social Science,318,N/A,0,en
Victorian Culture and the Origin of Disciplines,"Bernard Lightman, Bennett Zon",Routledge,2019-06-20,"Current studies in disciplinarity range widely across philosophical and literary contexts, producing heated debate and entrenched divergences. Yet, despite their manifest significance for us today seldom have those studies engaged with the Victorian origins of modern disciplinarity. Victorian Culture and the Origin of Disciplines adds a crucial missing link in that history by asking and answering a series of deceptively simple questions: how did Victorians define a discipline; what factors impinged upon that definition; and how did they respond to disciplinary understanding? Structured around sections on professionalization, university curriculums, society journals, literary genres and interdisciplinarity, Victorian Culture and the Origin of Disciplines addresses the tangled bank of disciplinarity in the arts, humanities, social sciences and natural sciences including musicology, dance, literature, and art history; classics, history, archaeology, and theology; anthropology, psychology; and biology, mathematics and physics. Chapters examine the generative forces driving disciplinary formation, and gauge its success or failure against social, cultural, political, and economic environmental pressures. No other volume has focused specifically on the origin of Victorian disciplines in order to track the birth, death, and growth of the units into which knowledge was divided in this period, and no other volume has placed such a wide array of Victorian disciplines in their cultural context.",Literary Collections,336,N/A,0,en

Work and Retirement,Stanley Parker,Routledge,2022-02-16,"In the early 1980s world recession and widespread unemployment had accentuated an existing trend – more people retiring from work early and living longer after doing so. Some were adequately prepared for a life of well-earned ‘leisure’ in retirement, but too many were not. The policies of employers, unions and governments on retirement needed to be challenged in societies where work opportunities were collapsing but where leisure activities and values were not yet strong enough to take their place. Originally published in 1982, Dr Parker, a sociologist, provides a careful and critical examination of what we knew about retirement and discusses possible alternative answers to the various problems involved at the time. The history of retirement is first considered, followed by a conceptual analysis of types of retirement. There are chapters on preparation for retirement, the capacity of older people to work, and on the varying experiences of retirement. Separate consideration is given to the question of work after retirement age and whether retirement is actually experienced as leisure. The concluding chapter examines various policy alternatives for dealing with the problems raised earlier in the book. Work and Retirement was intended for students of industrial sociology and industrial psychology, for personnel and human resource professionals, for trade unionists and for all those who had an interest in understanding the developments in the field of retirement and the older working population. Now it can be read in its historical context.",Social Science,157,N/A,0,en
The Coat Route,Meg Lukens Noonan,Spiegel & Grau,2013-07-16,"In today’s world of fast fashion, is there a place for a handcrafted $50,000 coat? When journalist Meg Lukens Noonan learned of an unthinkably expensive, entirely handcrafted overcoat that a fourth-generation tailor had made for one of his longtime clients, she set off on an adventure to understand its provenance, and from that impulse unspooled rich and colorful stories about its components, the centuries-old bespoke industry and its traditions, and the master craftsmen whose trade is an art form. In The Coat Route, Noonan pieces together the creation of the coat in question, tracing its elements to their far-flung sources, from the remote mountains of Peru, where villagers shear vicunas—whose soft fleece is more coveted and rare than the finest cashmere—to the fabulous Florentine headquarters of Stefano Ricci, the world’s greatest silk designer; from the family-owned French fabric house Dormeuil, founded in 1842, which drapes kings, presidents, and movie stars to the 150-year-old English button-making firm that creates the ne plus ultra of fasteners out of Indian water-buffalo horn and the workshop of the master hand engraver who makes the eighteen-karat gold plaque that hangs inside the coat’s collar. We meet the dapper son-in-law of an Australian wine baron who commissions the coat’s creation, and we come to know John Cutler, one of the top bespoke tailors in the world, who works his magic with scissors and thread out of his Sydney shop, redolent of cedar and English wool. Featuring a cast of offbeat, obsessed, and wildly entertaining characters, The Coat Route presents a rich tapestry of local masters, individual artisans, and family-owned companies that have stood against the tide of mass consumerism. As Noonan comes to realize, these craftsmen, some of whom find themselves on the brink of retirement with no obvious successors, have increasing reason to believe that their way is the best way—best for their customers, best for the environment, and best for the quality of life of all involved. The Coat Route is a love song to things of lasting value. Praise for The Coat Route “A spirited tour of fashion history . . . The Coat Route compels us to remember that behind every garment is a deep history and a pair of human hands—whether those hands stitched the dress’s hem or pulled a lever that stringed together that $30 must-have jacket.”—The Wall Street Journal “Delightful . . . The Coat Route celebrates those who work with their hands, creating something beautiful and lasting.”—The Seattle Times “[Meg Lukens Noonan’s] exploration of the business of fashion is fascinating and thorough, and her examination of bespoke goods redefines the words luxury and obsession.”—The Daily Beast “Traditions of bespoke tailoring (and other related crafts) are skirting the edge of extinction. Noonan’s delightful story makes us hope they endure.”—Publishers Weekly “A fabulous story, brilliantly told . . . I couldn’t have enjoyed it more.”—Bill Bryson “As captivating as any mystery or thriller, The Coat Route demystifies the rarefied universe of bespoke tailoring and provides a lens into the culture that covets it. It educates and inspires. I couldn’t put it down!”—Tim Gunn From the Hardcover edition.",Design,274,N/A,0,en

Improving Workplace Learning by Teaching Literature,Christine Angela Eastman,Springer,2016-04-19,"This book investigates the integration of literary writing into work based or business writing. It proposes ways of how to help people with considerable work experience use literature to engage with the problems they face in their work. Many people like to read for pleasure, but their skills in reading could always be improved. This book makes an original contribution to the fields of education, work based learning and business by encouraging students to explore history, memoir, fiction, and non-fiction to model their own writing and widen their knowledge beyond the work place and their customary reading. Inside are onsite experiments with fiction and non-fiction prose that show how people in the workplace respond and grow from contact with significant literature and culture that relates broadly to their work. As a Coaching Master’s student observes: “I have not been a prolific reader. It has been a weakness and a gap. I have probably read more in the last year [during the project course] than I have read in the past twenty years. So that says something. My ability to attend to what in a book has weight or relevance has markedly improved. In the past I banked largely on my opinions because not being a prolific reader, I had to. It can be incredibly empowering to see that there are so many assets outside of my own mind. When something comes up now, I tend to weigh it. I am more specific about how I use words.”",Education,124,N/A,0,en

Faces of Women and Aging,"Ellen Cole, Esther D Rothblum, Nancy C Davis",Routledge,2014-06-03,"Discover the diverse ways aging women attempt to deal with the universal challenges of loss, sickness, and death along with the problems of being old women in a society that values women mainly as sexual partners or producers of children. Old women are often seen as poor, powerless, and pitiful in our sexist and youth-oriented society. The truth is that women age much more successfully than do men and they are increasingly in the majority as our population ages. These truths and others are presented in Faces of Women and Aging--a collection written by women, a number of whom are themselves older women who bring their unique life experiences and personalities to the topic. This uplifting book emphasizes that middle and old age are merely stages of growth and development, not just seasons of loss and decline as the end approaches. A wealth of topics are covered in Faces of Women and Aging that broaden the reader’s awareness of the problems of women and aging including: how to maintain self-esteem in the face of sexism, ageism, and severe illness the problems of being single or divorced in the later years the problems of maintaining a good body image for older women in a society which values the young and the beautiful the additional difficulties of minority women, specifically lesbians and native American women increased dependency brought on by illness and loss of partners Faces of Women and Aging combines personal narratives that serve as reminders of the human beings behind statistics and case studies with theoretical observations which help therapists assist older women cope with the daily hardships as well as the more catastrophic problems of aging.",Psychology,214,N/A,0,en
Encyclopedic Learners' Dictionaries,Martin Stark,Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG,2015-03-30,"This book describes and evaluates the usefulness of a recently developed lexicographical hybrid: the encyclopedic learner's dictionary (ELD). It attemps to answer three key questions: i) What are ELDs?, ii) How useful are they?, and iii) How can they be designed to serve their users most effectively? The first chapter analyses the ELD from a typological perspective. First, the elements combined to create this new branch of lexicographical typology are examined. Next, two encyclopedic learners' dictionaries are dissected and compared: The ""Longman Dictionary of English Language and Culture"" and the ""Oxford Advanced Learner's Encyclopedic Dictionary"". Each ELD is compared with its non-encyclopedic parent dictionary, and a checklist of ELD-specific design features is drawn up. The second chapter focuses on the user perspective in lexicographical research. First, a critical survey of previous user-based studies is provided. Next, the questionnaire-based methodology used in the investigation is described. Fourty informants completed the questionnaire and an attempt is made to correlate user characteristics with dictionary use and with attitudes towards the inclusion of encyclopedic information in learners' dictionaries. In the third chapter each design feature found in the ELDs is described in depth and the informants' evaluations of its usefulness are supplied. In this manner, the typological focus of the first chapter and the user perspective of the second chapter are synthesized in a user-informed analysis and evaluation of ELD components. Finally, the implications of this research for the future production of ELDs are presented as a checklist of recommendations, and suggestions for future lexicographical research are made.",Language Arts & Disciplines,312,N/A,0,en

Hedonizing Technologies,Rachel P. Maines,JHU Press,2009-08-01,"Rachel P. Maines’s latest work examines the rise of hobbies and leisure activities in Western culture from antiquity to the present day. As technologies are ""hedonized,"" consumers find increasing pleasure in the hobbies’ associated tools, methods, and instructional literature. Work once essential to survival and comfort—gardening, hunting, cooking, needlework, home mechanics, and brewing—have gradually evolved into hobbies and recreational activities. As a result, the technologies associated with these pursuits have become less efficient but more appealing to the new class of leisure artisans. Maines interprets the growth and economic significance of hobbies in terms of broad consumer demand for the technologies associated with them. Hedonizing Technologies uses bibliometric and retail census data to show the growth in world markets for hobby craft tools, books, periodicals, and materials from the late 18th century to today. The book addresses basic issues in the history of labor and industry and makes an original contribution to the discussion of how technology and people interact.",Technology & Engineering,225,N/A,0,en

Design History Beyond the Canon,"Jennifer Kaufmann-Buhler, Victoria Rose Pass, Christopher Wilson",Bloomsbury Publishing,2019-02-07,"Design History Beyond the Canon subverts hierarchies of taste which have dominated traditional narratives of design history. The book explores a diverse selection of objects, spaces and media, ranging from high design to mass-produced and mass-marketed objects, as well as counter-cultural and sub-cultural material. The authors' research highlights the often marginalised role of gender and racial identity in the production and consumption of design, the politics which underpins design practice and the role of designed objects as pathways of nostalgia and cultural memory. While focused primarily on North American examples from the early 20th century onwards, this collection also features essays examining European and Soviet design history, as well as the influence of Asia and Africa on Western design practice. The book is organised in three thematic sections: Consumers, Intermediaries and Designers. The first section analyses a range of designed objects and spaces through the experiences and perspectives of users. The second section considers intermediaries from both technology and cultural industries, as well as the hidden labour within the design process itself. The final section focuses on designers from multiple design disciplines including high fashion, industrial design, interior design, graphic design and design history pedagogy. The essays in all three sections utilise different research methods and a wide range of theoretical approaches, including feminist theory, critical race theory, spatial theory, material culture studies, science and technology studies and art history. Design History Beyond the Canon brings together the most recent research which stretches beyond the traditional canon and looks to interdisciplinary methodologies to better understand the practice and consumption of design.",Design,273,N/A,0,en
The Psychology of Selling Life Insurance,Edward Kellogg Strong,N/A,1922,"Life underwriters have long been seeking some treatise on psychology that would explain the principles of selling life insurance, in non-technical language. Such is the purpose of this book. The salesman's two most difficult tasks are to interest the prospect and to close the sale. These two tasks are both very directly related to the psychological factor of desire. In this book the salesman is acquainted with man's native and acquired desires or interests and is shown how man's needs for insurance may be translated into terms of desire so that the prospect will finally want that which life insurance provides. When he comes to desire the service insurance renders, the problem of closing largely disappears. In order to make every principle as concrete and practical as possible they are taught in connection with the study of five complete sales-interviews and portions of several others.",Life insurance agents,518,3,1,en

Though a valued source particularly for private music teachers, with the de-emphasis on the professional elite and the decline in salon music, the magazine ceased publication in 1957. This Index to the articles in The Etude serves as a companion to E. Douglas Bomberger¿s 2004 publication on the music in The Etude. Published a little over fifty years after the final issue reached the public, this Index chronicles vocal and instrumental technique, composer biographies, position openings, department store orchestras, the design of a successful music studio, how to play an accordion, recital programs in music schools, and much more. The Index is a valuable tool for research, particularly in the music culture of American in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

"Aldo Leopold's Odyssey, Tenth Anniversary Edition",Julianne Lutz Warren,Island Press,2016-05-24,"In 2006, Julianne Lutz Warren (née Newton) asked readers to rediscover one of history’s most renowned conservationists. Aldo Leopold’s Odyssey was hailed by The New York Times as a “biography of ideas,” making “us feel the loss of what might have followed A Sand County Almanac by showing us in authoritative detail what led up to it.” Warren’s astute narrative quickly became an essential part of the Leopold canon, introducing new readers to the father of wildlife ecology and offering a fresh perspective to even the most seasoned scholars. A decade later, as our very concept of wilderness is changing, Warren frames Leopold’s work in the context of the Anthropocene. With a new preface and foreword by Bill McKibben, the book underscores the ever-growing importance of Leopold’s ideas in an increasingly human-dominated landscape. Drawing on unpublished archives, Warren traces Leopold’s quest to define and preserve land health. Leopold's journey took him from Iowa to Yale to the Southwest to Wisconsin, with fascinating stops along the way to probe the causes of early land settlement failures, contribute to the emerging science of ecology, and craft a new vision for land use. Leopold’s life was dedicated to one fundamental dilemma: how can people live prosperously on the land and keep it healthy, too? For anyone compelled by this question, the Tenth Anniversary Edition of Aldo Leopold’s Odyssey offers insight and inspiration.",Biography & Autobiography,526,N/A,0,en

How Things Really Work,"Bill Hobby, Saralee Tiede","Center for American History, University of Texas at Austin",2010,"Bill Hobby has spent most of his life in and around Texas government, including a record eighteen years as the state's lieutenant governor. His candid recollections about his days in office, as well as his take on what state government should and should not do are part of How Things Really Work: Lessons from a Life in Politics, published by the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History. ""Nostalgia is not my purpose,"" Hobby writes in the book's preface. ""But I do hope to convey something of my admiration for the people that I had the honor to work with, the spirit of the times, and a sense of how things actually worked--at least in the legislative process."" His no-holds-barred opinions about everything from partisan politics to efforts to rewrite the Texas Constitution to government wiretaps and the war on drugs are included, as are his memories of working with Texas politicians Ben Ramsey, Dolph Briscoe, Bill Clements, and Ann Richards. Hobby's years as lieutenant governor coincided with Texas's transition from a state dependent on oil and agriculture to one with a more diversified economy strengthened by the technology and health care industries. Through it all, Hobby emphasized the need for Texas to make education a priority. He enjoyed the nuts and bolts of the legislative process, especially appropriations and redistricting. ""To help people, government has to work,"" he says. ""Make the system work.""",Biography & Autobiography,0,N/A,0,en

Imagine Heaven,John Burke,Baker Books,2015-10-13,"It's obvious from the bookshelves and the big screen that heaven is on everyone's mind. All of us long to know what life after death will be like. Bestselling author John Burke is no exception. For decades, he has been studying accounts of people who have had near-death experiences (NDEs). While not every detail of individual NDEs correlate with Scripture, Burke shows how the common experiences shared by thousands of survivors clearly point to the God of the Bible and the exhilarating picture of heaven he promises. Imagine Heaven is an inspirational journey through the Bible's picture of heaven, colored in with the real-life stories of heaven's wonders. Burke compares gripping stories of NDEs to what Scripture says about our biggest questions of heaven: Will I be myself? Will I see friends and loved ones? What will it look like? What is God like? What will we do forever? What about children and pets? This book will propel readers into an experience that will forever change their view of the life to come and the way they live life today. It also tackles the tough questions of heavenly reward and hellish NDEs. Anyone interested in NDEs or longing to imagine heaven more clearly will enjoy this fascinating and hope-filled book.",Religion,351,5,2,en

The Space Between Two Thoughts: the Teachings of Iam,Dr. Virginia Davis Harper,AuthorHouse,2010-02-22,"The guides, when they come, should bring great feelings of love. This is the true indication that a high guide is present; there are few elseThe guides can only come in the space between two thoughts in that space between the in-breath and the out-breath, that space that is the quiet pool or reservoir of the deep wisdom within. IAM IAM represents the wisdom in each of us, and is a true teacher and friend. Written from a whole-brain perspective, The Space Between Two Thoughts is profound and accessible to individuals of all faiths and paths. With humor and compassion, this text weaves over 70 healing transmissions with commentary, dialogue, and easy to use Armchair Enlightenment exercises, demonstrating that the spiritual and material planes are not separate. What people are saying about IAM: IAMs advice and exercises have been very useful for my personal growth and mental well-being. IAM has made me realize that there truly is a higher power, and it cares very much about every aspect of our lives, no matter how small. IAM tells us things about ourselves that are really helpful and transformative in a way that no one else would know. It gives us the clues or guideposts to help us transform and evolve. A realization that I gained from IAM was the importance of each person, each animal, every plant, every action, every moment. We are all interconnected.","Body, Mind & Spirit",246,N/A,0,en

On the Origin of Spin,Brendan Bruce,CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform,2013-06-29,"This book was written to try and answer the question: ‘where and when did political spin originate?’ It deals with the techniques of news management developed and used in those advanced democracies who have laws to protect a free press. such as the United States of America, and to a lesser extent its first cousin, several times removed, the United Kingdom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland, or to be more precise, England, who in 1695 became the first country in the world to enshrine a free press into their constitutional law. This joint history of legal protections of press freedom; governmental toleration of free speech; progressive legislation to widen the franchise; vigorous growth in political parties; pluralism and its consequence, the peaceful coexistence of different interests, convictions and lifestyles; a healthy adherence to Burkean ‘little platoons’ of volunteers; and, most of all, sophisticated developments in mass media technologies and consumer marketing techniques; all of which means that the Anglo-Saxon cousins are, and have always been, in the vanguard of news management. Government and media have been at war from the very beginning. Au fond this is a struggle for allegiance. The media want the allegiance of their readers and viewers, because this brings them the profits they need to remain in business. As Patrick Le Lay, then CEO of the main French private channel TF1 put it: ""There are many ways to speak about TV, but in a business perspective, let's be realistic: TF1's job is to help Coca-Cola sell its product. What we sell to Coca-Cola is available human brain time."" Government on the other hand wants the allegiance of the voter, to acquire or retain power. The famous Victorian editor of 'The Times', Thomas Barnes, once said that the ""newspaper is not an organ through which Government can influence people, but through which people can influence the Government."" Politicians would reverse the dictum. And therein lies the causus belli. The politician's strategy for winning this war was stated most succinctly by that arch media manipulator, David Lloyd George: ""what you can't square, you squash; and what you can't squash, you square."" The media for their part, are determined to be neither squashed nor squared. From 1800 in the US and 1832 in Britain (when Germany and Italy were just a glint in the eye of some petty princes; and France was recovering from yet another pointless 'revolution' leaving behind yet another example of Kafka's bureaucratic slime); competitive, party based elections produced extraordinary outbursts of creativity. Politicians learned that the art of politics is about making and then winning arguments. As each successive cutting edge novelty arrived, the spin doctors quickly adapted and improved their techniques by adroitly exploiting the new medium’s benefits. For two centuries (and even before) the ‘Anglo-Saxons’ have led the world in spin: this is the history of that journey.",Political Science,511,N/A,0,en
Empire of Imagination,Michael Witwer,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2015-10-06,"The first comprehensive biography of geek and gaming culture's mythic icon, Gary Gygax, and the complete story behind his invention of Dungeons & Dragons. The life story of Gary Gygax, godfather of all fantasy adventure games, has been told only in bits and pieces. Michael Witwer has written a dynamic, dramatized biography of Gygax from his childhood in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin to his untimely death in 2008. Gygax's magnum opus, Dungeons & Dragons, would explode in popularity throughout the 1970s and '80s and irreversibly alter the world of gaming. D&D is the best-known, best-selling role-playing game of all time, and it boasts an elite class of alumni--Stephen Colbert, Robin Williams, and Vin Diesel all have spoken openly about their experience with the game as teenagers, and some credit it as the workshop where their nascent imaginations were fostered. Gygax's involvement in the industry lasted long after his dramatic and involuntary departure from D&D's parent company, TSR, and his footprint can be seen in the role-playing genre he is largely responsible for creating. Through his unwavering commitment to the power of creativity, Gygax gave generations of gamers the tools to invent characters and entire worlds in their minds. Witwer has written an engaging chronicle of the life and legacy of this emperor of the imagination.",Biography & Autobiography,357,N/A,0,en

Where the roots of oak trees recover and repair from their time in the light. Where the porcupette eats delicacies—raspberry leaves!—and coos and sings.

By the Light of the Moon,Dean Koontz,Bantam,2012-05-29,"Dean Koontz has surpassed his longtime reputation as “America’s most popular suspense novelist”(Rolling Stone) to become one of the most celebrated and successful writers of our time. Reviewers hail his boundless originality, his art, his unparalleled ability to create highly textured, riveting drama, at once viscerally familiar and utterly unique. Author of one #1 New York Times bestseller after another, Koontz is at the pinnacle of his powers, spinning mysteries and miracles, enthralling tales that speak directly to today’s readers, balm for the heart and fire for the mind. In this stunning new novel, he delivers a tour de force of dark suspense and brilliant revelation that has all the Koontz trademarks: adventure, chills, riddles, humor, heartbreak, an unforgettable cast of characters, and a climax that will leave you clamoring for more. Dylan O’Connor is a gifted young artist just trying to do the right thing in life. He’s on his way to an arts festival in Santa Fe when he stops to get a room for himself and his twenty-year-old autistic brother, Shep. But in a nightmarish instant, Dylan is attacked by a mysterious “doctor,” injected with a strange substance, and told that he is now a carrier of something that will either kill him...or transform his life in the most remarkable way. Then he is told that he must flee--before the doctor’s enemies hunt him down for the secret circulating through his body. No one can help him, the doctor says, not even the police. Stunned, disbelieving, Dylan is turned loose to run for his life...and straight into an adventure that will turn the next twenty-four hours into an odyssey of terror, mystery--and wondrous discovery. It is a journey that begins when Dylan and Shep’s path intersects with that of Jillian Jackson. Before that evening Jilly was a beautiful comedian whose biggest worry was whether she would ever find a decent man. Now she too is a carrier. And even as Dylan tries to convince her that they’ll be safer sticking together, cold-eyed men in a threatening pack of black Suburbans approach, only seconds before Jilly’s classic Coupe DeVille explodes into thin air. Now the three are on the run together, but with no idea whom they’re running from--or why. Meanwhile Shep has begun exhibiting increasingly disturbing behavior. And whatever it is that’s coursing through their bodies seems to have plunged them into one waking nightmare after another. Seized by sinister premonitions, they find themselves inexplicably drawn to crime scenes--just minutes before the crimes take place. What this unfathomable power is, how they can use it to stop the evil erupting all around them, and why they have been chosen are only parts of a puzzle that reaches back into the tragic past and the dark secrets they all share: secrets of madness, pain, and untimely death. Perhaps the answer lies in the eerie, enigmatic messages that Shep, with precious time running out, begins to repeat, about an entity who does his work “by the light of the moon.” By the Light of the Moon is a novel of heart-stopping suspense and transcendent beauty, of how evil can destroy us and love can redeem us--a masterwork of the imagination in which the surprises come page after page and the spell of sublime storytelling triumphs throughout. BONUS: This edition contains an excerpt from Dean Koontz's The City.",Fiction,481,N/A,0,en

The Daily Adventures of Mixerman,Mixerman,Hal Leonard Corporation,2009-05-01,"(Book). Mixerman is a recording engineer working with a famous producer on the debut album of an unknown band with a giant recording budget. Mixerman is supposed to be writing about recording techniques, but somehow, through that prism, he has hit upon a gripping story. Like all great narratives, Mixerman's diary has many anti-heroes for whom we, the readers, can have nothing but contempt. The band consists of the four most dislikable human beings you can imagine. The singer is vain and pretentious. The guitarist is a serious depressive. The drummer is as ""dumb as cotton,"" and the bassist is merely mean and petty, making him the only one that Mixerman can stand. All four of them hate each other's guts, and they haven't even been on tour yet. Mixerman takes you through the recording process of a bidding war band in over their heads with a famous record producer (also in over his head). Many find Mixerman's diary entries side-splittingly funny. Some find them maddening.

Is the stigma attached to adoption lessening? Does open communication about adoption contribute to the family's well-being? How successful are adoptive adults at putting their adolescent turmoil behind them? These and many other important and complex questions are addressed in Families and Adoption, an informative guidebook that shows you how adoption is both a condition and a lifelong process. Families and Adoption discusses legislation that can serve the needs of various members of the adoptive experience to deepen your understanding of the key legal issues associated with consent and openness. It also provides you with detailed coverage of changes in adoption law, open adoption research results, transracial and transethnic adoption, and the consequences of placing versus parenting for unmarried, teenage women who give birth. Graduate students, social workers, adoption professionals, members of adoptive families, and couples wishing to adopt will find there isn't a rock that Families and Adoption leaves unturned. It presents you with vital information on the following topics: the developmental stages of reunion between an adoptive child and birth parent, notions of adoption, parenthood, and kinship and how these notions are challenged after a reunion has taken place, the institution of adoption as it has existed for decades in American society, international adoption, respecting the bonds children have and helping them develop critical attachment skills, those who “accept” open-adoption and those who “embrace” it, flexible parenting styles and their positive effect on developmentally vulnerable adoptees. A skillful blend of personal adoption experiences and research studies, Families and Adoption explores the special issues adoption presents and how all parties involved can work together to improve placement decisions, ensure that a woman is confident in her decision to relinquish her child, and help families select the most appropriate adoption arrangement. The book's main strength is that it doesn't just look at the initial considerations of adoption; it prepares you for the issues that will arise along the way.",Social Science,273,N/A,0,en

Two Wheels Good,Jody Rosen,Crown,2023-06-13,"A panoramic revisionist portrait of the nineteenth-century invention that is transforming the twenty-first-century world “Excellent . . . calls to mind Bill Bryson, John McPhee, Rebecca Solnit.”—The New York Times Book Review (Editors’ Choice) ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: The New Yorker The bicycle is a vestige of the Victorian era, seemingly at odds with our age of smartphones and ride-sharing apps and driverless cars. Yet we live on a bicycle planet. Across the world, more people travel by bicycle than any other form of transportation. Almost anyone can learn to ride a bike—and nearly everyone does. In Two Wheels Good, journalist and critic Jody Rosen reshapes our understanding of this ubiquitous machine, an ever-present force in humanity’s life and dream life—and a flash point in culture wars—for more than two hundred years. Combining history, reportage, travelogue, and memoir, Rosen’s book sweeps across centuries and around the globe, unfolding the bicycle’s saga from its invention in 1817 to its present-day renaissance as a “green machine,” an emblem of sustainability in a world afflicted by pandemic and climate change. Readers meet unforgettable characters: feminist rebels who steered bikes to the barricades in the 1890s, a prospector who pedaled across the frozen Yukon to join the Klondike gold rush, a Bhutanese king who races mountain bikes in the Himalayas, a cycle-rickshaw driver who navigates the seething streets of the world’s fastest-growing megacity, astronauts who ride a floating bicycle in zero gravity aboard the International Space Station. Two Wheels Good examines the bicycle’s past and peers into its future, challenging myths and clichés while uncovering cycling’s connection to colonial conquest and the gentrification of cities. But the book is also a love letter: a reflection on the sensual and spiritual pleasures of bike riding and an ode to an engineering marvel—a wondrous vehicle whose passenger is also its engine.",History,417,N/A,0,en

In Suspect Terrain,John McPhee,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux",2011-04-01,"From the outwash plains of Brooklyn to Indiana's drifted diamonds and gold, John McPhee's In Suspect Terrain is a narrative of the earth, told in four sections of equal length, each in a different way reflecting the three others-- a biography; a set piece about a fragment of Appalachian landscape in illuminating counterpoint to the human history there; a modern collision of ideas about the origins of the mountain range; and, in contrast, a century-old collision of ideas about the existence of the Ice Age. The central figure is Anita Harris, an internationally celebrated geologist who went into her profession to get out of a Brooklyn ghetto. The unifying theme is plate tectonics-- here concentrating on the acceptance that all aspects of the theory do not universally enjoy. As such, In Suspect Terrain is a report from the rough spots at the front edge of a science. In Suspect Terrain is the second book in a series on geology and geologists, presenting a cross section of North America along the fortieth parallel, and gathered under the overall title Annals of the Former World.

Fats Waller on the Air,Stephen Taylor,Scarecrow Press,2006,"Radio and television broadcasts are an essential component in the career of jazz musician Thomas ""Fats"" Waller. The medium suited his character well, allowing his friendly, energetic personality to shine through. This book meticulously documents Waller's on-air appearances: from his first known broadcast in 1923 at age 19 to the final airing before his premature death in 1943. Fats Waller On The Air: The Radio Broadcasts and Discography adds another dimension to the life of this dynamic performer. Author Stephen Taylor combines established material with fresh research, resulting in a wealth of new information. The broadcasts, including tributes to Waller after his death, are covered in detail, featuring dates, times, songs played, and other artists who appeared on the program. Through descriptions from contemporary newspapers and magazines, accounts from individuals who were in attendance, and remarks by radio announcers from original transcripts, the book provides historical perspective and a clear sense of the character and feel of the broadcasts. The book also offers a timechart of early sound recording and radio transcriptions, allowing easy comparison of Waller's presence in the field. Never before published photos and a thorough, accurate discography-including 78 and 45 rpm records, transcriptions, LPs, CDs, and DVDs-make this an important reference tool for fans of Fats Waller, jazz music, stride piano, black social history, and broadcast history.",Biography & Autobiography,392,N/A,0,en

"Woke, Inc.",Vivek Ramaswamy,Hachette UK,2021-08-17,"In this New York Times bestseller, a young and successful entrepreneur makes the case that politics has no place in business, and sets out a new vision for the future of American capitalism. There’s a new invisible force at work in our economic and cultural lives. It affects every advertisement we see and every product we buy, from our morning coffee to a new pair of shoes. “Stakeholder capitalism” makes rosy promises of a better, more diverse, environmentally-friendly world, but in reality this ideology championed by America’s business and political leaders robs us of our money, our voice, and our identity. Vivek Ramaswamy is a traitor to his class. He’s founded multibillion-dollar enterprises, led a biotech company as CEO, he became a hedge fund partner in his 20s, trained as a scientist at Harvard and a lawyer at Yale, and grew up the child of immigrants in a small town in Ohio. Now he takes us behind the scenes into corporate boardrooms and five-star conferences, into Ivy League classrooms and secretive nonprofits, to reveal the defining scam of our century. The modern woke-industrial complex divides us as a people. By mixing morality with consumerism, America’s elites prey on our innermost insecurities about who we really are. They sell us cheap social causes and skin-deep identities to satisfy our hunger for a cause and our search for meaning, at a moment when we as Americans lack both. This book not only rips back the curtain on the new corporatist agenda, it offers a better way forward. America’s elites may want to sort us into demographic boxes, but we don’t have to stay there. Woke, Inc. begins as a critique of stakeholder capitalism and ends with an exploration of what it means to be an American today—a journey that begins with cynicism and ends with hope.",Business & Economics,310,N/A,0,en

When physics professor Chad Orzel went to the pound to adopt a dog, he never imagined Emmy. She wasn’t just a friendly mutt who needed a home. Soon she was trying to use the strange ideas of quantum mechanics for the really important things in her life: chasing critters, getting treats, and going for walks. She peppered Chad with questions: Could she use quantum tunneling to get through the neighbor’s fence and chase bunnies? What about quantum teleportation to catch squirrels before they climb out of reach? Where are all the universes in which Chad drops steak on the floor? With great humor and clarity, Chad Orzel explains to Emmy, and to human readers, just what quantum mechanics is and how it works—and why, although you can’t use it to catch squirrels or eat steak, it’s still bizarre, amazing, and important to every dog and human.",Science,256,N/A,0,en

The Light Ages,Seb Falk,National Geographic Books,2021-11-30,"Named a Best Book of 2020 by The Telegraph, The Times, and BBC History Magazine An illuminating guide to the scientific and technological achievements of the Middle Ages through the life of a crusading astronomer-monk. Soaring Gothic cathedrals, violent crusades, the Black Death: these are the dramatic forces that shaped the medieval era. But the so-called Dark Ages also gave us the first universities, eyeglasses, and mechanical clocks. As medieval thinkers sought to understand the world around them, from the passing of the seasons to the stars in the sky, they came to develop a vibrant scientific culture. In The Light Ages, Cambridge science historian Seb Falk takes us on a tour of medieval science through the eyes of one fourteenth-century monk, John of Westwyk. Born in a rural manor, educated in England’s grandest monastery, and then exiled to a clifftop priory, Westwyk was an intrepid crusader, inventor, and astrologer. From multiplying Roman numerals to navigating by the stars, curing disease, and telling time with an ancient astrolabe, we learn emerging science alongside Westwyk and travel with him through the length and breadth of England and beyond its shores. On our way, we encounter a remarkable cast of characters: the clock-building English abbot with leprosy, the French craftsman-turned-spy, and the Persian polymath who founded the world’s most advanced observatory. The Light Ages offers a gripping story of the struggles and successes of an ordinary man in a precarious world and conjures a vivid picture of medieval life as we have never seen it before. An enlightening history that argues that these times weren’t so dark after all, The Light Ages shows how medieval ideas continue to color how we see the world today.",Science,0,N/A,0,en

"Black Broadway in Washington, D.C.",Briana A Thomas,Arcadia Publishing,2018-09-10,"A history of the African American neighborhood and its remarkable residents in our nation’s capital. Before chain coffeeshops and luxury high-rises, before even the beginning of desegregation and the 1968 riots, Washington’s Greater U Street was known as Black Broadway. From the early 1900s into the 1950s, African Americans plagued by Jim Crow laws in other parts of town were free to own businesses here and built what was often described as a “city within a city.” Local author and journalist Briana A. Thomas narrates U Street’s rich and unique history, from the early triumph of emancipation to the days of civil rights pioneer Mary Church Terrell and music giant Duke Ellington, through the recent struggles of gentrification. “[An] engaging and compelling history. A skillful storyteller, Thomas brings the neighborhood’s people to life; and what a list of neighbors they are: Marion Barry; “Cool Papa” Bell; Mary McLeod Bethune; Ralph Bunche; Stokely Carmichael; Kenneth B. Clark; Anna Julia Cooper; Rev. Alexander Crummell; Charles H. Drew; Paul Laurence Dunbar; Edward Kennedy “Duke” Ellington; E. Franklin Frazier; Bishop C. M. “Sweet Daddy” Grace; the Grimké’s Angelina, Archibald, and Francis; Buck Leonard; A. Philip Randolph; Mary Church Terrell; and Carter G. Woodson, to name just a few. . . . Thomas makes them all—and perhaps even more importantly, many unknown everyday U Streeters—fully alive. Pick up her book and all doubts about the importance of the Nation’s Capital for American life will disappear.” —Blair A. Ruble, author of Washington’s U Street: A Biography",History,185,N/A,0,en

Specialty Retailers -- Marketing Triumphs and Blunders,"Ronald D. Michman, Edward M. Mazze",Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2001-02-28,"Michman and Mazze present five key variables that retailing executives in nine specialty businesses must understand and work with, to gain and sustain competitive advantage in their competitive environments. Innovation, target market segmentation, image development, physical store decor, and human resource managementf are identified and examined. Authors argue convincingly from research and practical experience that these fundamental considerations are crucial to achieving competitive dominance. With up-to-date analyses and extensive coverage of e-commerce and internet retailing as well, their book is essential for retailing executives. Michman and Mazze find that successful specialty retailers are not all things to all customers, and do not try to be. They are, however, the first to apply new technologies. Authors analyze the development of specialty stores in the U.S. and tie their variables together in an epilogue. Along the way they make clear that by focusing on their five critical variables, we can understand how marketing successes come about and what causes blunders in the nine highly important store categories under their examination here. They point out that not all of their variables need be used concurrently. Some may be more critical than others, and this depends on environmental and competitive conditions. Backing it all up is meticulously developed evidence from their research and personal experience -- all of it presented readably and in a way that practitioners can understand and immediately apply.",Business & Economics,280,N/A,0,en

Destruction Rites,Mona Hadler,Bloomsbury Publishing,2017-01-30,"In the early sixties, crowds gathered to watch rites of destruction - from the demolition derby where makeshift cars crashed into each other for sport, to concerts where musicians destroyed their instruments, to performances of self-destructing machines staged by contemporary artists. Destruction, in both its playful and fearsome aspects, was ubiquitous in the new Atomic Age. This complicated subjectivity was not just a way for people to find catharsis amid the fears of annihilation and postwar trauma, but also a complex instantiation of ideological crisis in a time with some seriously conflicted political myths. Destruction Rites explores the ephemeral visual culture of destruction in the postwar era and its links to contemporary art. It examines the demolition derby; games and toys based on warfare; playgrounds situated in bomb sites; and the rise of garage sales, where goods designed for obsolescence and destined for the garbage heap are reclaimed and repurposed by local communities. Mona Hadler looks at artists such as Jean Tinguely, Niki de Saint Phalle, Martha Rosler and Vito Acconci to expose how the 1960s saw destruction, construction and the everyday collide as never before. During the Atomic age, whether in the public sphere or art museums, destruction could be transformed into a constructive force and art objects and performances often oscillated between the two.",Art,282,N/A,0,en

It was due the next day. We were out at our family cabin in Bolinas, and he was at the kitchen table close to tears, surrounded by binder paper and pencils and unopened books on birds, immobilized by the hugeness of the task ahead. Then my father sat down beside him, put his arm around my brother’s shoulder, and said, ‘Bird by bird, buddy. Just take it bird by bird.’”",Language Arts & Disciplines,274,3.5,4,en

Scholars, practitioners, public health professionals, and principals in the child development community convened to address a science-based framework for elements of well-being and how the elements might be developed across the life course. Integrating physical, cognitive, and social-emotional domains, Well-Being is the first scientific book to consider well-being holistically. Focusing on a set of core strengths grouped within these three domains, the book also includes a fourth section on developmental strengths through adulthood that broadly examines a continuum of health and development, as well as transitions in well-being. This volume takes a developmental perspective across the life course, describing foundational strengths for well-being--the capacities that can be actively developed, supported, or learned. These foundational strengths--problem solving, emotional regulation, and physical safety--are the positive underpinnings of early child health and development, as well as ongoing well-being across the life course.

Encyclopedia of Play in Today′s Society,Rodney P. Carlisle,SAGE Publications,2009-04-02,"CHOICE Outstanding Academic Title for 2009 ""This ground-breaking resource is strongly recommended for all libraries and health and welfare institutional depots; essential for university collections, especially those catering to social studies programs."" —Library Journal, STARRED Review Children and adults spend a great deal of time in activities we think of as ""play,"" including games, sports, and hobbies. Without thinking about it very deeply, almost everyone would agree that such activities are fun, relaxing, and entertaining. However, play has many purposes that run much deeper than simple entertainment. For children, play has various functions such as competition, following rules, accepting defeat, choosing leaders, exercising leadership, practicing adult roles, and taking risks in order to reap rewards. For adults, many games and sports serve as harmless releases of feelings of aggression, competition, and intergroup hostility. The Encyclopedia of Play in Today′s Society explores the concept of play in history and modern society in the United States and internationally. Its scope encompasses leisure and recreational activities of children and adults throughout the ages, from dice games in the Roman Empire to video games today. With more than 450 entries, these two volumes do not include coverage of professional sports and sport teams but, instead, cover the hundreds of games played not to earn a living but as informal activity. All aspects of play—from learning to competition, mastery of nature, socialization, and cooperation—are included. Simply enough, this Encyclopedia explores play played for the fun of it! Key Features Available in both print and electronic formats Provides access to the fascinating literature that has explored questions of psychology, learning theory, game theory, and history in depth Considers the affects of play on child and adult development, particularly on health, creativity, and imagination Contains entries that describe both adult and childhood play and games in dozens of cultures around the world and throughout history Explores the sophisticated analyses of social thinkers such as Huizinga, Vygotsky, and Sutton-Smith, as well as the wide variety of games, toys, sports, and entertainments found around the world Presents cultures as diverse as the ancient Middle East, modern Russia, and China and in nations as far flung as India, Argentina, and France Key Themes Adult Games Board and Card Games Children′s Games History of Play Outdoor Games and Amateur Sports Play and Education Play Around the World Psychology of Play Sociology of Play Toys and Business Video and Online Games For a subject we mostly consider light-hearted, play as a research topic has generated an extensive and sophisticated literature, exploring a range of penetrating questions.

The Meaning of Activities in the Dwelling and Residential Environment,J. Meesters,IOS Press,2009-04-28,"The dwelling is a central setting in people’s everyday life. People use their dwelling and residential environment for a large variety of activities and purposes. The Meaning of Activities in the Dwelling and Residential Environment systematically relates activities, settings and meanings to improve the insight into people-environment relations which is called a meaning structure approach. Over 600 people, living in either a city centre, suburban or rural type of residential environment were asked about their everyday activities and the meanings thereof. The results show that meanings are important for the way in which people use their dwelling and residential environment. The meaning structure approach allows for a high level of aggregation identifying general meanings of the dwelling, such as a place to be together with family and friends. It also allows for a low level of aggregation, for example, using internet at home has for many people become part of everyday life, providing them with easy access to a wide range of information.

Task-based grammar teaching of English,Susanne Niemeier,Narr Francke Attempto Verlag,2017-10-23,"The focus on communication in TBLT often comes at the expense of form. In this book, the task-based approach is enhanced and coupled with insights into (cognitive) grammar, an approach which sees grammar as meaningful. The book shows how grammar teaching can be integrated into a communicative lesson in a non-explicit way, i.e., ""by the backdoor"". The learners are involved in situations that they may also encounter outside their classrooms and they are given communicative tasks they are to work on and solve, usually with a partner or in small groups. What teachers need to invest for preparing such lessons is their own creativity, as they have to come up with communicative situations which guide the learners into using a specific grammatical structure. The book first discusses the didactic and the linguistic theories involved and then translates these theoretical perspectives into actual teaching practice, focusing on the following grammatical phenomena: tense, aspect, modality, conditionals, passive voice, prepositions, phrasal verbs, verb complementation, pronouns and articles.",Literary Criticism,267,N/A,0,en

Variational Analysis and Set Optimization,"Akhtar A. Khan, Elisabeth Köbis, Christiane Tammer",CRC Press,2019-06-07,"This book contains the latest advances in variational analysis and set / vector optimization, including uncertain optimization, optimal control and bilevel optimization. Recent developments concerning scalarization techniques, necessary and sufficient optimality conditions and duality statements are given. New numerical methods for efficiently solving set optimization problems are provided. Moreover, applications in economics, finance and risk theory are discussed. Summary The objective of this book is to present advances in different areas of variational analysis and set optimization, especially uncertain optimization, optimal control and bilevel optimization. Uncertain optimization problems will be approached from both a stochastic as well as a robust point of view. This leads to different interpretations of the solutions, which widens the choices for a decision-maker given his preferences. Recent developments regarding linear and nonlinear scalarization techniques with solid and nonsolid ordering cones for solving set optimization problems are discussed in this book. These results are useful for deriving optimality conditions for set and vector optimization problems. Consequently, necessary and sufficient optimality conditions are presented within this book, both in terms of scalarization as well as generalized derivatives. Moreover, an overview of existing duality statements and new duality assertions is given. The book also addresses the field of variable domination structures in vector and set optimization. Including variable ordering cones is especially important in applications such as medical image registration with uncertainties. This book covers a wide range of applications of set optimization. These range from finance, investment, insurance, control theory, economics to risk theory. As uncertain multi-objective optimization, especially robust approaches, lead to set optimization, one main focus of this book is uncertain optimization. Important recent developments concerning numerical methods for solving set optimization problems sufficiently fast are main features of this book. These are illustrated by various examples as well as easy-to-follow-steps in order to facilitate the decision process for users. Simple techniques aimed at practitioners working in the fields of mathematical programming, finance and portfolio selection are presented. These will help in the decision-making process, as well as give an overview of nondominated solutions to choose from.",Business & Economics,337,N/A,0,en

A Student's Advanced Grammar of English (SAGE),Peter Fenn,UTB,2022-06-13,"Whatever kind of high-level language user you are – college or university student, serving language teacher, or advanced school learner – A Student’s Advanced Grammar of English (SAGE) offers you support, information, and further training. SAGE is a reference work as well as a programmed refresher course with exercises on the accompanying website, and a structured teaching aid. It serves as a spot-check in specific cases of uncertainty. But it also answers broader queries and provides comprehensive insights into the major structural areas of English. Its concern is not simply grammar, but above all usage. SAGE is easy to comprehend and non-specialist in method. All grammatical terminology is explained in a simple and straightforward manner. On the other hand, SAGE takes account of current research in language studies. In catering especially for the user with a native German background, SAGE treats many areas of English from a contrastive point of view, highlighting those phenomena which cause typical problems in a German-based learning context.

Medical Examination Made Memorable,"Yousaf Shahed, Anthony Culyer",CRC Press,2018-04-19,"Examination is an area of medical practice which requires much factual, diagnostic and procedural knowledge to be committed to memory: this in itself can be a challenging feat. Medical Examination Made Memorable puts research on learning and memorising techniques into action, presenting medical examination in a unique, enjoyable and easy-to-learn format. Health conditions are linked to well-known people, and specially drawn images - often deliberately bizarre or exaggerated to make them more memorable - are included throughout. Information is broken down into easily recallable chunks, and mnemonics (which may not suit all learning styles) are only included where especially clear or useful. Discussing information with others stimulates the aural component of memory, and practicing physical skills leads to kinaesthetic memorisation (muscle memory): the book also takes these vital learning techniques into account. Medical Examination Made Memorable is a vital reference and aide-memoire for students and practitioners at all levels and in all specialisms.",Medical,310,N/A,0,en

Getting to the Common Core,"Sharon L. Spencer, Sandra Vavra",IAP,2015-01-01,"The Common Core Standards have recently been adopted in most states across the nation and teachers are in the process of getting to the core of these standards. Teaching to standards is not a new concept; teachers have adapted to new standards every few years for quite some time. And teachers are adaptable, as can be seen in this book. We are writing this book to demonstrate how teachers use research-based strategies to meet Common Core Standards while still focusing on students. Our goal is to help teachers visualize students in action as other teachers describe the implementation of research-based strategies in their own classrooms, show student work samples, and provide reflections of student success in achieving the standards. Many Common Core Standards books focus on the standards, but our approach focuses on strategies that engage the students in the classroom--showing how different teachers at varying grade levels have used the strategies to meet the standards. With this focus, we believe that teachers gain a new and positive perspective on approaching the new standards and see the flexibility of strategies for meeting standards across subject areas. We have examined research on the strategies with the purpose of giving teachers a brief description of why these strategies work before giving actual examples from classrooms. We also work closely with teachers in the public schools and have our finger on the pulse of what is happening in the public schools—one of the current stressors being unpacking the Common Core Standards This book actually focuses on practice. We begin by laying out a rationale in our first chapter---The Core Value(s) of Education. Then, each chapter focuses on a strategy, including 1) a brief description about the research supporting each strategy and 2) several examples from different grade levels, which include a description of how the strategy was used, student work samples, and a reflection on the use of the strategy. The research descriptions are fairly short because, while we believe professional educators (aka teachers, in this case) should know the research that supports practice, we know they are not typically interested in long diatribes about the research.",Education,595,N/A,0,en

Spiritual Formation in Local Faith Communities,"Neil Pembroke, Ewan Kelly, Theo Pleizier, William S. Schmidt, Jan-Albert van den Berg",Wipf and Stock Publishers,2022-03-31,"Spiritual formation in our local churches is too often poorly done or it is virtually nonexistent. We developed this innovative approach to spiritual formation in the congregation because it is desperately needed. The prompt cards are used to spark deep reflection and shape potentially life-transforming conversations with a pastor around spiritual practices, spiritual character, personal and social ethics, and emotional well-being. The model was trialed in five countries. We heard time and time again how the six-week process fired a passion to go deeper with Christ. Some reported praying regularly for the first time in decades. Others found the Scriptures coming alive after years of “going through the motions.” In this book, the authors present a simple but powerful method and offer in-depth theological reflection on related issues. Some of the important areas covered are early church approaches to spiritual formation, contemporary spiritual practices, spiritual character, the indissoluble link between spirituality and moral virtue, the spirituality of the pastor, and the positive psychology approach.",Religion,240,N/A,0,en

User Models in Dialog Systems,"Alfred Kobsa, Wolfgang Wahlster",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"User models have recently attracted much research interest in the field of artificial intelligence dialog systems. It has become evident that flexible user-oriented dialog behavior of such systems can be achieved only if the system has access to a model of the user containing assumptions about his/her background knowledge as well as his/her goals and plans in consulting the system. Research in the field of user models investigates how such assumptions can be automatically created, represented and exploited by the system in the course of an ""on-line"" interaction with the user. The communication medium in this interaction need not necessarily be a natural language, such as English or German. Formal interaction languages are also permit ted. The emphasis is placed on systems with natural language input and output, however. A dozen major and several more minor user modeling systems have been de signed and implemented in the last decade, mostly in the context of natural-language dialog systems. The goal of UM86, the first international workshop on user model ing, was to bring together the researchers working on these projects so that results could be discussed and analyzed, and hopefully general insights be found, that could prove useful for future research.

The volume will appeal to anyone interested in new ways of researching the complex and dynamic phenomenon of the early learning of English.",Language Arts & Disciplines,229,N/A,0,en

Agglomeration Economics,Edward L. Glaeser,University of Chicago Press,2010-04-15,"When firms and people are located near each other in cities and in industrial clusters, they benefit in various ways, including by reducing the costs of exchanging goods and ideas. One might assume that these benefits would become less important as transportation and communication costs fall. Paradoxically, however, cities have become increasingly important, and even within cities industrial clusters remain vital. Agglomeration Economics brings together a group of essays that examine the reasons why economic activity continues to cluster together despite the falling costs of moving goods and transmitting information. The studies cover a wide range of topics and approach the economics of agglomeration from different angles. Together they advance our understanding of agglomeration and its implications for a globalized world.",Business & Economics,376,N/A,0,en

Reading Jean-Jacques Rousseau through the Prism of Chess,Florian Vauleon,University of Michigan Press,2019-11-25,"Over a period of forty years, Rousseau combined his devotion to writing with his enthusiasm for chess, and these two passions necessarily intertwined. Rousseau was able to transfer his power of concentration and the strict dialectics of his literary writings to his chess strategy. If Rousseau’s analytical skills influenced his attitude toward the game, then the game of chess inspired his logic and affected his discourse. Interpreted as a form of rationality, as a conceptual paradigm, the rules and strategies of chess accurately describe Rousseau’s ideas for social management, political power, and organization. Reading Jean-Jacques Rousseau through the Prism of Chess shows that Rousseau’s political theory, though allegedly inspired by Nature, found a perfect model in a game created by mankind; chess thus became a reference for his philosophical discourse and practice as well as a method to systematize Nature and organize society.",Political Science,156,N/A,0,en

But the lessons aren't as easy as she thought they would be. Abuela is a strict teacher and the words are a lot more difficult to memorize than Isabella thought they would be, so at the goading of her best friend she decides to put a stop to them.

General Surgery Residency Survival Guide,"Asanthi Ratnasekera, Marc Neff, Kahyun Yoon-Flannery, Alec Beekley",Springer Nature,2023-03-27,"There are over 250 surgical residencies in the United States. Most residents experience some degree of shock once they start on the very first day, and the demands of residency are high. The current overall dropout rate is 16%, and there is evidence for higher burnout rates, suicide rates, addiction rates and divorce rates among all surgeons compared to other careers. There is therefore a critical need for the education of resiliency during surgical residency and guidance on surviving this challenging portion of their career. Unfortunately, the experiences of trial and error are the basis for survival, and resiliency training is often overlooked as part of the traditional surgical training. This practical guide is founded on many conversations with struggling general surgery residents and will have wide appeal, utilizing these experiences via interviews with current residents at different residency programs and covering an even wider variety of topics, with variable experiences based on differing ages, races, sexes, and marital statuses. Each chapter begins with a topic and a brief introduction, expansion on the topic based on their unique experiences, and then a concluding list of pearls to remember and use in daily residency. The topics are broken down thematically into five main sections, covering the breadth of residency experience and work/life balance: academics, clinical duties, life outside of work, leadership and ethics, and basic survival skills and self-care. Written by current residents for current residents, General Surgery Residency Survival Guide will be a valuable resource for everyone navigating this challenging portion of their medical career.",Medical,189,N/A,0,en

Social Work in the Age of Disconnection,"Michael Jarrette-Kenny, Miriam Jaffe",Routledge,2022-05-05,"This edited text brings together the stories of nine clinical social workers working during COVID-19, exploring the disconnections caused by a forced use of technology as well as the disconnections apparent in a time of social injustice. Employing narrative strategies to capture this transformative moment of our history, these chapters explore the effects of technology and social media on psychotherapy, the delivery of services for the chronically mentally ill and elderly, as well as the consequences of recent cultural shifts on our conceptions of gender, sexuality, race, the immigrant experience, and political activism. While traditional research methodologies tend to address social problems as if they were divorced from the lives and experiences of human beings, these chapters employ phenomenological description of how the existing system functions, to identify theory-to-practice gaps and to recover the experiences of the person within the various institutional structures. Divided into three parts, each chapter begins with pre-reading and close reading questions and ends with writing prompts, allowing for practitioners and students to examine their own thoughts, and put what they have learnt into practice. Suitable for students of clinical social work and practicing mental health professionals, this book is essential for those wanting to make sense of social work practice in our constantly evolving times.",Psychology,217,N/A,0,en

New Perspectives on Material Mediation in Language Learner Pedagogy,"Darren K. LaScotte, Corinne S. Mathieu, Samuel S.

This edited volume includes diverse perspectives on the roles that materials play in language learner pedagogy. Moving beyond the field of English language teaching, readers will find novel contributions offering a diversity of language teaching contexts, learner populations, and topics in the theory and/or practice of second and foreign language teaching. Chapters explore the ways in which affordances and constraints of classroom materials impact teachers and learners, while at the same time they bring their own (evolving) resources, identities, beliefs, and expertise to modify and adapt the materials to better suit their local language teaching and learning environments. As such, this text is ideal for use as supplemental reading in a wide variety of applied linguistics, second/foreign language education, TESOL, and instructional course design courses.",Education,290,N/A,0,en

The Accidental Immigrant,David Bouchier,iUniverse,2004-06-24,"Transatlantic humorist David Bouchier brings wit, wisdom and a touch of philosophy to the everyday dramas of American suburban life. This book brings together more than a hundred essays, originally broadcast on National Public Radio, or published in his Out of Order column in the Sunday New York Times. When work and marriage brought David Bouchier to Long Island in 1986 the endless suburbs seemed mysterious and exotic to him. He was inspired to begin writing essays and newspaper columns about his life there - a personal and public diary of the Resident Alien experience. In 1992 a weekly public radio essay was added to the newspaper columns, and thousands of listeners still enjoy David's weekly radio broadcasts. These are the affectionate and sometimes acerbic observations of an Accidental Immigrant, who still finds life in America endlessly stimulating and wonderfully strange. David Bouchier's thoughts about love, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in the suburbs will make you smile, and make you think. Boring suburban rituals like lawn care mall shopping, wedding rehearsals, and barbecues will never seem the same again.",Humor,337,N/A,0,en

Greg deconstructs pop culture, media, kids, disease, race, food, sex, celebrity, current events, and nearly every other aspect of life, with Truths including but not limited to: ""if you're over 25 and still use party as a verb, then you're beyond redemption,"" ""the media wanted bird flu to kill thousands,"" ""attractive people don't write for a living,"" ""death row inmates make the best husbands,"" and ""the urge to punch Zach Braff in the face is completely natural."" With an irreverent voice, incredible wit, and a firm take on just about everything, this is a manual for how to think about stuff, by a guy who has thought about precisely that same stuff.

Rabbits for Food,Binnie Kirshenbaum,Soho Press,2019-05-07,"Master of razor-edged literary humor Binnie Kirshenbaum returns with her first novel in a decade, a devastating, laugh-out-loud funny story of a writer’s slide into depression and institutionalization. It’s New Year’s Eve, the holiday of forced fellowship, mandatory fun, and paper hats. While dining out with her husband and their friends, Kirshenbaum’s protagonist—an acerbic, mordantly witty, and clinically depressed writer—fully unravels. Her breakdown lands her in the psych ward of a prestigious New York hospital, where she refuses all modes of recommended treatment. Instead, she passes the time chronicling the lives of her fellow “lunatics” and writing a novel about what brought her there. Her story is a brilliant and brutally funny dive into the disordered mind of a woman who sees the world all too clearly. Propelled by razor-sharp comic timing and rife with pinpoint insights, Kirshenbaum examines what it means to be unloved and loved, to succeed and fail, to be at once impervious and raw. Rabbits for Food shows how art can lead us out of—or into—the depths of disconsolate loneliness and piercing grief.

Useful Girl,Marcus Stevens,Algonquin Books,2004-01-04,"Out on the western plains, two paths cross: those of a young woman running away from home and a Cheyenne girl running for her life. They're both on a heroic quest, though more than a hundred years separate their journeys. After her mother's sudden death, Erin Douglass is virtually alone in the world. When she witnesses the exhumation of a Cheyenne girl along the side of a dirt road, life in her Montana town indelibly changes. The girl's remains, gently wrapped in a faded army coat, with silver thimbles on her right hand, are more than a hundred years old. Though her father makes every attempt to keep the discovery quiet, Erin is haunted by questions: How did this young girl end up here, in the middle of nowhere, with no marker and all alone? Who was she? Together with Charlie White Bird, a young member of her father's road crew from the nearby reservation, Erin is determined to protect her burial ground. She and Charlie meet in secret, knowing that their encounters could threaten their divided communities. But as their commitment to their cause becomes more passionate, so, too, does their relationship. When Erin is faced with a crisis she feels she must bear alone, she runs away. With her mother's old suitcase and her granddad's journals on the Indian wars, she sets out, and as she moves farther from home, the Cheyenne girl's story vividly unfolds in her mind, guiding her toward another way out of her predicament. Sweeping and evocative, Useful Girl reminds us that the past, no matter how deeply buried, is never far from view. It is a testament to the power of the imagination and a novel of heartrending beauty.",Fiction,312,N/A,0,en

But delivering on these potentially conflicting promises depends on how they are adopted and used in homes. This book starts by developing a new analytical framework for understanding smart homes and their users. Drawing on a range of new empirical research combining both qualitative and quantitative data, the book then explores how smart home technologies are perceived by potential users, how they can be used to link domestic energy use to common daily activities, how they may (or may not) be integrated into everyday life by actual users, and how they serve to change the nature of control within households and the home. The book concludes by synthesising a range of evidence-based insights, and posing a series of challenges for industry, policy, and research that need addressing if a smart home future is to be realised. Researchers will find this book provides useful insights into this fast-growing field",Computers,135,N/A,0,en

Does that question send you into a panic spiral, or are you convinced that, unlike everyone in the history of life on earth, you will somehow avoid the tragic end and live to tell the tale? Statistically, we get about 4,000 Mondays in our lifetime, so if you're halfway through your life, you might have roughly 2,000 Mondays to go. The good news is that you are in charge of how you spend those days: toiling at a job you hate, or creating a career you love; scrolling mindlessly for hours a day, or pursuing the hobbies and travel that light you up; dreading the end, or living a full life that allows you to greet the Grim Reaper with a smile.

Full of practical takeaways and research-backed content, this book will motivate readers to take action on the life they want to be living, acting like a defibrillator for the soul.

The Other Woman,Godwin Ude,Tate Publishing,2013-02,"In his book, The Other Woman, Dr. Godwin Ude, President of Kingdom Acts Foundation, President of Transformation Centre, and certified marriage counselor, offers some serious insight to the troubles that arise within a marriage but often go undetected because of their seemingly innocent nature. Within this book, Dr. Ude addresses one marital issue after the next and offers readers direction and counsel on what to do once they have pinpointed a serious problem within their marriage. The foundation of his work rests on the fact that, although we often think of infidelity when we hear the word 'affair' more and more men are letting distractions other than a mistress come between them and their wives. In order to overcome these 'other women'¥ that may be working to destroy your marriage, it is vital that you recognize the signs and act appropriately once the source of the marital discord has been discovered. Dr. Ude's work is a handbook to help every woman who is fighting for her marriage figure out how she has the power to win the battle. There is no reason for so many marriages to end in divorce and it is the author's hope that this book will save many a marriage that might be carelessly thrown away because of simple miscommunication and unresolved issues.",Family & Relationships,144,N/A,0,en

Readers can also expect a few tricks of the trade to help them not only survive, but help them thrive as an engineering student.

Lighting the Stars,Gabriele Wills,Mindshadows,N/A,"Tucked into the rugged Canadian wilderness of Muskoka's majestic lake country, Merilee Sutcliffe's peaceful town seems worlds away from the escalating conflict in Europe. But life is about to change dramatically in the Summer of 1940. As her patriotic friends and relatives leave for battle, her small town is thrust into the war machine. Merilee's formerly tranquil skies soon roar with aircraft from the Royal Norwegian Air Force, stationed nearby to train young men determined to liberate their country from Nazi occupation. When German Prisoners of War march into her shocked community, they become Merilee's closest neighbours - and biggest threat. What unfolds in her remote town and on foreign shores sets Merilee and her growing circle on a collision course with an unimagined destiny. Caught up in the chaos is Luftwaffe pilot Erich Leitner. Shot down during the Battle of Britain and transplanted to a lakeside prison in Muskoka, he discovers he has more to fear from his comrades than his captors. While her cousin-in-spirit, Elyse Thornton, navigates the treacherous skies of Britain as a Spitfire Girl, audaciously ferrying warplanes from factories to airfields, Merilee becomes quietly entangled in her own dangerous liaisons on the home front. Caught between worlds, with conflicted loyalties and a sense of duty, she joins the Royal Canadian Air Force, Women's Division, and soon finds herself in ground-zero London, focusing her photographer's lens on a city under bombardment. Far from carefree summers on the lake, struggling to survive the relentless demands and sacrifices of war, Merilee, Elyse, and their friends wonder if they dare to risk their hearts as well. As unlikely lives intersect, ideologies and social hierarchies are challenged, loves and friendships are forged or broken, and countless heroes are made and lost. But even those who return to the serenity of Muskoka are changed forever.",Fiction,610,N/A,0,en

Uncertain Spatiotemporal Data Management for the Semantic Web,"Bai, Luyi, Zhu, Lin",IGI Global,2024-03-01,"In the world of data management, one of the most formidable challenges faced by academic scholars is the effective handling of spatiotemporal data within the semantic web. As our world continues to change dynamically with time, nearly every aspect of our lives, from environmental monitoring to urban planning and beyond, is intrinsically linked to time and space. This synergy has given rise to an avalanche of spatiotemporal data, and the pressing question is how to manage, model, and query this voluminous information effectively. The existing approaches often fall short in addressing the intricacies and uncertainties that come with spatiotemporal data, leaving scholars struggling to unlock its full potential. Uncertain Spatiotemporal Data Management for the Semantic Web is the definitive solution to the challenges faced by academic scholars in the realm of spatiotemporal data. This book offers a visionary approach to an all-encompassing guide in modeling and querying spatiotemporal data using innovative technologies like XML and RDF. Through a meticulously crafted set of chapters, this book sheds light on the nuances of spatiotemporal data and also provides practical solutions that empower scholars to navigate the complexities of this domain effectively.",Computers,527,N/A,0,en

Principles,Ray Dalio,Simon and Schuster,2018-08-07,"#1 New York Times Bestseller “Significant...The book is both instructive and surprisingly moving.” —The New York Times Ray Dalio, one of the world’s most successful investors and entrepreneurs, shares the unconventional principles that he’s developed, refined, and used over the past forty years to create unique results in both life and business—and which any person or organization can adopt to help achieve their goals. In 1975, Ray Dalio founded an investment firm, Bridgewater Associates, out of his two-bedroom apartment in New York City. Forty years later, Bridgewater has made more money for its clients than any other hedge fund in history and grown into the fifth most important private company in the United States, according to Fortune magazine. Dalio himself has been named to Time magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Along the way, Dalio discovered a set of unique principles that have led to Bridgewater’s exceptionally effective culture, which he describes as “an idea meritocracy that strives to achieve meaningful work and meaningful relationships through radical transparency.” It is these principles, and not anything special about Dalio—who grew up an ordinary kid in a middle-class Long Island neighborhood—that he believes are the reason behind his success. In Principles, Dalio shares what he’s learned over the course of his remarkable career. He argues that life, management, economics, and investing can all be systemized into rules and understood like machines. The book’s hundreds of practical lessons, which are built around his cornerstones of “radical truth” and “radical transparency,” include Dalio laying out the most effective ways for individuals and organizations to make decisions, approach challenges, and build strong teams. He also describes the innovative tools the firm uses to bring an idea meritocracy to life, such as creating “baseball cards” for all employees that distill their strengths and weaknesses, and employing computerized decision-making systems to make believability-weighted decisions. While the book brims with novel ideas for organizations and institutions, Principles also offers a clear, straightforward approach to decision-making that Dalio believes anyone can apply, no matter what they’re seeking to achieve. Here, from a man who has been called both “the Steve Jobs of investing” and “the philosopher king of the financial universe” (CIO magazine), is a rare opportunity to gain proven advice unlike anything you’ll find in the conventional business press.",Business & Economics,560,5,1,en

Everything Happens for a Reason,Kate Bowler,Random House,2018-02-06,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • “A meditation on sense-making when there’s no sense to be made, on letting go when we can’t hold on, and on being unafraid even when we’re terrified.”—Lucy Kalanithi “Belongs on the shelf alongside other terrific books about this difficult subject, like Paul Kalanithi’s When Breath Becomes Air and Atul Gawande’s Being Mortal.”—Bill Gates NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY REAL SIMPLE Kate Bowler is a professor at Duke Divinity School with a modest Christian upbringing, but she specializes in the study of the prosperity gospel, a creed that sees fortune as a blessing from God and misfortune as a mark of God’s disapproval. At thirty-five, everything in her life seems to point toward “blessing.” She is thriving in her job, married to her high school sweetheart, and loves life with her newborn son. Then she is diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer. The prospect of her own mortality forces Kate to realize that she has been tacitly subscribing to the prosperity gospel, living with the conviction that she can control the shape of her life with “a surge of determination.” Even as this type of Christianity celebrates the American can-do spirit, it implies that if you “can’t do” and succumb to illness or misfortune, you are a failure. Kate is very sick, and no amount of positive thinking will shrink her tumors. What does it mean to die, she wonders, in a society that insists everything happens for a reason? Kate is stripped of this certainty only to discover that without it, life is hard but beautiful in a way it never has been before. Frank and funny, dark and wise, Kate Bowler pulls the reader deeply into her life in an account she populates affectionately with a colorful, often hilarious retinue of friends, mega-church preachers, relatives, and doctors. Everything Happens for a Reason tells her story, offering up her irreverent, hard-won observations on dying and the ways it has taught her to live. Praise for Everything Happens for a Reason “I fell hard and fast for Kate Bowler. Her writing is naked, elegant, and gripping—she’s like a Christian Joan Didion. I left Kate’s story feeling more present, more grateful, and a hell of a lot less alone.

Waynesville,"Michael Beadle, Peter Yurko",Arcadia Publishing,2010-08-23,"Perched near the eastern edge of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Waynesville is an attractive destination with stunning vistas, cool mountain air, and small-town charm. For centuries, the Cherokee lived and hunted in what is now western North Carolina, and after the Revolutionary War, white settlers moved into the area from all directions to farm and build a new life on the frontier. By the end of the 18th century, families had established a small community known as Mount Prospect. In 1810, the town was renamed Waynesville after the Revolutionary War general ""Mad"" Anthony Wayne. With the coming of the railroad in the 1880s, Waynesville blossomed as a summer retreat for guests who came to stay at numerous boarding houses and hotels. By the early 1900s, Waynesville's neighboring town, Hazelwood, became a hotbed of industrial growth with lumber mills and assorted factories producing furniture, leather goods, and rubber products, and the town would eventually merge with Waynesville in 1995.",Photography,132,N/A,0,en
The Peaceful Wife,April Cassidy,Kregel Publications,2016-01-27,"“This book walks each of us through the reality checks we need in order to have the marriage we want!” —Shaunti Feldhahn, social researcher and best-selling author of For Women Only In today’s workplace, women are often rewarded for having type A personalities: driven, demanding, ambitious, and strong. Yet when it comes to their marriages, those same traits can backfire. After all, no one goes into marriage hoping for a promotion. What is a wife to do? April Cassidy knows this struggle firsthand. She thought she was a great Christian wife and begged God to make her passive husband into a more loving, involved, godly leader. Instead, God opened her eyes to changes that she needed to make, such as laying down her desire for control and offering genuine, unconditional respect—not just love—to her husband. Cassidy’s conclusions may be as startling to readers as they were to her, but The Peaceful Wife shares how she and many others have learned to reorient their lives to biblical commands—resulting in healthier, happier marriages. In the end, you’ll find The Peaceful Wife a powerful path to God’s design for women to live in full submission to Christ as Lord.",Religion,263,N/A,0,en

Designing a lifestyle for yourself that nurtures and supports who you are and what you value won’t happen instantaneously, but this book will certainly make the process simpler and easier for you. Becoming joyfully jobless begins with a commitment to self-discovery, a curiosity about your potential, and a willingness to acquire the information and skills that will enhance your work. Your way will be unlike anyone else’s, although you will share a deep camaraderie with others on this path. Being your own boss is both heady and humbling, but it’s seldom boring.” —Barbara J.

Master Czech A1 - BÝT,Jana Slav,Jana Lišková,2020-08-30,"DO YOU WANT TO RESIDE IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC? A person who wants to obtain a Czech permanent residence permit needs to pass an exam in the Czech language. Currently (in 2020), it is the A1 level, although it is going to be changed to A2 some time soon. (As far as I know, it has not been confirmed yet.) However, to achieve the A2 level, you need to master the lower A1 first, anyway. TO BE, OR NOT TO BE… GET READY FOR THE EXAM! In this little book, we’ll focus on the verb BÝT, that is TO BE, as the basic and most frequently used verb in Czech (and probably in most other languages as well). This is intended as a self-study handbook, perhaps close to phrase books, but it concentrates on what you need for the A1 exam. Besides some basic information about related grammar, you’ll find many many examples of its use in the context of the A1 exam, so when you read through this book, your vocabulary will be much richer and you’ll know many useful words and phrases, not just the verb BÝT itself. FIRST A LITTLE GRAMMAR, THEN A LOT OF EXAMPLES In the first part of this little book, you’ll find some grammatical notes on the verb BÝT. On the A1 level, you’re not expected to learn and remember all that, but I think it doesn’t hurt to have a look and get an idea. The rest of the book focuses on the A1 level and the thematic areas outlined in the detailed description of the level for the purposes of the exam for permanent residence permit in the Czech Republic.

How to Be Everything,Emilie Wapnick,HarperCollins,2017-05-02,"What do you want to be when you grow up? It's a familiar question we're all asked as kids. While seemingly harmless, the question has unintended consequences. It can make you feel like you need to choose one job, one passion, one thing to be about. Guess what? You don't. Having a lot of different interests, projects and curiosities doesn't make you a ""jack-of-all-trades, master of none."" Your endless curiosity doesn't mean you are broken or flaky. What you are is a multipotentialite: someone with many interests and creative pursuits. And that is actually your biggest strength. How to Be Everything helps you channel your diverse passions and skills to work for you. Based on her popular TED talk, ""Why some of us don't have one true calling"", Emilie Wapnick flips the script on conventional career advice. Instead of suggesting that you specialize, choose a niche or accumulate 10,000 hours of practice in a single area, Wapnick provides a practical framework for building a sustainable life around ALL of your passions. You'll discover: • Why your multipotentiality is your biggest strength, especially in today's uncertain job market. • How to make a living and structure your work if you have many skills and interests. • How to focus on multiple projects and make progress on all of them. • How to handle common insecurities such as the fear of not being the best, the guilt associated with losing interest in something you used to love and the challenge of explaining ""what you do"" to others. Not fitting neatly into a box can be a beautiful thing. How to Be Everything teaches you how to design a life, at any age and stage of your career, that allows you to be fully you, and find the kind of work you'll love.",Self-Help,228,N/A,0,en

Living Silence in Burma,Christina Fink,Bloomsbury Publishing,2009-10-15,"Eight years after the first edition of this insightful and highly regarded book, Burma remains one of the most troubled nations in Southeast Asia. While other countries have democratized and prospered, Burma is governed by a repressive military dictatorship and is the second largest producer of heroin in the world. In this exceptionally readable yet scholarly account of Burma today, Christina Fink gives a moving and insightful picture of what life under military rule is like. Through the extensive interviews conducted inside and outside the country, we begin to understand Burma's political and domestic situation and a comprehensive understanding of why military rule has lasted so long. This significantly revised new edition includes material taking the reader up to present day action and accounts, including the impacts of the dramatic 2007 monks' demonstrations, which were coordinated with former student activists and members of Aung San Suu Kyi's party. The book explores the regime's continued attempts to weaken and divide the democratic movement and the ethnic nationalist organizations and explains how the democratic movement and ethnic groups have sought to achieve their goals; in part, by working more closely together.",Business & Economics,325,N/A,0,en

While the Spell Walkers and other celestials are born with powers, specters take them, violently stealing the essence of endangered magical creatures. Brighton wishes he had a power so he could join the fray. Emil just wants the fighting to stop. The cycle of violence has taken a toll, making it harder for anyone with a power to live peacefully and openly. In this climate of fear, a gang of specters has been growing bolder by the day. Then, in a brawl after a protest, Emil manifests a power of his own—one that puts him right at the heart of the conflict and sets him up to be the heroic Spell Walker Brighton always wanted to be. Brotherhood, love, and loyalty will be put to the test, and no one will escape the fight unscathed.

No Cure for Being Human,Kate Bowler,Random House,2021-09-28,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • The bestselling author of Everything Happens for a Reason (And Other Lies I’ve Loved) asks, how do you move forward with a life you didn’t choose? “Kate Bowler is the only one we can trust to tell us the truth.”—Glennon Doyle, author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Untamed It’s hard to give up on the feeling that the life you really want is just out of reach. A beach body by summer. A trip to Disneyland around the corner. A promotion on the horizon. Everyone wants to believe that they are headed toward good, better, best. But what happens when the life you hoped for is put on hold indefinitely? Kate Bowler believed that life was a series of unlimited choices, until she discovered, at age thirty-five, that her body was wracked with cancer. In No Cure for Being Human, she searches for a way forward as she mines the wisdom (and absurdity) of today’s “best life now” advice industry, which insists on exhausting positivity and on trying to convince us that we can out-eat, out-learn, and out-perform our humanness. We are, she finds, as fragile as the day we were born. With dry wit and unflinching honesty, Kate Bowler grapples with her diagnosis, her ambition, and her faith as she tries to come to terms with her limitations in a culture that says anything is possible. She finds that we need one another if we’re going to tell the truth: Life is beautiful and terrible, full of hope and despair and everything in between—and there’s no cure for being human.",Biography & Autobiography,225,N/A,0,en

The Secret Lives of Introverts,Jenn Granneman,Simon and Schuster,2017-08-01,"An introvert guide and manifesto for all the quiet ones—and the people who love them. Is there a hidden part of you that no one else sees? Do you have a vivid inner world of thoughts and emotions that your peers and loved ones can’t seem to access? Have you ever been told you’re too “quiet,” “shy,” “boring,” or “awkward”? Are your habits and comfort zones questioned by a society that doesn’t seem to get the real you? If so, you might be an introvert. On behalf of those who have long been misunderstood, rejected, or ignored, fellow introvert Jenn Granneman writes a compassionate vindication—exploring, discovering, and celebrating the secret inner world of introverts that, only until recently, has begun to peek out and emerge into the larger social narrative. Drawing from scientific research, in-depth interviews with experts and other introverts, and her personal story, Granneman reveals the clockwork behind the introvert’s mind—and why so many people get it wrong initially. Whether you are a bona fide introvert, an extrovert anxious to learn how we tick, or a curious ambivert, these revelations will answer the questions you’ve always had: What’s going on when introverts go quiet? What do introvert lovers need to flourish in a relationship? How can introverts find their own brand of fulfillment in the workplace? Do introverts really have a lot to say—and how do we draw it out? How can introverts mine their rich inner worlds of creativity and insight? Why might introverts party on a Friday night but stay home alone all Saturday? How can introverts speak out to defend their needs? With other myths debunked and truths revealed, The Secret Lives of Introverts is an empowering manifesto that guides you toward owning your introversion by working with your nature, rather than against it, in a world where you deserve to be heard.",Self-Help,291,N/A,0,en

The next day, April wakes up to a viral video and a new life. News quickly spreads that there are Carls in dozens of cities around the world—from Beijing to Buenos Aires—and April, as their first documentarian, finds herself at the center of an intense international media spotlight. Seizing the opportunity to make her mark on the world, April now has to deal with the consequences her new particular brand of fame has on her relationships, her safety, and her own identity. And all eyes are on April to figure out not just what the Carls are, but what they want from us. Compulsively entertaining and powerfully relevant, An Absolutely Remarkable Thing grapples with big themes, including how the social internet is changing fame, rhetoric, and radicalization; how our culture deals with fear and uncertainty; and how vilification and adoration spring for the same dehumanization that follows a life in the public eye. The beginning of an exciting fiction career, An Absolutely Remarkable Thing is a bold and insightful novel of now.",Fiction,345,5,1,en

The CBT Workbook for Perfectionism,Sharon Martin,New Harbinger  Publications,2019-01-02,"If you feel an intense pressure to be perfect, this evidence-based workbook offers real strategies based in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to help you develop a more balanced and healthy perspective. Do you hold yourself—and perhaps others—to extremely high standards? Do you procrastinate certain tasks because you’re afraid you won’t carry them out perfectly? If you’ve answered “yes” to one or both of these questions, chances are you’re a perfectionist. And while there’s nothing wrong with hard work and high standards, perfectionism can also take over your life if you let it. So, how can you find balance? With this workbook, you’ll identify the causes of your perfectionism and the ways it is negatively impacting your life. Rather than measuring your self-worth by productivity and accomplishments, you’ll learn to exercise self-compassion, and extend that compassion to others. You’ll also learn ways to prioritize the things that really matter to you, without focusing on attaining fixed goals. Life isn’t perfect, and neither are we. If you’re ready to break free from out-of-control perfectionism and start living a richer, fuller life, this workbook will help you get started.",Self-Help,286,N/A,0,en

That Half-barbaric Twang,Karen Linn,University of Illinois Press,1994,"Long a symbol of American culture, the banjo actually originated in Africa before European-Americans adopted it. Karen Linn shows how the banjo--despite design innovations and several modernizing agendas--has failed to escape its image as a ""half-barbaric"" instrument symbolic of antimodernism and sentimentalism. Caught in the morass of American racial attitudes and often used to express ambivalence toward modern industrial society, the banjo stood in opposition to the ""official"" values of rationalism, modernism, and belief in the beneficence of material progress. Linn uses popular literature, visual arts, advertisements, film, performance practices, instrument construction and decoration, and song lyrics to illustrate how notions about the banjo have changed. Linn also traces the instrument from its African origins through the 1980s, alternating between themes of urban modernization and rural nostalgia. She examines the banjo fad of bourgeois Northerners during the late nineteenth century; the African-American banjo tradition and the commercially popular cultural image of the southern black banjo player; the banjo's use in ragtime and early jazz; and the image of the white Southerner and mountaineer as banjo player.",Music,212,N/A,0,en

Brilliant Activities for Reading Comprehension Year 1,Charlotte Makhlouf,Andrews UK Limited,2015-12-02,"The importance of being able to read for meaning should never be underestimated. The ability to decode text is not enough. It is vital that children understand what they are reading. More importantly, it is fundamental that they enjoy what they are reading, so that they grow up to become lifelong readers. The passages in the Brilliant Activities for Reading Comprehension series are designed to do just that. They provide children with a variety of engaging, enjoyable texts that will grab their attention, and indeed their teacher's attention as well. The passages begin in Year 1 with simple picture comprehension. They gradually increase in difficulty as you progress though the book, and through the series, encouraging children to develop their ability to read for meaning and use a range of strategies for decoding the text. Tasks range from simple factual recall and vocabulary work to more open-ended questions enabling the reader to provide a more personal response. The cross-curricular activities provide a wealth of ideas for extending the passages further and are ideal for fast-finishers. The Brilliant Activities for Reading Comprehension series provides an invaluable resource for assessing pupils' progress in reading, while helping them to develop their love of reading at the same time.",Education,117,N/A,0,en

Social Skills and Mental Health (Psychology Revivals),"Peter Trower, Bridget Bryant, Michael Argyle",Routledge,2013-12-16,"In the 10 years or so prior to original publication in 1978 new theories and discoveries in the social sciences had given a scientific basis and new impetus to the development of social skills training as a form of therapy. This book explores the progress made with this idea and gives practical guidance for therapists based on several years’ experience with the technique. The book provides an account of the latest ideas at the time, about the analysis of social behaviour – non-verbal communication, social skill, rules, analysis of situations, etc. The different techniques for training and modifying social behaviour – some old, some very new – are described and compared, with detailed accounts. There is a careful critical review of follow-up studies of social skills training and other forms of social therapy on in-patients, out-patients and volunteer subjects. The second part of the book consists of a manual for assessing deficits and difficulties, and for training in ten main areas of social deficiency such as observation, listening, speaking, asserting and planning. A rating scale, questionnaire and user’s booklet of training exercises is included. The book should be of interest, not only to psychiatric professionals – psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, psychiatric nurses, occupational therapists – but to many others, such as social and community workers, teachers, prison officers, and lay people who may be interested in forming self-help groups, either on their own or with professional guidance.",Psychology,321,N/A,0,en

Multilingualism and Creativity,Anatoliy V. Kharkhurin,Multilingual Matters,2012-09-03,"In this monograph, Anatoliy V. Kharkhurin presents the results of his empirical investigation into the impact of multilingual practice on an individual's creative potential. Until now, the relationship between these two activities has received little attention in the academic community. The book makes an attempt to resuscitate this theme and provides a solid theoretical framework supported by contemporary empirical research conducted in a variety of geographic, linguistic, and sociocultural locations. This study demonstrates that several factors - such as the multilinguals' age of language acquisition, proficiency in these languages and experience with cultural settings in which these languages were acquired - have a positive impact on selective attention and language mediated concept activation mechanisms. Together, these facilitate generative and innovative capacities of creative thinking. This book will be of great interest not only to scholars in the fields of multilingualism and creativity, but also to educators and all those interested in enhancing foreign language learning and fostering creativity.",Language Arts & Disciplines,236,N/A,0,en

Letters to a Young Athlete,Chris Bosh,Penguin,2021-06-01,"A legendary NBA player shares his remarkable story, infused with hard-earned wisdom about the journey to self-mastery from a life at the highest level of professional sports Chris Bosh, NBA Hall of Famer, eleven-time All-Star, two-time NBA champion, Olympic gold medalist, and the league’s Global Ambassador, had his playing days cut short at their prime by a freak medical condition.

Reflecting on all he had learned from a long list of basketball legends, from LeBron and Kobe to Pat Riley and Coach K, he saw that his important lessons weren’t about basketball so much as the inner game of success—right attitude, right commitment, right flow within a team. Now he shares that journey, giving us a view from the inside of what greatness feels like and what it takes.

Prototype Nation,Silvia M. Lindtner,Princeton University Press,2020-09-15,"A vivid look at China’s shifting place in the global political economy of technology production How did China’s mass manufacturing and “copycat” production become transformed, in the global tech imagination, from something holding the nation back to one of its key assets? Prototype Nation offers a rich transnational analysis of how the promise of democratized innovation and entrepreneurial life has shaped China’s governance and global image. With historical precision and ethnographic detail, Silvia Lindtner reveals how a growing distrust in Western models of progress and development, including Silicon Valley and the tech industry after the financial crisis of 2007–8, shaped the rise of the global maker movement and the vision of China as a “new frontier” of innovation. Lindtner’s investigations draw on more than a decade of research in experimental work spaces—makerspaces, coworking spaces, innovation hubs, hackathons, and startup weekends—in China, the United States, Africa, Europe, Taiwan, and Singapore, as well as in key sites of technology investment and industrial production—tech incubators, corporate offices, and factories. She examines how the ideals of the maker movement, to intervene in social and economic structures, served the technopolitical project of prototyping a “new” optimistic, assertive, and global China. In doing so, Lindtner demonstrates that entrepreneurial living influences governance, education, policy, investment, and urban redesign in ways that normalize the persistence of sexism, racism, colonialism, and labor exploitation. Prototype Nation shows that by attending to the bodies and sites that nurture entrepreneurial life, technology can be extricated from the seemingly endless cycle of promise and violence.

All In Startup,Diana Kander,John Wiley & Sons,2014-06-30,"If Owen Chase can't find a way to turn his company around in the next nine days, he'll be forced to shut it down and lay off all of his employees. He has incurred substantial debt and his marriage is on shaky ground. Through pure happenstance, Owen finds himself pondering this problem while advancing steadily as a contestant at the World Series of Poker. His Las Vegas path quickly introduces him to Samantha, a beautiful and mysterious mentor with a revolutionary approach to entrepreneurship. Sam is a fountain of knowledge that may save his company, but her sexual advances might prove too much for Owen's struggling marriage. All In Startup is more than just a novel about eschewing temptation and fighting to save a company. It is a lifeline for entrepreneurs who are thinking about launching a new idea or for those who have already started but can't seem to generate the traction they were expecting. Entrepreneurs who achieve success in the new economy do so using a new ""scientific method"" of innovation. All In Startup demonstrates why four counterintuitive principles separate successful entrepreneurs from the wanna-preneurs who bounce from idea to idea, unable to generate real revenue. You will likely get only one opportunity in your life to go ""all in"" in on an idea: to quit your job, talk your spouse into letting you drain the savings account, and follow your dream. All In Startup will prepare you for that ""all in"" moment and make sure that you push your chips into the middle only when the odds are in your favor. This book holds the keys to significantly de-risking your idea so that your success appears almost lucky.

Remini gives us a full life of Webster from his birth, early schooling, and rapid rise as a lawyer and politician in New Hampshire to his equally successful career in Massachusetts where he moved in 1816. Remini treats both the man and his time as they tangle in issues such as westward expansion, growth of democracy, market revolution, slavery and abolitionism, the National Bank, and tariff issues. Webster's famous speeches are fully discussed as are his relations with the other two of the ""great triumvirate"", Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun.

Range,David Epstein,Penguin,2021-04-27,"The #1 New York Times bestseller that has all America talking—with a new afterword on expanding your range—as seen on CNN's Fareed Zakaria GPS, Morning Joe, CBS This Morning, and more. “The most important business—and parenting—book of the year.” —Forbes “Urgent and important. . . an essential read for bosses, parents, coaches, and anyone who cares about improving performance.” —Daniel H. Pink Shortlisted for the Financial Times/McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award Plenty of experts argue that anyone who wants to develop a skill, play an instrument, or lead their field should start early, focus intensely, and rack up as many hours of deliberate practice as possible. If you dabble or delay, you’ll never catch up to the people who got a head start. But a closer look at research on the world’s top performers, from professional athletes to Nobel laureates, shows that early specialization is the exception, not the rule. David Epstein examined the world’s most successful athletes, artists, musicians, inventors, forecasters and scientists. He discovered that in most fields—especially those that are complex and unpredictable—generalists, not specialists, are primed to excel. Generalists often find their path late, and they juggle many interests rather than focusing on one. They’re also more creative, more agile, and able to make connections their more specialized peers can’t see. Provocative, rigorous, and engrossing, Range makes a compelling case for actively cultivating inefficiency. Failing a test is the best way to learn. Frequent quitters end up with the most fulfilling careers. The most impactful inventors cross domains rather than deepening their knowledge in a single area. As experts silo themselves further while computers master more of the skills once reserved for highly focused humans, people who think broadly and embrace diverse experiences and perspectives will increasingly thrive.",Psychology,369,N/A,0,en

The Power of Full Engagement,"James E.

The Mars Project,Wernher Von Braun,University of Illinois Press,1953,"This classic on space travel was first published in 1953, when interplanetary space flight was considered science fiction by most of those who considered it at all. Here the German-born scientist Wernher von Braun detailed what he believed were the problems and possibilities inherent in a projected expedition to Mars. Today von Braun is recognized as the person most responsible for laying the groundwork for public acceptance of America's space program. When President Bush directed NASA in 1989 to prepare plans for an orbiting space station, lunar research bases, and human exploration of Mars, he was largely echoing what von Braun proposed in The Mars Project.",History,116,3,1,en
Why Women Read Fiction,Helen Taylor,Oxford University Press,2019-12-05,"Ian McEwan once said, 'When women stop reading, the novel will be dead.' This book explains how precious fiction is to contemporary women readers, and how they draw on it to tell the stories of their lives. Female readers are key to the future of fiction and—as parents, teachers, and librarians—the glue for a literate society. Women treasure the chance to read alone, but have also gregariously shared reading experiences and memories with mothers, daughters, grandchildren, and female friends. For so many, reading novels and short stories enables them to escape and to spread their wings intellectually and emotionally. This book, written by an experienced teacher, scholar of women's writing, and literature festival director, draws on over 500 interviews with and questionnaires from women readers and writers. It describes how, where, and when British women read fiction, and examines why stories and writers influence the way female readers understand and shape their own life stories. Taylor explores why women are the main buyers and readers of fiction, members of book clubs, attendees at literary festivals, and organisers of days out to fictional sites and writers' homes. The book analyses the special appeal and changing readership of the genres of romance, erotica, and crime. It also illuminates the reasons for British women's abiding love of two favourite novels, Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre. Taylor offers a cornucopia of witty and wise women's voices, of both readers themselves and also writers such as Hilary Mantel, Helen Dunmore, Katie Fforde, and Sarah Dunant. The book helps us understand why—in Jackie Kay's words—'our lives are mapped by books.'",Literary Criticism,299,N/A,0,en

Verbal Perseveration,Jacqueline Ann Stark,Psychology Press,2007,"Introductory textbooks on neurogenic communication disorders associated with aphasia and brain injury do not provide full documentation of the pervasive influence of perseveration in the diagnosis and treatment of clients with severe language processing deficits. This special issue of Aphasiology aims to revives the profound interest in verbal perseveration observed in the classical German literature between 1890 and 1931. Various aspects of the phenomenon of perseveration are addressed in this issue. When and under what circumstances do perseverations occur? What are the characteristics of perseverative errors and how do they relate to non-perseverative sound and word errors? The papers share a common goal, namely to understand the origin of the phenomenon 'perseveration' in healthy subjects and clients with brain damage and injury.

AlphaBrain,Stephen Duneier,John Wiley & Sons,2019-02-11,"Smarter decision-making based on cognitive science AlphaBrain is the investor's guide to achieving more, doing better, and reaching higher. At its core, the magnitude of your success is based on the quality of your decisions. The problem is that human beings are poor decision-makers; we tend to approach problems after they arise instead of planning for them in advance. We put too much weight on instinct, belief, and ""gut feeling."" We make the same mistakes over and over again—so reliably, in fact, that cognitive science can accurately predict exactly which mistakes we'll make and when. This book offers a way to understand and plan for the human mind's usual tendencies to help you make smarter investment decisions. Using a framework based on cognitive research, you'll learn how to approach decisions objectively, systematically, and constantly review your process; you'll take action based on evidence instead of intuition, and get ahead of potential problems before they get the best of you. With so much riding on the correctness of your choices, natural tendency can be a dangerous thing. This book shows you how to remove the bias and emotion to start making choices backed by hard evidence and objective data and lower your stress. Shift your processes from reactive to proactive Base decisions on reality over belief Eliminate cognitive bias and reduce common mistakes Make better decisions with a systematic, objective approach Why do we begin managing risk only once it becomes apparent? Why do we react to the market instead of making the big decisions before emotion takes over? Investing has always been a largely reactive field, but those who dominate it approach decision-making less like a human and more like a machine.

In the 1960s, a talented graphic artist called Roy Cross was commissioned to paint some of the box art for Airfix, and for a ten-year-period he provided many of the glorious paintings seen on the boxes, setting new standards for realism and accuracy. Many are still being used today, a full four decades later. Inside the pages of this book are some of Roy's best artworks, shown here in full format and in superb detail, with many reproduced here in book form for the very first time.

Taxpayer's Comprehensive Guide to LLCs and S Corps,Jason Watson,Watson CPA Group,2014-09-03,"How can I avoid self-employment taxes? This simple question was the inspiration for creating an article describing the benefits of an S Corporation. That original article, which was about four pages long, quickly became a series of KnowledgeBase articles on the Watson CPA Group website. The articles touched on basic topics such as how to elect S Corp status, payroll, reasonable salary determination, retirement planning, health care, fringe benefits and liability protection. Those broad topics demanded much more information, both horizontally by spanning into more related issues, and vertically by digging deeper into the granular yet riveting levels of the tax code. The articles were grouped and relabeled as the Taxpayer’s Comprehensive Guide to LLCs and S Corps which grew to 39 pages in its first edition. Time marched on, and more information was added to the first edition such as expanded retirement planning concerns, health care options after the Affordable Care Act and business valuations including exit strategies. Boom, we now had our second edition at over 100 pages. At that point it was suggested by some clients and colleagues to convert the PDF into an eBook as well as paperback. So here we are.. Each week we receive several phone calls and emails from small business owners across the country who have read our Taxpayer’s Comprehensive Guide to LLCs and S Corps and praised the wealth of information. Regardless of your current situation, whether you are considering starting your own business or entertaining a contracting gig, or you are an experienced business owner, the contents of this book are for you. This book will show you how to reduce your self-employment taxes through an S Corporation election and how to use your corporation to your retirement and fringe benefit advantage. You will also learn the operational considerations of an S Corp plus the 185 reasons you should NOT elect S Corp status. Want to buy or sell a business? That’s in here too. This book is written with the general taxpayer in mind. Too many resources simply regurgitate complex tax code without explanation. While in some cases tax code and court opinions are duplicated verbatim because of the precise words, this book strives to explain many technical concepts in layperson terms with some added humor and opinions. We believe you will find this book educational as well as amusing.",Business & Economics,136,N/A,0,en
Social by Nature,Catherine Bliss,Stanford University Press,2018-01-16,"Sociogenomics has rapidly become one of the trendiest sciences of the new millennium. Practitioners view human nature and life outcomes as the result of genetic and social factors. In Social by Nature, Catherine Bliss recognizes the promise of this interdisciplinary young science, but also questions its implications for the future. As she points out, the claim that genetic similarities cause groups of people to behave in similar ways is not new—and a dark history of eugenics warns us of its dangers. Over the last decade, sociogenomics has enjoyed a largely uncritical rise to prominence and acceptance in popular culture. Researchers have published studies showing that things like educational attainment, gang membership, and life satisfaction are encoded in our DNA long before we say our first word. Strangely, unlike the racial debates over IQ scores in the '70s and '90s, sociogenomics has not received any major backlash. By exposing the shocking parallels between sociogenomics and older, long-discredited, sciences, Bliss persuasively argues for a more thoughtful public reception of any study that reduces human nature to a mere sequence of genes. This book is a powerful call for researchers to approach their work in more socially responsible ways, and a must-read for anyone who wants to better understand the scholarship that impacts how we see ourselves and our society.",Social Science,359,N/A,0,en

iGen,Jean M.

With generational divides wider than ever, parents, educators, and employers have an urgent need to understand today’s rising generation of teens and young adults. Born in the mid-1990s up to the mid-2000s, iGen is the first generation to spend their entire adolescence in the age of the smartphone. With social media and texting replacing other activities, iGen spends less time with their friends in person—perhaps contributing to their unprecedented levels of anxiety, depression, and loneliness. But technology is not the only thing that makes iGen distinct from every generation before them; they are also different in how they spend their time, how they behave, and in their attitudes toward religion, sexuality, and politics. They socialize in completely new ways, reject once sacred social taboos, and want different things from their lives and careers. More than previous generations, they are obsessed with safety, focused on tolerance, and have no patience for inequality. With the first members of iGen just graduating from college, we all need to understand them: friends and family need to look out for them; businesses must figure out how to recruit them and sell to them; colleges and universities must know how to educate and guide them. And members of iGen also need to understand themselves as they communicate with their elders and explain their views to their older peers. Because where iGen goes, so goes our nation—and the world.",Social Science,452,4,3,en

The Chequered Past,David Anderson Charters,University of Toronto Press,2007-01-01,"In the forty-year period between 1951 and 1991, Canadian sports car competition underwent a massive change, transforming itself from an amateur recreational pastime to a commercialized profession and from an individual sport to a spectacle for mass consumption. The Chequered Past is the story of the struggle over power and purpose within the Canadian auto sport that led to this transformation. The first comprehensive history of sports car racing and rallying in Canada, The Chequered Past traces the efforts of the national governing body - the Canadian Auto Sport Clubs (CASC) - to bring its sports car competition up to a 'world class' level, and to manage the consequences of those efforts in the second half of the twentieth century. David Charters traces the social origins of the sport and the major trends that shaped it: professionalism, technological change, rising costs, and the influence of commercial sponsors. Charters argues that while early enthusiasts set the sport on a course toward professionalism that would eventually produce world-class Canadian events and racers, that course would also ultimately change the purpose of the sport: from personal recreation to mass entertainment. As technological innovations drove up the costs of competing at the top ranks, racers were forced to rely on sponsors, who commercialized and ultimately gained control of the sport. The end result, Charters argues, was the marginalization of the amateur competitor and of the CASC itself. Based on extensive research into the CASC's records and dozens of interviews with former competitors and officials, The Chequered Past opens a window into the rich but virtually unknown history of the auto sport, and claims for it a place in Canadian sports history.",Sports & Recreation,393,N/A,0,en

"THINK STRAIGHT: Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Life",Darius Foroux,North Eagle Publishing,2017-12-21,"I know something about you without knowing you. I bet you spend A LOT of time in your head. You know, thinking, worrying, stressing, freaking out -- call it whatever you want. I call it a preoccupied mind. And with what? 99% of your thoughts are useless. William James, once the leading psychologist in America, and one of the founders of the philosophical school of pragmatism, put it best: ""A great many people think they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices."" Pragmatism believes that the mind is a tool. Your mind should work for you, not against you. People who don't master their mind, don't believe it's possible. They say: ""I can't help but thinking these things."" Well, you can TAKE CONTROL of your mind with enough practice. I've done it. And in THINK STRAIGHT, I share exactly how. It's a quick read and you can use it to immediately to improve your thinking. You have the ability to decide what you think. Or, you can choose NOT to think. And that is one of the most important and most practical things you can learn in life. Before I learned that skill, I would spend hours and hours inside my head. Just think about how much you think. - ""I wonder what my boss thinks?"" - ""What happens if I screw up and lose my job?"" -""What if my business never takes off?"" - ""Does she love me?"" - ""Why does my life suck?"" - ""What if I get cancer?"" - ""I can't finish anything. What's wrong with me? And the list goes on. THINK STRAIGHT reveals the recipe for taking control of your mind so you can improve your life, career, relationships, business. I wrote this little book in a way that you can read it more than once. And I hope that this book serves as an anchor to you--especially during trying times.

After having a nationally televised panic attack, Dan Harris knew he had to make some changes. A lifelong nonbeliever, he found himself on a bizarre adventure involving a disgraced pastor, a mysterious self-help guru, and a gaggle of brain scientists. Eventually, Harris realized that the source of his problems was the very thing he always thought was his greatest asset: the incessant, insatiable voice in his head, which had propelled him through the ranks of a hypercompetitive business, but had also led him to make the profoundly stupid decisions that provoked his on-air freak-out. Finally, Harris stumbled upon an effective way to rein in that voice, something he always assumed to be either impossible or useless: meditation, a tool that research suggests can do everything from lower your blood pressure to essentially rewire your brain. 10% Happier takes readers on a ride from the outer reaches of neuroscience to the inner sanctum of network news to the bizarre fringes of America’s spiritual scene, and leaves them with a takeaway that could actually change their lives.",Self-Help,261,4,4,en

Secret Will,Paul Chapman,N/A,2021-03-17,"More than four centuries have passed since Shakespeare wrote his glorious plays, and it is little wonder that the meaning of many of the references in them escapes modern audiences. That's a shame, because they are packed with cryptic allusions to the fascinating people, dramatic events, juicy gossip, lurid scandals, gripping court battles, treacherous conspiracies and outrageous acts of insolence he encountered during his lifetime. To know these background stories is to understand and enjoy his works so much more. In Secret Will, Paul Chapman peels back the curtain to reveal the real Shakespeare and the world that lies hidden behind those quill-scratched pages. He does so by examining key passages from the plays and then asking searching questions about how they relate to the tempestuous times in which he lived. Why, for instance, does A Midsummer Night's Dream contain clear references to the illicit love affair between Elizabeth I and Robert Dudley? How might one of the biggest earthquakes in the history of the British Isles have inspired intriguing lines in Romeo and Juliet? Has Shakespeare immortalised as Ophelia a young woman named Katherine Hamlett, who drowned when he was young? How is a speech in Hamlet connected to the brazen abduction of an Elizabethan schoolboy?Does Shakespeare pour out the raw grief he feels over the death of his young son in heartbreaking lines in King John? Should his most famous stage direction - 'Exit, pursued by a bear' - actually read 'Exit, pursued by a polar bear'? Is he teasing us with a veiled clue to the identity of the mysterious 'Dark Lady' of his desires in Twelfth Night? What do his plays tell us about London's sleazy sex industry, with its legions of prostitutes known as Winchester Geese? Why was the famous Globe theatre threatened by a courtroom drama alleging it was built using stolen timbers, and what led to it burning down? Did a rancorous legal battle between three feuding sisters over their senile father's estate inspire the towering tragedy that is King Lear? And what in the world was the dancing horse?These, and many more such questions, are answered in Secret Will. As well as being a fascinating work of biography, Secret Will has the flavour of a detective saga with all its hints and clues. Links to quotes from Shakespeare's works make the book a gripping page turner for both the aficionado and casual reader alike. 'All the world's a stage, ' Shakespeare once wrote. Secret Will reveals the astonishing story of how he really did put his world on the stage. Readers of this book may never watch a play by the Bard in same way again.",,426,N/A,0,en

Summary: Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order: Ray Dalio,Quick Savant,QUICK SAVANT,2022-06-20,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER This lengthy summary begins with a Ray Dalio synopsis of Principles of Dealing with Changing World Order. A full analysis of his chapters on China follows. This book and the audiobook are meant to complement as study aids, not to replace the irreplaceable Ray Dalio’s work. “A provocative read...Few tomes coherently map such broad economic histories as well as Mr. Dalio’s. Perhaps more unusually, Mr. Dalio has managed to identify metrics from that history that can be applied to understand today.” —Andrew Ross Sorkin, The New York Times From legendary investor Ray Dalio, author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Principles, who has spent half a century studying global economies and markets, Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order examines history’s most turbulent economic and political periods to reveal why the times ahead will likely be radically different from those we’ve experienced in our lifetimes—and to offer practical advice on how to navigate them well. Ray Dalio recognized a combination of political and economic situations that he had not seen before a few years ago. Huge debts and near-zero interest rates led to massive money printing in the world's three major reserve currencies; major political and social conflicts within countries, particularly the United States, due to the largest wealth, political, and values disparities in more than a century; and the rise of a world power to challenge the existing world order. Between 1930 and 1945, this confluence happened for the final time. Dalio was inspired by this discovery to look for the recurring patterns and cause-and-effect correlations that underpin all significant shifts in wealth and power over the previous 500 years. Dalio takes readers on a tour of the world's major empires, including the Dutch, British, and American empires, in this remarkable and timely addition to his Principles series, putting the ""Big Cycle"" that has driven the successes and failures of all the world's major countries throughout history into perspective. He unveils the timeless and universal forces for what is ahead. Humans are more likely to commit evil than good under legalism because they are only driven by self-interest and need rigorous regulations to restrain their urges.",Business & Economics,151,N/A,0,en

In the century since, it has evolved into the world's most popular intellectual pastime: a unique form of wordplay, the codes and conventions of which are open to anyone masochistic enough to get addicted.

Alan Connor writes twice-weekly about crosswords for the Guardian. He has contributed pieces about language for the BBC and the Guardian and works in radio and television, writing for Charlie Brooker, Caitlin Moran and Sue Perkins.

MEMORY ENHANCING TECHNIQUES FOR INVESTIGATIVE INTERVIEWING,"Ronald P. Fisher, R.E.

This manual provides guiding principles to effective interviewing, with specific techniques to be used and others to be avoided. There are principles of memory retrieval so that the reader will understand why to employ specific techniques -- for example, when to use open-ended versus direct short-answer questions, effective use of pauses, asking follow-up questions, cues to name and number recall, etc. There is the strategy of interview sequential structure -- that is, what to probe for at the beginning, middle, and end of the interview. Also included are practical exercises and real-world experiences. The book will also be helpful for attorneys in conducting investigative interviews.",Interviewing in law enforcement,233,N/A,0,en

Refuge of the Honored,"Yasuhito Kinoshita, Christie W.

This timely study documents the birth of a major social phenomenon in Japan—the planned retirement community. In the mid-1980s, Yasuhito Kinoshita spent a year living in Japan's first such community, Fuji-no-Sato. His collaboration with Christie W. Kiefer, a cultural gerontologist, is the first detailed study of a retirement community in a non-Western culture. Fuji-no-Sato is a social community with no visible traditions. Kinoshita and Kiefer show that its residents' preference for long-established relationships creates the need for the invention of relationships that have no precedent in Japanese society. This book reveals much about Japanese culture, and about the ""graying of society"" that plagues the newly industrialized countries of Asia. Its lessons about sensitivity to the elderly's values and the need for clear communication have important applications in other cultures as well.",Social Science,232,N/A,0,en

Some Lucky Woman,Carmen DeSousa,Written Musings,2016-03-29,"After fifteen years of marriage, Jana’s luck just ran out—right into the arms of another woman. Now she’s determined to make her own luck! The first thing Jana realizes she needs to do is empty the joint bank account, then she's thinking she might take a tire iron to her soon-to-be-ex-husband's truck. After that, she's not sure what she'll do ... Maybe she'll adopt a cat. Very quickly, Jana decides she doesn't need a man. A perfectly sized and shaped device and writing about the perfect hero will more than suffice. Determined to share her philosophy, she pens You Don't Need a Man, encouraging women everywhere to go out and experience life instead of waiting for a man to complete them. Three years later, Jana has a New York Times bestseller and a contract for a movie adaptation, but she also has a shoulder injury, which has put a crimp in her new carefree lifestyle. Worse yet, she can't write. Her only hope is Dr. Adrian Kijek, a renowned physical therapist who hates her simply because she wrote a book about not needing a man, or so she thinks... What readers are saying about Some Lucky Woman: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "" Great story and even greater message…"" — Goodreads ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ""I loved how the story moved quickly and covered five years of Jana's life and her growth to independence. I loved her relationship with her cousin and how smart both women were and how they supported each other…"" — Goodreads ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ""Great story about a woman's journey to love and fulfillment…"" — New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Tina Wainscott/Jaime Rush WARNING: Although there are many adult situations in this novel, if say ... something crazy happened and a famous producer adapted this contemporary women's fiction into a movie, it would have a PG-13 rating. There are no erotic scenes, no graphic violence, and while there are a few allowed-on-TV curse words, there aren't a plethora of gratuitous foul words. Oh, and if you were looking for a cliffhanger, you won't find that here either. Some Lucky Woman includes all three parts of Jana's story. Please proceed at your own risk.",Fiction,337,N/A,0,en

Stepping Up to Global Challenges (SGC) 2: Learning English While Fighting the Outbreak of Covid-19,Susana Amante,Editora Edições Esgotadas,2022-03-21,"In 2020, the project ‘Stepping Up to Global Challenges (SGC): Empowering Students across the World’ was launched, during the difficult period when the COVID-19 pandemic was spreading across the globe and causing the lockdown of several activities. Education was also severely affected, but, even if the response widely varied at the time, remote learning, telecollaboration and project-based approaches were adopted by many teachers, “encourag[ing] learners to take an active role in their own learning process and to learn how to collaborate successfully with others in order to solve real world challenges” (Mont & Masats, 2018, p. 93). At the Polytechnic of Viseu (Portugal), Ege University (Turkey) and UTH University (Poland), four teachers of English decided to embrace the idea of diluting frontiers and exploring the potential of Information and Communication Technologies through telecollaboration, in which the students developed tasks around the topic of entrepreneurship. Stepping Up to Global Challenges (SGC2): Learning English while Fighting the Outbreak of Covid-19 is a funded project that started in March 2021 and ends in March 2022. Funding for the project was obtained via Apoios Especiais do PV, Tipologia: Projetos que se destinem a implementar metodologias de aprendizagem ativa.

Task or time? Comparing methods for measuring the gender distribution of work,"Banerjee, Archis, Kumar, Neha, Quisumbing, Agnes R.",Intl Food Policy Res Inst,2024-10-07,"There is growing evidence that gender disparities in the distribution of paid and unpaid work impose constraints on women’s well-being and livelihoods, reducing access to paid employment, and time for education, leisure, and social activities. Yet, gender disparities in unpaid work often go undiagnosed by traditional household surveys. While time-use surveys are well-suited for measuring unpaid work, they are often expensive to administer and take substantial amounts of survey time, leading to respondent fatigue, particularly in multi-topic surveys where other outcomes are also being collected. In this paper, we compare data collected using the task allocation module in the Transforming Agrifood Systems in South Asia (TAFSSA) integrated household survey and the time-use module in the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) survey. We begin by describing the methods used to collect the data in each of the surveys. We present an overview of the characteristics of the study sites in the TAFSSA integrated survey and sites in the same countries where the WEAI data were collected. We then present comparable data from each of the two methods. The findings confirm the gendered patterns in involvement in different activities as measured by both survey modules. While women’s participation in agricultural activities is high across Bangladesh, India, and Nepal, the amount of time they spend on agricultural activities is less than that spent by men. Both survey tools confirm that women undertake most of the food preparation-related activities, and men contribute through shopping/purchasing food.",Political Science,56,N/A,0,en

A Dog's Purpose,W. Bruce Cameron,Forge Books,2010-07-06,"A Dog’s Purpose—the #1 New York Times bestseller and major motion picture—is a perfect gift to introduce dog lovers to this wonderful series. Based on the beloved bestselling novel by W. Bruce Cameron, A Dog’s Purpose, from director Lasse Hallström (The Cider House Rules, Dear John, The 100-Foot Journey), shares the soulful and surprising story of one devoted dog (voiced by Josh Gad) who finds the meaning of his own existence through the lives of the humans he teaches to laugh and love. The family film told from the dog’s perspective also stars Britt Robertson, KJ Apa, John Ortiz, Peggy Lipton, Juliet Rylance, Luke Kirby, Pooch Hall and Dennis Quaid.

Interconnections,"Carol Faulkner, Alison M. Parker",Boydell & Brewer,2014,"Explores gender and race as principal bases of identity and locations of power and oppression in American history. This collection builds on decades of interdisciplinary work by historians of African American women as well as scholars of feminist and critical race theory, bridging the gap between well-developed theories of race, gender, and power and the practice of historical research. It examines how racial and gender identity is constructed from individuals' lived experiences in specific historical contexts, such as westward expansion, civil rights movements, or economic depression as well as by national and transnational debates over marriage, citizenship and sexual mores. All of these essays consider multiple aspects of identity, including sexuality, class, religion, and nationality, amongothers, but the volume emphasizes gender and race as principal bases of identity and locations of power and oppression in American history.

"The Radio Hobby, Private Associations, and the Challenge of Modernity in Germany",Bruce B. Campbell,Springer Nature,2019-10-18,"In the early twentieth century, the magic of radio was new, revolutionary, and poorly understood. A powerful symbol of modernity, radio was a site where individuals wrestled and came to terms with an often frightening wave of new mass technologies. Radio was the object of scientific investigation, but more importantly, it was the domain of tinkerers, “hackers,” citizen scientists, and hobbyists. This book shows how this wild and mysterious technology was appropriated by ordinary individuals in Germany in the first half of the twentieth century as a leisure activity. Clubs and hobby organizations became the locus of this process, providing many of the social structures within which individuals could come to grips with radio, apart from any media institution or government framework. In so doing, this book uncovers the vital but often overlooked social context in which technological revolutions unfold.",History,370,N/A,0,en

Portraits of Courage,George W. Bush,Crown,2017-02-28,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A vibrant collection of oil paintings and stories by President George W. Bush honoring the sacrifice and courage of America’s military veterans. With Forewords by former First Lady Laura Bush and General Peter Pace, 16th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Growing out of President Bush’s own outreach and the ongoing work of the George W. Bush Institute's Military Service Initiative, Portraits of Courage brings together sixty-six full-color portraits and a four-panel mural painted by President Bush of members of the United States military who have served our nation with honor since 9/11—and whom he has come to know personally. Our men and women in uniform have faced down enemies, liberated millions, and in doing so showed the true compassion of our nation. Often, they return home with injuries—both visible and invisible—that intensify the challenges of transitioning into civilian life. In addition to these burdens, research shows a civilian-military divide. Seventy-one percent of Americans say they have little understanding of the issues facing veterans, and veterans agree: eighty-four percent say that the public has ""little awareness"" of the issues facing them and their families. Each painting in this meticulously produced hardcover volume is accompanied by the inspiring story of the veteran depicted, written by the President. Readers can see the faces of those who answered the nation’s call and learn from their bravery on the battlefield, their journeys to recovery, and the continued leadership and contributions they are making as civilians. It is President Bush’s desire that these stories of courage and resilience will honor our men and women in uniform, highlight their family and caregivers who bear the burden of their sacrifice, and help Americans understand how we can support our veterans and empower them to succeed. President Bush will donate his net author proceeds from PORTRAITS OF COURAGE to the George W. Bush Presidential Center, a non-profit organization whose Military Service Initiative works to ensure that post-9/11 veterans and their families make successful transitions to civilian life with a focus on gaining meaningful employment and overcoming the invisible wounds of war.",Biography & Autobiography,198,4,1,en

AMORALMAN,Derek DelGaudio,Vintage,2021-03-02,"Truth and lies are two sides of the same coin. But who's flipping it? A thought-provoking and brilliantly entertaining work of nonfiction from one of the world's leading deceivers, the creator and star of the astonishing theater show and forthcoming film In & Of Itself. Derek DelGaudio believed he was a decent, honest man. But when irrefutable evidence to the contrary is found in an old journal, his memories are reawakened and Derek is forced to confront--and try to understand--his role in a significant act of deception from his past. Using his youthful notebook entries as a road map, Derek embarks on a soulful, often funny, sometimes dark journey, retracing the path that led him to a world populated by charlatans, card cheats, and con artists. As stories are peeled away and artifices are revealed, Derek examines the mystery behind his father's vanishing act, the secret he inherited from his mother, the obsession he developed with sleight-of-hand that shaped his future, and the affinity he felt for the professional swindlers who taught him how to deceive others. And once he finds himself working as a crooked dealer in a big-money Hollywood card game, Derek begins to question his own sense of morality, and discovers that even a master of deception can find himself trapped inside an illusion. A M O R A L M A N is a wildly engaging exploration of the fictions we live as truths. It is ultimately a book about the lies we tell ourselves and the realities we manufacture in others.",Biography & Autobiography,256,N/A,0,en

Modern Ikebana,"Tom Loxley, Victoria Gaiger",Ludion Publishers,2020-04-30,"If you think of flower arranging as an occupation for florists in pursuit of the perfect dome, think again. Because there is a generation of radical new artists who are reinventing what it means to arrange flowers, many of them inspired by the Japanese art of ikebana. Since its origins in the 6th century, ikebana has been as much a philosophy as an art, with its roots in Zen Buddism and a reverence for nature. Over hundreds of years it has developed a complex set of unwritten rules, that take a lifetime to master. But in recent years the distinctive look of ikebana - with its love of the asymmetric shapes to be found in nature and its willingness to embrace simple, natural materials - has found a new audience and opened the eyes of a generation of artists to a new way of working with flowers. This book showcases a selection of this new wave of floral artists, from Tokyo to New York. The authors Victoria Gaiger and Tom Loxley - the editors of the award-winning rakesprogress, the UK's leading independent magazine about the art of gardens, plants and flowers - have talked to 25 of the most exciting young florists working today about their art and inspiration. It includes an introduction to the history and evolution of Japanese floral art and beautiful images of the artists' studios and their floral creations.",,240,N/A,0,en

Tailspin,Steven Brill,Vintage,2019-04-02,"In this revelatory narrative covering the years 1967 to 2017, Steven Brill gives us a stunningly cogent picture of the broken system at the heart of our society. He shows us how, over the last half century, America’s core values—meritocracy, innovation, due process, free speech, and even democracy itself—have somehow managed to power its decline into dysfunction. They have isolated our best and brightest, whose positions at the top have never been more secure or more remote. The result has been an erosion of responsibility and accountability, an epidemic of shortsightedness, an increasingly hollow economic and political center, and millions of Americans gripped by apathy and hopelessness. By examining the people and forces behind the rise of big-money lobbying, legal and financial engineering, the demise of private-sector unions, and a hamstrung bureaucracy, Brill answers the question on everyone’s mind: How did we end up this way? Finally, he introduces us to those working quietly and effectively to repair the damages. At once a diagnosis of our national ills, a history of their development, and a prescription for a brighter future, Tailspin is a work of riveting journalism—and a welcome antidote to political despair.",Political Science,482,N/A,0,en

His manuscript reveals the multiple uses, appeals, and limits of domesticity for LGBTQ people in the post-World War II period, in their efforts to make social and sexual connections, and to appeal for expanded rights and freedoms. For example, the 1970s witnessed an efflorescence of gay communal households that proved to be seedbeds for alternative modes of domesticity, using the privacy of domestic space to achieve broader social and political changes. Vider brings a novel perspective to gay identity and culture, examining domesticity as a meeting point between practices and discourse, the local and national, the private and the public""--",Family & Relationships,307,N/A,0,en

As an eternally curious outsider, Maeve Higgins can see that the United States is still an experiment. Some parts work well and others really don’t, but that doesn't stop her from loving the place and the people that make it. With piercing political commentary in a sweet and salty tone, these essays unearth answers to the questions we all have about this country we call home; the beauty of it all and the dark parts too. Maeve attends the 2020 Border Security Expo to better understand the future of our borders, and finds herself at The Alamo surrounded by queso and homemade rifles. A chance encounter with a statue of a teenage horseback rider causes her to interrogate the purpose of monuments, this sends her hurtling through the past, connecting Ireland’s revolutionary history with the struggles of Black Americans today. And after mistaking edibles for innocent candies, Maeve gets way too high at Paper Source. Most of all, Maeve wants to leave this country and this planet better than she found it. That may well be impossible, but it certainly means showing love. Lots of it, even when it's difficult to do so.

The Truth of Right Now,Kara Lee Corthron,Simon and Schuster,2017-01-03,"Two isolated teens struggle against their complicated lives to find a true connection in this “timely and timeless” (Kirkus Reviews, starred review) debut novel about first love and the wreckage of growing up. Lily is returning to her privileged Manhattan high school after a harrowing end to her sophomore year and it’s not pretty. She hates chemistry and her spiteful lab partner, her friends are either not speaking to her or suffocating her with concerned glances, and nothing seems to give her joy anymore. Worst of all, she can’t escape her own thoughts about what drove her away from everyone in the first place. Enter Dari (short for Dariomauritius), the artistic and mysterious transfer student, adept at cutting class. Not that he’d rather be at home with his domineering Trinidadian father. Dari is everything that Lily needs: bright, creative, honest, and unpredictable. And in a school where no one really stands out, Dari finds Lily’s sensitivity and openness magnetic. Their attraction ignites immediately, and for the first time in what feels like forever, Lily and Dari find happiness in each other. In twenty-first-century New York City, the fact that Lily is white and Dari is black shouldn’t matter that much, but nothing’s as simple as it seems.

Quiet,Susan Cain,Crown,2013-01-29,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Experience the book that started the Quiet Movement and revolutionized how the world sees introverts—and how introverts see themselves—by offering validation, inclusion, and inspiration “Superbly researched, deeply insightful, and a fascinating read, Quiet is an indispensable resource for anyone who wants to understand the gifts of the introverted half of the population.”—Gretchen Rubin, author of The Happiness Project NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY People • O: The Oprah Magazine • Christian Science Monitor • Inc. • Library Journal • Kirkus Reviews What are the advantages of being an introvert? They make up at least one-third of the people we know. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts—Rosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve Wozniak—that we owe many of the great contributions to society. In Quiet, Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts—from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Passionately argued, impeccably researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, Quiet has the power to permanently change how you see yourself.

In this, his fourth collection, he affirms his place as one of America’s greatest living poets. That Was Now, This Is Then takes on the planar paradoxes of time and space, destabilizing highly tuned lyrics and elegies with dizzying turns in poems of unrequitable longing, of longing for longing, of longing to be found, of grief. In these poems, Seshadri’s speaker becomes the subject, the reader becomes the writer, and the multiplying refracted narratives yield an “anguish so pure it almost / feels like joy.”",Poetry,88,N/A,0,en
Girl Waits With Gun,Amy Stewart,HarperCollins,2015-09-01,"NATIONAL BESTSELLER. The first in the Kopps Sisters Novel Series, Girl Waits with Gun is an enthralling novel based on the forgotten true story of one of the nation’s first female deputy sheriffs. Constance Kopp doesn’t quite fit the mold. She towers over most men, has no interest in marriage or domestic affairs, and has been isolated from the world since a family secret sent her and her sisters into hiding fifteen years ago. One day a belligerent and powerful silk factory owner runs down their buggy, and a dispute over damages turns into a war of bricks, bullets, and threats as he unleashes his gang on their family farm. When the sheriff enlists her help in convicting the men, Constance is forced to confront her past and defend her family — and she does it in a way that few women of 1914 would have dared. A New York Times Editors' Choice “A smart, romping adventure, featuring some of the most memorable and powerful female characters I've seen in print for a long time. I loved every page as I followed the Kopp sisters through a too-good-to-be-true (but mostly true!) tale of violence, courage, stubbornness, and resourcefulness.”—Elizabeth Gilbert",Fiction,421,N/A,0,en
I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,Maya Angelou,Random House,2010-07-21,"Here is a book as joyous and painful, as mysterious and memorable, as childhood itself. I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings captures the longing of lonely children, the brute insult of bigotry, and the wonder of words that can make the world right. Maya Angelou’s debut memoir is a modern American classic beloved worldwide. Sent by their mother to live with their devout, self-sufficient grandmother in a small Southern town, Maya and her brother, Bailey, endure the ache of abandonment and the prejudice of the local “powhitetrash.” At eight years old and back at her mother’s side in St. Louis, Maya is attacked by a man many times her age—and has to live with the consequences for a lifetime. Years later, in San Francisco, Maya learns that love for herself, the kindness of others, her own strong spirit, and the ideas of great authors (“I met and fell in love with William Shakespeare”) will allow her to be free instead of imprisoned. Poetic and powerful, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings will touch hearts and change minds for as long as people read. “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings liberates the reader into life simply because Maya Angelou confronts her own life with such a moving wonder, such a luminous dignity.”—James Baldwin From the Paperback edition.",Biography & Autobiography,289,5,2,en

Why It's OK to Be a Gamer,"Sarah C. Malanowski, Nicholas R. Baima",Taylor & Francis,2024-05-13,"If you enjoy video games as a pastime, you are certainly not alone—billions of people worldwide now play video games. However, you may still find yourself reluctant to tell others this fact about yourself. After all, we are routinely warned that video games have the potential to cause addiction and violence. And when we aren’t being warned of their outright harms, we are told we should be doing something better with our time, like going outside, socializing with others, or reading a book. Playing video games is thus often seen at best as a waste of time, and at worst a source of violent tragedy. Why It’s OK to Be a Gamer takes on the pervasive assumption that playing video games is a childish and time-wasting hobby, and a potentially addictive and dangerous one at that. It argues instead that there are many ways in which gaming can help us flourish, for example by: developing genuine friendships and other meaningful relationships with others, helping us cultivate a virtuous personal character, giving us a unique aesthetic experience, providing us with psychological benefits, and just plain helping us relax and enjoy ourselves. Video games are not just for those with no life; on the contrary, they can help contribute to a rich and meaningful life.

PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT BY COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR FRAGILE X SYNDROME,Edenilson Brandl,Edenilson Brandl,N/A,"Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and is associated with a wide range of developmental, behavioral, and emotional challenges. The impact of this condition is felt not only by individuals diagnosed with FXS but also by their families and caregivers who must navigate the complexities of daily life with a genetic disorder. As research in genetics and psychology advances, new therapeutic strategies are emerging to address the emotional and psychological aspects of living with a condition like FXS. In this book, ""Psychological Support by Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Fragile X Syndrome,"" I aim to provide a comprehensive guide that merges knowledge of FXS with practical Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) tools. This manual is designed to serve individuals with FXS, their families, and mental health professionals, offering insights into how CBT techniques can be adapted to meet the unique needs of those affected by this genetic condition. The book begins with a foundational understanding of FXS, its genetic background, and its biological and psychological impact. We explore essential topics such as trauma, hereditary and genetic diseases, and epigenetics, providing readers with a solid base in both the science and the lived experience of those with FXS. These topics set the stage for understanding the behavioral challenges often encountered and offer a gateway into the therapeutic strategies that follow. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy has long been recognized as an effective tool for managing emotional and psychological difficulties, especially in the context of chronic illness. In this book, I have dedicated significant space to CBT principles, practices, and specialized approaches tailored for those with Fragile X Syndrome. From basic techniques like cognitive restructuring and behavioral activation to advanced strategies such as mindfulness and schema therapy, the goal is to equip both professionals and families with the resources necessary to foster emotional resilience, improve mental health, and manage the day-to-day challenges that come with FXS. Pain management, both physical and emotional, is another central theme of the book. Individuals with FXS often experience a variety of physical discomforts tied to their condition, such as back pain, joint pain, and issues stemming from developmental or genetic abnormalities. This book not only addresses the cognitive strategies for dealing with emotional pain but also includes practical approaches for managing chronic physical pain that individuals with FXS may endure. I also emphasize the importance of personalized therapeutic approaches. Every person with Fragile X Syndrome experiences the condition differently, and their treatment should reflect that individuality. By providing an array of CBT tools and practices, this book encourages a tailored approach, where therapists, caregivers, and families can choose the strategies that best meet their needs. Ultimately, this book is a resource designed to empower. Whether you are a mental health professional, a caregiver, or an individual directly impacted by Fragile X Syndrome, it is my hope that this guide provides not only practical tools but also inspiration for fostering a better quality of life and psychological well-being.",Psychology,1381,N/A,0,en

PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT BY COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR X-LINKED ADRENOLEUKODYSTROPHY,Edenilson Brandl,Edenilson Brandl,N/A,"The journey of understanding and managing X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is one marked by complexity, resilience, and a profound emotional toll on individuals and families alike. As a genetic disorder that impacts both the body and the mind, ALD presents not only physical challenges but also psychological burdens that require a thoughtful, compassionate approach. This book, Psychological Support by Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy, was born out of a deep commitment to bridge the gap between genetic understanding and mental health support, providing patients, families, and mental health professionals with practical tools to navigate the emotional landscape of living with ALD. Our approach centers on the powerful benefits of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), a proven therapeutic framework known for its versatility in addressing both emotional and behavioral aspects of chronic conditions. Through CBT, individuals can build resilience, develop healthy coping strategies, and find meaning even in the face of genetic challenges. This book integrates foundational knowledge about genetics and ALD with detailed CBT strategies, tailored specifically to the psychological needs that arise when living with this rare disorder. This work is intended as a supportive companion for those grappling with the realities of ALD, from patients and caregivers to healthcare providers. By beginning with essential background on ALD and genetic principles, we aim to equip readers with the knowledge needed to fully appreciate the psychological aspects of this condition. Subsequent sections explore the nuances of CBT, providing step-by-step guidance, actionable tools, and case-based examples to illustrate how CBT can be adapted to support individuals at every stage of their journey. The book also includes practical pain management strategies and a range of CBT techniques aimed at helping patients manage symptoms, navigate the healthcare system, and address the social and emotional challenges unique to ALD. To those facing the challenges of ALD, we hope this book provides not only therapeutic support but also a sense of empowerment. While genetic conditions may alter the path of one’s life, they do not define it. With the right support, patients and families can build resilience, nurture hope, and pursue a meaningful life. In these pages, may you find tools, insights, and encouragement for the journey ahead.",Psychology,1479,N/A,0,en

Everyday Discourse and Common Sense,"Wolfgang Wagner, Nicky Hayes",Bloomsbury Publishing,2017-09-16,"Thinking and talking in everyday life differs from thinking and talking in more formal contexts, and that difference is not always taken into account in social psychology. What is needed is an approach that sets the man and woman in the street as competent actors in their own right, rather than just pinpointing their alleged cognitive shortcomings. This book proposes the theory of Social Representations, which allows us to articulate collective and individual psychological processes, as a solution. The text begins with a general analysis of everyday thinking in psychology, discussing research into socio-political, popular scientific and cultural systems of common-sense. The theory is presented through both classic and contemporary research into the construction of the social world, from the individual level of representations as metaphors, images and cognitive structures, to collective phenomena such as dialogue, discourse and shared understandings. The concluding chapters cover epistemological and methodological developments in the field. This book is the first comprehensive, integrative and book-length treatment of Moscovici's Theory of Social Representations in the English language.",Psychology,470,N/A,0,en

LIGHTEN Your Day,Professor Pete Alexander,Professor Pete Alexander,2019-05-12,"Stress is all around us—at work, at home, online … you name it. A simple Google search on stress will pull up over one billion results on what stress is, types of it, what causes it, symptoms, and what you can do about it. But we don’t need Google to tell us if we’re stressed: the reality is, we know it because our mind and body are delivering clear signals that we are taxing ourselves. The problem is that we don’t have the time to figure out how to deal with stress in the now, and then we stress out about not being able to deal with our stress: a vicious circle. Sure, you could buy a book or download an app on meditating, or breathing, or journaling, or exercising. You could open the book or app and give it a try, but it probably didn’t work. Why? Maybe you didn’t give it enough time. Maybe you tried it while also responding to 100 emails. Maybe the techniques provided were too complicated or time-intensive, so now you’re frustrated and thinking “I’ve got this really important meeting/presentation this morning, where I have to be at my best. Isn’t there some tool or technique that can help me right now, in this moment?” The answer is yes! If you flip through this book you will see that there are hundreds of fast, effective, and easy tips and tools designed specifically to be used in the now. Why so many? Because you are unique, so there is no such thing as a one-size fits all tool for stress relief. What works for one person may not work for someone else. The book’s foundation is the LIGHTEN™ Model, and the tools suggested are organized around the areas of your life that need to be nurtured in order to achieve long-term stress relief: Livelihood (career), Imagination, Genius (unconscious mind), Health, Time, Environment, and Network (relationships). If you are stressed about hitting your sales quota, take a look at the Livelihood or Time chapter. Worried about that next presentation? The Imagination chapter has some great techniques. Anxious about your next doctor’s appointment? Check out the Genius or Health chapter. Meeting your in-laws? The Network chapter is the place to go. The intent of this book is that you keep it handy for whenever or wherever you need it: that important meeting/presentation, that difficult conversation you need to have, the multiple priorities all needing your attention right now, or anything else that stresses you out when shit happens. If you just have a couple minutes to spare to get some quick-and-easy stress relief, this book is for you.",Self-Help,236,N/A,0,en

"Preference, Belief, and Similarity",Amos Tversky,MIT Press,2003-11-21,"Amos Tversky (1937–1996), a towering figure in cognitive and mathematical psychology, devoted his professional life to the study of similarity, judgment, and decision making. He had a unique ability to master the technicalities of normative ideals and then to intuit and demonstrate experimentally their systematic violation due to the vagaries and consequences of human information processing. He created new areas of study and helped transform disciplines as varied as economics, law, medicine, political science, philosophy, and statistics. This book collects forty of Tversky's articles, selected by him in collaboration with the editor during the last months of Tversky's life.

It is a firsthand account of how more than 50 patients with myeloma were given a non-toxic, precisely-targeted, anti-cancer treatment that was specifically adapted to their individual cancers. These Individualized Anti-Cancer Targeted Therapies (smart bombs) have produced amongst the best responses as well as survival rates for myeloma. Accordingly, the author argues that some patients might even have been “cured” of their cancers.The concepts and logic behind “dtZ” are carefully presented in simple language so that both doctors and patients can easily understand them. Numerous tables and figures are provided, together with clear and simple explanations.

Networked Information Technology and the Transition to Retirement,Tora K. Bikson,RAND Corporation,1991,"This report explores retirement as a social-psychological process, particularly from the perspectives of role incumbents on either side of the transition. It also considers whether and how networked information and communication technology helps to create or maintain task processes and social ties for spatially distributed groups, and attempts to determine what part such technology might play in supporting interactions among retired individuals and between them and their still-employed peers. It extends earlier studies of technology transfer and utilization, of social behavior in relatively healthy community-resident older adults, and of the effects of computer support in varied kinds of task groups by using a more powerful research design--a field experiment--that permits an evaluation of the comparative capability of new electronic media to provide intellectual and affective links between people who have no prior experience in using networked interactive systems. The experiment demonstrates that computers can serve as an effective infrastructure for social interchange; they are superior to traditional media for overcoming spatial and temporal barriers to interaction.",Self-Help,166,N/A,0,en

The book presents evidence from a classroom-based intervention study conducted in a secondary school in England on cross-linguistic strategy transfer. It suggests that even beginner or low proficiency foreign language learners can develop effective skills and strategies in the foreign language classroom which can also positively influence writing in other languages, including their first language. This book ultimately encourages more joined-up, cross-curricular, cross-linguistic thinking related to language in schools by exploring the potential for collaboration between languages teachers.",Language Arts & Disciplines,274,N/A,0,en

""The thefts are engaging and surprising, and the narrative brims with international intrigue. Li, however, has delivered more than a straight thriller here, especially in the parts that depict the despair Will and his pals feel at being displaced, overlooked, underestimated and discriminated against. This is as much a novel as a reckoning."" —New York Times Book Review Ocean's Eleven meets The Farewell in Portrait of a Thief, a lush, lyrical heist novel inspired by the true story of Chinese art vanishing from Western museums; about diaspora, the colonization of art, and the complexity of the Chinese American identity. History is told by the conquerors. Across the Western world, museums display the spoils of war, of conquest, of colonialism: priceless pieces of art looted from other countries, kept even now. Will Chen plans to steal them back. A senior at Harvard, Will fits comfortably in his carefully curated roles: a perfect student, an art history major and sometimes artist, the eldest son who has always been his parents' American Dream. But when a mysterious Chinese benefactor reaches out with an impossible—and illegal—job offer, Will finds himself something else as well: the leader of a heist to steal back five priceless Chinese sculptures, looted from Beijing centuries ago. His crew is every heist archetype one can imag­ine—or at least, the closest he can get. A con artist: Irene Chen, a public policy major at Duke who can talk her way out of anything. A thief: Daniel Liang, a premed student with steady hands just as capable of lockpicking as suturing. A getaway driver: Lily Wu, an engineering major who races cars in her free time. A hacker: Alex Huang, an MIT dropout turned Silicon Valley software engineer. Each member of his crew has their own complicated relationship with China and the identity they've cultivated as Chinese Americans, but when Will asks, none of them can turn him down. Because if they succeed? They earn fifty million dollars—and a chance to make history. But if they fail, it will mean not just the loss of everything they've dreamed for themselves but yet another thwarted at­tempt to take back what colonialism has stolen. Equal parts beautiful, thoughtful, and thrilling, Portrait of a Thief is a cultural heist and an examination of Chinese American identity, as well as a necessary cri­tique of the lingering effects of colonialism.",Fiction,385,N/A,0,en

The Poet X,Elizabeth Acevedo,HarperCollins,2018-03-06,"Winner of the National Book Award for Young People’s Literature, the Michael L. Printz Award, and the Pura Belpré Award! Fans of Jacqueline Woodson, Meg Medina, and Jason Reynolds will fall hard for this astonishing New York Times-bestselling novel-in-verse by an award-winning slam poet, about an Afro-Latina heroine who tells her story with blazing words and powerful truth. Xiomara Batista feels unheard and unable to hide in her Harlem neighborhood. Ever since her body grew into curves, she has learned to let her fists and her fierceness do the talking. But Xiomara has plenty she wants to say, and she pours all her frustration and passion onto the pages of a leather notebook, reciting the words to herself like prayers—especially after she catches feelings for a boy in her bio class named Aman, who her family can never know about. With Mami’s determination to force her daughter to obey the laws of the church, Xiomara understands that her thoughts are best kept to herself. So when she is invited to join her school’s slam poetry club, she doesn’t know how she could ever attend without her mami finding out. But she still can’t stop thinking about performing her poems. Because in the face of a world that may not want to hear her, Xiomara refuses to be silent. “Crackles with energy and snaps with authenticity and voice.” —Justina Ireland, author of Dread Nation “An incredibly potent debut.” —Jason Reynolds, author of the National Book Award Finalist Ghost “Acevedo has amplified the voices of girls en el barrio who are equal parts goddess, saint, warrior, and hero.” —Ibi Zoboi, author of American Street This young adult novel, a selection of the Schomburg Center's Black Liberation Reading List, is an excellent choice for accelerated tween readers in grades 6 to 8.

Happy,Derren Brown,Random House,2016-09-22,"The Sunday Times Bestseller 'Really brilliant and just crammed with wisdom and insight. It will genuinely make a difference to me and the way I think about myself.' Stephen Fry ___ Everyone says they want to be happy. But that's much more easily said than done. What does being happy actually mean? And how do you even know when you feel it? In Happy Derren Brown explores changing concepts of happiness - from the surprisingly modern wisdom of the Stoics and Epicureans in classical times right up until today, when the self-help industry has attempted to claim happiness as its own. He shows how many of self-help's suggested routes to happiness and success - such as positive thinking, self-belief and setting goals - can be disastrous to follow and, indeed, actually cause anxiety. Happy aims to reclaim happiness and to enable us to appreciate the good things in life, in all their transient glory. By taking control of the stories we tell ourselves, by remembering that 'everything's fine' even when it might not feel that way, we can allow ourselves to flourish and to live more happily. ___ What readers are saying: ***** 'Immensely positive and life-affirming' ***** 'This is the blue print to a good life' ***** 'Thought provoking and potentially life-changing.'",Self-Help,552,4,2,en

Clarke Award-winning Adrian Tchaikovsky, The Doors of Eden is an extraordinary feat of the imagination and a page-turning adventure about parallel universes and the monsters that they hide. They thought we were safe. They were wrong. Four years ago, two girls went looking for monsters on Bodmin Moor. Only one came back. Lee thought she'd lost Mal, but now she's miraculously returned. But what happened that day on the moors? And where has she been all this time? Mal's reappearance hasn't gone unnoticed by MI5 officers either, and Lee isn't the only one with questions. Julian Sabreur is investigating an attack on top physicist Kay Amal Khan. This leads Julian to clash with agents of an unknown power - and they may or may not be human. His only clue is grainy footage, showing a woman who supposedly died on Bodmin Moor. Dr Khan's research was theoretical; then she found cracks between our world and parallel Earths. Now these cracks are widening, revealing extraordinary creatures. And as the doors crash open, anything could come through.

He finds himself the subject of vitriolic press attacks, a police investigation and so much public loathing that he starts to wonder if he has any chance of receiving a fair trial. As the line blurs between his own life and that of the character he plays on TV, Kevin is forced to confront a lifetime of inadequacy in order to redeem himself. The Star Witness is the story of one man’s descent into disgrace and his journey to rejoin the human race. This pin-sharp satire on the shallows of modern media culture will keep you laughing, cringing and guessing until the very last page.",Fiction,247,N/A,0,en

Mind Your X's and Y's,Lisa Johnson,Simon and Schuster,2006-09-13,"Today's 18-to-40-year-olds make for a notoriously elusive group of consumers: they're savvy, sophisticated, and particular. They're all but immune to traditional advertising and have an instinctive sense of quality and fair pricing. Inundated with choices, they are drawn to brands that satisfy not just what they need, but what they crave. At the same time, these consumers are spending money like it's going out of style. Generation X has firmly refuted its slacker reputation and is nearing the height of its earning potential. Generation Y has more buying power than any previous generation of teens and twentysomethings. But how to win their attention and loyalty? In Mind Your X's and Y's, Lisa Johnson proves that the buying habits of 18-to-40-year-olds can be anticipated. Johnson, coauthor of Don't Think Pink and a leading marketing consultant, pinpoints the new rules of engagement for this Connected Generation. Based on her own and others' groundbreaking research, she looks into the heart of the Gen X and Y psyche to identify its ten core cravings -- for adventure, for high-concept design, for new families and social networks, and for personal storytelling, to name a few. This revolutionary book is packed with fascinating case studies of established and breakaway brands from every major industry, interviews with dozens of maverick thinkers and hundreds of consumers, and numerous revealing statistics. Johnson analyzes the scope of each craving to determine how it drives specific buying behaviors and offers relevant data that illustrate its impact. Mind Your X's and Y's equips anyone who wants to reach these consumers -- brand managers and their advertising, online, creative, packaging, events, and promotions teams; small-business owners and their marketing staff; advertising agencies and specialists -- with the know-how to transform market research into profitable strategies. Members of Generations X and Y are the most coveted and hard-to-reach consumers in the marketplace. Mind Your X's and Y's is a master class in how to create compelling brands for this Connected Generation.",Business & Economics,222,N/A,0,en

Logic Programming and Databases,"Stefano Ceri, Georg Gottlob, Letizia Tanca",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The topic of logic programming and databases. has gained in creasing interest in recent years. Several events have marked the rapid evolution of this field: the selection, by the Japanese Fifth Generation Project, of Prolog and of the relational data model as the basis for the development of new machine archi tectures; the focusing of research in database theory on logic queries and on recursive query processing; and the pragmatic, application-oriented development of expert database systems and of knowledge-base systems. As a result, an enormous amount of work has been produced in the recent literature, coupled with the spontaneous growth of several advanced projects in this area. The goal of this book is to present a systematic overview of a rapidly evolving discipline, which is presently not described with the same approach in other books. We intend to introduce stu dents and researchers to this new discipline; thus we use a plain, tutorial style, and complement the description of algorithms with examples and exercises. We attempt to achieve a balance be tween theoretical foundations and technological issues; thus we present a careful introduction to the new language Datalog, but we also focus on the efficient interfacing of logic programming formalisms (such as Prolog and Datalog) with large databases.",Computers,295,N/A,0,en

Economista, historiador, diputado en los años de la Transición, ministro de Sanidad y Consumo del primer Gobierno socialista, rector de la Universidad Menéndez y Pelayo, melómano, atleta, apasionado del fútbol, del Barça y de la Real Sociedad, columnista, tertuliano, profesor de universidad y, sobre todo, padre de tres hijas, tuvo múltiples facetas e innumerables intereses. Las sucesivas y variadas vidas de este intelectual al que le gustaba agitar, conversar y debatir para convencer y dejarse convencer, le llevaron a habitar cuatro grandes geografías peninsulares: Cataluña, Valencia, Madrid y el norte (Santander y San Sebastián). Todas ellas se recorren en esta biografía, que nos permite también profundizar en la historia de una España en la que Lluch imaginó que todo el mundo, desde la diversidad y el respeto mutuo, podría sentirse cómodo. Ernest Lluch fue una persona abierta al conocimiento, la curiosidad, la tolerancia y la vida. Nunca renunció a ningún debate, ya que entendía la controversia como la oportunidad de comprender las razones del otro. Y lo demostró en todas sus facetas, profesionales y personales, como revela esta biografía de Joan Esculies.

Por un lado, algunos resultados han apuntado a que un uso intensivo de las nuevas tecnologías, y en especial de Internet, provocaba el aislamiento. Otros estudios, liderados por nuestros autores, han determinado que el uso de Internet se convierte en una fuente de organización cívica y aumenta los vínculos de las personas. Los expertos se han alineado, a partir de la realización de estudios cuantitativos, entre los que han entendido Internet de un modo utópico y los que han creído ver en Internet una nueva fuente de males, y se han alineado en una visión distópica.

Señales De Que Tu Pareja NO Te Quiere.,Julio Alberto Martinez Lagrene,Julio Alberto Martinez Lagrene,2023-07-08,"Aunque puede resultar desalentador enfrentarse a señales de que tu pareja no te quiere, es importante recordar que mereces una relación amorosa y satisfactoria. A veces, reconocer estas señales puede ser el primer paso hacia una vida mejor y más plena. Es normal tener expectativas de amor, respeto y afecto en una relación de pareja. Sin embargo, cuando tu pareja no muestra signos de amor hacia ti, puede ser doloroso y desorientador. Es importante recordar que no estás solo/a en esta experiencia y que hay una abundancia de apoyo y recursos disponibles para ayudarte a navegar por esta situación. La psicología nos enseña que las relaciones saludables se caracterizan por el respeto mutuo, la comunicación abierta, la empatía y el apoyo emocional. Sin embargo, cuando las señales indican lo contrario, es vital tomar en consideración tu bienestar y tomar decisiones basadas en el amor propio y el respeto propio. A nivel emocional, es normal sentir una mezcla de emociones como tristeza, decepción, confusión e incluso enfado. Permítete sentir estas emociones y valora el hecho de que reconocer estas señales es un acto de valentía y amor propio. Puede ser difícil aceptar que tu pareja no te quiere, pero recuerda que mereces una relación en la que te sientas amado/a, valorado y respetado. La ciencia ha demostrado que las relaciones de pareja saludables tienen un impacto positivo en nuestra salud física y emocional. Una relación amorosa y de apoyo puede aumentar nuestra autoestima, reducir el estrés, mejorar nuestra salud mental y fortalecer nuestra resiliencia. Es importante recordar que mereces experimentar estos beneficios en tu relación. Si te encuentras en una situación en la que las señales indican que tu pareja no te quiere, es esencial priorizar tu bienestar y considerar tomar medidas para cambiar la dinámica de la relación o, en casos extremos, poner fin a la relación. Buscar el apoyo de amigos, familiares o profesionales de la salud mental puede ser de gran ayuda durante este proceso. Recuerda que mereces una relación en la que te sientas amado/a, valorado/a y respetado/a. Aceptar las señales de que tu pareja no te quiere puede ser el primer paso hacia la construcción de una vida plena y satisfactoria. No te conformes con menos de lo que mereces y permítete buscar y cultivar relaciones que te nutran y te hagan crecer como persona.",Psychology,246,N/A,0,es

Weight of Modernity,"Cathy Banwell, Dorothy Broom, Anna Davies, Jane Dixon",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-30,"Over a half of adults in the US, Canada, Australia and numerous European countries are now overweight or obese, a proportion that has risen sharply in the past two decades. Dominant biomedical explanations focus on the energy equation – an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure - and remedies focus on motivating individuals to restore the balance by eating better and being more active, or – in extreme cases – surgical intervention. This book offers a perspective that sees increasing obesity as a social phenomenon as well as a public health problem. It contains detailed accounts of three generations of Australians’ experiences of changing environments and the emergence of social trends such as increasing availability of convenience foods, the individualisation and commercialisation of leisure, car reliance, and busyness. Participants' narratives are interwoven with sociological and historical analyses of changes to show how contemporary Australians are experiencing and adapting to dramatic socio-cultural and environmental changes that are reshaping their lives and, in many cases, their bodies. The book demonstrates that obesity is an unintended consequence of economic development accompanied by profound socio-cultural changes, and by identifying the key developments the authors propose leverage points. While the research was conducted in Australia, the fundamental drivers of rapid weight gain are equally present in other modern, secular societies.",Medical,200,N/A,0,en

Making Eye Health a Population Health Imperative,"National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, Health and Medicine Division, Board on Population Health and Public Health Practice, Committee on Public Health Approaches to Reduce Vision Impairment and Promote Eye Health",National Academies Press,2017-01-15,"The ability to see deeply affects how human beings perceive and interpret the world around them. For most people, eyesight is part of everyday communication, social activities, educational and professional pursuits, the care of others, and the maintenance of personal health, independence, and mobility. Functioning eyes and vision system can reduce an adult's risk of chronic health conditions, death, falls and injuries, social isolation, depression, and other psychological problems. In children, properly maintained eye and vision health contributes to a child's social development, academic achievement, and better health across the lifespan. The public generally recognizes its reliance on sight and fears its loss, but emphasis on eye and vision health, in general, has not been integrated into daily life to the same extent as other health promotion activities, such as teeth brushing; hand washing; physical and mental exercise; and various injury prevention behaviors. A larger population health approach is needed to engage a wide range of stakeholders in coordinated efforts that can sustain the scope of behavior change. The shaping of socioeconomic environments can eventually lead to new social norms that promote eye and vision health. Making Eye Health a Population Health Imperative: Vision for Tomorrow proposes a new population-centered framework to guide action and coordination among various, and sometimes competing, stakeholders in pursuit of improved eye and vision health and health equity in the United States. Building on the momentum of previous public health efforts, this report also introduces a model for action that highlights different levels of prevention activities across a range of stakeholders and provides specific examples of how population health strategies can be translated into cohesive areas for action at federal, state, and local levels.",Medical,587,N/A,0,en

Educating the Student Body,"Committee on Physical Activity and Physical Education in the School Environment, Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine",National Academies Press,2013-11-13,"Physical inactivity is a key determinant of health across the lifespan. A lack of activity increases the risk of heart disease, colon and breast cancer, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteoporosis, anxiety and depression and others diseases. Emerging literature has suggested that in terms of mortality, the global population health burden of physical inactivity approaches that of cigarette smoking. The prevalence and substantial disease risk associated with physical inactivity has been described as a pandemic. The prevalence, health impact, and evidence of changeability all have resulted in calls for action to increase physical activity across the lifespan. In response to the need to find ways to make physical activity a health priority for youth, the Institute of Medicine's Committee on Physical Activity and Physical Education in the School Environment was formed. Its purpose was to review the current status of physical activity and physical education in the school environment, including before, during, and after school, and examine the influences of physical activity and physical education on the short and long term physical, cognitive and brain, and psychosocial health and development of children and adolescents. Educating the Student Body makes recommendations about approaches for strengthening and improving programs and policies for physical activity and physical education in the school environment. This report lays out a set of guiding principles to guide its work on these tasks. These included: recognizing the benefits of instilling life-long physical activity habits in children; the value of using systems thinking in improving physical activity and physical education in the school environment; the recognition of current disparities in opportunities and the need to achieve equity in physical activity and physical education; the importance of considering all types of school environments; the need to take into consideration the diversity of students as recommendations are developed. This report will be of interest to local and national policymakers, school officials, teachers, and the education community, researchers, professional organizations, and parents interested in physical activity, physical education, and health for school-aged children and adolescents.",Medical,503,N/A,0,en

"Women, Race, & Class",Angela Y. Davis,Vintage,2011-06-29,"From one of our most important scholars and civil rights activist icon, a powerful study of the women’s liberation movement and the tangled knot of oppression facing Black women. “Angela Davis is herself a woman of undeniable courage. She should be heard.”—The New York Times Angela Davis provides a powerful history of the social and political influence of whiteness and elitism in feminism, from abolitionist days to the present, and demonstrates how the racist and classist biases of its leaders inevitably hampered any collective ambitions. While Black women were aided by some activists like Sarah and Angelina Grimke and the suffrage cause found unwavering support in Frederick Douglass, many women played on the fears of white supremacists for political gain rather than take an intersectional approach to liberation. Here, Davis not only contextualizes the legacy and pitfalls of civil and women’s rights activists, but also discusses Communist women, the murder of Emmitt Till, and Margaret Sanger’s racism. Davis shows readers how the inequalities between Black and white women influence the contemporary issues of rape, reproductive freedom, housework and child care in this bold and indispensable work.",Social Science,290,N/A,0,en

Adolescents A to Z,Tiffany Field,Xlibris Corporation,2011-09-15,"In the book Adolescents A to Z, Tiffany Field has reviewed recent research on adolescence issues from A to Z. Parents often feel the need to consult a reference book regarding problems their adolescents are experiencing. Although encyclopedia-like books have been written on adolescents’ medical problems, those do not include behavior problems. Books that cover behavior problems are not organized in alphabetical order but rather, the problems are imbedded in different age sections or in general discussions, forcing the parent to read all the material to find the specific problem. Most discussions of adolescents’ problems, even by well-known authors, are largely based on anecdotal material and clinical experience rather than research data.

Mobilizing Gen Z,"Jolene Erlacher, Katy White",William Carey Publishing,2022-08-08,"A God-Designed Generation for a God-Given Task The scale and scope of the global, technological, and cultural changes of the past two decades are unprecedented. For the first time in history, American churches and agencies are mobilizing from a post-Christian cultural context and to new collaborations with a global mission force. Amidst these rapid changes, how can mission leaders continue to ensure that we fulfill the Great Commission mandate to disciple Christ-worshippers from every tribe, tongue, and nation? In Mobilizing Gen Z, Jolene Erlacher and Katy White blend leading research with the voices of current mission practitioners to unpack the dynamics behind our changing culture and the resulting impact on the church. And perhaps not-so-surprisingly, they reach the conclusion that God has already provided a solution for such a time as this—Gen Z (b. 1996– 2010). Through an in-depth profile of this rising cohort—their characteristics, worldview, strengths and weaknesses—the authors illustrate both why Gen Z is sorely needed and why we must seek to engage them differently than previous generations. Encouraging and winsome, Mobilizing Gen Z provides practical tools and strategies for engaging, equipping, and retaining Gen Z missionaries. Are we ready to pass the torch?",Religion,273,N/A,0,en

Social Participation of Students with Special Educational Needs in Mainstream Education,"Susanne Schwab, Mirna Nel, Frank Hellmich",Routledge,2020-05-21,"This book provides deep insight into the social situation of students with different kinds of special needs in various European countries. Research findings concerning students’ attitudes towards peers with disabilities, and teachers’ feedback on students’ social behaviour, are also presented. Full inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream education requires equity in each student’s chances for academic and social-emotional development, and their participation in society. In the context of inclusive education, it is important to take students’ social participation into consideration. Are students with special educational needs (SEN) accepted by their peers? Do they interact with their peers during breaks and classes? Do they have friends, or do they feel lonely in their class? This book seeks to answer such questions, seeing social participation as a crucial ingredient, as well as an outcome, of inclusive education. This topic is critical because many previous studies show students with SEN having a high risk of social exclusion. This volume will be of interest to everyone studying special needs education, especially those concerned with future improvement of social participation for all students. This book was originally published as a special issue of the European Journal of Special Needs Education.

Probabilistic Graphical Models,"Daphne Koller, Nir Friedman",MIT Press,2009-07-31,"A general framework for constructing and using probabilistic models of complex systems that would enable a computer to use available information for making decisions. Most tasks require a person or an automated system to reason—to reach conclusions based on available information. The framework of probabilistic graphical models, presented in this book, provides a general approach for this task. The approach is model-based, allowing interpretable models to be constructed and then manipulated by reasoning algorithms. These models can also be learned automatically from data, allowing the approach to be used in cases where manually constructing a model is difficult or even impossible. Because uncertainty is an inescapable aspect of most real-world applications, the book focuses on probabilistic models, which make the uncertainty explicit and provide models that are more faithful to reality. Probabilistic Graphical Models discusses a variety of models, spanning Bayesian networks, undirected Markov networks, discrete and continuous models, and extensions to deal with dynamical systems and relational data. For each class of models, the text describes the three fundamental cornerstones: representation, inference, and learning, presenting both basic concepts and advanced techniques. Finally, the book considers the use of the proposed framework for causal reasoning and decision making under uncertainty. The main text in each chapter provides the detailed technical development of the key ideas. Most chapters also include boxes with additional material: skill boxes, which describe techniques; case study boxes, which discuss empirical cases related to the approach described in the text, including applications in computer vision, robotics, natural language understanding, and computational biology; and concept boxes, which present significant concepts drawn from the material in the chapter. Instructors (and readers) can group chapters in various combinations, from core topics to more technically advanced material, to suit their particular needs.",Computers,1268,N/A,0,en

The Neuropsychology of Everyday Life: Issues in Development and Rehabilitation,"David E. Tupper, Keith D.

In time, experience led all of us from the several disciplines involved in this enterprise to the conclusion that the crude diagnostic techniques available to us circa 1945-1965 had garnered little valid information on which to base such complex, differential diagnostic decisions. It now is gratifying to look back and review the remarkable progress that has occurred in the field of clinical neuropsychology in the four decades since I was a graduate student. In the late 1940s such pioneers as Ward Halstead, Alexander Luria, George Yacorzynski, Hans-Lukas Teuber, and Arthur Benton already were involved in clinical studies that, by the late 1960s, would markedly have improved the quality of clinical practice. However, the only psychological tests that the clinical psychologist of my immediate post Second Wodd War generation had as aids for the diagnosis of neurologically based conditions involving cognitive deficit were such old standbys as the Wechsler-Bellevue, Rorschach, Draw A Person, Bender Gestalt, and Graham Kendall Memory for Designs Test.",Medical,320,N/A,0,en

Write It Off! Deduct It!,Bernard B. Kamoroff,Rowman & Littlefield,2015-01-12,"Are you paying more taxes than you have to? There are more than nineteen million home-based businesses in the United States—56 percent of all businesses—and they generate $102 billion in annual revenue. As far as the IRS is concerned, a home business is no different than any other business. But there is a difference: not only can you deduct the business expenses that every business is entitled to, you can turn personal, nondeductible expenses into tax-deductible business expenses—if you are careful to follow the rules. No tax software or accountant knows the details of your home-based business like you do, and the IRS is certainly not going to tell you about a deduction you failed to take. This invaluable book not only lists the individual items that are deductible in your home-based business—from utilities to that part of the home where you work—but also explains where to list them on your income tax forms.",Business & Economics,215,N/A,0,en

Even the Terrible Things Seem Beautiful to Me Now,Mary Schmich,Agate+ORM,2019-11-05,"The best columns by the Pulitzer Prize–winning Chicago Tribune writer, on diverse topics like family, loss, mental health, advice, and the Windy City. Over the last two decades, Mary Schmich’s biweekly column in the Chicago Tribune has offered advice, humor, and discerning commentary on a broad array of topics including family, milestones, mental illness, writing, and life in Chicago. Schmich won the 2012 Pulitzer for Commentary for “her wide range of down-to-earth columns that reflect the character and capture the culture of her famed city.” This second edition—updated to include Schmich’s best pieces since its original publication—collects her ten Pulitzer-winning columns along with more than 150 others, creating a compelling collection that reflects Schmich’s thoughtful and insightful sensibility. The book is divided into thirteen sections, with topics focused on loss and survival, relationships, Chicago, travel, holidays, reading and writing, and more. Schmich’s 1997 “Wear Sunscreen” column (which has had a life of its own as a falsely attributed Kurt Vonnegut commencement speech) is included, as well as her columns focusing on the demolition of Chicago’s infamous Cabrini-Green housing project. One of the most moving sections is her twelve-part series with U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow, as the latter reflected on rebuilding her life after the horrific murders of her mother and husband. Schmich’s columns are both universal and deeply personal. The first section of this book is dedicated to columns about her mother, and her stories of coping with her mother’s aging and eventual death. Throughout the book, Schmich reflects wisely and wryly on the world we live in, and her fond observances of Chicago life bring the city in all its varied character to warm, vivid life.",Literary Collections,375,N/A,0,en
Flow and the Foundations of Positive Psychology,Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi,Springer,2014-08-08,"The second volume in the collected works of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi covers about thirty years of Csikszentmihalyi‘s work on three main and interconnected areas of study: attention, flow and positive psychology. Describing attention as psychic energy and in the footsteps of William James, Csikszentmihalyi explores the allocation of attention, the when and where and the amount of attention humans pay to tasks and the role of attention in creating ‘experiences’, or ordered patterns of information. Taking into account information processing theories and attempts at quantifying people’s investment, the chapters deal with such topics as time budgets and the development and use of the Experience Sampling Method of collecting data on attention in everyday life. Following the chapters on attention and reflecting Csikszentmihalyi’s branching out into sociology and anthropology, there are chapters on the topic of adult play and leisure and connected to that, on flow, a concept formulated and developed by Csikszentmihalyi. Flow has become a popular concept in business and management around the world and research on the concept continues to flourish. Finally, this volume contains articles that stem from Csikszentmihalyi’s connection with Martin Seligman; they deal with concepts and theories, as well as with the development and short history, of the field and the “movement” of positive psychology.",Psychology,313,5,1,en
Handbook of Research on Perspectives on Society and Technology Addiction,"Sine Nazl?, Rengim, Sari, Gül?ah",IGI Global,2023-06-19,"Internet-based technologies prevail in most of the world. Along with the positive features of digital technologies that permeate our lives in almost every area, including lifestyles and daily practices, the traces of negative aspects have also become evident. Digital addiction is among the most important of these aspects. It is obvious that communication, which has been maintained in various forms since the beginning of humanity, has been shaped by the period in which it is lived. The technology-based transformation has transformed communication, which has been adopted to the ""internet"" in the world, into a completely different form. Communication, which has become sustainable at any time and anywhere, regardless of location, led by the never-ending elements of ""continuity"" and ""interaction,"" has turned into an indispensable form. Perspectives on Society and Technology Addiction examines every subject of digital addiction in an interdisciplinary way. It discusses the issues about what technology addiction is, how to deal with this addiction, how to use the existing technology in a positive way, how to deal with this technology for disadvantaged groups, and concerns in the fields of social science and communication science. Covering topics such as Consumer 5.0, experience design, and information markets, this premier reference source is an essential resource for sociologists, policymakers, students and educators of higher education, researchers, and academicians.",Psychology,630,N/A,0,en

Enterprise Patterns and MDA,"Jim Simon Plumtree, Jim Arlow, Ila Neustadt",Addison-Wesley Professional,2003-12-22,"Enterprise Patterns and MDA teaches you how to customize any archetype pattern–such as Customer, Product, and Order–to reflect the idiosyncrasies of your own business environment. Because all the patterns work harmoniously together and have clearly documented relationships to each other, you’ll come away with a host of reusable solutions to common problems in business-software design. This book shows you how using a pattern or a fragment of a pattern can save you months of work and help you avoid costly errors. You’ll also discover how–when used in literate modeling–patterns can solve the difficult challenge of communicating UML models to broad audiences. The configurable patterns can be used manually to create executable code. However, the authors draw on their extensive experience to show you how to tap the significant power of MDA and UML for maximum automation. Not surprisingly, the patterns included in this book are highly valuable; a blue-chip company recently valued a similar, but less mature, set of patterns at hundreds of thousands of dollars. Use this practical guide to increase the efficiency of your designs and to create robust business applications that can be applied immediately in a business setting.",Computers,1164,N/A,0,en

"Centennial History of the Carnegie Institution of Washington: Volume 1, The Mount Wilson Observatory: Breaking the Code of Cosmic Evolution","Allan Sandage, Louis Brown",Cambridge University Press,2004,"Since its foundation in 1904, the Mount Wilson Observatory has been at the centre of the development of astrophysics. Perched atop a mountain wilderness, two mammoth solar tower telescopes and the 60- and 100-inch behemoth night-time reflectors were all the largest in the world. Research has centred around two main themes - the evolution of stars and the development of the universe. This first volume in a series of five histories of the Carnegie Institution describes the people and events, the challenges and successes that the Observatory has witnessed. It includes biographical sketches of forty of the most famous Mount Wilson pioneer astronomers working during the first half of the twentieth century. Contemporary photographs illustrate the development and use of some of the innovative instruments that filled the observatory during this time. This story brings together the elements that formed modern theories of stellar evolution and cosmology.",Science,672,N/A,0,en

FAQ 3,,"AK-INTERACTIVE, S.L.",N/A,"This new Super-Book, like its predecessors in this same series of technical manuals called “FAQ”, is dedicated to modeling military vehicles and the techniques used for assembling, painting and weathering. The difference with the previous book is that we have moved on in the timeframe and this book is a complement of the previous ones. It also explains some new techniques that have appeared these last years, mainly to use in modern vehicles but that can be also used in vehicles of all eras. The most complete book for military vehicles edited until now. The materials that make up modern vehicles and weapons have changed considerably since World War II. Materials that were out of the question on a technological and industrial level back then are now commonplace. The use of these new materials and the manufacturing and assembly methods reflect on the way we paint and weather these models; they require a different approach. Like many other things in life, in the end the purpose is to take up new challenges. In this book we present some of those challenges.

Haley and Martin might be too awkward to hang out in real life, but over text, they're becoming addicted to each other.There's just one problem: Haley doesn't know who Martin is.

Generation Z,"Corey Seemiller, Meghan Grace",N/A,2018-10-19,"No other generation in history has received as much coverage as the Millennial generation. Books, Google searches, blogs, and news articles are everywhere about them. Yet, Generation Z is comprised of our youth and young adults today and has received very little attention comparatively. Those in Generation Z are among our youngest consumers, students, colleagues, constituents, voters, and neighbors. Being able to better understand who they are and how they see the world can be helpful in effectively working with, teaching, supervising, and leading them. Generation Z: A Century in the Making offers insight into nearly every aspect of the lives of those in Generation Z, including a focus on their career aspirations, religious beliefs and practices, entertainment and hobbies, social concerns, relationships with friends and family, health and wellness, money management, civic engagement, communication styles, political ideologies, technology use, and educational preferences. Drawing from an unprecedented number of studies with higher education research institutions, market research firms such as Pew and Census, other generational researchers and industry leaders, this is the authoritative defining work on Generation Z that market researchers, consumer behaviour specialists, and employers sorely need - and it is a fascinating read for anyone interested in the sociology of generations.",Generation Z.,321,N/A,0,en

Generation Z Goes to College,"Corey Seemiller, Meghan Grace",John Wiley & Sons,2016-01-19,"Say Hello to Your Incoming Class—They're Not Millennials Anymore Generation Z is rapidly replacing Millennials on college campuses. Those born from 1995 through 2010 have different motivations, learning styles, characteristics, skill sets, and social concerns than previous generations. Unlike Millennials, Generation Z students grew up in a recession and are under no illusions about their prospects for employment after college. While skeptical about the cost and value of higher education, they are also entrepreneurial, innovative, and independent learners concerned with effecting social change. Understanding Generation Z's mindset and goals is paramount to supporting, developing, and educating them through higher education. Generation Z Goes to College showcases findings from an in-depth study of over 1,100 Generation Z college students from 15 vastly different U.S. higher education institutions as well as additional studies from youth, market, and education research related to this generation.

A Portrait of Walt Disney World,"Kevin Kern, Tim O'Day, Steven Vagnini",Disney Editions,2021-09-28,"This expansive, must-have coffee table book paints a robust portrait of the Walt Disney World Resort, across half a century, through diverse and vibrant voices and mostly unseen Disney theme park concept art and photographs. Walt Disney's vision for the Florida Project begins with Disneyland and the 1964-1965 New York World's Fair. After an imaginative and expansive design, a unique land acquisition process, and an innovative construction period, the Walt Disney World Resort celebrated its Grand Opening in October 1971. It featured a theme park dubbed the Magic Kingdom and three recreational resorts: Disney's Contemporary Resort, Disney's Polynesian Village, and Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground. As Walt Disney World consistently grew and further evolved through the five decades that followed, certain themes reverberated: an appreciation for nostalgia, a joy for fantasy, a hunger for discovery, and an unending hope for a better tomorrow. Inspirational and memorable theme parks, water parks, sports arenas, recreational water sports, world-class golf courses, vast shopping villages, and a transportation network unlike any other in the world resulted in fun, festive, and familiar characters, traditions, spectacles, merchandise, and so much more. The resort has come to represent the pulse of American leisure and has served as a backdrop for life's milestones both big and small, public and private. Walt Disney World: A Portrait of the First Half Century serves as a treasure trove for vacationers, students of hospitality, artists, and all Disney collectors.

The Lost City of Z,David Grann,Simon and Schuster,2009-08-10,"**NOW A MAJOR FILM STARRING ROBERT PATTINSON, CHARLIE HUNNAM AND SIENNA MILLER** ‘A riveting, exciting and thoroughly compelling tale of adventure’JOHN GRISHAM The story of Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett, the inspiration behind Conan Doyle's The Lost World, by the author of the international Number One bestsellers KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON and THE WAGER Fawcett was among the last of a legendary breed of British explorers. For years he explored the Amazon and came to believe that its jungle concealed a large, complex civilization, like El Dorado. Obsessed with its discovery, he christened it the City of Z. In 1925, Fawcett headed into the wilderness with his son Jack, vowing to make history. They vanished without a trace. For the next eighty years, hordes of explorers plunged into the jungle, trying to find evidence of Fawcett's party or Z. Some died from disease and starvation; others simply disappeared. In this spellbinding true tale of lethal obsession, David Grann retraces the footsteps of Fawcett and his followers as he unravels one of the greatest mysteries of exploration. ‘A wonderful story of a lost age of heroic exploration’ Sunday Times ‘Marvellous ...

Cerebral Plasticity,"Leo M. Chalupa, Nicoletta Berardi, Matteo Caleo, Lucia Galli-Resta, Tommaso Pizzorusso",MIT Press,2011-05-20,"A survey of the latest research, covering such topics as plasticity in the adult brain and the underlying mechanisms of plasticity. The notion that neurons in the living brain can change in response to experience—a phenomenon known as ""plasticity""—has become a major conceptual issue in neuroscience research as well as a practical focus for the fields of neural rehabilitation and neurodegenerative disease. Early work dealt with the plasticity of the developing brain and demonstrated the critical role played by sensory experience in normal development. Two broader themes have emerged in recent studies: the plasticity of the adult brain (one of the most rapidly developing areas of current research) and the search for the underlying mechanisms of plasticity—explanations for the cellular, molecular, and epigenetic factors controlling plasticity. Many scientists believe that achieving a fundamental understanding of what underlies neuronal plasticity could help us treat neurological disorders and even improve the learning capabilities of the human brain. This volume offers contributions from leaders in the field that cover all three approaches to the study of cerebral plasticity. Chapters treat normal development and the influences of environmental manipulations; cerebral plasticity in adulthood; and underlying mechanisms of plasticity. Other chapters deal with plastic changes in neurological conditions and with the enhancement of plasticity as a strategy for brain repair.",Medical,439,N/A,0,en
