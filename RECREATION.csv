Book for the Hour of Recreation,María de San José Salazar,University of Chicago Press,2007-11-01,"María de San José Salazar (1548-1603) took the veil as a Discalced (""barefoot"") Carmelite nun in 1571, becoming one of Teresa of Avila's most important collaborators in religious reform and serving as prioress of the Seville and Lisbon convents. Within the parameters of the strict Catholic Reformation in Spain, María fiercely defended women's rights to define their own spiritual experience and to teach, inspire, and lead other women in reforming their church. María wrote this book as a defense of the Discalced practice of setting aside two hours each day for conversation, music, and staging of religious plays. Casting the book in the form of a dialogue, María demonstrates through fictional conversations among a group of nuns during their hours of recreation how women could serve as very effective spiritual teachers for each other. The book includes one of the first biographical portraits of Teresa and Maria's personal account of the troubled founding of the Discalced convent at Seville, as well as her tribulations as an Inquisitional suspect. Rich in allusions to women's affective relationships in the early modern convent, Book for the Hour of Recreation also serves as an example of how a woman might write when relatively free of clerical censorship and expectations. A detailed introduction and notes by Alison Weber provide historical and biographical context for Amanda Powell's fluid translation.",Biography & Autobiography,205,N/A,0,en

Parks and Recreation System Planning,David Barth,Island Press,2020-07-21,"Parks and recreation systems have evolved in remarkable ways over the past two decades. No longer just playgrounds and ballfields, parks and open spaces have become recognized as essential green infrastructure with the potential to contribute to community resiliency and sustainability. To capitalize on this potential, the parks and recreation system planning process must evolve as well. In Parks and Recreation System Planning, David Barth provides a new, step-by-step approach to creating parks systems that generate greater economic, social, and environmental benefits. Barth first advocates that parks and recreation systems should no longer be regarded as isolated facilities, but as elements of an integrated public realm. Each space should be designed to generate multiple community benefits. Next, he presents a new approach for parks and recreation planning that is integrated into community-wide issues. Chapters outline each step—evaluating existing systems, implementing a carefully crafted plan, and more—necessary for creating a successful, adaptable system. Throughout the book, he describes initiatives that are creating more resilient, sustainable, and engaging parks and recreation facilities, drawing from his experience consulting in more than 100 communities across the U.S. Parks and Recreation System Planning meets the critical need to provide an up-to-date, comprehensive approach for planning parks and recreation systems across the country.

Forest Tourism and Recreation,"Xavier Font, John Tribe",CABI,2000-01-01,"Annotation. The demand for ecotourism and outdoor recreation is increasing, and the pressures on land use are becoming more obvious. A large part of the experience of ecotourism and recreational landscape depends on the maintenance of forested land. Effective management of tourism and recreation in forests can provide extra income to help offset the costs of sustainable timber production and encourage biodiversity conservation.This multi-author book considers the compatibility between tourism, forestry and conservation, the management of natural resources and the involvement of stakeholders and the community.

"How to Watch Television, Second Edition","Ethan Thompson, Jason Mittell",NYU Press,2020-03-31,"A new edition that brings the ways we watch and think about television up to the present We all have opinions about the television shows we watch, but television criticism is about much more than simply evaluating the merits of a particular show and deeming it “good” or “bad.” Rather, criticism uses the close examination of a television program to explore that program’s cultural significance, creative strategies, and its place in a broader social context. How to Watch Television, Second Edition brings together forty original essays—more than half of which are new to this edition—from today’s leading scholars on television culture, who write about the programs they care (and think) the most about. Each essay focuses on a single television show, demonstrating one way to read the program and, through it, our media culture. From fashioning blackness in Empire to representation in Orange is the New Black and from the role of the reboot in Gilmore Girls to the function of changing political atmospheres in Roseanne, these essays model how to practice media criticism in accessible language, providing critical insights through analysis—suggesting a way of looking at TV that students and interested viewers might emulate. The contributors discuss a wide range of television programs past and present, covering many formats and genres, spanning fiction and non-fiction, broadcast, streaming, and cable. Addressing shows from TV’s earliest days to contemporary online transformations of the medium, How to Watch Television, Second Edition is designed to engender classroom discussion among television critics of all backgrounds.

Literature as Recreation in the Later Middle Ages,Glending Olson,Cornell University Press,2019-05-15,"This book studies attitudes toward secular literature during the later Middle Ages. Exploring two related medieval justifications of literary pleasure—one finding hygienic or therapeutic value in entertainment, and another stressing the psychological and ethical rewards of taking time out from work in order to refresh oneself—Glending Olson reveals that, contrary to much recent opinion, many medieval writers and thinkers accepted delight and enjoyment as valid goals of literature without always demanding moral profit as well. Drawing on a vast amount of primary material, including contemporary medical manuscripts and printed texts, Olson discusses theatrics, humanist literary criticism, prologues to romances and fabliaux, and Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. He offers an extended examination of the framing story of Boccaccio's Decameron. Although intended principally as a contribution to the history of medieval literary theory and criticism, Literature as Recreation in the Later Middle Ages makes use of medical, psychological, and sociological insights that lead to a fuller understanding of late medieval secular culture.",Literary Criticism,244,N/A,0,en

The Essential Aldo Leopold,"Curt D. Meine, Richard L.

Leopold biographer Curt Meine and noted conservation biologist Richard Knight have assembled this comprehensive collection of quotations from Leopold’s extensive and diverse writings, selected and organized to capture the richness and depth of the North American conservation movement. Prominent biologists, conservationists, historians, and philosophers provide introductory commentaries describing Leopold’s contributions in varied fields and reflecting upon the significance of his work today.

Sports & Recreation Fads,"Frank Hoffmann, Beulah B Ramirez",Routledge,2013-12-16,"True to the spirit of the all-American athlete and our society's seemingly endless pursuit of and passion for leisure activities is Sports & Recreation Fads. This readable and fascinating reference book highlights some of the most notable as well as some long-forgotten pastimes and personalities. Sporting and recreation events have thrived in the United States for more than two centuries. Just about every sport and recreation embraced from Colonial America to the present has had its faddish aspects. The fascinating introduction provides a basic understanding of the importance of fads in the development of sports and recreation. No book on sports fads would be complete without several chapters on baseball, and this exciting volume is no different--Hank Aaron's 715th home run, baseball card collecting, Mark “the Bird” Fidrych's shining season with the Detroit Tigers, Bo Jackson's double career, Jackie Robinson's success in breaking the color barrier, and Pete Rose's gambling troubles--a true slice of Americana, the best and the worst of our favorite pastime! From the controversial people and events in professional athletics--Mohammed Ali, Joe Namath, Mike Tyson, the “battle of the sexes” between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs, the “Black Sox Scandal,” and the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders, to the heroes--Charles Atlas, Joe Louis, and Babe Ruth, Hoffmann and Bailey illustrate the often fickle and sometimes enduring interest that Americans have for sports figures and their games. This informative and entertaining book also examines our personal quest for fitness, our devotion to automobiling, and our love of games, including bridge, charades, crossword puzzles, Monopoly, Dungeons & Dragons, Scrabble, and Trivial Pursuit. Sports &Recreation Fads is a handy guide to our favorite leisure activities of the last 200 years.",Sports & Recreation,414,N/A,0,en

America's Renewable Resources,"Kenneth D. Frederick, Roger A. Sedjo",Routledge,2013-10-18,"By recording one country's experience with its vast natural resource base, America's Renewable Resources: Historical Trends and Current Challenges will help to inform the management of future demands on the resource base in the U.S. and throughout the world. The contributors focus specifically on renewable resources--water, forests, rangeland, cropland and soils, and wildlife--which possess the capacity to restore themselves after they have be consumed. Because this capacity can be destroyed and the time required for restoration can be very long, a balance in their use is necessary to sustain continued productivity. In arresting fashion, the authors trace the history of each resource's use from early colonial times through periods of dramatic, sometimes cataclysmic, changes in its utilization by an expanding, diversifying society. They show how unforeseen consequences have forced social institutions into existence and compelled policy makers, especially at the federal level, to deal with problems for which they were largely unprepared. America's Renewable Resources, by examining changes in demand, technologies, policies, and institutions, will assist both policy makers and the public at large to look past short-term events to the conditions fundamental to maintaining our future economic and environmental wellbeing.

As a field of study, recreational ecology is both multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary, and the authors seek to develop a deeper understanding of both the role and function of the factors that influence visitor numbers and their impact. An accessible and comprehensive textbook, it features numerous types of outdoor recreational activities including hill walking, rock climbing, mountain marathons, skiing, scuba diving and more. Drawn from several global case studies, the authors estimate the current and future numbers involved in outdoor recreation, and how best these numbers can be managed.

Willy Wonka meets The Matrix.”—USA Today • “As one adventure leads expertly to the next, time simply evaporates.”—Entertainment Weekly A world at stake. A quest for the ultimate prize. Are you ready? In the year 2045, reality is an ugly place. The only time Wade Watts really feels alive is when he’s jacked into the OASIS, a vast virtual world where most of humanity spends their days. When the eccentric creator of the OASIS dies, he leaves behind a series of fiendish puzzles, based on his obsession with the pop culture of decades past. Whoever is first to solve them will inherit his vast fortune—and control of the OASIS itself. Then Wade cracks the first clue. Suddenly he’s beset by rivals who’ll kill to take this prize.

Tourism and Recreation in Rural Areas,"Richard W. Butler, C. Michael Hall, John Jenkins",Wiley,1998-06-29,"Recent years have witnessed a change from the passive, low key use of rural areas for recreation to the explosion of tourism as a highly active and dominant agent of change and control in the countryside and associated rural communities. This book considers the effects of rural recreation and tourism with special reference to: * the economics of rural restructuring * public sector rural policies * imaging and reimaging * the social dynamics of rural change * sustainability of tourism and recreation in rural areas Contemporary reflections of each of these issues are brought together by Richard Butler, C. Michael Hall and John Jenkins from experts in Australasia, North America and Europe. The book provides a critical evaluation of the enthusiasm and promotion given to this growth industry by government and private bodies, and examines opportunities and challenges associated with the development and management of tourism in a rural environment.",Travel,274,N/A,0,en
Urban Green,Colin Fisher,UNC Press Books,2015-05-11,"In early twentieth-century America, affluent city-dwellers made a habit of venturing out of doors and vacationing in resorts and national parks. Yet the rich and the privileged were not the only ones who sought respite in nature. In this pathbreaking book, historian Colin Fisher demonstrates that working-class white immigrants and African Americans in rapidly industrializing Chicago also fled the urban environment during their scarce leisure time. If they had the means, they traveled to wilderness parks just past the city limits as well as to rural resorts in Wisconsin and Michigan. But lacking time and money, they most often sought out nature within the city itself--at urban parks and commercial groves, along the Lake Michigan shore, even in vacant lots. Chicagoans enjoyed a variety of outdoor recreational activities in these green spaces, and they used them to forge ethnic and working-class community. While narrating a crucial era in the history of Chicago's urban development, Fisher makes important interventions in debates about working-class leisure, the history of urban parks, environmental justice, the African American experience, immigration history, and the cultural history of nature.",Nature,249,N/A,0,en
"Evaluating Recreation Services, 4th Ed","Karla A. Henderson, M. Deborah Bialeschki, Laurie P. Browne",N/A,2017-04,"Evaluation is a process that each of us uses every day. Professionals in any field of human services must have the means to access and assess information. Having information is not enough, however, unless that information can be applied and used. To organize and manage recreation services (i.e., all elements related to the various specialties in the field such as parks, tourism, sports, arts, therapeutic recreation, camping, event management), information is needed about people's preferences, needs, and behaviors and the programs, administrative structures, and resources that comprise the organizations. To build a body of knowledge and to document the value of recreation, systematic processes are necessary. Evaluation and research can provide information that will enable ""enlightened decisions."" Evaluating Recreation Services: Making Enlightened Decisions, Fourth Edition, is about systematic evaluation and research that focuses specifically on identifying explicit evaluation criteria or research questions, collecting evidence or data, and making judgments about the value or the worth of something applied to service improvement or knowledge development. This book aims to provide a basic overview and working knowledge of procedures. Knowing basic steps in evaluation research and having some familiarity with evaluation and research tools can help you to begin a process of lifelong learning about systematic inquiry.",,462,N/A,0,en

Outdoor Recreation,Hilde G. Nielsen,BoD – Books on Demand,2021-01-20,"Outdoor recreation refers to recreation/activity executed outdoors, most commonly in natural settings. At least in many high-income countries, outdoor recreation is by many considered as an attractive activity during spare time or holidays. People actively seek out activities such as walking in the mountains, climbing, hunting, horseback riding, skiing, etc., which are very often difficult to accommodate in ordinary working days. Some people find outdoor recreation attractive to the extent that they take several months or a year off from work in order to spend time in nature. Outdoor recreation stimulates a healthy lifestyle and increases public health, and it is important to develop outdoor activity habits from early childhood, a habit that should last for an entire lifetime. This book will take you through the definitions of outdoor recreation and different types of recreation. Furthermore, the book will also give you a snapshot of the physiological and psychological effects of outdoor recreation and why outdoor recreation is important for development in children and adolescents, and for adults and the older population, in addition to descriptions of some of the major and maybe the most used outdoor activities.",Health & Fitness,104,N/A,0,en

The Discipline of Leisure,"Simon Coleman, Tamara Kohn",Berghahn Books,2008-01-01,"The burgeoning social scientific study of tourism has emphasized the effects of the post-industrial economy on travel and place. However, this volume takes some of these issues into a different area of leisure: the spare-time carved out by people as part of their everyday lives - time that is much more intimately juxtaposed with the pressures and influences of work life, and which often involves specific bodily practices associated with hobbies and sports. An important focus of the book is the body as a site of identity formation, experience, and disciplined recreation of the self. Contributors examine the ways rituals, sports, and forms of bodily transformation mediate between contemporary ideologies of freedom, choice and self-control.",Social Science,208,N/A,0,en

"Understanding the Active Economy and Emerging Research on the Value of Sports, Recreation, and Wellness","David J Finch, David Legg",Business Science Reference,2021-06-04,"The active economy incorporates several disciplines that include sport performance, sport business, recreation, tourism, physical activity, urban planning, leisure, and health and wellness, among others. From an academic and policy perspective, these disciplines are typically viewed as distinct, with only limited spillover, and consequently, limited research explores the interaction between them. However, each individual sector can be studied as interdependent rather than autonomous. By viewing the various sectors as part of a complex active ecosystem, policymakers and practitioners are better positioned to shape broad opportunities while maximizing the community value of sports, recreation, and wellness. Understanding the Active Economy and Emerging Research on the Value of Sports, Recreation, and Wellness provides a new view on the fields of sport, recreation, and health and wellness by exploring the interaction between these traditional separate disciplines. It includes sub-groups of the active economy such as health and wellness, active apparel and accessories, active equipment and sports betting but also ties in sub-groups from the ancillary sector such as tourism, design and infrastructure, media and content, and professional services. This book is intended for professionals, educators, and researchers working in the fields of sports, recreation, and health and wellness, as well as economists, executives, managers, practitioners, stakeholders, researchers, academicians, and students interested in how sports, recreation, and wellness operate in the active economy.",,305,N/A,0,en

Eating the Dinosaur,Chuck Klosterman,Simon and Schuster,2009-10-20,"After a bestselling and acclaimed diversion into fiction, Chuck Klosterman, author of Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs, returns to the form in which he’s been spectacularly successful with a collection of essays about our consumption of pop culture and sports. Q: What is this book about? A: Well, that’s difficult to say. I haven’t read it yet—I’ve just picked it up and casually glanced at the back cover. There clearly isn’t a plot. I’ve heard there’s a lot of stuff about time travel in this book, and quite a bit about violence and Garth Brooks and why Germans don’t laugh when they’re inside grocery stores. Ralph Nader and Ralph Sampson play significant roles. I think there are several pages about Rear Window and college football and Mad Men and why Rivers Cuomo prefers having sex with Asian women. Supposedly there’s a chapter outlining all the things the Unabomber was right about, but perhaps I’m misinformed. Q: Is there a larger theme? A: Oh, something about reality. “What is reality,” maybe? No, that’s not it. Not exactly. I get the sense that most of the core questions dwell on the way media perception constructs a fake reality that ends up becoming more meaningful than whatever actually happened. Also, Lady Gaga. Q: Should I read this book? A: Probably. Do you see a clear relationship between the Branch Davidian disaster and the recording of Nirvana’s In Utero? Does Barack Obama make you want to drink Pepsi? Does ABBA remind you of AC/DC? If so, you probably don’t need to read this book. You probably wrote this book.

United States Code,United States,N/A,2013,"""The United States Code is the official codification of the general and permanent laws of the United States of America. The Code was first published in 1926, and a new edition of the code has been published every six years since 1934. The 2012 edition of the Code incorporates laws enacted through the One Hundred Twelfth Congress, Second Session, the last of which was signed by the President on January 15, 2013. It does not include laws of the One Hundred Thirteenth Congress, First Session, enacted between January 2, 2013, the date it convened, and January 15, 2013. By statutory authority this edition may be cited ""U.S.C. 2012 ed."" As adopted in 1926, the Code established prima facie the general and permanent laws of the United States. The underlying statutes reprinted in the Code remained in effect and controlled over the Code in case of any discrepancy. In 1947, Congress began enacting individual titles of the Code into positive law. When a title is enacted into positive law, the underlying statutes are repealed and the title then becomes legal evidence of the law. Currently, 26 of the 51 titles in the Code have been so enacted. These are identified in the table of titles near the beginning of each volume. The Law Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives continues to prepare legislation pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 285b to enact the remainder of the Code, on a title-by-title basis, into positive law. The 2012 edition of the Code was prepared and published under the supervision of Ralph V. Seep, Law Revision Counsel. Grateful acknowledgment is made of the contributions by all who helped in this work, particularly the staffs of the Office of the Law Revision Counsel and the Government Printing Office""--Preface.",Law,974,N/A,0,en

It is a complete resource for fostering coaching excellence in small- and large-scale programming, and from volunteer to part-time or full-time coaches.

Land and Leisure,"Carlton S. Van Doren, George B. Priddle, John E. Lewis",Routledge,2019-04-25,"First published in 1974. Leisure has come to be a vital force in our lives, a part of self-discovery, essential for our well-being. With increased amounts of leisure time, there has been rapid growth in the demand for diverse recreational facilities and their subsequent overuse. With this in mind, it is clear why the planning, managing and administration of recreational resources, particularly in urban areas, is of personal interest to everyone. Land and Leisure introduces the student to all aspects of recreational land use - spatial, economic, behavioural and physical. This second edition is designed to demonstrate some of the basic up-to-date ideas and issues of the last decade and a half that have been influential in shaping decisions, and is concerned both with urban recreation and the uses of resources within metropolitan areas and with the role of the private sector in providing facilities. The book is divided into five parts with discussions ranging over topics such as the individual's recreational needs, recreational land-use evaluation, regional planning and the problems of decision-making and the provision of recreational resources. Its interdisciplinary approach will enable students to understand the problems, concepts, methods and approaches helpful in furthering and integrating their knowledge of recreational resources.",Social Science,540,N/A,0,en

Tierney",Human Kinetics,2009,"""Recreation, Event, and Tourism Businesses: Start-Up and Sustainable Operations reveals the keys to business success in the commercial recreation, event, and tourism sector.

""Recreation, Event, and Tourism Businesses presents new professionals and potential business owners with clear, easy-to-read directions for developing and writing a business plan. The book's business profiles and case studies serve as examples to follow when working on the plan and help readers gain insight into how businesses are planned, started, and funded.

Study Guide for the Therapeutic Recreation Specialist Certification Examination,"NORMA J.. FOLKERTH STUMBO (JEAN E.), Jean E. Folkerth",N/A,2018-08-20,"Compare our prices! The purpose of this study guide is to assist candidates in preparing for the NCTRC national certification examination for Certified Therapeutic Recreation Specialists. We are excited to tell you that this fifth edition of the Study Guide for the Therapeutic Recreation Specialist Certification Examination has changed significantly from previous editions. This is largely due to two reasons: (a) the National Council for Therapeutic Recreation Certification (NCTRC) has recently updated the Job Analysis, which helps structure the content of the test, and (b) the computerized test has a newer format of a 150-item test. Therefore, we have restructured the Study Guide to align more closely with the most recent NCTRC exam content and format. In addition, weve added over 100 new items for a total of over 850 practice test items! The Study Guide offers over 250 random practice items, plus four practice exams, each with 150 items distributed across the job analysis that mirrors the national exam. In preparing this Study Guide, our mission is two-fold: (a) to provide information that helps candidates reduce test anxiety and maximize test performance; and (b) to provide numerous sample questions, similar to those actually found on the exam, that will allow candidates to practice and self-assess their own readiness for the test. For many individuals, the thought of taking a certification examination can be unsettling. We often hear statements such as, I have never taken a comprehensive exam. There is so much information. How do I learn it all? This Study Guide will help to identify areas where you need further study to help you ace your NCTRC certification examination!",,164,N/A,0,en

Risk Management in Sport and Recreation,"John Otto Spengler, Daniel Connaughton, Andrew T. Pittman",Human Kinetics,2006,"Risk Management in Sport and Recreation is a comprehensive resource for those charged with the responsibility of providing for the safety of participants and spectators in a sport or recreation setting. It covers a range of safety issues, including lightning, heat illness, aquatics, playground safety, drug testing, and medical emergency action plans. Readers receive clear and detailed explanations of issues to consider before making decisions on risk management. Risk Management in Sport and Recreation is designed to provide a foundation for approaching key issues in safety and risk management. It shows readers how to evaluate and analyze various safety issues and apply the underlying concepts to a variety of situations. The following are unique features of the text: -A safety guidelines finder lists Web sites of accessible standards, guidelines, and recommendations from leading organizations. -Chapter objectives and pullout boxes of key points and key statistics stress the importance of the topic under discussion. -Threshold issues in each chapter highlight important factors to consider when making decisions on risk management. -Real-world applications at the end of each chapter present scenarios involving the potential for harm, and readers must make a decision on how to address the issues. -Examples of public service announcements, posters, and other publicly viewed safety information are presented. -An appendix offers examples of emergency action plans, checklists, and recommendations from organizations such as the National Lightning Safety Institute and university aquatic centers. -A companion Web site provides links to the Web sites used in the book, as well as updates to guidelines and links that may occur after the book is in print. The safety guidelines finder gives students and practitioners a single location from which they can easily access important safety information. Organized under land-based or water-based activities, each activity lists guidelines, recommendations, and standards along with the source for that information. Each entry includes Web sites where readers can find the full documents. The text also features sample guidelines and safety checklists from agencies and associations that demonstrate how organizations might plan for risk and communicate safety information. Readers also consider the types of postings and equipment they will need in order to communicate their risk management plans, and they are given real-life situations in which a risk management plan is needed and are prompted to consider why and how to create a plan for such situations. The resource will help students and professionals plan for and manage risk. Current and future employees of sport facilities, school athletic programs, parks and recreation programs, youth and aquatic centers, or resorts and golf courses will find that Risk Management in Sport and Recreation provides the tools to assist in making the right decisions to manage risk effectively.",Business & Economics,188,N/A,0,en

This new edition covers all aspects of the economics of sport and recreation but gives prominence to the staggering rise of the commercial sector over the last decade. Special attention is paid to the economics of the sports goods industry, the economics of sports sponsorship, the economics of major sports events, the economics of professional team sports, and the economic relationship between sport and broadcasting. In the first edition of this book published in 1985, the emphasis was on the government and voluntary sectors as the lead sectors in the sports market. As we enter the next millennium, it is the commercial sector that is the lead sector in the sports market and this is reflected in the content and structure of the new book. Aimed specifically at students engaged in the study of sport and its interaction with the economy, this book will be an invaluable resource.",Business & Economics,343,N/A,0,en

Professional, responsive, and carefully considered planning is critical to success in developing, managing, and making accessible outdoor recreation resources. Outdoor Recreation Planning provides guidance for defining where outdoor recreation resource management should and could be going forward and sound advice, principles, and approaches for identifying pathways for getting there. Responsive outdoor recreation resource planning must actively and interactively engage, early and often, the stakeholders, citizens, and others the planning organization is working to serve. Considered planning will look carefully and comprehensively at the opportunities and constraints for achieving success. Outdoor Recreation Planning is unique because it has been prepared by academics and planning practitioners working together to provide a teaching guide as well as a planning applications resource. The authors have practical experience in advising and helping to develop recreation resource planning rules and procedures and in developing master plans for public properties.

Today they are one of the Nation's largest providers of outdoor recreation. Next to the Department of the Interior, the agency that operates our national park system, the Corps of Engineers manages more recreation areas than any other federal or state agency.

Recreation and Sports Ministry: Impacting the Postmodern Culture,John Garner,N/A,2016-12,"How open is our culture to recreation and sports? The popular culture today is saturated with recreation and sports. The Olympics, Super Bowl, World Series, X-Games, Iron Man events, the Final Four in college basketball, and the playoff series in professional basketball capture the imaginations of millions of people in America each time they are held. The questions are, according to general editor John Garner, where is the church and how is the church using these tools to reach people, and will the church see the opportunity to use recreation and sports as ministry tools?The fact is, most churches are not reaching the postmodern culture and are being ignored by an increasingly non-Christian American culture because people see no relevance to their lives. What they do see relevance in is re-creative leisure; they pursue it at break-neck speed and often at great costs. Somehow the church must learn to ¿capture the imagination¿ of a world that is passing it by. If the church can capture the imaginations of people, it can get their attention, can gain access to their minds, and can reach the heart with the message of the love of God.",Religion,314,N/A,0,en

That neglect should be corrected! It is important to recognize the ways in which racism has permeated our society, sometimes blatant and sometimes subtle. While the focus is South Carolina, the particulars are representative of what happened in CCC camps across the nation. As one of the most popular facets of President Franklin D. Roosevelts New Deal, the activities and antics of the CCC boys deserve attention. My primary purpose in writing this book is to assist teachers and librarians and their upper level elementary and high school students in understanding this crucial but understudied era in South Carolinas history.

"Introduction to Recreation Services for People with Disabilities, 4th Ed","Charles C. Bullock, Michael J. Mahon",N/A,2017-03,"Introduction to Recreation Services for People With Disabilities continues to reflect a broad-based explanation of the role of practitioners in the interrelated fields of therapeutic recreation, inclusive recreation, and special recreation. This fourth edition represents a major revision, including the most current research and thinking about the interdisciplinary fields of recreation and disability studies. This book is intended to be an introductory text for all students in parks and recreation/leisure studies departments. Every student, whether she or he intends to work in a provincial park or a state hospital, a community recreation center or a community mental health center, a public school or a cruise ship, needs a basic level of knowledge about people with disabilities. The central theme of this book is that people with disabilities are people who have the same needs and wants as anyone else and deserve the right to be at the center of their services. Each person with a disability is a person first, not a disability. Recreation services must be centered around the person who is being served. That is, whether treatment-oriented recreation therapy, goal-oriented special recreation, or activity-oriented inclusive recreation, it is the person and not the professional or even the activity that must be at the center of service delivery. It is our hope that you will begin to see people with disabilities as people as you learn about recreation and therapeutic recreation services. If you emerge from this book (or your class) with this person-centered knowledge, then you will have learned a lot about how to provide recreation services to people with disabilities. Whether or not you happen to be a person with a disability, our more earnest hope is that you will emerge with a commitment to ensure that people with disabilities are treated as people who are at the center of their programs and services. This means that you will become an advocate, maybe even a zealot, on behalf of people with disabilities. You will encourage friends and colleagues to use people-first and respectful language. You will refrain from jokes that perpetuate stereotypes. You will be part of a new breed of recreation and therapeutic recreation professionals who celebrate differences and strive to provide person-centered and responsive services.",,396,N/A,0,en

"Human Resource Management in Recreation, Sport, and Leisure Services","Margaret Arnold, Regina Bresnan Glover, Cheryl Suzanne Beeler",Venture Pub,2012,"""Managers of recreation, sport, and leisure services perform a variety of activities. Perhaps the most essential of these activities is the management of human resources. Every person associated with an organization, directly or indirectly, is a resource. These people might be recreation directors, event planners, sport managers, park supervisors, therapeutic recreation specialists, or outdoor leaders. They might have full-time, part-time, seasonal, or voluntary status. It is a mistake to assume that these individuals will automatically fit together into a cohesive, coordinated team. Furthermore, it is an error to assume that people will automatically perform the appropriate tasks and perform those tasks in the most desirable manner. An effective team effort is essential to the operation of any organization, and it is the responsibility of the manager to make this happen. In summary, this textbook prepares students--whether they intend to work in commercial recreation, therapeutic recreation, outdoor recreation, governmental recreation, youth services, sports management, or event planning--with a solid foundation for human resource management. Theory and practice are combined to assist students in gaining a greater understanding of the many complexities they will encounter in the workplace.""--Publisher's website.",Business & Economics,245,N/A,0,en

The Diaries of Adam and Eve,Mark Twain,Xist Publishing,2015-09-28,"What if Adam and Eve Had a Diary? “He talks very little. Perhaps it is because he is not bright and is sensitive about it and wishes to conceal it. It is such a pity that he should feel so, for brightness is nothing. It is in the heart that the values lie. I wish I could make him understand that a loving good heart is riches, and riches is enough, and that without it intellect is poverty.” - Mark Twain, Eve's Diary Mark Twain’s short stories aren’t about his religious beliefs. In fact, the Diaries of Adam and Eve should be taken with a grain of salt as they are humorous and witty and describe in a unique way the relationship between two human beings, man and woman who eventually end up falling in love with each other.

The Getty Villa,"Marion True, Jorge Silvetti",Getty Publications,2005,"The original Getty Museum, housed in a replica of a Roman Villa on a site overlooking the Pacific Ocean, is one of Los Angeles's most treasured landmarks. Closed for almost ten years while renovations were made to the building and the site itself was transformed into a center for the study of antiquities and conservation, the Getty Villa is now set to open late in 2005. The Getty Villa is a lively history of the Getty Museum, its renowned antiquities collections, and its growth from a small museum in a ranch house in Malibu to its first home in a building designed to replicate what we know of the Villa dei Papiri, an ancient Roman villa partially uncovered in Herculaneum. Most engagingly, this book records the ten-year adventure in reconfiguring a beautiful, but topographically challenging, site into one that could continue to accommodate the splendid Museum building and also provide for an outdoor theater, laboratories for conservation work and research, offices for staff and visiting scholars, and an education program for adults and children. This is a story of architectural imagination, geographical challenges, and legal hurdles, all of which have resulted in a truly unique and beautiful site. The story is an enlightening and rewarding one for anyone interested in architecture and in the difficulties posed by building on a grand scale in the twenty-first century. Beautifully illustrated throughout, the book includes 250 reproductions of works of art, photographs of both the old and the new Getty Museum, site plans, and architectural elevations.",Architecture,262,N/A,0,en

Issues in Recreation and Leisure,"Donald J. McLean, Daniel G. Yoder",Human Kinetics,2005,"Learning to resolve a dilemma ethically is a complex skill that recreation leaders and managers must learn in order to be successful, because they face ethical issues every day. They must ask themselves, ""What is the right thing to do in this situation?"" ""Is my decision ethical for everyone involved?"" ""How will my decision affect each of the stakeholders--and my career?"" Teaching applied ethics requires an understanding of how moral dilemmas can be justly resolved as well as techniques and approaches to accomplish these goals. Issues in Recreation and Leisure: Ethical Decision Making guides students though this complex process of resolving real-life recreation dilemmas by presenting activities, techniques, and a field-tested three-step process. This process helps students develop sound approaches to dealing with contemporary issues in leisure and recreation. In addition, this text contains the following features: -Thematic chapters that address current major issues in recreation management, therapeutic recreation, outdoor recreation, tourism, and culture so that students can comprehend the range of issues in these diverse areas of recreation -Eight case studies based on current dilemmas from a variety of recreation and leisure settings, providing students with valuable practice in applying the three-step method for resolving ethical dilemmas -Learning activities in each chapter that help students apply leisure philosophy to resolve dilemmas Part I explores ethics in leisure services and examines how dilemmas are naturally solved. It covers ethical theory and introduces a three-step method that can be widely applied. Students learn how recreation professionals worked through an actual dilemma and how their problem-solving strategies affect their solutions and their careers. Part II presents real-life dilemmas common to a variety of leisure management areas, ethical issues in therapeutic recreation, and problems in outdoor education. The authors also tackle various issues surrounding tourism, including culture, sex tourism, the natural environment, and virtual tourism. Part III contains a consideration of professionalism in parks and recreation and related fields, a peek into the future, and eight contemporary case studies drawn from leisure services fields. These case studies test students' abilities to apply ethical problem solving by using the three-step method presented earlier in the book. The studies present issues in four major areas of recreation and leisure. Issues in Recreation and Leisure: Ethical Decision Making provides new insights into the recreation and leisure profession.

Quadrilingual Economics Dictionary,"Simon K. Kuipers, B.S. Wilpstra",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This quadrilingual economics dictionary is the result of many years of work. Professor Frits J. de J ong gathered material for this book since the very beginning of his professional career in the final years of the forties. Unfortunately, the author himself was not able to see the final result of his labours in book form. A mere few weeks after the completion of the manuscript, in November 1976, Professor De Jong passed away. As Hartog and Hennipman wrote in their memorials, Frits de Jong always devoted much attention to the development of concepts and terminology. Throughout his career, he exhibited great determination and perseverance in trying to achieve a clear and consistent terminology, and its subsequent use, in the science of economics. !' 2 That his efforts were mainly aimed at his native language was due to the fact that a language such as Dutch, which is only practiced in a small geographic area, faces the danger of a large-scale introduction of foreign words, specifically English/American, German and French words in this case. He always strongly resisted such a debasement of the Dutch language and sought instead to construct appropriate Dutch words for the existing English, German and French ones. An early example can be found in an article published in De Economist of 1950, entitled ""De economische terminologie in het Nederlands"" (The Terminology of Economics in Dutch).",Business & Economics,687,N/A,0,en

Sense of Place in Natural Resource Recreation and Tourism,Jennifer Farnum,N/A,2005,"Understanding sense of place and related concepts often presents challenges for both managers and researchers. Inconsistent application of terms, questions regarding their origin, and a lack of awareness of research findings contribute to the ambiguity of these concepts. This integrative review of research provides relevant, current information on the role of sense of place in natural-resourcebased recreation and tourism. Special focus is given to the foundations of place attachment, how place attachment may differ among user types, and the relation of place attachment to other psychological phenomena such as attitudes. The role of theory in place attachment also is addressed, and gaps in theoretical and empirical work are identified. This review provides specific recommendations for managers and others wanting to better understand the dynamics of sense of place.",Forests and forestry,68,N/A,0,en

Heartbreak: A Personal and Scientific Journey,Florence Williams,W. W. Norton & Company,2022-02-01,"Winner of the 2023 PEN/E.O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award A Five Books ""Best Literary Science Writing"" Book of 2023 • A Smithsonian Best Science Book of 2022 • A Prospect Magazine Top Memoir of 2022 • A KCRW Life Examined Best Book of 2022 ""Keen observer [and] deft writer"" (David Quammen) Florence Williams explores the fascinating, cutting-edge science of heartbreak while seeking creative ways to mend her own. When her twenty-five-year marriage suddenly falls apart, journalist Florence Williams expects the loss to hurt. But when she starts feeling physically sick, losing weight and sleep, she sets out in pursuit of rational explanation. She travels to the frontiers of the science of ""social pain"" to learn why heartbreak hurts so much—and why so much of the conventional wisdom about it is wrong. Soon Williams finds herself on a surprising path that leads her from neurogenomic research laboratories to trying MDMA in a Portland therapist’s living room, from divorce workshops to the mountains and rivers that restore her. She tests her blood for genetic markers of grief, undergoes electrical shocks while looking at pictures of her ex, and discovers that our immune cells listen to loneliness. Searching for insight as well as personal strategies to game her way back to health, she seeks out new relationships and ventures into the wilderness in search of an extraordinary antidote: awe. With warmth, daring, wit, and candor, Williams offers a gripping account of grief and healing. Heartbreak is a remarkable merging of science and self-discovery that will change the way we think about loneliness, health, and what it means to fall in and out of love.",Science,263,N/A,0,en

Impacting on Recreation and Park Legislation,Daniel D. McLean,Amer Alliance for Health Physical,1990-01-01,"This publication offers guidelines on successfully shaping political decisions concerning recreation and parks. It is divided into five sections and intended as a resource manual to be used when political action is called for. The first section deals with the overall structures and interventions which can change park and recreation policy. Section 2 tells how the various levels of government are organized to provide support to recreation and parks, and the processes which turn public opinion into public policy. A brief history and some future trends concerning federal, state, and local roles in funding recreation and parks are given. Also included is an explanation of the structure and function of the state legislatures and their relationship to state and local recreation and park policy. Section 3 provides a model for mounting a comprehensive statewide legislative campaign and suggests planning strategies and ways to involve people for successful political action. In the fourth section, techniques are outlined to educate voters and politicians. Section 5 includes questions and answers about recreation and parks, research excerpts, and support statements to help sell recreation and parks to political decision makers.

As in all the previous editions, the entrepreneurism theme is a very key orientation of this text. We view this industry as having three major components: the Travel Industry, the Hospitality Industry, and the Local Commercial Recreation Industry, and we will continue to use the term Commercial Recreation and Tourism to refer to the entire industry. The purpose of this edition remains the same as the first four editions; to provide an introduction to the scope, characteristics, management aspects, and trends of the commercial recreation and tourism industry. It is intended that the book offer a blend of conceptual and practical material to achieve a basic understanding of this huge and diverse industry. While some of the content is oriented toward large and established businesses, the text also has an entrepreneurial orientation that is particularly applicable to smaller businesses and organizations. Hopefully, many future commercial recreation and tourism entrepreneurs will gain some useful ideas in these pages. As with earlier editions, this text will avoid coverage of content that is usually included in other texts, such as recreation philosophy, leisure behavior theory, activity leadership, generic recreation programming, management theory, staff supervision, facility planning/design, legal liability, accounting principles, etc. However, we will cover several topics that have received little attention in other commercial recreation and tourism texts. These topics include entrepreneurial strategies, applied economic concepts, business start-ups, steps of the feasibility study, operations management, and several specific types of programs in commercial recreation and tourism. Finally, the content is presented in a way that parallels a logical course sequence. That is, from general to specific as explained below. The first three chapters provide an introduction to the overall commercial recreation and tourism industry including history, definitions, economic impacts, profile of the entrepreneur, entrepreneurial strategies, economic concepts, challenges and general strategies to overcome barriers. Chapters 4 through 8 present content about the initiation and management of the commercial recreation and tourism enterprise. The information is intended to have general application to the overall industry, even though there are specific differences between the diverse sub-industries. Content includes business start-up strategies, feasibility studies, financing sources, financial management, marketing, operations management, and some specific types of programming. Chapters 9 through 11 narrow the focus to the three major categories of the industry: travel, hospitality, and local commercial recreation. Each chapter examines the status, operations, trends, and opportunities in numerous specific types of industries. Another reason to hold this content until the end is to buy time to allow students to investigate these industries on their own as part of a major class project. An industry report is a good idea for a project or term paper, particularly if the student relates the text content to examples found in the students desired area of career employment. We decided to delete the 12th chapter that concluded previous texts. The reasons that we decided to do this are that we decided to include industry trends within each of the three prior chapters. We also decided that the section of the previous text that focused on academic preparation for students, was better left to the faculty members who teach the course. The authors updated much of the content, particularly the content that related to specific industry data. On the other hand, conceptual content that remains relevant, was changed little. Many new references were used for the new material. This text was developed for a variety of uses. The primary purpose is, of course, as a textbook for an introductory course in commercial recreation and tourism. The text could also function as an introduction to the overall industry for majors in travel/tourism or hotel management. Whatever the academic use, a course instructor should try to supplement the text concepts with local examples. Hopefully, the text may also be of value to investors and practitioners in specific industries who seek an overview of the entire commercial recreation and tourism industry. Although there are many separate sub-industries, it is very common for success in one industry to be related to events in another industry. For example, hotels, restaurants, and shops in a ski destination probably wont fill up if the ski mountain operation is not updated with modern high-speed lifts or snowmaking equipment to guarantee a good base for the Christmas season. Similarly, all these businesses may be very dependent on a single airline company to fly tourists in for their ski vacation. It should also be pointed out that the choice of gender nouns he or she throughout the text was made by random selections. As the commercial recreation and tourism industry matures, males and females seem to be less relegated to stereotypical roles either as staff, managers, or owners. With great enthusiasm, three new co-authors have joined our team to write this seventh edition. They are Dr. Scott Rood, Dr. Kate-Price Howard, and Dr. Andrew Holdnak. All three bring exceptional and practical knowledge about the commercial recreation and tourism industry. Finally, Dr. Lynn Jamieson has decided to retire from her many years as one of the two founding authors of this text. We will miss her great attitude, professionalism, and knowledge.",Recreation,379,N/A,0,en

Mapping Leisure,"Ishwar Modi, Teus J. Kamphorst",Springer,2018-02-06,"This volume addresses the rich and varied thoughts, concepts, approaches and leisure practices in sixteen countries of three continents---Australia, Asia and Africa. The chapters showcase the diversity in the forms and ways in which the idea and practice of leisure have developed across space and time. However, the common thread through the chapters is that concepts and practices of leisure are found all over the world, from pre-historic settlements to the present-day consumer societies. Seemingly, being at leisure is a capacity of the human species present at birth and which develops in a variety of individual and societal contexts. Even in situations where leisure gets little official recognition as being an aspect of life---such as under colonial rule or in extremely work-centric societies---it needs to be contextually understood. This is a welcome addition to the literature on leisure studies from a global and comparative perspective.",Sports & Recreation,308,N/A,0,en

Routledge Handbook of Leisure Studies,Tony Blackshaw,Taylor & Francis,2020-07-26,"This landmark publication brings together some of the most perceptive commentators of the present moment to explore core ideas and cutting edge developments in the field of Leisure Studies. It offers important new insights into the dynamics of the transformation of leisure in contemporary societies, tracing the emergent issues at stake in the discipline and examining Leisure Studies’ fundamental connections with cognate disciplines such as Sociology, Cultural Studies, History, Sport Studies and Tourism. This book contains original work from key scholars across the globe, including those working outside the Leisure Studies mainstream. It showcases the state of the art of contemporary Leisure Studies, covering key topics and key thinkers from the psychology of leisure to leisure policy, from Bourdieu to Baudrillard, and suggests that leisure in the 21st century should be understood as centring on a new ‘Big Seven’ (holidays, drink, drugs, sex, gambling, TV and shopping). No other book has gone as far in redefining the identity of the discipline of Leisure Studies, or in suggesting how the substantive ideas of Leisure Studies need to be rethought. The Routledge Handbook of Leisure Studies should therefore be the intellectual guide of first choice for all scholars, academics, researchers and students working in this subject area.",Sports & Recreation,633,N/A,0,en
"Leisure, Sport and Tourism, Politics, Policy and Planning, 4th Edition",A J Veal,CABI,2017-05-05,"The gap between theory and practice in the leisure, sport and tourism studies areas seems to have widened as scholars have become more specialized. Nevertheless, it is imperative that students be as familiar as possible with a wide range of social and political theory, and also be able to reconcile that knowledge with their own current and future roles as practicing professionals. As well as extensive updating of sources, this new edition examines such topics as libertarianism, theocracy, anti-establishment politics, and the concept of generations. A new chapter presents discussions of a number of 'issues and challenges' facing the leisure, sport and tourism sector. Introducing the subject for undergraduate and postgraduate students of leisure, sport and tourism, this book is also a useful addition to the shelf of any policy maker or practitioner within the industries.",Business & Economics,441,N/A,0,en

Torkildsen's Sport and Leisure Management,"Rob Wilson, Chris Platts, Daniel Plumley",Taylor & Francis,2022-11-01,"For nearly 40 years Torkildsen’s Sport and Leisure Management has been the most comprehensive and engaging introduction to sport and leisure management available to students at all levels. Now in its seventh edition, it is still the only textbook that covers all the key topics taught within contemporary sport and leisure management courses. This new edition includes expanded coverage of the practical managerial skills that students must develop if aiming for a career in the sport and leisure industry, from planning and managing people to marketing, entrepreneurship, and the law. It includes four completely new chapters on the global sport and leisure economy, historical development, cross-sector collaboration, and management consultancy, reflecting important developments in contemporary sport and leisure. This edition retains the hallmark strengths of previous editions, including in-depth discussion of the social and cultural context of sport and leisure; full analysis of the public, private, and voluntary sectors; and a review of key products and services. Richly illustrated throughout with up-to-date evidence, data, case-studies, and international examples, each chapter also contains a range of useful pedagogical features, such as discussion questions, practical tasks, and structured guides to further reading and resources. This is an important resource for students working in fields such as sport management, sport business, sport development, leisure management, and events management.

How Boston Played,Stephen Hardy,Univ. of Tennessee Press,2003,"""Whether consciously molding the city through the construction of public spaces or developing social ties through organizations such as athletic clubs, Bostonians of all classes participated in recreation-based community building, often at cross-purposes. Elite Bostonians, for instance, promoted the establishment of parks as a healthy alternative to unsavory activities, such as drinking and gambling, that they associated with the city's vast new pool of immigrants. They were soon forced to compromise, however, with citizens who were less interested in the rhetoric of moral uplift than in using the parks for competitive athletics and commercial amusements.""--BOOK JACKET.",History,316,N/A,0,en

United States Code: Title 16: Conservation [sections] 344-856,,N/A,2013,"Preface 2012 edition: The United States Code is the official codification of the general and permanent laws of the United States. The Code was first published in 1926, and a new edition of the code has been published every six years since 1934. The 2012 edition of the Code incorporates laws enacted through the One Hundred Twelfth Congress, Second session, the last of which was signed by the President on January 15, 2013. It does not include laws of the One Hundred Thirteenth Congress, First session, enacted between January 3, 2013, the date it convened, and January 15, 2013. By statutory authority this edition may be cited ""U.S.C. 2012 ed."" As adopted in 1926, the Code established prima facie the general and permanent laws of the United States. The underlying statutes reprinted in the Code remained in effect and controlled over the Code in case of any discrepancy. In 1947, Congress began enacting individual titles of the Code into positive law. When a title is enacted into positive law, the underlying statutes are repealed and the title then becomes legal evidence of the law. Currently, 26 of the 51 titles in the Code have been so enacted. These are identified in the table of titles near the beginning of each volume. The Law Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives continues to prepare legislation pursuant to 2 USC 285b to enact the remainder of the Code, on a title-by-title basis, into positive law. The 2012 edition of the Code was prepared and published under the supervision of Ralph V. Seep, Law Revision Counsel. Grateful acknowledgment is made of the contributions by all who helped in this work, particularly the staffs of the Office of the Law Revision Counsel and the Government Printing Office. -- John. A.

Kerry Smith's papers prepared over 25 years dealing with the theory and practice of non-market valuation for environmental resources. Taken together, the papers explore the conceptual basis, the implementation process and empirical performance of all available methods of measuring economic values for the services of nature and how these values are constructed from people's choices. The issues discussed in this volume include travel cost recreation demand, averting behaviour, household production, hedonic property value, hedonic wage and contingent valuation methods. These essays describe what has been learned from past benefit analysis, using meta-analysis, as well as the issues at the frontier of current research in the area.

Diversity and Inclusion in the Recreation Profession,"Ingrid Eleanore Schneider, B. Dana Kivel",N/A,2016,"As North America continues to diversify in its population, inclusion is more important than ever. In this important book, the authors explore, document, and delve into the construct of diversity within the context of managing and providing recreation and leisure-related services. Using multiple perspectives and comprehensive research, the authors provide (1) an analysis and critique of the current state of knowledge about diversity issues within the PRTM fields (parks, recreation, and tourism management); (2) a forum for scholars and recreation professionals to share best practices and their own experiences in PRTM organisations related to diversity in scholarship and practice, including public, private, and non-profit agencies; and (3) opportunities to explore strategies for addressing diversity and strategies toward structural changes within organisations. Specifically, the authors illuminate how markers of diversity influence the issues and problems perceived and/or experienced by diverse groups; the nature and types of institutional barriers often unwittingly created by organisational professionals in their response, or lack thereof, to diverse populations; and transformational opportunities, both individual and organisational, that result through enhanced commitment to organisational diversity and inclusion.",Leisure industry,225,N/A,0,en

The applicability of indicator systems for natural resource and natural resource area management within the parks and recreation arena is very high, including urban parks and recreation programs and their influence on quality of life. Tourism is also an area that needs much more work in terms of assessing impacts as well as developing indicators for gauging progress in the long term.

Therapeutic Recreation,"Marcia Jean Carter, Glen E. Van Andel",N/A,2019-06-12,"For over 35 years, Therapeutic Recreation: A Practical Approach has provided an authoritative and engaging introduction to the field of therapeutic recreation. The Fifth Edition of Carter and Van Andel's well-regarded text extends this tradition of excellence, equipping a new generation of students with the theoretical foundations and practical methods they need to become successful practitioners.The authors present the fundamentals of recreational therapy practice from the perspective of a 21st-century health and human service profession: emphasizing evidenced-based practices and documented outcomes, supporting individual and community assets, promoting fiscal responsibility, and utilizing a strengths-based approach that focuses on an individual's capacities when developing a strategy to improve health status, quality of life, and functional abilities.Updates throughout reflect recent scholarship, revised standards and operational definitions, evidence-based literature to support interventions, and global health concerns. The critical component of documentation has been added to discussions of the APIE-D process, while chapters on neurodevelopmental disorders and behavioral and mental health issues incorporate the terminology and organization of the DSM-5. The latest edition also features expanded treatment of social issues and the adult-onset, chronic, and lifelong illnesses and disabilities associated with aging.This full-featured edition retains the student-oriented approach that makes it an ideal text for introductory courses. Illustrations, case studies, key terms, study questions, and practical exercises reinforce key concepts and offer opportunities to apply chapter content, while abundant field-based photographs illuminate the practice of recreational therapy.",Recreation,0,N/A,0,en

Leisure Management,"Ian Cooper, Michael Frank Collins",Cabi,1998,"The World Leisure and Recreation Association (WLRA) held its fourth World Congress in Cardiff, Wales, in July 1996. The overall theme was ""Leisure and the Quality of Life In the 21st Century"". At the congress, the Management Commission, the newest of WLRA's Commissions, attracted 78 papers in the management and access theme, from 16 countries. This book presents edited and revised versions of 18 of the most significant papers from the management section of the congress. The papers are diverse in topic, focus and geography, but demonstrate the vigor and developing nature of management studies in leisure, both of an applied and theoretical nature. Two themes in particular are developed: issues, such as access to leisure services, pressures of visitor numbers on rural areas, and contracting out of services to the private sector; and applications of different theories and approaches to managing leisure resources and customers. Case study material is presented from locations as diverse as Australia, Brazil, Canada, Spain and the UK. Overall, the book will be invaluable as supplementary reading for students of leisure studies and for lecturers, researchers and practitioners in leisure management.",Business & Economics,344,N/A,0,en

Strangers in the Land of Paradise,Lillian Serece Williams,Indiana University Press,2000-07-22,"Now in paperback! Strangers in the Land of Paradise The Creation of an African American Community, Buffalo, NY, 1900–1940 Lillian Serece Williams Examines the settlement of African Americans in Buffalo during the Great Migration. ""A splendid contribution to the fields of African-American and American urban, social and family history. . . . expanding the tradition that is now well underway of refuting the pathological emphasis of the prevailing ghetto studies of the 1960s and '70s."" —Joe W. Trotter Strangers in the Land of Paradise discusses the creation of an African American community as a distinct cultural entity. It describes values and institutions that Black migrants from the South brought with them, as well as those that evolved as a result of their interaction with Blacks native to the city and the city itself. Through an examination of work, family, community organizations, and political actions, Lillian Williams explores the process by which the migrants adapted to their new environment. The lives of African Americans in Buffalo from 1900 to 1940 reveal much about race, class, and gender in the development of urban communities. Black migrant workers transformed the landscape by their mere presence, but for the most part they could not rise beyond the lowest entry-level positions. For African American women, the occupational structure was even more restricted; eventually, however, both men and women increased their earning power, and that—over time—improved life for both them and their loved ones. Lillian Serece Williams is Associate Professor of History in the Women's Studies Department and Director of the Institute for Research on Women at Albany, the State University of New York. She is editor of Records of the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs, 1895–1992, associate editor of Black Women in United States History, and author of A Bridge to the Future: The History of Diversity in Girl Scouting. 352 pages, 14 b&w illus., 15 maps, notes, bibl., index, 6 1/8 x 9 1/4 Blacks in the Diaspora—Darlene Clark Hine, John McCluskey, Jr., and David Barry Gaspar, general editors",History,300,N/A,0,en

Human Resource Management in Sport and Recreation,"Packianathan Chelladurai, Shannon Kerwin",Human Kinetics,2018-10-30,"Human Resource Management in Sport and Recreation, Third Edition, provides current and future practitioners with a solid foundation in research and application of human resource management in the sport and recreation industries. The third edition prepares students for success by bringing into focus the three divergent groups of people who constitute human resources in sport and recreation organizations: paid professional workers, volunteers, and the clients themselves. Dr. Packianathan Chelladurai, pioneer in the field of sport management, continues to bring his expertise to this edition; he is joined by new coauthor Dr. Shannon Kerwin, an active researcher in organizational behavior and human resource management in sport. With more than 50 collective years of experience in teaching management of human resources, Chelladurai and Kerwin synthesize the core dynamics of human resources and the management of these resources as well as the role of the sport and recreation manager. The third edition’s updated references, examples, and studies reflect the increased growth, interest, and complexity in human resource management in recreation and sport in recent years. Additional enhancements of the third edition include the following: • A new opening chapter on the significance of human resources describes consumer services, professional services, and human services and provides a model for the subsequent chapters. • A greater emphasis is placed on recruitment and training as an essential component of success. • New “Technology in Human Resource Management” and “Diversity Management of Human Resources” sidebars connect theory to practice for sport managers as they confront contemporary issues in the workplace. • Case studies at the end of each chapter help students apply concepts from the chapter to real-world scenarios. • Instructor ancillaries help instructors prepare for class with the use of an instructor guide with a syllabus, tips for teaching, and additional resources, as well as an image bank. In addition, updated pedagogical aids include learning objectives, summaries, lists of key terms, comprehension questions, and discussion questions to guide student learning through each chapter. Sidebars throughout the text provide applied concepts, highlight relevant research, and offer digestible takeaways. Organized into four parts, the text begins by outlining the unique and common characteristics of the three groups of human resources in sport and recreation. Part II focuses on differences in people and how the differences affect behavior in sport and recreation organizations. In part III, readers explore significant organizational processes in the management of human resources. Part IV discusses two significant outcomes expected of human resource practices: satisfaction and commitment. Finally, a conclusion synthesizes information and presents a set of founding and guiding themes. Human Resource Management in Sport and Recreation, Third Edition, explains essential concepts in human resources in the sport and recreation industries. The authors present a clear and concise treatise on the critical aspects of management of human resources within sport and recreational organizations to help aspiring and current professionals maximize their potential in the field.",Business & Economics,408,N/A,0,en

Everything Is Horrible and Wonderful,Stephanie Wittels Wachs,"Sourcebooks, Inc.",2018-02-26,"In the style of The Recovering, and Educated: A Memoir, Stephanie Wittels Wachs delves into the dark world of loss, grief, and addiction in a heartbreaking but hopeful memoir With a captivating foreward by Aziz Ansari One phone call was all it took to change Stephanie Wittels Wachs's life forever... Her younger brother, Harris, a comedy star known for his work on Parks and Recreation and for introducing the world to the art of the humblebrag, died of a heroin overdose. How do you make sense of such a tragic end to a life full of so much hilarious brilliance? In beautiful, unsentimental, and surprisingly funny prose, Stephanie Wittels Wachs alternates between her brother's struggle with addiction, which she learned about three days before her wedding, and the first year after his death, in all its emotional devastation. This compelling portrait of a comedic genius and a profound exploration of the love between siblings is A Year of Magical Thinking for a new generation of readers. Everything is Horrible and Wonderful will make you laugh, cry, and wonder if that possum on the fence is really your brother's spirit animal.

The Discipline Of Leisure,"Simon Coleman, Tamara Kohn",Berghahn Books,2013-01-15,"The burgeoning social scientific study of tourism has emphasized the effects of the post-industrial economy on travel and place. However, this volume takes some of these issues into a different area of leisure: the spare-time carved out by people as part of their everyday lives - time that is much more intimately juxtaposed with the pressures and influences of work life, and which often involves specific bodily practices associated with hobbies and sports. An important focus of the book is the body as a site of identity formation, experience, and disciplined recreation of the self. Contributors examine the ways rituals, sports, and forms of bodily transformation mediate between contemporary ideologies of freedom, choice and self-control.",Social Science,210,N/A,0,en

An Assessment of Frameworks Useful for Public Land Recreation Planning,Stephen F. McCool,N/A,2007,"Public land managers are confronted with an ever-growing and diversifying set of demands for providing recreation opportunities. Coupled with a variety of trends (devolution of governance and decisionmaking, population growth, technological innovation, shifts in public values, economic restructuring) and reduced organizational capacity, these demands represent a significant and complex challenge to public land management. One way of dealing with this situation is to use a framework to assist in working through this complexity. A framework, for the purpose of this report, is a process using a set of steps, based on sound science, that assists managers in framing a particular problem, working through it, and arriving at a set of defendable decisions. Several such frameworks exist for providing recreation opportunities on public lands. These include the Recreation Opportunity Spectrum, Limits of Acceptable Change, Visitor Experience and Resource Protection, Visitor Impact Management, and Benefits-Based Management. The report traces the development of each of these frameworks, describes the fundamental premises and concepts used within them, and provides an assessment of the experience with their use. Each of the frameworks has been used with varying success, depending on the organizations will, its technical capacity, the extent to which the process is inclusive of varying value systems, how open and deliberative the process is, the extent to which the organization is concerned with effectiveness, and the extent to which issues are confronted at the systems level.",Outdoor recreation,136,N/A,0,en

Whatever Happened to the Good Life?,Earle F Zeigler,N/A,2002-11-27,"This book asks whatever happened to the good life? While answering this provocative question, you will find an opportunity to determine your own RQ or recreational quotient based on involvement (or lack of) in a broad spectrum of recreational pursuits. After seeing where you score personally, you can take the necessary steps - if you wish - to raise your RQ Why should this question concern you? It should because in modern society people are increasingly crowded together in heavily populated urban and suburban communities. This has created a serious problem. We now need to know how people can find happiness, satisfaction, and a high quality of life despite the increased tempo of living often amidst badly crowded conditions? Your leisure-time involvement is insightfully related here to society's development. North Americans have been accused of being afflicted with spectatoritis (i.e. spending too much of their free time watching others taking part in some form of activity, recreational or otherwise).

Overwhelmed,Brigid Schulte,A&C Black,2014-03-13,"______________________ 'Too much to do? Stop and read this' - Guardian 'For a fresh take on an eternal dilemma, Overwhelmed is worth a few hours of any busy woman's life – if only to ensure that she doesn't drop off the bottom of her own “To Do” list' - Mail on Sunday ______________________ In her attempts to juggle work and family life, Brigid Schulte has baked cakes until 2 a.m., frantically (but surreptitiously) sent important emails during school trips and then worked long into the night after her children were in bed. Realising she had become someone who constantly burst in late, trailing shoes and schoolbooks and biscuit crumbs, she began to question, like so many of us, whether it is possible to be anything you want to be, have a family and still have time to breathe. So when Schulte met an eminent sociologist who studies time and he told her she enjoyed thirty hours of leisure each week, she thought her head was going to pop off. What followed was a trip down the rabbit hole of busy-ness, a journey to discover why so many of us find it near-impossible to press the 'pause' button on life and what got us here in the first place. Overwhelmed maps the individual, historical, biological and societal stresses that have ripped working mothers' and fathers' leisure to shreds, and asks how it might be possible for us to put the pieces back together. Seeking insights, answers and inspiration, Schulte explores everything from the wiring of the brain and why workplaces are becoming increasingly demanding, to worldwide differences in family policy, how cultural norms shape our experiences at work, our unequal division of labour at home and why it's so hard for everyone – but women especially – to feel they deserve an elusive moment of peace. ______________________ 'Every parent, every caregiver, every person who feels besieged by permanent busyness, must read this book' - Anne-Marie Slaughter, author of Why Women Still Can't Have It All",Biography & Autobiography,398,N/A,0,en

Outdoor Recreation,Charles I. Zinser,John Wiley & Sons,1995-08-11,"Perhaps no other nation on earth devotes as large a portion of its public lands to recreational use as the United States. And while millions of Americans flock to our national parks, forests, and other public lands each year, these areas are also major attractions for international visitors and an important source of foreign exchange. The allocation, location, planning, and management of public lands for recreational use is now a major activity within each of the nation's four major land-managing agencies, and in several smaller departments as well. This book presents an overview of the vast and diverse federal recreation system, its historical evolution, methods of management and development, and the different roles played by the National Park Service, the Forest Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management. It explores concepts in land-use planning, examines relevant federal legislation, and presents federal concepts for preserving amenity resources. Rather than make an exhaustive presentation of current facilities and recreational opportunities, author Charles Zinser uses a case study approach to illustrate and analyze programs and development principles found in each of the major agencies. More than 300 tables, maps, and illustrations supplement the text. An entire chapter is devoted to the recreational resources of smaller federal agencies, including the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Tennessee Valley Authority, all of which permit various forms of water-related recreation on reservoirs under their control. Many people are surprised to learn that, in terms of recreational use, the Army Corps of Engineers is the number-two federal agency. Packed with helpful, practical, and authoritative information, Outdoor Recreation is a one-stop source on the availability, development, and management of recreational resources within the federal system. It is a first-rate reference for anyone involved in forestry, geography, wildland or watershed management, land-use planning and development, or creating recreational facilities. It is also an ideal textbook for courses in geography and recreational use of public lands. The most complete guide available to the federal recreation system The system of federal lands devoted to outdoor recreation is as diverse bureaucratically as it is geographically. At least eight federal agencies administer recreational resources from mountain to seashore, from desert to glacier, in virtually every state and territory of the nation. This one-stop sourcebook offers complete information on the acquisition, development, management, and protection of these resources, including: Extensive coverage of recreational resources administered by federal land-managing agencies that control one fourth of our national territory A review of the basic concepts of land-use planning An examination of the federal legislation that created current programs and facilities Numerous maps, statistical tables, and illustrations not available from any other source Case studies that illustrate the practical impact of federal policies and concepts Examples of federal plans for protecting these resources, including: the National Wilderness Preservation System, National Trails System, and the National Wild and Scenic River System",Law,940,N/A,0,en

The Value of Recreational Sports in Higher Education,National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association (U.S.),Human Kinetics Publishers,2004,"What attracts students to a college--academics? recreational sports? the campus recreation center? If you selected all three answers, you are right. Most students choose a college or university for its academic merits, but another key factor in their decision is the recreational sports programs and facilities. Recreational sports are an important component to students' quality of life on campus and to a college's recruitment and retention of students. The National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association contracted Kerr-Downs Research Associates to conduct a nationwide research project to determine the value of recreational sport on college campuses. More than 2,600 students from 16 colleges participated in this study, making it the largest representative group of college students from multiple colleges ever studied with respect to the value of participation in recreational sports. This study examined the value and contributions of recreational sports to participants' lives and documented the buying power of participants in recreational sports. The first of its kind in research, The Value of Recreational Sports in Higher Education makes a strong the case for campus recreational sports programs and facilities that will support the mission of your college into the future.",Education,228,N/A,0,en

Dimensions of Leisure for Life,Human Kinetics,Human Kinetics,2010,"""Leisure is everywhere, but its impact on people's lives is often overlooked. Leisure is more than “doing nothing” or “hanging out.” It has implications for society, affecting economics, politics, business, health, and the environment. On an individual level, it offers multiple opportunities for personal growth and development. And it contributes to a better quality of life for individuals and communities as a whole. With Dimensions of Leisure for Life: Individuals and Society, students will learn to understand and appreciate leisure and explore the ways that their leisure choices can help them lead happier, more balanced lives both now and in the future. ... With contributions from 22 leading professors, the book examines the following: the concept of leisure, including the various ways in which it has been defined and described, the benefits associated with it, the scope of the leisure industry field, and the basis for studying leisure as a social science; the impact of leisure on quality of life, health, physical activity and stress levels, and overall happiness and well-being; the social significance of leisure, including the interaction of leisure with history, contemporary society, technology, the environment, economics, and politics and public policy; the factors that influence each individual's leisure choices and level of involvement in leisure activities, such as awareness of local options, barriers of age, gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, religion, or socioeconomic status, geographic distribution of leisure spaces; and maturity level and stage of development.""--Publisher.",Health & Fitness,386,2.5,2,en

Nazis of Copley Square,Charles Gallagher,Harvard University Press,2021-09-28,"Winner of a Catholic Media Association Book Award The forgotten history of American terrorists who, in the name of God, conspired to overthrow the government and formed an alliance with Hitler. On January 13, 1940, FBI agents burst into the homes and offices of seventeen members of the Christian Front, seizing guns, ammunition, and homemade bombs. J. Edgar Hoover’s charges were incendiary: the group, he alleged, was planning to incite a revolution and install a “temporary dictatorship” in order to stamp out Jewish and Communist influence in the United States. Interviewed in his jail cell, the front’s ringleader was unbowed: “All I can say is—long live Christ the King! Down with Communism!” In Nazis of Copley Square, Charles Gallagher provides a crucial missing chapter in the history of the American far right. The men of the Christian Front imagined themselves as crusaders fighting for the spiritual purification of the nation, under assault from godless Communism, and they were hardly alone in their beliefs. The front traced its origins to vibrant global Catholic theological movements of the early twentieth century, such as the Mystical Body of Christ and Catholic Action. The front’s anti-Semitism was inspired by Sunday sermons and by lay leaders openly espousing fascist and Nazi beliefs. Gallagher chronicles the evolution of the front, the transatlantic cloak-and-dagger intelligence operations that subverted it, and the mainstream political and religious leaders who shielded the front’s activities from scrutiny. Nazis of Copley Square is a grim tale of faith perverted to violent ends, and a warning for those who hope to curb the spread of far-right ideologies today.",History,337,N/A,0,en

Introduction to Forestry and Natural Resources,"Donald L. Grebner, Pete Bettinger, Jacek P. Siry, Kevin Boston",Academic Press,2021-01-19,"Introduction to Forestry and Natural Resources, Second Edition, presents a broad, completely updated overview of the profession of forestry. The book details several key fields within forestry, including forest management, economics, policy, utilization and forestry careers. Chapters deal specifically with forest regions of the world, landowners, forest products, wildlife habitats, tree anatomy and physiology, and forest disturbances and health. These topics are ideal for undergraduate introductory courses and include numerous examples and questions for students to ponder. There is also a section dedicated to forestry careers. Unlike other introductory forestry texts, which focus largely on forest ecology rather than practical forestry concepts, this book encompasses the economic, ecological and social aspects, thus providing a uniquely balanced text. The wide range of experience of the contributing authors equips them especially well to identify missing content from other texts in the area and address topics currently covered in corresponding college courses. - Covers the application of forestry and natural resources around the world with a focus on practical applications and graphical examples - Describes basic techniques for measuring and evaluating forest resources and natural resources, including fundamental terminology and concepts - Includes management policies and their influence at the local, national and international levels",Technology & Engineering,513,N/A,0,en

DeGraaf",Venture Publishing (PA),1999,"Meeting the needs of customers through effective recreation programs is imperative for leisure service organizations to survive and prosper in the twenty-first century. The authors of this book break new ground for recreation programming by interpreting it within the servant leadership approach. Servant leadership is based on the premise that all recreation providers serve their customers through programs. The servant leadership approach simultaneously enhances the personal growth of workers and improves the quality and caring of our many institutions through a combination of teamwork and community, personal involvement in decision making, and ethical and caring behavior. Whether a leisure services professional works for a municipal recreation department providing recreational sports leagues for adults, or for a nonprofit organization providing special events, or as a commercial tour operator offering wilderness backpacking trips, Programming for Parks, Recreation, and Leisure Services: A Servant Leadership Approach provides both cutting-edge concepts and practical knowledge for successful programming.",Leisure industry,0,N/A,0,en

Lake Mead National Recreation Area,Jonathan Foster,University of Nevada Press,2016-08-02,"This book examines the creation, characteristics, and tribulations of the first United States National Recreation Area. It also addresses the National Park Service’s historic role in managing reservoir-based recreation in a uniquely arid region. First named the Boulder Dam Recreation Area, this parkland was created in 1936 by a memorandum of agreement between the National Park Service and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. Over the course of its existence, the area has served as a model for a subsequent system of National Recreation Areas. The area’s extreme popularity has, in combination with changing public attitudes regarding preservation and safety, presented the National Park Service with tremendous challenges in recent decades. Jonathan Foster’s examination of these challenges and the responses to them reveal an increasingly anxious relationship between the government, the public, and special interest groups in the American West.",Travel,162,N/A,0,en

Outdoor Recreation,Charles I. Zinser,John Wiley & Sons,1995-08-11,"Perhaps no other nation on earth devotes as large a portion of its public lands to recreational use as the United States. And while millions of Americans flock to our national parks, forests, and other public lands each year, these areas are also major attractions for international visitors and an important source of foreign exchange. The allocation, location, planning, and management of public lands for recreational use is now a major activity within each of the nation's four major land-managing agencies, and in several smaller departments as well. This book presents an overview of the vast and diverse federal recreation system, its historical evolution, methods of management and development, and the different roles played by the National Park Service, the Forest Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management. It explores concepts in land-use planning, examines relevant federal legislation, and presents federal concepts for preserving amenity resources. Rather than make an exhaustive presentation of current facilities and recreational opportunities, author Charles Zinser uses a case study approach to illustrate and analyze programs and development principles found in each of the major agencies. More than 300 tables, maps, and illustrations supplement the text. An entire chapter is devoted to the recreational resources of smaller federal agencies, including the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Tennessee Valley Authority, all of which permit various forms of water-related recreation on reservoirs under their control. Many people are surprised to learn that, in terms of recreational use, the Army Corps of Engineers is the number-two federal agency. Packed with helpful, practical, and authoritative information, Outdoor Recreation is a one-stop source on the availability, development, and management of recreational resources within the federal system. It is a first-rate reference for anyone involved in forestry, geography, wildland or watershed management, land-use planning and development, or creating recreational facilities. It is also an ideal textbook for courses in geography and recreational use of public lands. The most complete guide available to the federal recreation system The system of federal lands devoted to outdoor recreation is as diverse bureaucratically as it is geographically. At least eight federal agencies administer recreational resources from mountain to seashore, from desert to glacier, in virtually every state and territory of the nation. This one-stop sourcebook offers complete information on the acquisition, development, management, and protection of these resources, including: Extensive coverage of recreational resources administered by federal land-managing agencies that control one fourth of our national territory A review of the basic concepts of land-use planning An examination of the federal legislation that created current programs and facilities Numerous maps, statistical tables, and illustrations not available from any other source Case studies that illustrate the practical impact of federal policies and concepts Examples of federal plans for protecting these resources, including: the National Wilderness Preservation System, National Trails System, and the National Wild and Scenic River System",Law,936,N/A,0,en

"Race, Riots, and Roller Coasters",Victoria W. Wolcott,University of Pennsylvania Press,2012-08-16,"Throughout the twentieth century, African Americans challenged segregation at amusement parks, swimming pools, and skating rinks not only in pursuit of pleasure but as part of a wider struggle for racial equality. Well before the Montgomery bus boycott, mothers led their children into segregated amusement parks, teenagers congregated at forbidden swimming pools, and church groups picnicked at white-only parks. But too often white mobs attacked those who dared to transgress racial norms. In Race, Riots, and Roller Coasters, Victoria W. Wolcott tells the story of this battle for access to leisure space in cities all over the United States. Contradicting the nostalgic image of urban leisure venues as democratic spaces, Wolcott reveals that racial segregation was crucial to their appeal. Parks, pools, and playgrounds offered city dwellers room to exercise, relax, and escape urban cares. These gathering spots also gave young people the opportunity to mingle, flirt, and dance. As cities grew more diverse, these social forms of fun prompted white insistence on racially exclusive recreation. Wolcott shows how black activists and ordinary people fought such infringements on their right to access public leisure. In the face of violence and intimidation, they swam at white-only beaches, boycotted discriminatory roller rinks, and picketed Jim Crow amusement parks. When African Americans demanded inclusive public recreational facilities, white consumers abandoned those places. Many parks closed or privatized within a decade of desegregation. Wolcott's book tracks the decline of the urban amusement park and the simultaneous rise of the suburban theme park, reframing these shifts within the civil rights context. Filled with detailed accounts and powerful insights, Race, Riots, and Roller Coasters brings to light overlooked aspects of conflicts over public accommodations. This eloquent history demonstrates the significance of leisure in American race relations.",History,320,N/A,0,en

The Code was first published in 1926, and a new edition of the code has been published every six years since 1934. The 2012 edition of the Code incorporates laws enacted through the One Hundred Twelfth Congress, Second Session, the last of which was signed by the President on January 15, 2013. It does not include laws of the One Hundred Thirteenth Congress, First Session, enacted between January 2, 2013, the date it convened, and January 15, 2013. By statutory authority this edition may be cited ""U.S.C. 2012 ed."" As adopted in 1926, the Code established prima facie the general and permanent laws of the United States. The underlying statutes reprinted in the Code remained in effect and controlled over the Code in case of any discrepancy. In 1947, Congress began enacting individual titles of the Code into positive law. When a title is enacted into positive law, the underlying statutes are repealed and the title then becomes legal evidence of the law. Currently, 26 of the 51 titles in the Code have been so enacted. These are identified in the table of titles near the beginning of each volume. The Law Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives continues to prepare legislation pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 285b to enact the remainder of the Code, on a title-by-title basis, into positive law. The 2012 edition of the Code was prepared and published under the supervision of Ralph V. Seep, Law Revision Counsel.

We look in astonishment and horror at such things as the judging debacle in the pairs figure-skating event at the 2002 Olympic Winter Games, the not-too-distant future possibility of genetically modified athletes, the bribe taking by members of the IOC, the widespread steroid use by athletes, the child sex-abuse cases in hockey, the acceptance of physical assault and violence, the hooligans among British soccer fans, and the drug abusers at the Tour de France. This revised and expanded edition is designed to provide an analytical framework for readers to explore and understand the ethical issues and controversies in sport today. Included for discussion purposes are topical case studies from the world of sport and recreation.""--Publisher's website.",Philosophy,0,N/A,0,en

Patterns from the Golden Age of Rustic Design,Albert H. Good,Roberts Rinehart,2003-02-25,"Containing over 1200 photographs and detailed line drawings from which one can design and build directly, Patterns from the Golden Age of Rustic Design is a valuable reference for preservationists, historians, designers, and homeowners. Albert Good provided plans for the construction of cabins, lodges, hotels, fireplaces, boat houses, furniture, fixtures, and more. Initially developed as a teaching tool for designers in the 1930s, this book is for anyone who has a desire to duplicate the classic, rustic structures commonly found in state and national parks. The designs extend to the use of stone in New England and the proliferation of the pueblo and mission styles in the southwest, as well as structures made of logs and mortar. In this informative treasure of a design book, you will find that the author reached his principal goal to present structures that ""appear to belong and be a part of their settings.""",Architecture,628,N/A,0,en

The Color of Culture,Daniel H. Krymkowski,Rowman & Littlefield,2021-01-15,"Utilizing written sources as well as nationally representative survey data, Daniel H. Krymkowski analyzes the extent and causes of African American underrepresentation in the cultural realms of golf, hiking, hunting and fishing, water sports, winter sports, classical music, painting and sculpture, ballet, and the theater. African American participation significantly lags behind that of non-Hispanic whites in all of these areas, and it is not due to an aversion to these types of activities. Rather, as Krymkowski shows, its primary sources are racial-ethnic socioeconomic differences, as well as historic and contemporary discrimination, both overt and subtle. These causes are rooted in the systemic racism that continues to plague the United States. The lack of opportunity to participate in such cultural forms deprives African Americans of aesthetic experiences that are central to the human condition, and it has implications for both health and the accumulation of cultural and social capital. Krymkowski also explores current efforts to increase African American representation in these areas of culture and discusses the benefits of doing so.",Social Science,207,N/A,0,en

Subduing Satan,Ted Ownby,UNC Press Books,2014-02-01,"The Praying South and the Fighting South are two of our most popular images of white southern culture. In Subduing Satan, Ted Ownby details the tensions between these complex--and often opposing--attitudes. ""Ownby's re-creation of male recreation is rich and fascinating. He paints the saloon and the street, the cockfighting and dogfighting rings as realms of distinctly male vices, enjoyed lustily by men seeking to escape the sweet virtue of the Southern Christian home.--Nation ""A bold new thesis. . . . [Ownby] gives us guideposts in the ongoing search for the meaning of southern history.--Journal of Southern History ""I suspect that for many years ahead Ted Ownby's Subduing Satan will serve as the standard guide on how to write religious social history.--Bertram Wyatt-Brown, University of Florida ""This is one of the freshest and most interesting books written about the American South in years.

Humblebrag,Harris Wittels,N/A,2014-07-01,"From comedian and writer (Parks and Recreation, Eastbound & Down) Harris Wittels comes a hysterical breakdown of boasts, brags, and self-adulation disguised as humble comments and complaints-based on his popular @humblebrag Twitter feed. Something immediately annoyed Harris Wittels about Twitter. All of a sudden it was acceptable to brag, so long as those brags were ever-so-thinly disguised as transparent humility, such as: ""Just filed my taxes. Biggie was right, mo money mo problems."" ""I hate when I go into a store to get something to eat and the male staff are too busy hitting on me to get my order right :( so annoying!"" Taking action by naming this phenomenon and creating the Twitter account called Humblebrag-dedicated solely to retweeting the humblebrags of others-Wittels's new word took the Internet by storm. Harris also shows readers what humblebrags might look like from some of history's most notable names, as well as devoting an entire chapter to a man who just might be the greatest humblebraggart of them all...",HUMOR,138,N/A,0,en

Sensory Stories for Children and Teens with Special Educational Needs,Joanna Grace,Jessica Kingsley Publishers,2014-10-21,"Sensory Stories are short stories of a few lines which are brought to life through a selection of meaningful sensory experiences. They are particularly beneficial for students with Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD), profound and multiple learning difficulties (PMLD), autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and other special educational needs (SEN). For children with PMLD, Sensory Stories can open up new avenues for communication and inclusive learning. For students with SPD and ASD, they offer a fun way of encountering sensory experiences and triggers in a safe, repetitive way, which over time can help to reduce associated anxieties. This accessible guide offers teachers, other professionals working with students with SEN and parents with a complete step-by-step guide to creating and using Sensory Stories effectively. Aiming to make Sensory Stories affordable and accessible to schools and parents alike by using everyday items found in the classroom and home, Joanna Grace provides original, ready-to-use Sensory Stories with accompanying lesson plans, games and activities and adaptations for different abilities and diagnoses. Written by an experienced SEN consultant and sensory learning specialist, this is unique and essential reading for teachers, other professionals and parents wishing to introduce the many benefits of multi-sensory storytelling to children in their care.",Education,250,N/A,0,en

The Broadview Anthology of Tudor Drama,Alan Stewart,Broadview Press,2021-02-19,"English drama between the late fifteenth century and the late sixteenth centuries is as diverse as it is engaging; this anthology brings together eighteen of the most interesting and important dramatic works from the period. The plays have been chosen to give a broad view of the drama produced in Tudor England. They testify to the eclectic tastes of sixteenth-century audiences, ranging from morality plays (Mankind, Everyman), to comedies inspired by the Roman plays of Terence and Plautus (Ralph Roister Doister), to tragedies inspired by the plays of Seneca (Gorboduc, Cambises). In later plays, morality plots rub shoulders with slapstick comic business (The Longer Thou Livest The More Fool Thou Art, The Three Ladies of London), and classical gods intervene in the affairs of England’s regions (Gallathea). While some of the plays offer pure entertainment, others have a clear political agenda. King Johan is presented as a prototype for English resistance to Rome’s Catholicism; Gorboduc’s decision to abdicate and divide his kingdom highlights the vexed question of the English succession under a childless queen. Other plays comment more obliquely on contemporary events. Play of the Four Elements reflects on England’s nascent maritime expeditions to the New World, while The Three Ladies of London comments topically on immigrant overcrowding in England’s port towns, and the dangers of England’s trade in the Mediterranean. Some plays push the boundaries of what the theatre can do in staging violence (Cambises) and questioning gender roles (Gallathea). Designed for undergraduate use, the anthology includes extensive explanatory annotations and a substantial introduction to each play; spelling and punctuation have been partially modernized in the interests of making the texts more accessible to students. In all this, the anthology follows principles similar to those developed for Christina M. Fitzgerald’s and John T. Sebastian’s Broadview Anthology of Medieval Drama; several of the plays from that anthology are also included here, while the rest have been newly edited for this volume, under the supervision of General Editor Alan Stewart.",Literary Collections,668,N/A,0,en

Messages for Building Up New Believers (3),Watchman Nee,Living Stream Ministry,1994-09-01,"After Watchman Nee resumed his ministry in 1948, he fellowshipped several times with the brothers about the critical need to provide believers with a spiritual education. As a goal, he wanted to provide basic teachings to every brother and sister in the church so that they could have a solid foundation of the truth and express the same testimony among the churches. Messages for Building Up New Believers, Volumes 1-3, contains fifty-four lessons for new believers, which Watchman Nee released during his workers' training in Kuling. These chapters are rich in content and all-inclusive in scope. The truths are basic and crucial. This three-volume series begins with a message given by Watchman Nee at a co-workers’ meeting in July 1950 concerning the meeting for the building up of new believers. It covers the importance of this type of training, the main points to take care of, and some practical suggestions.

The Broadview Anthology of Medieval Drama,"Christina M. Fitzgerald, John T. Sebastian",Broadview Press,2012-12-05,"The past generation has been an extraordinarily active one in medieval drama scholarship; our appreciation of the range of medieval drama has been significantly broadened, and our understanding of certain medieval genres—most notably, biblical drama—has been fundamentally altered. The Broadview Anthology of British Literature has been widely praised for the degree to which it has taken this scholarship into account in its selection of and presentation of medieval plays. Now Broadview launches a new anthology that takes those plays as its base while expanding very substantially beyond them to represent the full range of drama in English (and, where strong connections exist, in French, Latin, Cornish, and Welsh as well) through to 1576. In all, over forty plays are included. Each work has been fully annotated and is prefaced by a substantial introduction. In many cases the language is to some extent modernized in order to make the plays more accessible to readers today.",Drama,595,N/A,0,en

Gumption,Nick Offerman,Penguin,2015-05-26,"The star of Parks and Recreation and author of the New York Times bestseller Paddle Your Own Canoe returns with a second book that humorously highlights twenty-one figures from our nation’s history, from her inception to present day—Nick’s personal pantheon of “great Americans.” To millions of people, Nick Offerman is America. Both Nick and his character, Ron Swanson, are known for their humor and patriotism in equal measure. After the great success of his autobiography, Paddle Your Own Canoe, Offerman now focuses on the lives of those who inspired him. From George Washington to Willie Nelson, he describes twenty-one heroic figures and why they inspire in him such great meaning. He combines both serious history with light-hearted humor—comparing, say, Benjamin Franklin’s abstinence from daytime drinking to his own sage refusal to join his construction crew in getting plastered on the way to work. The subject matter also allows Offerman to expound upon his favorite topics, which readers love to hear—areas such as religion, politics, woodworking and handcrafting, agriculture, creativity, philosophy, fashion, and, of course, meat.",Humor,347,3,1,en

Good Clean Fun,Nick Offerman,Penguin,2016-10-18,"Nick Offerman, woodworker, actor, and co-host of NBC’s Making It, invites you on a hilarious and informative woodworking adventure that takes you behind the scenes of his very own woodshop. Nestled among the glitz and glitter of Tinseltown is a testament to American elbow grease and an honest-to-god hard day’s work: Offerman Woodshop. Captained by hirsute woodworker, actor, comedian, and writer Nick Offerman, the shop produces not only fine handcrafted furniture, but also fun stuff—kazoos, baseball bats, ukuleles, mustache combs, even cedar-strip canoes. Now Nick and his ragtag crew of champions want to share their experience of working at the Woodshop, tell you all about their passion for the discipline of woodworking, and teach you how to make a handful of their most popular projects along the way. This book takes readers behind the scenes of the woodshop, both inspiring and teaching them to make their own projects and besotting them with the infectious spirit behind the shop and its complement of dusty wood-elves. In these pages you will find a variety of projects for every skill level, with personal, easy-to-follow instructions by the OWS woodworkers themselves; and, what’s more, this tutelage is augmented by mouth-watering color photos (Nick calls it ""wood porn""). You will also find writings by Nick, offering recipes for both comestibles and mirth, humorous essays, odes to his own woodworking heroes, insights into the ethos of woodworking in modern America, and other assorted tomfoolery. Whether you’ve been working in your own shop for years, or if holding this stack of compressed wood pulp is as close as you’ve ever come to milling lumber, or even if you just love Nick Offerman’s brand of bucolic yet worldly wisdom, you’ll find Good Clean Fun full of useful, illuminating, and entertaining information.",Humor,354,5,1,en

Walls,L.M. Elliott,Algonquin Young Readers,2021-07-27,"Can two cousins on opposite sides of the Cold War and a divided city come together when so much stands between them? Drew is an army brat in West Berlin, where soldiers like his dad hold an outpost of democracy against communist Russia. Drew’s cousin Matthias, an East Berliner, has grown up in the wreckage of Allied war bombing, on streets ruled by the secret police. From enemy sides of this Cold War standoff, the boys become wary friends, arguing over the space race, politics, even civil rights, but bonding over music. If informants catch Matthias with rock ’n’ roll records or books Drew has given him, he could be sent to a work camp. If Drew gets too close to an East Berliner, others on the army post may question his family’s loyalty. As the political conflict around them grows dire, Drew and Matthias are tested in ways that will change their lives forever. Set in the tumultuous year leading up to the surprise overnight raising of the Berlin Wall in August 1961, and illustrated with dozens of real-life photographs of the time, Walls brings to vivid life a heroic and tragic episode of the Cold War.",Young Adult Fiction,327,N/A,0,en

"Cases, Materials, and Problems in Property",Richard H. Chused,N/A,2010,"View or download the free 2016 Online Supplement for this product. To access an additional chapter section on estates, click here. Electronic teaching materials include the additional chapter section. This casebook raises interesting and challenging problems concerning the development of property law. Property concepts are introduced through cutting edge issues, such as intellectual property, rights of publicity, and ownership rights in the human body. Historical dimensions are presented through discussions of laws which formerly excluded certain individuals from most forms of ownership and property control, such as Native Americans, African Americans, and women. The text covers traditional topics: estates in land, landlord and tenant laws, transfers of property, private land use controls, and constitutional limitations on public land use controls. Most chapters are preceded by a concise summary of legal doctrines or common themes covered in the chapter. Explanatory Notes provide extensive explanations of cases and rules; they clarify complicated opinions with background information regarding the circumstances giving rise to the proceedings. Problems and Problem Notes take students beyond the realm of settled rules to generate analysis of the purpose behind the rules. This book also points students to relevant secondary sources for a broader understanding of property law. This book also is available in a three-hole punched, alternative loose-leaf version printed on 8.5 x 11 inch paper with wider margins and with the same pagination as the hardbound book.",Law,1592,N/A,0,en

By selling wood chips and reducing residue-disposal costs, sawmills could improve their utilization of sawlogs. But to justify the installation of debarking and chipping machines, and to know what such machines could contribute to his business, the sawmill owner must have a thorough understanding of the costs involved in chip production. To help him in this we have made case studies of seven sawmills in southeastern Ohio, eastern Kentucky, and Tennessee, and have analyzed all the factos of cost involved in chip production.",Sawmills,320,N/A,0,en

Understanding Extreme Sports: A Psychological Perspective,"Eric Brymer, Francesco Feletti, Erik Monasterio, Robert D. Schweitzer",Frontiers Media SA,2020-03-30,"Extreme sports, those activities that lie on the outermost edges of independent adventurous leisure activities, where a mismanaged mistake or accident would most likely result in death, have developed into a significant worldwide phenomenon (Brymer & Schweitzer, 2017a). Extreme sport activities are continually evolving, typical examples include BASE (an acronym for Buildings, Antennae, Span, Earth) jumping and related activities such as proximity flying, extreme skiing, big wave surfing, waterfall kayaking, rope free solo climbing and high-level mountaineering. While participant numbers in many traditional team and individual sports such as golf, basketball and racket sports have declined over the last decade or so, participant numbers in so called extreme sports have surged. Although extreme sports are still assumed to be a Western pastime, there has been considerable Global uptake. Equally, the idea that adventure sports are only for the young is also changing as participation rates across the generations are growing. For example, baby boomers are enthusiastic participants of adventure sports more generally (Brymer & Schweitzer, 2017b; Patterson, 2002) and Generation Z turn to extreme sports because they are popular and linked to escapism (Giannoulakis & Pursglove, 2017). Arguably, extreme sports now support a multi-billion dollar industry and the momentum seems to be intensifying. Traditional explanations for why extreme sports have become so popular are varied. For some, the popularity is explained as the desire to rebel against a society that is becoming too risk averse, for others it is about the spectacle and the merchandise that is associated with organised activities and athletes. For others it is just that there are a lot of people attracted by risk and danger or just want to show off. For others still it is about the desire to belong to sub-cultures and the glamour that goes with extreme sports. Some seek mastery in their chosen activity and in situations of significant challenges. This confusion is unfortunate as despite their popularity there is still a negative perception about extreme sports participation. There is a pressing need for clarity. The dominant research perspective has focused on positivist theory-driven perspectives that attempt to match extreme sports against predetermined characteristics. For the most part empirical research has conformed to predetermined societal perspectives. Other ways of knowing might reveal more nuanced perspectives of the human dimension of extreme sport participation. This special edition brings together cutting-edge research and thought examining psychology and extreme sports, with particular attention payed to the examination of motivations for initial participation, continued participation, effective performance, and outcomes from participation.

It defines the strengths-based approach and examines foundational and theoretical concepts as well as the legislation that mandates inclusive leisure services. Part II provides in-depth information on inclusive practices that can be used by leisure service professionals to ensure a positive experience for all individuals with disabilities. It challenges readers to go beyond inclusive programs and to apply inclusion in all organizational aspects. Part III offers applied information and examples of inclusion across the breadth of leisure services, including programming in sports, fitness, aquatics, art, outdoor adventure, travel and tourism, special events, and more. Inclusive Leisure asserts that disability is simply part of the human condition, that the strengths and abilities of people with disabilities must be at the forefront of inclusion, and that access to inclusive leisure is a matter of social justice and a critical professional practice. By learning theoretical and legal foundations, building on that knowledge with a multitude of applied elements, and establishing their practice in a strengths-based approach, students will be well prepared to create inclusive leisure environments and programming.

Spatial Microsimulation for Rural Policy Analysis,"Cathal O'Donoghue, Dimitris Ballas, Graham Clarke, Stephen Hynes, Karyn Morrissey",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-10-12,"The aim of this book is to explore the challenges facing rural communities and economies and to demonstrate the potential of spatial microsimulation for policy and analysis in a rural context. This is done by providing a comprehensive overview of a particular spatial microsimulation model called SMILE (Simulation Model of the Irish Local Economy). The model has been developed over a ten year period for applied policy analyis in Ireland which is seen as an ideal study area given its large percentage of population living in rural areas. The book reviews the policy context and the state of the art in spatial microsimulation against which SMILE was developed, describes in detail its model design and calibration, and presents example of outputs showing what new information the model provides using a spatial matching process. The second part of the book explores a series of rural issues or problems, including the impacts of new or changing government or EU policies, and examines the contribution that spatial microsimulation can provide in each area.",Business & Economics,276,N/A,0,en

Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-II,"Thomas Oakland, Patti L. Harrison",Academic Press,2011-10-10,"Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-II summarizes information on adaptive behavior and skills as well as general issues in adaptive behavior assessment with the goal of promoting sound assessment practice during uses, interpretations, and applications of the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-II. Adaptive behavior and skills refer to personal qualities associated with the ability to meet one's personal needs such as communication, self-care, socialization, etc. and those of others. Data from measures of adaptive behavior have been used most commonly in assessment and intervention services for persons with mental retardation. However, the display of adaptive behaviors and skills is relevant to all persons. The Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-II (ABAS-II) provides a comprehensive, norm-referenced assessment of the adaptive behavior and skills of individuals from birth through age 89. The comprehensive natures of the ABAS-II, ease in administration and scoring, and wide age range have resulted in its widespread use for a large number of assessment purposes. The book provides practical information and thus serves as a valuable resource for those who use the ABAS-II. - Assists in the functional use of the ABAS-II - Provides case studies illustrating use of the ABAS-II in comprehensive assessment and intervention planning - Reviews scholarship on adaptive behaviors and skills - Describes legal, ethical, and other professional standards and guidelines that apply to the use of the ABAS-II and other measures of adaptive behavior - Discusses the use of the ABAS-II with autism, mental retardation; young children and those in elementary and secondary school; as well as incarcerated persons being evaluated for possible mental retardation",Psychology,431,N/A,0,en

Designing Experiences,"J. Robert Rossman, Mathew D. Duerden",Columbia University Press,2019-07-23,"In an increasingly experience-driven economy, companies that deliver great experiences thrive, and those that do not die. Yet many organizations face difficulties implementing a vision of delivering experiences beyond the provision of goods and services. Because experience design concepts and approaches are spread across multiple, often disconnected disciplines, there is no book that succinctly explains to students and aspiring professionals how to design them. J. Robert Rossman and Mathew D. Duerden present a comprehensive and accessible introduction to experience design. They synthesize the fundamental theories and methods from multiple disciplines and lay out a process for designing experiences from start to finish. Rossman and Duerden challenge us to reflect on what makes a great experience from the user’s perspective. They provide a framework of experience types, explaining people’s engagement with products and services and what makes experiences personal and fulfilling. The book presents interdisciplinary research underlying key concepts such as memory, intentionality, and dramatic structure in a down-to-earth style, drawing attention to both the macro and micro levels. Designing Experiences features detailed instructions and numerous real-world examples that clarify theoretical principles, making it useful for students and professionals. An invaluable overview of a growing field, the book provides readers with the tools they need to design innovative and indelible experiences and to move their organizations into the experience economy.

Since the first edition of Interpretation of Bloodstain Evidence at Crime Scenes was published nearly a decade ago, bloodstain pattern interpretation has continued to grow as a branch of forensic science. Revised and updated to reflect new technology and developments in the field, the second edition is packed with new information and illustrations-including 421 photographs and diagrams of improved quality that will aid in interpretation of evidence. Expanding on a single chapter presented in the bestselling first edition, the second edition details, in four chapters, an introduction to bloodstain interpretation; low-velocity impact and angular considerations; medium and high-velocity impact; and the significance of partially dried, clotted, aged, and physically altered bloodstains in four new chapters. A full chapter on the detection of blood with luminol, featuring high-quality, full-color photographs of luminol reactions, has been added. This new edition also includes 12 new case studies in addition to 8 original case studies from the first edition that have been retained for their interpretative value.

Recreational Disturbance of Shorebirds in Tropical Asia,"Priyan Perera, Sumudu Marasinghe, Greg D. Simpson, David Newsome",Springer Nature,2022-09-16,"Much of that growing demand for coastal recreation and tourism has focused on countries in South and Southeast Asia in the tourism megaregion that this book refers to as Tropical Asia. As such, the recreational disturbance of shorebirds in Asia is a serious conservation issue, at a time when populations of both migratory and non-migratory species of shorebirds are threatened and declining because of the loss of coastal habitat and increased human disturbance. Despite global awareness about the impacts that the growth of coastal recreation and tourism across Tropical Asia is likely to be having on threatened and endangered migratory and resident shorebird species of the coastal zones of the East Asian– Australasian Flyway, less than 3% of the published peer-reviewed research into the recreational disturbance of shorebirds addresses coastal zones of Tropical Asia. This situation points to a significant knowledge gap regarding the impacts of human recreation on shorebirds in the Tropical Asian region. In contrast, almost three quarters of the peer-reviewed articles that report recreational disturbance research and management strategies focus on coastal zones in North America (36%), Oceania (20%), and Europe (20%). For those reasons, the quantitative systematic literature review and research case study from Sri Lanka reported in this book provide a call to action and recommendations for both management approaches grounded in the international literature and a research agenda that should be implemented in the coastal zones of Tropical Asia.",Technology & Engineering,106,N/A,0,en

Recreation as a Developmental Experience: Theory Practice Research,"Lawrence R. Allen, Robert J. Barcelona",John Wiley & Sons,2011-07-26,"It's not all ""fun and games."" A growing body of research suggests that recreation activities can be powerful development contexts when they are properly framed and intentionally designed. This volume highlights much of that research, and the articles that follow provide ample evidence that well-framed recreation activities and contexts can provide a range of positive developmental outcomes. Editors Lawrence R. Allen and Robert J. Barcelona draw on their own work in human and youth development and have assembled contributing authors who explore the important of meaningful recreation and leisure experiences in the lives of youth and the value of recreation from a developmental perspective. Chapters focus on the developmental potential of specific recreation contexts and settings and provide research and evidence-based strategies outlining the activities that best promote positive youth development. Finally, the volume demonstrates how recreation is being used to strengthen individual and community assets and its role as a contributor in addressing pressing social issues. This is the 130th volume of New Directions for Youth Development, the Jossey-Bass quarterly report series dedicated to bringing together everyone concerned with helping young people, including scholars, practitioners, and people from different disciplines and professions. The result is a unique resource presenting thoughtful, multi-faceted approaches to helping our youth develop into responsible, stable, well-rounded citizens.",Education,138,N/A,0,en

The purpose of this study guide is to assist candidates in preparing for the NCTRC national certification examination for Certified Therapeutic Recreation Specialists. 850 flashcards (included in the bundle and separately) on the 6 topic areas of the test: Foundational knowledge; Assessment; Documentation; Implementation; Administration of TR; Advancement of the profession. We are excited to tell you that this fifth edition of the Study Guide for the Therapeutic Recreation Specialist Certification Examination has changed significantly from previous editions. This is largely due to two reasons: (a) the National Council for Therapeutic Recreation Certification (NCTRC) has recently updated the Job Analysis, which helps structure the content of the test, and (b) the computerized test has a newer format of a 150-item test. Therefore, we have restructured the Study Guide to align more closely with the most recent NCTRC exam content and format. In addition, weve added over 100 new items for a total of over 850 practice test items! The Study Guide offers over 250 random practice items, plus four practice exams, each with 150 items distributed across the job analysis that mirrors the national exam. In preparing this Study Guide, we had a twofold mission: (a) to provide information that helps candidates reduce test anxiety and maximize test performance and (b) to provide numerous sample questions, similar to those actually found on the exam, that will allow candidates to practice and self-assess their own readiness for the test. For many individuals, the thought of taking a certification examination can be unsettling. We often hear statements such as I have never taken a comprehensive exam. There is so much information. How do I learn it all? This Study Guide will help you to identify areas where you need further study to help you ace your NCTRC certification examination!",,164,N/A,0,en

Sports in Zion,Richard Ian Kimball,University of Illinois Press,2003-08-12,"If a religion cannot attract and instruct young people, it will struggle to survive, which is why recreational programs were second only to theological questions in the development of twentieth-century Mormonism. In this book, Richard Ian Kimball explores how Mormon leaders used recreational programs to ameliorate the problems of urbanization and industrialization and to inculcate morals and values in LDS youth. As well as promoting sports as a means of physical and spiritual excellence, Progressive Era Mormons established a variety of institutions such as the Deseret Gymnasium and camps for girls and boys, all designed to compete with more ""worldly"" attractions and to socialize adolescents into the faith. Kimball employs a wealth of source material including periodicals, diaries, journals, personal papers, and institutional records to illuminate this hitherto underexplored aspect of the LDS church. In addition to uncovering the historical roots of many Mormon institutions still visible today, Sports in Zion is a detailed look at the broader functions of recreation in society.",Religion,252,N/A,0,en

Outdoor Recreation Participation in the United States- Projections To 2060,J. Bowker,CreateSpace,2015-01-03,"We developed national projections through 2060 of participation for 17 outdoor recreation activities. The projections were made under futures that vary by population growth, socioeconomic conditions, land use changes, and climate. We used a two-step approach to project the number of participants and the days of participation. The estimation step yielded national-level statistical models of adult participation rate and days of participation by activity. The simulation step combined the models with external projections of explanatory variables at 10-year intervals to 2060. Per capita estimates for participation and days were then combined with population projections to derive estimates of participants and days of participation by activity. Results were derived across three 2010 Resources Planning Act Assessment scenarios that each feature three associated climate futures. Findings indicated that outdoor recreation will remain a key part of the social and economic fabric of the United States.",,40,N/A,0,en

Chaparral-type ecosystems are a common element of all of the world’s Mediterranean-type climate regions – of which California is one – yet there is little public appreciation of the intrinsic value and the ecosystem services that these landscapes provide. Valuing Chaparral is a compendium of contributions from experts in chaparral ecology and management, with a focus on the human relationship with chaparral ecosystems. Chapters cover a wide variety of subjects, ranging from biodiversity to ecosystem services like water provision, erosion control, carbon sequestration and recreation; from the history of human interactions with chaparral to current education and conservation efforts; and from chaparral restoration and management to scenarios of the future under changing climate, land use, and human population. Valuing Chaparral will be of interest to resource managers, the research community, policy makers, and the public who live and work in the chaparral dominated landscapes of California and other Mediterranean-type climate regions.",Technology & Engineering,483,N/A,0,en

Encyclopedia of Sports & Recreation for People with Visual Impairments,Andrew Leibs,IAP,2012-12-01,"Not long ago, most blind and visually impaired people grew up without ever playing sports; they sat on the sidelines, and kept score during gym—protected rather than included. In the 1980s, few people had ever heard of the Paralympic Games or accessible recreation. Today, promising blind athletes can receive residency at the US Olympic Training Center; runners compete for prize money and national championships, and most ski resorts offer adaptive programs throughout the year where blind people can ski, cycle, and kayak—often for free. The Paralympic movement, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and ever-increasing expectation for inclusion among the disabled have inspired an explosion of accessible sports, fitness, and recreation programs that accommodate the blind. The Encyclopedia of Sports & Recreation for People with Visual Impairments is the first consumer-focused, action-oriented guide to this new world of accessible activity, profiling the people, programs, and products that are helping move blind and visually impaired people from the sidelines into the game. This groundbreaking guide profiles every accessible blind sport and recreation activity with entries that outline how athletes (both novice and elite) got involved in the sport and how participation has shaped their life. The book also profiles major blind sports organizations and includes chapter and resource listings on camps and accessible recreation providers. Through this book, blind people will be inspired to embrace sports as the rest of society does—as a vital component of personal expression and human interaction that opens paths to adventure, confidence, and lifelong health and fitness.",Crafts & Hobbies,288,N/A,0,en

Laugh Lines,Alan Zweibel,Abrams,2020-04-14,"With his tender, funny memoir of four decades in the business, one of the first writers for Saturday Night Live traces the history of American comedy. Alan Zweibel started his comedy career selling jokes for seven dollars apiece to the last of the Borscht Belt standups. Then one night, despite bombing on stage, he caught the attention of Lorne Michaels and became one of the first writers at Saturday Night Live, where he penned classic material for Gilda Radner, John Belushi, and all of the original Not Ready For Prime Time Players. From SNL, he went on to have a hand in a series of landmark shows—from It’s Garry Shandling’s Show to Curb Your Enthusiasm. Throughout the pages of Laugh Lines Zweibel weaves together his own stories and interviews with his friends and contemporaries, including Richard Lewis, Eric Idle, Bob Saget, Mike Birbiglia, Sarah Silverman, Judd Apatow, Dave Barry, Carl Reiner, and more. The book also features a charming foreword from his friend of forty-five years Billy Crystal, with whom he co-wrote and co-produced the upcoming film Here Today that stars Crystal and Tiffany Haddish. Laugh Lines is a warmhearted cultural memoir of American comedy. “In Laugh Lines, Zweibel looks back, affectionately and informatively, at a career that began when he was a young deli worker grinding out jokes for old-school borscht belt comedians in his spare time, and that, after his “S.N.L.” years, included rewarding collaborations with, among others, Garry Shandling, Billy Crystal, Martin Short, Larry David and Dave Barry. . . . Fascinating.” —New York Times “Any comedy fan will thrill to see the contemporary art's invention through the eyes of consummate funny man Alan Zweibel. He takes you behind the velvet rope and makes you weep for all those artists who made us laugh. Screamingly funny—also very moving. A classic.” —Mary Karr “Alan Zweibel is legendary among us comedians. He is the man who delivers comedy with an emotional clout that makes him respected and revered.” —Steve Martin",Biography & Autobiography,304,N/A,0,en

The containment of working time and the rise in spending power have been long-term trends and are likely to continue over the next decades. While growth of leisure may not have eradicated differences by social class, gender or age, it has transformed how these differences are expressed, challenged or modified.

Understanding the psychology of physical activity has therefore become an important concern for scientists, health professionals and policy-makers alike. Psychology of Physical Activity is a comprehensive and in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of exercise psychology, from theories of motivation and adherence to the design of successful interventions for increasing participation. Now in a fully revised, updated and expanded third edition, Psychology of Physical Activity is still the only textbook to offer a full survey of the evidence-base for theory and practice in exercise psychology, and the only textbook that explains how to interpret the quality of the research evidence. With international cases, examples and data included throughout, the book also provides a thoroughly detailed examination of the relationship between physical activity and mental health. A full companion website offers useful features to help students and lecturers get the most out of the book during their course, including multiple-choice revision questions, PowerPoint slides and a test bank of additional learning activities.

Outdoor Recreation,Charles I. Zinser,John Wiley & Sons,1995-08-11,"Perhaps no other nation on earth devotes as large a portion of its public lands to recreational use as the United States. And while millions of Americans flock to our national parks, forests, and other public lands each year, these areas are also major attractions for international visitors and an important source of foreign exchange. The allocation, location, planning, and management of public lands for recreational use is now a major activity within each of the nation's four major land-managing agencies, and in several smaller departments as well. This book presents an overview of the vast and diverse federal recreation system, its historical evolution, methods of management and development, and the different roles played by the National Park Service, the Forest Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management. It explores concepts in land-use planning, examines relevant federal legislation, and presents federal concepts for preserving amenity resources. Rather than make an exhaustive presentation of current facilities and recreational opportunities, author Charles Zinser uses a case study approach to illustrate and analyze programs and development principles found in each of the major agencies. More than 300 tables, maps, and illustrations supplement the text. An entire chapter is devoted to the recreational resources of smaller federal agencies, including the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Tennessee Valley Authority, all of which permit various forms of water-related recreation on reservoirs under their control. Many people are surprised to learn that, in terms of recreational use, the Army Corps of Engineers is the number-two federal agency. Packed with helpful, practical, and authoritative information, Outdoor Recreation is a one-stop source on the availability, development, and management of recreational resources within the federal system. It is a first-rate reference for anyone involved in forestry, geography, wildland or watershed management, land-use planning and development, or creating recreational facilities. It is also an ideal textbook for courses in geography and recreational use of public lands. The most complete guide available to the federal recreation system The system of federal lands devoted to outdoor recreation is as diverse bureaucratically as it is geographically. At least eight federal agencies administer recreational resources from mountain to seashore, from desert to glacier, in virtually every state and territory of the nation. This one-stop sourcebook offers complete information on the acquisition, development, management, and protection of these resources, including: Extensive coverage of recreational resources administered by federal land-managing agencies that control one fourth of our national territory A review of the basic concepts of land-use planning An examination of the federal legislation that created current programs and facilities Numerous maps, statistical tables, and illustrations not available from any other source Case studies that illustrate the practical impact of federal policies and concepts Examples of federal plans for protecting these resources, including: the National Wilderness Preservation System, National Trails System, and the National Wild and Scenic River System",Law,926,N/A,0,en

The Matheny Manifesto,"Mike Matheny, Jerry B. Jenkins",Crown,2015-02-03,"St. Louis Cardinals manager Mike Matheny's New York Times bestselling manifesto about what parents, coaches, and athletes get wrong about sports; what we can do better; and how sports can teach eight keys to success in sports and life. Mike Matheny was just forty-one, without professional managerial experience and looking for a next step after a successful career as a Major League catcher, when he succeeded the legendary Tony La Russa as manager of the St. Louis Cardinals in 2012. While Matheny has enjoyed immediate success, leading the Cards to the postseason four times in his first four years−a Major League record−people have noticed something else about his life, something not measured in day-to-day results. Instead, it’s based on a frankly worded letter he wrote to the parents of a Little League team he coached, a cry for change that became an Internet sensation and eventually a “manifesto.” The tough-love philosophy Matheny expressed in the letter contained his throwback beliefs that authority should be respected, discipline and hard work rewarded, spiritual faith cultivated, family made a priority, and humility considered a virtue. In The Matheny Manifesto, he builds on his original letter by first diagnosing the problem at the heart of youth sports−it starts with parents and coaches−and then by offering a hopeful path forward. Along the way, he uses stories from his small-town childhood as well as his career as a player, coach, and manager to explore eight keys to success: leadership, confidence, teamwork, faith, class, character, toughness, and humility. From “The Coach Is Always Right, Even When He’s Wrong” to “Let Your Catcher Call the Game,” Matheny’s old-school advice might not always be popular or politically correct, but it works. His entertaining and deeply inspirational book will not only resonate with parents, coaches, and athletes, it will also be a powerful reminder, from one of the most successful new managers in the game, of what sports can teach us all about winning on the field and in life.",Sports & Recreation,226,N/A,0,en

Erika Fane’s boyfriend's older brother is handsome, strong, and completely terrifying. The star of his college's basketball team gone pro, he's more concerned with the dirt on his shoe than he is with her. But she saw him. She heard him. The things that he did, and the deeds that he hid... For years, Erika bit her nails, unable to look away. Now, she’s in college, but she hasn’t stopped watching him. He’s bad and the things she’s seen aren’t content to stay in her head anymore. Because he's finally noticed her. But Michael Crist knows the hold he has on Rika, how much she fears him.

Drug Use for Grown-Ups,Dr. Carl L. Hart,Penguin,2022-01-11,"“Hart’s argument that we need to drastically revise our current view of illegal drugs is both powerful and timely . . . when it comes to the legacy of this country’s war on drugs, we should all share his outrage.” —The New York Times Book Review From one of the world's foremost experts on the subject, a powerful argument that the greatest damage from drugs flows from their being illegal, and a hopeful reckoning with the possibility of their use as part of a responsible and happy life Dr. Carl L. Hart, Ziff Professor at Columbia University and former chair of the Department of Psychology, is one of the world's preeminent experts on the effects of so-called recreational drugs on the human mind and body. Dr. Hart is open about the fact that he uses drugs himself, in a happy balance with the rest of his full and productive life as a researcher and professor, husband, father, and friend. In Drug Use for Grown-Ups, he draws on decades of research and his own personal experience to argue definitively that the criminalization and demonization of drug use--not drugs themselves--have been a tremendous scourge on America, not least in reinforcing this country's enduring structural racism. Dr. Hart did not always have this view. He came of age in one of Miami's most troubled neighborhoods at a time when many ills were being laid at the door of crack cocaine. His initial work as a researcher was aimed at proving that drug use caused bad outcomes. But one problem kept cropping up: the evidence from his research did not support his hypothesis. From inside the massively well-funded research arm of the American war on drugs, he saw how the facts did not support the ideology. The truth was dismissed and distorted in order to keep fear and outrage stoked, the funds rolling in, and Black and brown bodies behind bars. Drug Use for Grown-Ups will be controversial, to be sure: the propaganda war, Dr. Hart argues, has been tremendously effective. Imagine if the only subject of any discussion about driving automobiles was fatal car crashes. Drug Use for Grown-Ups offers a radically different vision: when used responsibly, drugs can enrich and enhance our lives.

Her family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education, and no one to intervene when one of Tara’s older brothers became violent. When another brother got himself into college, Tara decided to try a new kind of life. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge University. Only then would she wonder if she’d traveled too far, if there was still a way home. “Beautiful and propulsive . . . Despite the singularity of [Westover’s] childhood, the questions her book poses are universal: How much of ourselves should we give to those we love?

Being a Christian, by Dr. Jason Allen, shows how Jesus redeems all of life.

It also provides perspectives on the behavioral science of aging for researchers and professionals from other disciplines. The book is organized into four parts.

Academically Adrift,"Richard Arum, Josipa Roksa",University of Chicago Press,2011-01-15,"In spite of soaring tuition costs, more and more students go to college every year. A bachelor’s degree is now required for entry into a growing number of professions. And some parents begin planning for the expense of sending their kids to college when they’re born. Almost everyone strives to go, but almost no one asks the fundamental question posed by Academically Adrift: are undergraduates really learning anything once they get there? For a large proportion of students, Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa’s answer to that question is a definitive no. Their extensive research draws on survey responses, transcript data, and, for the first time, the state-of-the-art Collegiate Learning Assessment, a standardized test administered to students in their first semester and then again at the end of their second year. According to their analysis of more than 2,300 undergraduates at twenty-four institutions, 45 percent of these students demonstrate no significant improvement in a range of skills—including critical thinking, complex reasoning, and writing—during their first two years of college. As troubling as their findings are, Arum and Roksa argue that for many faculty and administrators they will come as no surprise—instead, they are the expected result of a student body distracted by socializing or working and an institutional culture that puts undergraduate learning close to the bottom of the priority list. Academically Adrift holds sobering lessons for students, faculty, administrators, policy makers, and parents—all of whom are implicated in promoting or at least ignoring contemporary campus culture. Higher education faces crises on a number of fronts, but Arum and Roksa’s report that colleges are failing at their most basic mission will demand the attention of us all.",Education,272,4,1,en

Campus Life,Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching,Jossey-Bass,1990,"A national study of social conditions on college campuses found that college officials were concerned about alcohol and drug abuse, crime, breakdown of civility, racial tensions, sex discrimination, and a diminishing commitment to teaching and learning. In response to those findings, this book proposes that both academic and civic standards be clarified and that the enduring values that undergird a community of learning be precisely defined. Six principles are presented that provide a formula for day-to-day decision making on the campus and define the kind of community every college and university should strive to be: (1) a purposeful community, (2) an open community, (3) a just community, (4) a disciplined community, (5) a caring community, and (6) a celebrative community. Appendices present detailed results of the 1989 national survey by the Carnegie Foundation that formed the basis for this report. The survey identified campus life issues of concern, as perceived by 382 responding institutions in the National Survey of College and University Presidents and 355 responding institutions in the 1989 National Survey of Chief Student Affairs Officers by the American Council on Education and the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators. The survey also analyzed views on improving campus life, actions likely to improve campus life, and changes over 5 years in specific problem areas. Reference notes accompany each chapter.

They fall in love, despite Hamilton’s bastard birth and the uncertainties of war. A founding father’s wife... But the union they create—in their marriage and the new nation—is far from perfect. From glittering inaugural balls to bloody street riots, the Hamiltons are at the center of it all—including the political treachery of America’s first sex scandal, which forces Eliza to struggle through heartbreak and betrayal to find forgiveness. The last surviving light of the Revolution… When a duel destroys Eliza’s hard-won peace, the grieving widow fights her husband’s enemies to preserve Alexander’s legacy. But long-buried secrets threaten everything Eliza believes about her marriage and her own legacy. Questioning her tireless devotion to the man and country that have broken her heart, she’s left with one last battle—to understand the flawed man she married and imperfect union he could never have created without her…",Fiction,773,4.5,3,en

Hawaiki Rising,Sam Low,University of Hawaii Press,2019-11-30,"Attuned to a world of natural signs—the stars, the winds, the curl of ocean swells—Polynesian explorers navigated for thousands of miles without charts or instruments. They sailed against prevailing winds and currents aboard powerful double canoes to settle the vast Pacific Ocean. And they did this when Greek mariners still hugged the coast of an inland sea, and Europe was populated by stone-age farmers. Yet by the turn of the twentieth century, this story had been lost and Polynesians had become an oppressed minority in their own land. Then, in 1975, a replica of an ancient Hawaiian canoe—Hōkūle‘a—was launched to sail the ancient star paths, and help Hawaiians reclaim pride in the accomplishments of their ancestors. Hawaiki Rising tells this story in the words of the men and women who created and sailed aboard Hōkūle‘a. They speak of growing up at a time when their Hawaiian culture was in danger of extinction; of their vision of sailing ancestral sea-routes; and of the heartbreaking loss of Eddie Aikau in a courageous effort to save his crewmates when Hōkūle‘a capsized in a raging storm. We join a young Hawaiian, Nainoa Thompson, as he rediscovers the ancient star signs that guided his ancestors, navigates Hōkūle‘a to Tahiti, and becomes the first Hawaiian to find distant landfall without charts or instruments in a thousand years. Hawaiki Rising is the saga of an astonishing revival of indigenous culture by voyagers who took hold of the old story and sailed deep into their ancestral past.",History,0,N/A,0,en

Dee decided to recruit the best players from Canada and pay them to play for the Portage Lake (Houghton) hockey team. The team won the 1904 U.S. Championship and defeated a team from Montreal for what was billed as the World's Championship. Following this successful season, Gibson and Dee began promoting the idea of a professional hockey league and in December 1904 play began in the International Hockey League (IHL). The league had five teams - Calumet, Pittsburgh, Portage Lake, Sault Ste. Marie Michigan, and Sault Ste. Marie Ontario, and although the league lasted only three seasons it was the start of professional hockey.",,136,4.5,2,en
The Responsible Company,"Yvon Chouinard, Vincent Stanley",Patagonia,2013-10-06,"The Responsible Company, by Yvon Chouinard, founder and owner of Patagonia, and Vincent Stanley, co-editor of its Footprint Chronicles, draw on the their 40 years' experience at Patagonia – and knowledge of current efforts by other companies – to articulate the elements of responsible business for our time. Patagonia, named by Fortune in 2007 as the coolest company on the planet, has earned a reputation as much for its ground-breaking environmental and social practices as for the quality of its clothes. In this exceptionally frank account, Chouinard and Stanley recount how the company and its culture gained the confidence, by step and misstep, to make its work progressively more responsible, and to ultimately share its discoveries with companies as large as Wal-Mart or as small as the corner bakery. In plain, compelling prose, the authors describe the current impact of manufacturing and commerce on the planet’s natural systems and human communities, and how that impact now forces business to change its ways. The Responsible Company shows companies how to reduce the harm they cause, improve the quality of their business, and provide the kind of meaningful work everyone seeks. It concludes with specific, practical steps every business can undertake, as well as advice on what to do, in what order. This is the first book to show companies how to thread their way through economic sea change and slow the drift toward ecological bankruptcy. Its advice is simple but powerful: reduce your environmental footprint (and its skyrocketing cost), make legitimate products that last, reclaim deep knowledge of your business and its supply chain to make the most of opportunities in the years to come, and earn the trust you’ll need by treating your workers, customers and communities with respect.",Business & Economics,140,N/A,0,en

Thousands of civilians, many of them young women from small towns across the U.S., were recruited to this secret city, enticed by the promise of solid wages and war-ending work. What were they actually doing there? Very few knew. The purpose of this mysterious government project was kept a secret from the outside world and from the majority of the residents themselves. Some wondered why, despite the constant work and round-the-clock activity in this makeshift town, did no tangible product of any kind ever seem to leave its guarded gates? The women who kept this town running would find out at the end of the war, when Oak Ridge’s secret was revealed and changed the world forever. Drawing from the voices and experiences of the women who lived and worked in Oak Ridge, The Girls of Atomic City rescues a remarkable, forgotten chapter of World War II from obscurity. Denise Kiernan captures the spirit of the times through these women: their pluck, their desire to contribute, and their enduring courage. “A phenomenal story,” and Publishers Weekly called it an “intimate and revealing glimpse into one of the most important scientific developments in history.” “Kiernan has amassed a deep reservoir of intimate details of what life was like for women living in the secret city...Rosie, it turns out, did much more than drive rivets.” —The Washington Post",Biography & Autobiography,416,4,1,en

A History of Children's Play and Play Environments,Joe L. Frost,Routledge,2010-04-02,"Children’s play throughout history has been free, spontaneous, and intertwined with work, set in the playgrounds of the fields, streams, and barnyards. Children in cities enjoyed similar forms of play but their playgrounds were the vacant lands and parks. Today, children have become increasingly inactive, abandoning traditional outdoor play for sedentary, indoor cyber play and poor diets. The consequences of play deprivation, the elimination and diminution of recess, and the abandonment of outdoor play are fundamental issues in a growing crisis that threatens the health, development, and welfare of children. This valuable book traces the history of children’s play and play environments from their roots in ancient Greece and Rome to the present time in the high stakes testing environment. Through this exploration, scholar Dr. Joe Frost shows how this history informs where we are today and why we need to re-establish play as a priority. Ultimately, the author proposes active solutions to play deprivation. This book is a must-read for scholars, researchers, and students in the fields of early childhood education and child development.",Education,566,N/A,0,en
Community Development,"Erin Sharpe, Heather Mair, Felice Yuen",N/A,2016-05-31,"This book takes up a range of factors affecting the relationship between community development and recreation: planning assumptions and structures, class and racial influences on engagement processes, grassroots approaches, critical consciousness through young adult literature, questions about the relationship between community and economic development, and issues of inclusion, social justice, and community empowerment. In a world of diversity and fluidity, the challenge for leisure/recreation practitioners and scholars becomes more complex and potentially exciting if we can become comfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity. The term ""community development"" in a globalized and diverse world is problematic and carries with it a history of colonialism, Western expansion and hegemony, and neo-liberal agendas in addition to being situated in a changing contentious world with nation-states and minority groups struggling over control. This volume initiates a discussion about the ways leisure, sport, and tourism might conceptualize the relationship with community development. The volume builds upon existing research and programs, extends or reframes theoretical approaches, questions, and posits alternative frameworks for playing with the intersection of community development, leisure, sport and tourism. Its strength and relevance comes from the authors' willingness to seriously and playfully explore the limits, implications, and variations of community development relevant for recreation and leisure studies as well as construct alternative spaces for leisure practices. Whether it is reconceiving planning as a ""human arena"" potentially facilitating how an individual comes to understand the self and communities, an exploration of how whiteness and privilege colour community development and recreation, conceiving of a compassionate pedagogy for community and recreation facilitation, or returning to young adult literature and storytelling for knowledge, this collection interweaves current theories, ethical frameworks, practices, and critiques relevant to recreation and leisure practitioners and scholars. Such a collection helps orient leisure practice and scholarship within larger international and North American currents of diversity, struggles over Indigenous rights and standing, economic and global agendas, political agendas that use leisure as power over or exclusion of others, the value of leisure beyond social and economic benefits, and the hegemonic commitment to an autonomous, self-initiating individual self. As the voices herein unfold spaces within dominant and status quo approaches in governments and academia, there are some voices yet to be heard.",Community development,258,N/A,0,en

The book teaches up-to-date parking management techniques for selecting parking policies and understanding parking behavior when faced with policy interventions. It shows when to apply each policy, how to include user attitudes in policy definition, and how to model user behavior when refining parking policies. In addition, it stresses the need to reduce overall city driving and the need to allow users to choose the transport mode that best suits their needs. As the growth of cities and car dependency worldwide has led to parking problems resulting in increased traffic congestion, pollution, and overall urban chaos, this book creates a model to help deal with the fallout. - Offers step-by-step procedures for defining sustainable parking policies - Synthesizes the latest research into one source - Links theoretical knowledge with hands-on best practices from around the world - Includes learning aids, such as chapter openers, textboxes, end-of-chapter review questions, and a glossary",Law,316,N/A,0,en

Community Parks and Recreation,"Christopher R. Edginton, Sam Lankford, Rodney B. Dieser, Rodney D. Dieser, Christopher L. Kowalski",N/A,2018-03-02,"Over the past 150 years, communities have focused their attention on enhancing quality of life, health and wellness, and the greening of their environments through the provision of park and recreation services and amenities. The greening and beautification of communities as well as tying recreation services to clean economic development provide a direct connection between the work public park and recreation departments and community development. This text asks students to consider important questions, such as: What are the most important elements of a livable community? In what type of community they would like to live? How important are building social connections amongst family, friends, neighbors, colleagues, and others? How are such relationships developed and sustained? What types of organizations are more likely to create such opportunities for building ones social capital? What agencies in the community are concerned with addressing environmental degradation and on the flipside enhancing community beautification and greening? All of these questions point toward the importance of public parks and recreation and its community development efforts. Community Parks & Recreation: An Introduction is organized into three major parts. Part I focuses on the History and Philosophical Foundations of Public Parks and Recreation. The major intent of this section is to provide an underpinning to assist the student in understanding the major dimensions of public parks and recreation and its impact socially, culturally, environmentally and economically. Part II of the book focuses on Managerial and Administrative Aspects of Park and Recreation Systems. This section of the book provides practical strategies for administrative activities, planning, marketing, budgeting, engaging the public and land acquisition. Part III of the book is focused on The Public Sector Service Provision in Parks and Recreation. This section of the book focuses on program and service delivery including chapters dealing with programming for community recreation, youth programming, programming for adults and seniors, programming special events and community-based therapeutic recreation. The authors of this text all share a deep interest in community, parks, and/or recreation services. At various times in their careers, they have have served as playground leaders, recreation specialists, youth leaders, community therapeutic recreation specialists, recreation center directors, recreation supervisors and/or directors of parks and recreation. The authors hold a strong commitment to community parks and recreation that is clearly reflected in this new text.",Community development,392,N/A,0,en

Managing to Optimize the Beneficial Outcomes of Recreation,Beverly L. Driver,Venture Publishing (PA),2008,"""Managing to Optimize the Beneficial Outcomes of Recreation focuses on the need for public park and recreation agencies to optimize the beneficial outcomes of recreational opportunities they provide and on how such optimization can be achieved. The six chapters in Part 1 of the text explain what Outcomes-Focused Management (OFM) is, how it evolved, why it is needed, why it is credible, how it can and should be implemented by public municipal and wildland recreation park and recreation agencies. These introductory chapters also explain why every segment of a country's population needs to understand the existing science-based knowledge about the benefits of leisure, and why repositioning of people's currently too limited understanding and appreciation of the benefits of leisure is so badly needed. The six chapters of Part 2 describe how OFM has been used to help guide park and recreation policy development by agencies in Australia, Canada, the U.S., and New Zealand. Part 3 is comprised of eight chapters that describe how OFM has been applied to guide the development and implementation of management plans by various public park and recreation agencies. A large proportion of the chapters in Parts 2 and 3 were authored by practitioners who were directly involved in the applications described. Those chapters are rich in their descriptions of what was learned about how to, and how not to, apply and implement OFM. The four chapters of Part 4 describe other applications of OFM such as to promote more attention on the benefits to residents of local communities, determine the local impacts of recreation and tourism, and guide recreation-related health initiatives and wildlife management. The summary chapter critiques what the text and suggests future needed direction. This text was designed for leisure professionals as well as lay persons, politicians, and journalists. The primary hoped-for readers include leisure scientists, academics, and students; leisure professionals who work for municipal park and recreation agencies; and their counterparts who work for agencies that manage public wildlands on which outdoor recreation opportunities are provided. Managing to Optimize the Beneficial Outcomes of Recreation explains what OFM is, why it should be applied more widely to the management of recreation and related amenity resources and programs that are managed by public agencies, and how such management can and should be done."" -- Publisher.",Leisure industry,0,N/A,0,en

The Routledge Handbook of Media Use and Well-Being,"Leonard Reinecke, Mary Beth Oliver",Routledge,2016-06-23,"The Routledge Handbook of Media Use and Well-Being serves as the first international review of the current state of this fast-developing area of research. The volume provides a multifaceted perspective on the beneficial as well as the detrimental effects of media exposure on psychological health and well-being. As a ""first-mover,"" it will define the field of media use and well-being and provide an essential resource for research and teaching in this area. The volume is structured along four central considerations: Processes presents concepts that provide a theoretical bridge between media use and well-being, such as psychological need satisfaction, recovery from stress and strain, self-presentation and self-enhancement, or parasocial interactions with media characters, providing a comprehensive understanding of the underlying processes that drive psychological health and well-being through media. Moderators examines both risk factors that promote negative effects on well-being and protective factors that foster positive media effects. Contexts bridges the gap between theory and ""real life"" by illustrating how media use can influence well-being and satisfaction in very different life domains, covering the full spectrum of everyday life by addressing the public, private, and work spheres. Audiences takes a look at the influence of life phases and life situations on the interplay of media use and well-being, questioning whether various user groups differ with regard to the effects of media exposure. Bringing together the expertise of outstanding international scholars from multiple disciplines, including communication, media psychology, social psychology, clinical psychology, and media education, this handbook sheds new light on the role of media in influencing and affecting emotions.",Language Arts & Disciplines,485,5,1,en

Dictionary of Concepts in Recreation and Leisure Studies,Stephen L. Smith,Greenwood,1990,"The obvious audience for this book is professionals, scholars, and students in the recreation field. However, many of these entries relate to other fields of interest. . . . [T]his work should find a place in academic libraries supporting curricula in recreation and related leisure studies. Reference Books Bulletin The vocabulary and major concepts of the new field of recreation and leisure studies are just developing and this dictionary is the first major attempt to describe and systematize those concepts. Although university departments devoted to the study of recreation and leisure have been in existence for over half a century, there has never been a comprehensive dictionary written for the field. The concepts included in the dictionary may be grouped into four general categories. The first of these include elemental concepts--those ideas that form the intellectual bedrock of the field. Then there are theoretical concepts- scholarly models or interpretations of the patterns and processes seen in recreation and leisure. Research and methodological concepts make up the third category. while the fourth include professional concepts representing some of the basic ideas inherent in the service side of the field. Each definition is organized chronologically, emphasizing the evolution of the term and its interpretation or application. Definitions also point to links between concepts listed in the dictionary. Numerous references and suggestions for further reading are included for readers wishing to pursue a topic in more detail. Faculty and graduate students in recreation and leisure studies will welcome this first comprehensive dictionary of the field, as will the libraries of universities and colleges with a recreation and leisure studies department. The historical material and the critical review of conflicting definitions is a special feature and one that makes this book not only useful as a dictionary, but also as a reference work on state of the art ideas and concepts in the field.",Reference,396,N/A,0,en

Pluralism is one of the founding creeds of the United States—yet America’s society and legal system continues to face deep, unsolved structural problems in dealing with differing cultural anxieties, and minority viewpoints. Inazu not only argues that it is possible to cohabitate peacefully in this country, but also lays out realistic guidelines for our society and legal system to achieve the new American dream through civic practices that value toleration over protest, humility over defensiveness, and persuasion over coercion""--cover page verso.",Business & Economics,177,N/A,0,en

Concentration,,One Point Six Technology Pvt Ltd,2010-10-12,"Concentration is sometimes spoken of as the ability to direct one's thinking in whatever direction one wishes to. We all have the ability to concentration span: this is the time we can concentrate on a specific task before our thoughts wander and our minds race from one thing to another. To deal with such times, we need to learn and practice concentration skills. In learning these skills the aim is to extend our concentration span, bearing in mind that we have different spans for different tasks. The main barriers to concentrating are boredom, anxiety and day-dreaming. Therefore, to improve our concentration, we fist need to counteract these barriers. Our ability to do so depends on our own enthusiasm for the task. The power of concentration is an invaluable and lifelong asset in our lives.",Self-Help,72,N/A,0,en

Analysis of Recreational Use of Selected Reservoirs in California,"V. S. Pankey, W. E. Johnston",N/A,1969,"The study is based on recreation use data collected at seven Corps of Engineers reservoirs in California. The two basic objectives of the study were to evaluate and attempt to isolate factors influencing recreation use, and develop recreation use prediction models. The technique used is multiple linear regression. The study generalizes the 'Clawson-Hotelling' prediction model for estimating demand at selected reservoirs in California using distance from the site as a proxy for price. Alternative prediction models employ distance zones about sites or county of origin of users of each site, and results from the alternative models are compared. The various factors or variables examined included socio-economic variables relating to income, age, education, urbanization, and population of the zones (counties) and certain site specific variables to differentiate either quality and/or quantity of the recreation experience at reservoirs. Findings of the study relate only to recreation use prediction at reservoir sites in California. However, these findings will provide the bases for development of more sophisticated prediction models having wider application and also for further studies in the determination of the economic value of water-based recreation.

Barriers to Play and Recreation for Children and Young People with Disabilities. Exploring Environmental Factors,"Maria Prellwitz, Annemie Desoete, Angharad Beckett, Carol Barron, Deborah Fenney Salkeld, Helen Lynch, Marieke Coussens, Nan Cannon Jones",N/A,2017,"This report reviews international research into the barriers to play for children with disabilities. The authors come from different disciplinary backgrounds, in Sociology, Social Policy, Anthropology, Occupational Health and Education and bring different concerns to this review. They are united, however, in their adoption of a rights-based perspective. The UNCRC and UNCRPD emphasise the right to play for children with disabilities. Play is vital for child development. The problem of 'play deprivation' for many children with disabilities is very real. Yet the right to, and value of 'play for the sake of play', for fun and recreation, must not be forgotten in relation to the lives of children with disabilities. The focus in this report is upon barriers to play that exist beyond the minds and bodies of individual children, within a 'disabling' environment. Barriers include those associated with the design of the built environment, social attitudes and professional practices. The report maps an agenda for further research in this area, emphasising the need for participatory methodologies that capture the views and voices of children with disabilities, their friends and families, on this important issue of play.",Social sciences (General),0,N/A,0,en

Up to This Pointe,Jennifer Longo,Random House Books for Young Readers,2016-01-19,"Harper had a plan. It went south. Hand this utterly unique contemporary YA to anyone who loves ballet or is a little too wrapped up in their Plan A. (It's okay to fail, people!) Harper Scott is a dancer. She and her best friend, Kate, have one goal: becoming professional ballerinas. And Harper won’t let anything—or anyone—get in the way of The Plan, not even the boy she and Kate are both drawn to. Harper is a Scott. She’s related to Robert Falcon Scott, the explorer who died racing Amundsen and Shackleton to the South Pole. Amundsen won because he had a plan, and Harper has always followed his model. So when Harper’s life takes an unexpected turn, she finagles (read: lies) her way to the icy dark of McMurdo Station . . . in Antarctica. Extreme, but somehow fitting—apparently she has always been in the dark, dancing on ice this whole time. And no one warned her. Not her family, not her best friend, not even the boy who has somehow found a way into her heart. It will take a visit from Shackleton's ghost--the explorer who didn't make it to the South Pole, but who got all of his men out alive--to teach Harper that success isn't always what's important, sometimes it's more important to learn how to fail successfully.

Future Has Other Plans,"Jon Kohl, Steve McCool",Fulcrum Publishing,2016-12-01,"Crisis has enveloped the more than 200,000 nationally and regionally protected natural and cultural heritage sites around the world. Heritage managers – those who manage natural sites such as national parks, wilderness areas, and biosphere reserves, as well as those who manage cultural sites including historic monuments, battlefields, heritage cities, and ancient rock art sites – face an urgent need to confront this crisis, and each day that they don't, more of our planet's common heritage disappears. Although heritage management and implementation suffer from a lack of money, time, personnel, information, and political will, The Future Has Other Plans argues that deeper causes to current problems lurk in the discipline itself. Drawing on decades of practical experience in global heritage management and case studies from around the world, Jon Kohl and Steve McCool provide an innovative solution for conserving these valuable protected areas. Merging interdisciplinary and evolving management paradigms, the authors introduce a new kind of holistic planning approach that integrates the practice of heritage management and conservation with operational realities.",Nature,406,N/A,0,en

Stokely Speaks,"Stokely Carmichael (Kwame Ture), Mumia Abu-Jamal",Chicago Review Press,2007-02-01,"In the speeches and articles collected in this book, the black activist, organizer, and freedom fighter Stokely Carmichael traces the dramatic changes in his own consciousness and that of black Americans that took place during the evolving movements of Civil Rights, Black Power, and Pan-Africanism. Unique in his belief that the destiny of African Americans could not be separated from that of oppressed people the world over, Carmichael's Black Power principles insisted that blacks resist white brainwashing and redefine themselves. He was concerned not only with racism and exploitation, but with cultural integrity and the colonization of Africans in America. In these essays on racism, Black Power, the pitfalls of conventional liberalism, and solidarity with the oppressed masses and freedom fighters of all races and creeds, Carmichael addresses questions that still confront the black world and points to a need for an ideology of black and African liberation, unification, and transformation.",Political Science,168,N/A,0,en

Free the Beaches,Andrew W. Kahrl,Yale University Press,2018-03-20,"“A well-documented—and dispiriting—history of prejudice and inequality . . . An unsparing exposé of white supremacy among Northern elites.” —Kirkus Reviews During the long, hot summers of the late 1960s and 1970s, one man began a campaign to open some of America’s most exclusive beaches to minorities and the urban poor. That man was anti-poverty activist and one-time presidential candidate Ned Coll of Connecticut, a state that permitted public access to a mere seven miles of its 253-mile shoreline. Nearly all of the state’s coast was held privately, for the most part by white, wealthy residents. This book is the first to tell the story of the controversial protester who gathered a band of determined African American mothers and children and challenged the racist, exclusionary tactics of homeowners in a state synonymous with liberalism. Coll’s legacy of remarkable successes—and failures—illuminates how our nation’s fragile coasts have not only become more exclusive in subsequent decades but also have suffered greater environmental destruction and erosion as a result of that private ownership. Winner of the Homer D. Babbidge Award, sponsored by the Association for the Study of Connecticut History Winner of the 2019 Connecticut Book Awards, non-fiction category, sponsored by Connecticut Center for the Book “This is a life story brimming with humanity and a great antidote to life under global capitalism, in which privatization is all the rage. Andrew Kahrl’s book is sure to have a sorely needed humanizing effect on all its readers.” —Ted Steinberg, award-winning author of Gotham Unbound: The Ecological History of Greater New York",History,433,N/A,0,en

Planning and the Rural Environment,"Joan Davidson, Gerald Wibberley",Elsevier,2016-04-20,"Planning and the Rural Environment examines the environmental issues affecting countryside planning. Emphasis is placed on the look and feel of the open countryside, the function and appearance of the rural environment, rather than the problems of its people and the settlements in which they live. Also discussed is the conflict of interest generated between some of the major planning systems concerned with the development of rural activities and the protection of rural resources. Comprised of 13 chapters, this volume begins with an assessment of conflicting views of how a countryside of the future should develop and the degree of control and direction that should take place. The following chapters consider how the emerging range of environmental problems and opportunities in rural planning can best be illustrated. In particular, the dominance of agriculture as a rural activity is analyzed, together with forest and woodland management; leisure activity in the countryside; and conservation of resources and wildlife. The next section is devoted to uplands and the urban fringe, paying particular attention to some of the ways in which rural interests interact in two very different areas. Finally, the development of rural planning is reviewed and issues that are expected to shape the countryside of the future are considered. This book should be of interest to postgraduate students of rural planning and specialists in various fields of countryside planning.",Political Science,256,N/A,0,en

Nazi-Organized Recreation and Entertainment in the Third Reich,Julia Timpe,Palgrave Macmillan,2017-03-10,"This book explores the activities of the Nazi regime's vast leisure programme. Shortly after coming to power in Germany, it began a large-scale undertaking to bring happiness and a good life to so-called 'Aryan' Germans, carried out by the Nazi leisure organization Kraft durch Freude. Julia Timpe traces Kraft durch Freude's practices and propaganda from 1933 through the Second World War, and analyses Nazi-organized sports classes, entertainment events, and beautification campaigns for industrial sites and the countryside, as well as Kraft durch Freude's activities in entertaining German soldiers and concentration camp guards. Contributing to newer scholarship which focuses on the integratory force of the Nazi promise of a unified 'racial community' of all 'Aryan' Germans, this book highlights that Kraft durch Freude's 'everyday production of joy' was central to Nazism, closely connected to the destructive side of the Third Reich, and ultimately a major reason for Nazism's success among the German population.",History,0,N/A,0,en

Social Science Theory for Environmental Sustainability,Marc J. Stern,Oxford University Press,2018-06-22,"Social-ecological challenges call for a far better integration of the social sciences into conservation training and practice. Environmental problems are, first and foremost, people problems. Without better understandings of the people involved, solutions are often hard to come by, regardless of expertise in biology, ecology, or other traditional conservation sciences. This novel book provides an accessible survey of a broad range of theories widely applicable to environmental problems that students and practitioners can apply to their work. It serves as a simple reference guide to illuminate the value and utility of social science theories for the practice of environmental conservation. As part of the Techniques in Ecology and Conservation Series, it will be a vital resource for conservation scientists, students, and practitioners to better navigate the social complexities of applying their work to real-world problem-solving.",Nature,308,N/A,0,en

Beyond the Urban Fringe,"Rutherford H. Platt, George Macinko",U of Minnesota Press,1983,"Beyond the Urban Fringe was first published in 1983. Minnesota Archive Editions uses digital technology to make long-unavailable books once again accessible, and are published unaltered from the original University of Minnesota Press editions. The non-metropolitan hinterland of the United States is no longer the placid and bucolic countryside celebrated by Currier and Ives. As urban America imposes ever-increasing demands upon the nation's resources, energy, water, food, recreation and scenery, peace and quiet are all sought in the land beyond the urban fringe. Certain dramatic changes in non-metropolitan America are already apparent. Census figures from 1980 documented that the population of rural areas and small towns was increasing more rapidly than that of metropolitan areas or the nation as a whole. The interstate highway network affords unprecedented access to small cities and towns, broadening commuting patterns and enabling industries to relocate outside of cities. During the 1960s and 1970s millions of acres were carved yo for second homes and recreational developments, a practice which often inflated the price of rural land. Beyond the Urban Fringe deals with problems arising from this transformation of nonmetropolitan America. It is based on reports given at a 1980 conference sponsored by the Association of American Geographers and funded by the National Science Foundation, with the participation of the U.S. Geological Survey and the Office of Water Research and Technology. The authors represent a wide range of disciplines--geography, resource economics, rural sociology, planning, law, and physics--and deal with topics not often found in a single volume: the character of land-use change in non-metropolitan areas, rural economic growth and decline, the rural land market, the growth and decline of small towns, farmland policy, remote sensing in rural areas, the impact of energy development on land use, hazardous waste disposal, and nuclear plant siting in nonurban areas. Geographers, planners, resource economists, and others concerned with environmental and resource management will find Beyond the Urban Fringe a valuable source of current research on a subject of central importance at all levels of government.","Land use, Rural",442,N/A,0,en

Did Ye Hear Mammy Died?,Séamas O'Reilly,"Little, Brown",2022-06-07,"A heart-warming and hilarious family memoir of growing up as one of eleven siblings raised by a single dad in Northern Ireland at the end of the Troubles. Séamas O’Reilly’s mother died when he was five, leaving him, his ten (!) brothers and sisters, and their beloved father in their sprawling bungalow in rural Derry. It was the 1990s; the Troubles were a background rumble, but Séamas was more preoccupied with dinosaurs, Star Wars, and the actual location of heaven than the political climate. ­ An instant bestseller in Ireland, Did Ye Hear Mammy Died? is a book about a family of loud, argumentative, musical, sarcastic, grief-stricken siblings, shepherded into adulthood by a man whose foibles and reticence were matched only by his love for his children and his determination that they would flourish. “In this joyous, wildly unconventional memoir, Séamas O'Reilly tells the story of losing his mother as a child and growing up with ten siblings in Northern Ireland during the final years of the Troubles as a raucous comedy, a grand caper that is absolutely bursting with life.”―Patrick Radden Keefe, NYT bestselling author of Say Nothing and Empire of Pain One of NPR’s Best Books of the Year",Biography & Autobiography,192,N/A,0,en

Sport and Recreation in Canadian History,Carly Adams,Human Kinetics,2020-10-16,"Serving as a foundation for critical discussion about the importance of the past, Sport and Recreation in Canadian History covers the historical events, people, and moments that shape Canadian sport in the present and future. While this text focuses on sport and recreation practices on these lands now claimed by Canada, it is set within a larger historical context of interconnecting social and cultural practices to speak to the sustained tensions, complexities, and contradictions prevalent in Canadian society. The editor, Dr. Carly Adams, and her 17 contributing experts from across Canada bring the latest research in all areas of Canadian sport history to life and present a thorough look at the nation’s past events. The text challenges the dominant narratives and encourages students to think critically about Canadian sport history. It examines how gender, ethnicity, race, religion, ability, class, and other systems of oppression and privilege have shaped sport and recreation practices, with Canadian sporting culture reproducing many of the same oppressive systems that exist on the larger scale. Sport and Recreation in Canadian History separates itself from its competitors by providing an abundance of pedagogical aids. Sidebars highlighting prominent people provide glimpses of figures who made a significant impact on Canadian sport history. Transformative Moment sidebars focus on significant events as they relate to specific themes, such as gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, or ability. A comprehensive timeline showcases where important events fell in relation to one another, while the text acknowledges the problem of presenting history in a linear way and provides a more nuanced discussion of time. Descriptions of primary source documents—such as newspaper articles, photographs, and historical documents—are accompanied by explanations of how sport historians work with these documents. Sport and Recreation in Canadian History asks readers to think differently about the history of Canadian sport, and it examines how past people, moments, and events continue to shape 21st-century sport.",Sports & Recreation,441,N/A,0,en

Oh Crap! Potty Training,Jamie Glowacki,Simon and Schuster,2015-06-16,"From potty-training expert and social worker Jamie Glowacki, who’s already helped over half a million families successfully toilet train their preschoolers, comes a newly revised and updated guide that’s “straight-up, parent-tested, and funny to boot” (Amber Dusick, author of Parenting: Illustrated with Crappy Pictures). Worried about potty training? Let Jamie Glowacki, potty-training expert, show you how it’s done. Her six-step, proven process to get your toddler out of diapers and onto the toilet has already worked for tens of thousands of kids and their parents. Here’s the good news: your child is probably ready to be potty trained EARLIER than you think (ideally, between 20–30 months), and it can be done FASTER than you expect (most kids get the basics in a few days—but Jamie’s got you covered even if it takes a little longer). If you’ve ever said to yourself: -How do I know if my kid is ready? -Why won’t my child poop in the potty? -How do I avoid “potty power struggles”? -How can I get their daycare provider on board? -My kid was doing so well—why is he regressing? -And what about nighttime?! Oh Crap! Potty Training can solve all of these (and other) common issues. This isn’t theory, you’re not bribing with candy, and there are no gimmicks. This is real-world, from-the-trenches potty training information—all the questions and all the answers you need to do it once and be done with diapers for good.",Family & Relationships,186,N/A,0,en

Prophetic Culture,Federico Campagna,Bloomsbury Publishing,2021-06-17,"Selected as one of The Tablet's Books of the Year 2021 Throughout history, different civilisations have given rise to many alternative worlds. Each of them was the enactment of a unique story about the structure of reality, the rhythm of time and the range of what it is possible to think and to do in the course of a life. Cosmological stories, however, are fragile things. As soon as they lose their ring of truth and their significance for living, the worlds that they brought into existence disintegrate. New and alien worlds emerge from their ruins. Federico Campagna explores the twilight of our contemporary notion of reality, and the fading of the cosmological story that belonged to the civilisation of Westernised Modernity. How are we to face the challenge of leaving a fertile cultural legacy to those who will come after the end of our future? How can we help the creation of new worlds out of the ruins of our own?",Philosophy,281,N/A,0,en

35 Dumb Things Well-Intended People Say,Maura Cullen,Morgan James Publishing,2008-09-01,"“The go-to guide on diversity. . . . A must-read book for [anyone] who wants to understand what it takes to respect and work with today’s global workforce.” —Brendon Burchard, #1 New York Times–bestselling author of High Performance Habits A powerful diversity training tool from one of the most respected diversity trainers. Even well-intended people can cause harm. Have you ever heard yourself or someone else say: “Some of my best friends are . . . (Black, White, Asian, etc.)”? “I don’t think of you as . . . (Gay, Disabled, Jewish, etc.)”? “I don’t see color, I’m colorblind”? These statements and dozens like them can build a divide between us and the people we interact with. Though well-intended, they often widen the diversity gap sometimes causing irreparable harm personally and professionally. If you’ve ever wanted to be more effective in your communication with others, or have been afraid of saying the wrong thing, then this concise guide is essential to becoming more inclusive and diversity-smart. “Good intentions are not enough in this well written, down to earth, no blame, insightful book. If you ever found yourself unsure of what to say, then this book will provide you valuable tools to be more effective every day.” —Judith H. Katz, Ed.

Welcome to Pawnee,Jim O'Heir,HarperCollins,2024-11-19,"Jim O’Heir, who played Jerry (or Garry or Larry) on Parks and Recreation and co-hosts the hit podcast Parks and Recollection, brings fans a heartfelt behind-the-scenes look at one of America’s most beloved sitcoms, brimming with never-before-told stories featuring the cast and crew, along with dozens of unseen photos! For seven seasons, Leslie Knope and the Parks and Recreation gang charmed millions of viewers with their quirky antics and unwavering positivity. The sitcom continues to be a fan-favorite for streaming services today, nearly a decade after its finale. Now for the first time, Jim O’Heir, who played the lovable Jerry (or, well, Garry/Larry/Terry/Barry, depending on the episode), invites readers back to Pawnee for an exclusive look behind the scenes. Joined by some of his Parks and Rec pals, including Chris Pratt, Retta, Rob Lowe, and showrunners Greg Daniels and Mike Schur, O’Heir reveals how this “little show that could” came to be, thanks to the tireless dedication and comedic genius of Amy Poehler, Nick Offerman, and the rest of the gang. As the show found its footing, the cast quickly bonded into a tight-knit family. Here O’Heir shares all his favorite unforgettable memories both on and off camera, from hilarious unscripted moments and epic dance-offs in the hair and makeup trailers, to iconic birthday parties at Rashida Jones’s house and quiet bonfires in Nick Offerman’s backyard.

Historic Tales of Watchung,Robert A. Mayers,Arcadia Publishing,2020,"The borough of Watchung's forests, farmlands, lakes and mountain vistas have been traversed by man for thousands of years. The Leni-Lenapes settled along the banks of the Stony Brook and Watchung Lake, naming the area Wacht Unks, or ""High Hills."" Attracted by its abundant natural resources, European settlers began to farm the area in the seventeenth century. The citizens took up arms during the Revolutionary War, serving as minutemen in the Somerset County Militia, protecting the strategic Stony Brook Pass. The town survived an existential crisis in 1924 as the state attempted and failed to convert the region into a massive water reservoir. Local author and historian Robert A.

Global Challenges in Recreational Fisheries,Øystein Aas,John Wiley & Sons,2008-04-30,"Recreational or sports fishing is a multi-billion dollar industry worldwide and in many countries represents an important social and cultural activity. In some regions, it also contributes significant income to tourism and tackle businesses. In addition to its importance from a social and economic standpoint, the impact of recreational fishing on the environment and on food webs can often be substantial. This important book represents the major output from the 4th World Recreational Fishing Conference held in Norway in June 2005. The conference focused on several topics and targeted all stakeholders in the recreational fishing sector, including researchers, managers, NGO representatives and businesses. This book reflects that diversity, encompassing a variety of approaches within its carefully selected and fully peer-reviewed chapters. Global Challenges in Recreational Fisheries is an essential purchase for fisheries managers, multidisciplinary fisheries scientists, marine and freshwater biologists, ecologists and environmental scientists. The book is highly relevant for graduate university courses in fisheries management and fisheries sciences.

One of the Service's strengths has been its pragmatism and adaptability, but current guidelines are hard to come by and the decisions of the future will be neither simple nor easy.

The Rise of the States,Jon C. Teaford,JHU Press,2002-05-03,"In The Rise of the States, noted urban historian Jon C. Teaford explores the development of state government in the United States from the end of the nineteenth century to the so-called renaissance of states at the end of the twentieth. Arguing that state governments were not lethargic backwaters that suddenly stirred to life in the 1980s, Teaford shows instead how state governments were continually adapting and expanding throughout the past century. While previous historical scholarship focused on the states, if at all, as retrograde relics of simpler times, Teaford describes how states actively assumed new responsibilities, developed new sources of revenue, and created new institutions. Teaford examines the evolution of the structure, function, and finances of state government during the Progressive Era, the 1920s, the Great Depression, the post–World War II years, and the post–reapportionment era beginning in the late 1960s. State governments, he explains, played an active role not only in the creation, governance, and management of the political units that made up the state but also in dealing with the growth of business, industries, and education. Not all states chose the same solutions to common problems. For Teaford, the diversity of responses points to the growing vitality and maturity of state governments as the twentieth century unfolded.",History,288,N/A,0,en

Object Relations and Intersubjective Theories in the Practice of Psychotherapy,Elinor Parks,Routledge,2020-01-29,"This volume explores the relationship between language and culture whilst considering its implications for the teaching of Modern Foreign Languages in higher education. Drawing on a comparative empirical study conducted at universities both in the UK and US, this text problematizes the impacts of a separation of language and content in German degree modules. Illustrating the need for a curriculum which fosters the development of intercultural competence and criticality, Parks reconceptualizes established models of Criticality (Barnett) and Intercultural Communicative Competence (Byram). The chapters in this volume discuss a range of important topics including; language graduates with deep translingual and transcultural competence, observed differences and similarities between British and American universities and faculty and student voices: developing intercultural competence and criticality. Aimed at scholars with research interests in Intercultural Communication, Language Education and Applied linguistics, this volume provides a thorough discussion for the ways in which Modern Language programmes in higher education can be improved. Additionally, those carrying out research in the fields of Language Teaching and Language Policy in higher education will find Developing Critical Cultural Awareness in Modern Languages to be of great relevance.",Psychology,274,N/A,0,en

Yet, until now, no book has thoroughly explored that impact, though this topic is critical for leisure professionals to understand as they shape services and programs to meet the needs of the diverse populations they serve. Race, Ethnicity, and Leisure: Perspectives on Research, Theory, and Practice brings together 28 world-renowned researchers who provide a comprehensive review and unified perspective on leisure in relation to five minority populations in the United States and Canada: African Americans, Latino Americans, Asian North Americans, Indigenous peoples, and religious minority groups. This text offers a compendium of knowledge as it • synthesizes leisure research on race and ethnicity and discusses how changing demographics will affect leisure behaviors and activities in the 21st century; • explains the leisure behaviors and participation patterns of racial and ethnic minority groups in the United States and Canada; • explores issues, including natural resource recreation, physical activity and health, tourism, and sport, as they relate to recreation activities among minorities; and • presents an international perspective, delving into the leisure behaviors of minority groups in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and East Asia. Race, Ethnicity, and Leisure examines the current theories and practices related to minority leisure and reviews numerous issues related to these diverse groups’ leisure, including needs and motivations, constraints, and discrimination. The authors consider leisure behavior of ethnic and racial groups , investigating issues such as types of recreation participation among specific groups, recreation in specific environments, and factors affecting participation. The book also suggests future directions in research and professional practice, guiding students and professionals in addressing the demographic changes in the U.S. and Canadian populations. The result is an unprecedented text that offers an extensive look at the changing landscape of recreation, leisure pursuits, our world, and the populations that are driving these changes. As such, Race, Ethnicity, and Leisure is an essential text for those preparing to enter the recreation and leisure field.",Sports & Recreation,386,4,1,en

How To Watch Television,"Ethan Thompson, Jason Mittell",NYU Press,2013-09-16,"Examines social and cultural phenomena through the lens of different television shows We all have opinions about the television shows we watch, but television criticism is about much more than simply evaluating the merits of a particular show and deeming it ‘good’ or ‘bad.’ Rather, criticism uses the close examination of a television program to explore that program’s cultural significance, creative strategies, and its place in a broader social context. How to Watch Television brings together forty original essays from today’s leading scholars on television culture, writing about the programs they care (and think) the most about. Each essay focuses on a particular television show, demonstrating one way to read the program and, through it, our media culture. The essays model how to practice media criticism in accessible language, providing critical insights through analysis—suggesting a way of looking at TV that students and interested viewers might emulate. The contributors discuss a wide range of television programs past and present, covering many formats and genres, spanning fiction and non-fiction, broadcast and cable, providing a broad representation of the programs that are likely to be covered in a media studies course. While the book primarily focuses on American television, important programs with international origins and transnational circulation are also covered. Addressing television series from the medium’s earliest days to contemporary online transformations of television, How to Watch Television is designed to engender classroom discussion among television critics of all backgrounds.",Psychology,407,N/A,0,en

The papers cover the gamut of methods that are typically classified as revealed preference approaches - including: recreation demand models, hedonic methods, and averting behavior methods, as well as efforts to combine stated and revealed preferences. While this collection is far from exhaustive, the editors have included papers they believe will represent the state of the art in the theory and application of revealed preference methods, contribute to development of the state of the art, or raise fundamental challenges and insights that will drive the research agenda in the coming years.",Business & Economics,610,N/A,0,en

The papers identify the origins of the concept of existence value, discuss the way in which it came to play a role in natural resource damage assessment, explain the history behind the contingent valuation method (which is being used increasingly to measure lost existence values), identify the pros and cons of this technique, review some of the law and federal rulemaking that have evolved from natural resource damage cases, and suggest a research agenda for the future.

Preference Data for Environmental Valuation,"John Whitehead, Tim Haab, Ju-Chin Huang",Routledge,2012-03-15,"The monetary valuation of environmental goods and services has evolved from a fringe field of study in the late 1970s and early 1980s to a primary focus of environmental economists over the past decade. Despite its rapid growth, practitioners of valuation techniques often find themselves defending their practices to both users of the results of applied studies and, perhaps more troubling, to other practitioners. One of the more heated threads of this internal debate over valuation techniques revolves around the types of data to use in performing a valuation study. In the infant years of the development of valuation techniques, two schools of thought emerged: the revealed preference school and the stated preference school, the latter of which is perhaps most associated with the contingent valuation method. In the midst of this debate an exciting new approach to non-market valuation was developed in the 1990s: a combination and joint estimation of revealed preference and stated preference data. There are two primary objectives for this book. One objective is to fill a gap in the nonmarket valuation ""primer"" literature. A number of books have appeared over the past decade that develop the theory and methods of nonmarket valuation but each takes an individual nonmarket valuation method approach. This book considers each of these valuation methods in combination with another method. These relationships can be exploited econometrically to obtain more valid and reliable estimates of willingness-to-pay relative to the individual methods. The second objective is to showcase recent and novel applications of data combination and joint estimation via a set of original, state-of-the-art studies that are contributed by leading researchers in the field. This book will be accessible to economists and consultants working in business or government, as well as an invaluable resource for researchers and students alike.",Business & Economics,343,N/A,0,en
Benefits Assessment,"J.D. Bentkover, V.T. Covello, J.L. Mumpower",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"In recent years there has been substantial interest in benefits assessment methods, especially as these methods are used to assess health, safety, and environmental issues. At least part of this interest can be traced to Executive Order 12291, issued by President Ronald Reagan in 1981. This Executive Order requires Federal agencies to perform benefits assessments of pro posed major regulations and prohibits them from taking regulatory action unless potential benefits exceed potential costs to society. Heightened interest in benefits assessment methods has in tum given rise to greater recognition of the inherent difficulties in performing such assess ments. For example, many benefits that are intuitively felt to be most important are also among the most difficult to measure. It can be difficult to identify the full range of both benefits and costs. The choice of an appro priate discount rate for comparing benefits and costs over time is proble matic. Even when benefits are quantifiable in principle and agreement can be reached on their valuation, required d,ata may not be available. Thus considerable uncertainty is built into most benefit estimates, even when they are based on the best available data. In light of the complexities and difficulties associated with the perform ance of a benefits assessment, this book reviews the current state of theoretical and methodological knowledge in the field. The review is extensive in that it covers over fifty years of research, theoretical develop ment, and practice.",Technology & Engineering,245,N/A,0,en

Volume 2,"Partha Dasgupta, Karl-Göran Mäler",Clarendon Press,1997-03-13,"Two and a half billion people are affected directly on a day to day basis by the allocation and use of purely local resources. Yet `official' development economics has concentrated on headline international issues and only recently begun to take account of the dependence of poor countries on their natural resources, the link between acute poverty and environmental degredation, and the problems associated with the management of local common property such as soil and soil cover, water, forests and their products, animals and fisheries. In these volumes, which are part of the WIDER programme on the Economics of the Environment, expert contributors provide a set of authoritative studies of emerging development issues, ranging from foundational matters to case studies, original research (in areas where there has been a paucity of work) to survey papers. They address both analytic and empirical issues on the role of environmental resources in the development process, presenting explanations of existing situations and policies for the future. A wealth of interests and backgrounds is represented and reflected in the cross-fertilization between papers.",Business & Economics,360,N/A,0,en

Its perspective is dynamic, including a consideration of the dynamics of natural systems, and global, with attention paid to issues in both rich and poor nations. In addition to chapters on well-established topics such as the theory and practice of pollution regulation, it includes chapters on new areas of environmental economics research related to common property management regimes; population and poverty; mechanism design; political economy of regulation; experimental evaluations of policy instruments; and technological change.",Business & Economics,647,N/A,0,en
Handbook of Environmental Economics,"Karl-Goran Maler, Jeffrey R. Vincent",Elsevier,2005-12-09,"Much applied environmental economics is concerned with the valuation of changes in environmental quality. Obtaining reliable valuation estimates requires attention to theoretical and econometric issues that are often quite subtle. Volume 2 of the Handbook of Environmental Economics presents both the theory and the practice of environmental valuation. It synthesizes the vast literature that has accumulated since the publication of the Handbook of Natural Resource and Energy Economics two decades ago. It includes chapters on individual valuation methods written by researchers responsible for fundamental advances in those methods. It also includes cross-cutting chapters that deal with aspects of welfare theory, uncertainty, experimental methods, and public health that are pertinent to valuation. Throughout the volume, attention is paid to research and policy issues that arise not only in high-income countries, where most of the theory and econometrics that underlie applied valuation methods have been developed, but also in poorer parts of the world. The volume provides a state-of-the-art reference for scholars and practitioners alike.",Business & Economics,647,N/A,0,en

Environmental Policies for Agricultural Pollution Control,"J. S.

These have become major policy issues in many countries, with the main polluting effect being on water quality. As with other types of pollution, significant reductions in agriculture's contribution to water pollution requires the application of either enforceable regulatory approaches or changes in the economic environment, so that farmers adopt environmentally-friendly production practices. Providing a review and guide to the policy options and their economic administrative and political merits, the reader can develop an understanding of these options and their merits in the emerging policy context. The principal focus is on the developed world, particularly North America and Europe. The book is aimed at advanced students, researchers and professionals in agricultural economics and policy, and environmental and pollution sciences.",Business & Economics,240,N/A,0,en

Canadian Rockies Backroad Mapbook,Russell Mussio,Mussio Ventures Ltd.,2016-07-02,"This book focuses on the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks — an interconnected system of provincial and national parks covering more than 30,000 square kilometres (18,630 mi2). These parks vary in popularity and access – some see millions of visitors each year, while others see visitors in the tens of thousands. Some parks are easily accessed from a major highway, while others require rigorous journeys by foot, horse or plane. Each of these parks offers a unique twist on the dramatic landscapes that define the Rockies – towering mountain peaks, rushing rivers, ancient glaciers, wildflower-filled meadows, brilliant blue lakes and dense forests make up this outdoor paradise. With so much area to explore, it can be overwhelming trying to decide on where to go. Luckily, our Canadian Rockies Mapbook provides a well-organized and easy-to-use breakdown of the region’s parks to help you decide on the adventure that is right for you. With state-of-the-art topographic maps, detailed trip-planning resources and meticulously researched adventure listings, our Mapbook will ensure you make the most out of your Rockies experience.",Travel,208,N/A,0,en

Water Resource Systems Planning and Management,"Daniel P. Loucks, Eelco van Beek",Springer,2017-03-02,"This book is open access under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license. This revised, updated textbook presents a systems approach to the planning, management, and operation of water resources infrastructure in the environment. Previously published in 2005 by UNESCO and Deltares (Delft Hydraulics at the time), this new edition, written again with contributions from Jery R. Stedinger, Jozef P. M. Dijkman, and Monique T. Villars, is aimed equally at students and professionals. It introduces readers to the concept of viewing issues involving water resources as a system of multiple interacting components and scales. It offers guidelines for initiating and carrying out water resource system planning and management projects. It introduces alternative optimization, simulation, and statistical methods useful for project identification, design, siting, operation and evaluation and for studying post-planning issues. The authors cover both basin-wide and urban water issues and present ways of identifying and evaluating alternatives for addressing multiple-purpose and multi-objective water quantity and quality management challenges. Reinforced with cases studies, exercises, and media supplements throughout, the text is ideal for upper-level undergraduate and graduate courses in water resource planning and management as well as for practicing planners and engineers in the field.",Technology & Engineering,635,N/A,0,en

Where the Deer and the Antelope Play,Nick Offerman,Penguin,2021-10-12,"A humorous and rousing set of literal and figurative sojourns as well as a mission statement about comprehending, protecting, and truly experiencing the outdoors, fueled by three journeys undertaken by actor, humorist, and New York Times bestselling author Nick Offerman Nick Offerman has always felt a particular affection for the Land of the Free—not just for the people and their purported ideals but to the actual land itself: the bedrock, the topsoil, and everything in between that generates the health of your local watershed. In his new book, Nick takes a humorous, inspiring, and elucidating trip to America's trails, farms, and frontier to examine the people who inhabit the land, what that has meant to them and us, and to the land itself, both historically and currently. In 2018, Wendell Berry posed a question to Nick, a query that planted the seed of this book, sending Nick on two memorable journeys with pals—a hiking trip to Glacier National Park with his friends Jeff Tweedy and George Saunders, as well as an extended visit to his friend James Rebanks, the author of The Shepherd's Life and English Pastoral. He followed that up with an excursion that could only have come about in 2020—Nick and his wife, Megan Mullally, bought an Airstream trailer to drive across (several of) the United States. These three quests inspired some “deep-ish"" thinking from Nick, about the history and philosophy of our relationship with nature in our national parks, in our farming, and in our backyards; what we mean when we talk about conservation; and the importance of outdoor recreation, all subjects very close to Nick's heart. With witty, heartwarming stories and a keen insight into the human problems we all confront, this is both a ramble through and celebration of the land we all love.",Humor,353,N/A,0,en

After a traumatic past, Ivy is is now a philanthropist with a seemingly perfect life.

Human Dimension and Interior Space,"Julius Panero, Martin Zelnik",Watson-Guptill,2014-01-21,"The study of human body measurements on a comparative basis is known as anthropometrics. Its applicability to the design process is seen in the physical fit, or interface, between the human body and the various components of interior space. Human Dimension and Interior Space is the first major anthropometrically based reference book of design standards for use by all those involved with the physical planning and detailing of interiors, including interior designers, architects, furniture designers, builders, industrial designers, and students of design. The use of anthropometric data, although no substitute for good design or sound professional judgment should be viewed as one of the many tools required in the design process. This comprehensive overview of anthropometrics consists of three parts. The first part deals with the theory and application of anthropometrics and includes a special section dealing with physically disabled and elderly people. It provides the designer with the fundamentals of anthropometrics and a basic understanding of how interior design standards are established. The second part contains easy-to-read, illustrated anthropometric tables, which provide the most current data available on human body size, organized by age and percentile groupings. Also included is data relative to the range of joint motion and body sizes of children. The third part contains hundreds of dimensioned drawings, illustrating in plan and section the proper anthropometrically based relationship between user and space. The types of spaces range from residential and commercial to recreational and institutional, and all dimensions include metric conversions. In the Epilogue, the authors challenge the interior design profession, the building industry, and the furniture manufacturer to seriously explore the problem of adjustability in design. They expose the fallacy of designing to accommodate the so-called average man, who, in fact, does not exist. Using government data, including studies prepared by Dr. Howard Stoudt, Dr. Albert Damon, and Dr. Ross McFarland, formerly of the Harvard School of Public Health, and Jean Roberts of the U.S. Public Health Service, Panero and Zelnik have devised a system of interior design reference standards, easily understood through a series of charts and situation drawings. With Human Dimension and Interior Space, these standards are now accessible to all designers of interior environments.",Architecture,322,N/A,0,en

For the Love of Cities,Peter Kageyama,N/A,2011,"The mutual love affair between people and their place is one of the most powerful influences in our lives, yet rarely thought of in terms of a relationship. As cities begin thinking of themselves as engaged in a relationship with their citizens, and citizens begin to consider their emotional connections with their places, we open up new possibilities in community, social and economic development by including the most powerful of motivators-the human heart-in our toolkit of city-making.The book explores what makes cities lovable, what motivates ordinary citizens to do extraordinary things for their places and how some cities, such as New Orleans, Detroit, and Cleveland are using that energy to fill in the gaps that ""official"" city makers have left as resources have disappeared. Meet those amazing people who are truly ""in love"" with their cities and learn how they are key to the future development of our communities. Praise for the book: What Kageyama has done is to introduce the vital piece into the urban discussion-- the matter of love; the piece without which all city building must fail, for ""love"" the corner stone of civic citizenship. It takes some bravura and acumen to champion the subject of love in the urban forum that wants to quantify, when only love qualifies and justifies the discussion of cities. Mr. Kageyama goes one step further. He provides precious indicators. Many city thinkers will follow suit, but for the time being, this is the essential book. Pier Giorgio Di Cicco Poet Laureate Emeritus, Toronto, Ontario Author of Municipal Mind: Manifestos for The Creative City For the Love of Cities succeeds in putting an exclamation point on the exceptional value of deepening the relationship that city dwellers feel for their neighborhoods by adding amenities such as parks, outdoor cafes, art galleries, trees, flowers and even sidewalks to create a meaningful sense of place. It also explores the often hidden added value of creative entrepreneurs in creating a sense of place that attracts, nurtures and retains citizens. The book is a love note from Author Peter Kageyama to cities everywhere that will prompt you to more closely examine your own relationship with where you live, work and play. Diane Egner Publisher and Managing Editor, 83 Degrees Media Former Book Editor, The Tampa Tribune For the Love of Cities is a must read for city changemakers.

Educating the Student Body,"Committee on Physical Activity and Physical Education in the School Environment, Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine",National Academies Press,2013-11-13,"Physical inactivity is a key determinant of health across the lifespan. A lack of activity increases the risk of heart disease, colon and breast cancer, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteoporosis, anxiety and depression and others diseases. Emerging literature has suggested that in terms of mortality, the global population health burden of physical inactivity approaches that of cigarette smoking. The prevalence and substantial disease risk associated with physical inactivity has been described as a pandemic. The prevalence, health impact, and evidence of changeability all have resulted in calls for action to increase physical activity across the lifespan. In response to the need to find ways to make physical activity a health priority for youth, the Institute of Medicine's Committee on Physical Activity and Physical Education in the School Environment was formed. Its purpose was to review the current status of physical activity and physical education in the school environment, including before, during, and after school, and examine the influences of physical activity and physical education on the short and long term physical, cognitive and brain, and psychosocial health and development of children and adolescents. Educating the Student Body makes recommendations about approaches for strengthening and improving programs and policies for physical activity and physical education in the school environment. This report lays out a set of guiding principles to guide its work on these tasks. These included: recognizing the benefits of instilling life-long physical activity habits in children; the value of using systems thinking in improving physical activity and physical education in the school environment; the recognition of current disparities in opportunities and the need to achieve equity in physical activity and physical education; the importance of considering all types of school environments; the need to take into consideration the diversity of students as recommendations are developed.

Contests in Higher Mathematics,Gabor J. Szekely,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"One of the most effective ways to stimulate students to enjoy intellectual efforts is the scientific competition. In 1894 the Hungarian Mathematical and Physical Society introduced a mathematical competition for high school students. The success of high school competitions led the Mathematical Society to found a college level contest, named after Miklós Schweitzer. The problems of the Schweitzer Contests are proposed and selected by the most prominent Hungarian mathematicians. This book collects the problems posed in the contests between 1962 and 1991 which range from algebra, combinatorics, theory of functions, geometry, measure theory, number theory, operator theory, probability theory, topology, to set theory. The second part contains the solutions. The Schweitzer competition is one of the most unique in the world. The experience shows that this competition helps to identify research talents.

The Fall of Public Man,Richard Sennett,Penguin UK,2003-01-30,"THE FALL OF PUBLIC MAN is a book in the great tradition of sociological scholarship. Sennett writes first of the tension between the public and private realms in which we live, arguing that different types of behaviour and activity are appropriate in each. He argues that the barrier between these different realms has been eroded, and that this breakdown is so profound that public man has been left with no certain idea of his role in society. Sennett sees the development of the city as the single most important element of the social change he describes, and puts his argument in its historical perspective through an analysis of the changes in our built environment from the 18th century to the present day.",Social Science,546,N/A,0,en

Recreation Business,JOHN R. KELLY,N/A,2018-06-21,"Recreation Business: Strategies for Success is a conversation about leisure-based businesses for classroom and online courses. From the point of view of a senior scholar who has studied leisure and its social contexts for 5 decades, Kelly begins by introducing the scope and variety of recreation businesses and discusses major issues in the field. Then he turns toward social and behavioral science research about recreation and leisure that has been developed since 1970, answering the question, how does this research guide and direct the beginning and operation of a recreation business? Throughout the book, Kelly encourages dialogue and learning through questions, cases, research ideas, debates, online resources, and more. The beginning is that leisure is different. The focus is on what a recreation business sells or rents: an experience. The crucial element is quality. And decades of study have yielded a lot of insight into how leisure experiences can be raised to a level that will attract and retain clients. John R. (Jack) Kelly",,190,N/A,0,en

Soul Recreation,Tom Schwanda,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2012-04-11,"Spiritually there is a great hunger today for contemplative and more satisfying experiences with God. Puritanism might seem to be an unlikely source for this, yet few groups in the history of Christian spirituality have written more extensively or wisely on the subject. Isaac Ambrose (1604-64), a relatively forgotten English Puritan, developed a theological foundation for the spiritual life based upon the Christian's intimate union with Christ, which the Puritans often called ""spiritual marriage."" Schwanda demonstrates that this vibrant relationship of union and communion with Jesus, inspired by the Holy Spirit, was manifested in a deep contemplative piety of gazing lovingly and gratefully upon God. At the same time, Ambrose did not neglect loving his neighbors. This study reveals how heavenly meditation was one of the significant practices engaged by Ambrose to cultivate spiritual intimacy and enjoyment of God. Further, his experiential reading of Scripture, in particular the Song of Songs, provided him with a language of ravishment and delight in God. This book provides a distinctively Protestant foundation for recovering the contemplative life while recognizing the significant contributions of the Western Catholic tradition.",Religion,315,N/A,0,en

After a chance encounter led to her being held captive in a disgusting house of horrors, she fought tooth and nail to escape the clutches of a man known only as The Slob. But while she may have fled the disastrous situation, the details of her struggle are now carved into her flesh and soul. Vera's son is the product of utter depravity. Harold, the sinister seed left by the man who took everything from her, continues to blossom in nauseating fashion. His features and habits are stomach-churning, vividly familiar, and becoming more disturbing by the day. Determined to coax out the bright side of her child that she sees an occasional glimpse of, Vera strives for normalcy. But will the faint light she's chasing shine through the darkness or will she be left cleaning up another gruesome mess? The sequel to Aron Beauregard's Splatterpunk Award-Nominated work of depravity, ""The Slob,"" will bring you back to the forefront of filth and carnage with a new, unqiue, and terrifying trajectory.

Kicking Center,Rachel Allison,Rutgers University Press,2018-08-30,"Winner of the 2018 Early Career Gender Scholar Award from the Sociologists for Women in Society-South Girls and young women participate in soccer at record levels and the Women’s National Team regularly draws media, corporate, and popular attention. Yet despite increased representation and visibility, gender disparities in opportunity, compensation, training resources, and media airtime persist in soccer, and two professional leagues for women have failed since 2000. In Kicking Center, Rachel Allison investigates a women’s soccer league seeking to break into the male-dominated center of U.S. professional sport. Through an examination of the challenges and opportunities identified by those working for and with this league, she demonstrates how gender inequality is both constructed and contested in professional sport. Allison details the complex constructions of race, class, gender, and sexuality in the selling and marketing of women’s soccer in a half-changed sports landscape characterized by both progress and backlash, and where professional sports are still understood to be men’s territory.",Sports & Recreation,209,N/A,0,en

Introduction to Adaptive Sport and Recreation,"Robin Hardin, Joshua R. Pate",Human Kinetics,2024-09-12,"As the number of adaptive sport and recreation programs increases, athletes with disabilities now have more opportunities than ever to participate in sports, recreation, and physical fitness. In response, students pursuing a career in sport management need to be fully prepared to incorporate adaptive sport and recreation into their organizations. Introduction to Adaptive Sport and Recreation is a groundbreaking text designed to address this need. Written and edited by a team of esteemed educators and professionals, this comprehensive textbook offers a broad exploration of sport and recreation for people with disabilities within the framework of sport management. It begins with social and theoretical discussions covering topics such as defining disability, confronting ableism, considering the concepts of inclusion versus integration, and understanding contact theory and social isolation theory. Students are exposed to participation barriers faced by athletes with disabilities and learn about models of disability perception and legal efforts to address disparities (such as the Americans with Disabilities Act). Also discussed are the disability rights movement as well as legal efforts and policies that have affected access to sport and recreation opportunities for people with disabilities. Perhaps the most visible example of adaptive sports is the Paralympic Games. The history of this competition is explored in detail, and the text offers an overview of other elite adaptive global competitions as well. Differences between the Paralympics and the Special Olympics are examined, including their participants, organizational philosophies, and governance. The text explores media coverage of adaptive sports and explains how the stereotypical frames of the past—which often clash with how athletes wish to be presented—are yielding to today’s more empowering and preferred position of viewing participants as athletes. Students will also see how opportunities for adapted sport are expanding. The long-term athlete development (LTAD) model has been applied to adaptive sports at all levels of competition worldwide. A sidebar spotlights efforts made in this area by Swimming Canada. In addition, the benefits and challenges of offering adaptive programs for military populations and young people are discussed. Because the costs associated with adaptive sport programs often exceed those of able-bodied sports, financial considerations are sometimes cited as a barrier. Students will learn about typical expenses for adaptive programs, along with different ways of identifying funding sources. The text concludes with an insightful case study featuring the University of Alabama Adapted Athletics (UAAA) program. This case study offers a managerial perspective on starting an athletics program for athletes with disabilities by exploring all facets, including sports offered, funding, and facilities. Throughout the text, profile sidebars, critical thinking exercises, and key points foster further discussion and enhance understanding of the concepts presented. Introduction to Adaptive Sport and Recreation serves as the authoritative guide to prepare students to integrate adaptive sport and recreation programs in their future work as a sport management professional.",Sports & Recreation,346,N/A,0,en

Introduction to Park Management,"Samuel V. Lankford, Jill Knowles-Lankford, Daniel Archie Wheeler",N/A,2017-02-09,"This fourth edition is intended for university students who may have an interest in becoming employed in the parks profession. The book explores the responsibilities of staff and the problems and challenges associated with managing parks in the 21st century. Particular attention is paid to the structure of park organisations, planning, decision making, and politics that ultimately influence the way parks are managed. Part I provides an overview of parks and park management. Historical aspects of the development of parks are reviewed and detailed. Part II specifically addresses the multitude of park administrative functions, such as organisational structures, park policies, laws and risk management, funding, personnel, and concludes with maintenance and safety concerns. Part III provides information on resource planning and management of the resources through citizen involvement, planning, facilities, and environmental management issues. Part IV is an overview of visitor use issues and protection of parks. Topics include visitor conflicts, vandalism, law enforcement, fire management, interpretation, and visitor management services. Finally, Part V provides a broad overview and examples of sustainable practices in park management, including tools such as ROS, LAC, and VERP and possible solutions to the numerous challenges that park managers must address. It is our belief that sustainable management practices and planning practices designed with environmental management and visitor management are the keys to successful park operations. Similar to the 3rd edition, the 4th edition utilises where applicable the practical and sage advice of Grant W Sharpe, Charles H Odegaard, and Wenonah Finch Sharpe in the earlier editions of this book. We have retained the essence of the material, and the broad topics that those authors provided as a framework for park management. Readers will note that some references are older. We retained references that have historical significance and have been overlooked in the current literature, which are included at the end of each chapter under General References. Some of these ideas are currently accepted as common knowledge; however, we all can benefit from understanding the origin of ideas that have influenced park management.",Parks,400,N/A,0,en

A well-worn first edition of this book sits next to my office desk and I consult it often. There is no better collection of everyday issues examined from a Christian perspective. A wide variety of topics are addressed with a cleverly balanced combination of academic and practical perspectives, informed by thoughtful biblical and theological reflection. This is a wonderfully useful tool. I am pleased that it will be available to resource a new generation of Christians who are eager to understand more about what it means to follow Christ in every aspect of life.” — Alistair Mackenzie, Senior Lecturer: School of Theology, Mission and Ministry, Laidlaw College, Christchurch, New Zealand.

Mathematical Recreations and Essays,W. W. Rouse Ball,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2018-07-11,"Mathematical Recreations and Essays W. W. Rouse Ball For nearly a century, this sparkling classic has provided stimulating hours of entertainment to the mathematically inclined. The problems posed here often involve fundamental mathematical methods and notions, but their chief appeal is their capacity to tease and delight. In these pages you will find scores of ""recreations"" to amuse you and to challenge your problem-solving faculties-often to the limit. Now in its 13th edition, Mathematical Recreations and Essays has been thoroughly revised and updated over the decades since its first publication in 1892. This latest edition retains all the remarkable character of the original, but the terminology and treatment of some problems have been updated and new material has been added. Among the challenges in store for you: Arithmetical and geometrical recreations; Polyhedra; Chess-board recreations; Magic squares; Map-coloring problems; Unicursal problems; Cryptography and cryptanalysis; Calculating prodigies; ... and more. You'll even find problems which mathematical ingenuity can solve but the computer cannot. No knowledge of calculus or analytic geometry is necessary to enjoy these games and puzzles. With basic mathematical skills and the desire to meet a challenge you can put yourself to the test and win. ""A must to add to your mathematics library.""-The Mathematics Teacher We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection. Many of the books in our collection have been out of print for decades, and therefore have not been accessible to the general public. The aim of our publishing program is to facilitate rapid access to this vast reservoir of literature, and our view is that this is a significant literary work, which deserves to be brought back into print after many decades. The contents of the vast majority of titles in the Classic Library have been scanned from the original works. To ensure a high quality product, each title has been meticulously hand curated by our staff. Our philosophy has been guided by a desire to provide the reader with a book that is as close as possible to ownership of the original work. We hope that you will enjoy this wonderful classic work, and that for you it becomes an enriching experience.",,376,N/A,0,en

This award-winning dictionary is a must for therapists! It provides clear, useful definitions for thousands of terms that therapists in today's health care environment must understand to be effective members of the health care team. This is not a medical dictionary. Definitions of diagnoses include not only the cause of the disease and common limitations, but also implications for therapeutic intervention. Terms such as bed and support surface, which get one or two lines in a medical dictionary, if they are defined at all, contain detailed information that helps therapists understand how they need to modify their therapy to provide the most effective treatment for the equipment being used. Practitioners in occupational therapy, physical therapy, recreational therapy, speech-language pathology, chemical dependency counseling, art therapy, music therapy, social work, psychology, nursing, and education will find definitions that cross the boundaries of their respective fields and provide common understanding of terms. The dictionary improves understanding between disciplines and improves the quality of care for the patients, clients, and residents that are served.",Medical care,0,N/A,0,en

A Curse Dark as Gold,Elizabeth C. Bunce,Scholastic Inc.,2010-05-19,"“In this slow-simmering but rewarding retelling, first-novelist Bunce presents an innovative interpretation of Rumpelstiltskin.” —Horn Book Winner of the William C. Morris Award for a Young Adult Debut An ALA Best Book for Young Adults A Smithsonian Notable Book An Oprah’s Book Club Kids’ Reading List Teen Selection The gold thread promises Charlotte Miller a chance to save her family’s beloved woolen mill. It promises a future for her sister, jobs for her townsfolk, security against her grasping uncle—maybe even true love. To get the thread, Charlotte must strike a bargain with its maker, the mysterious Jack Spinner. But the gleam of gold conjures a shadowy past—secrets ensnaring generations of Millers. And Charlotte’s mill, her family, her love—what do those matter to a stranger who can spin straw into gold? This is an award-winning and wholly original retelling of “Rumplestiltskin.” “Set in a rural valley in the late 1700s, this reworking of the ‘Rumplestiltskin’ story includes ghosts, witchcraft, elements of Georgian society, and much earlier folk magic in the guise of a novel of manners.” —School Library Journal “A Curse Dark as Gold beats the hell out of any fantasy novel I’ve read this year. Her heroine/narrator is immensely appealing; the atmosphere of a world on the cusp of the Industrial Revolution is completely believable; and the suspense of the story builds so craftily that I started taking notes on just how she does it.” —Peter S. Beagle, World Fantasy Award-winning author “An intelligent, original, and interesting new take on an old fairy tale, and a marvelous debut novel.” —Teen Book Review",Young Adult Fiction,404,4.5,2,en

Torkildsen's Sport and Leisure Management,"Rob Wilson, Chris Platts, Daniel Plumley",Taylor & Francis,2012-04-27,"For nearly thirty years George Torkildsen’s classic textbook has been the most comprehensive and engaging introduction to sport and leisure management available to students at all levels.

The Adventure Gap,James Edward Mills,Mountaineers Books,2014-09-24,"""An important new book about a crucial challenge facing the conservation movement"" -- Spencer Black, vice president, Sierra Club The nation’s wild places—from national and state parks to national forests, preserves, and wilderness areas—belong to all Americans. But not all of us use these resources equally. Minority populations are much less likely to seek recreation, adventure, and solace in our wilderness spaces. It’s a difference that African American author James Mills addresses in his new book, The Adventure Gap: Changing the Face of the Outdoors. In 2013, the first all-African American team of climbers, sponsored by the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS), challenged themselves on North America’s highest point, the dangerous and forbidding Denali, in Alaska. Mills uses Expedition Denali and its team members’ adventures as a jumping-off point to explore how minority populations view their place in wild environments and to share the stories of those who have already achieved significant accomplishments in outdoor adventures—from Mathew Henson, a Black explorer who stood with Peary at the North Pole, to Kai Lightner, a teenage sport climber currently winning national competitions. As our country grows increasingly multicultural, our natural legacy needs the devotion of people of all races and ethnicities to steward its care. The Adventure Gap is both a compelling adventure tale and road map to help everyone look to the outdoors for experiences that will enrich their lives.",Social Science,221,N/A,0,en

Confident Pluralism,John D. Inazu,University of Chicago Press,2018-08-03,"In the three years since Donald Trump first announced his plans to run for president, the United States seems to become more dramatically polarized and divided with each passing month. There are seemingly irresolvable differences in the beliefs, values, and identities of citizens across the country that too often play out in our legal system in clashes on a range of topics such as the tensions between law enforcement and minority communities. How can we possibly argue for civic aspirations like tolerance, humility, and patience in our current moment? In Confident Pluralism, John D. Inazu analyzes the current state of the country, orients the contemporary United States within its broader history, and explores the ways that Americans can—and must—strive to live together peaceably despite our deeply engrained differences. Pluralism is one of the founding creeds of the United States—yet America’s society and legal system continues to face deep, unsolved structural problems in dealing with differing cultural anxieties and differing viewpoints. Inazu not only argues that it is possible to cohabitate peacefully in this country, but also lays out realistic guidelines for our society and legal system to achieve the new American dream through civic practices that value toleration over protest, humility over defensiveness, and persuasion over coercion. With a new preface that addresses the election of Donald Trump, the decline in civic discourse after the election, the Nazi march in Charlottesville, and more, this new edition of Confident Pluralism is an essential clarion call during one of the most troubled times in US history. Inazu argues for institutions that can work to bring people together as well as political institutions that will defend the unprotected. Confident Pluralism offers a refreshing argument for how the legal system can protect peoples’ personal beliefs and differences and provides a path forward to a healthier future of tolerance, humility, and patience.",Law,187,N/A,0,en

"Sport, Physical Culture, and the Moving Body","Joshua I. Newman, Holly Thorpe, David Andrews",Rutgers University Press,2020-01-17,"2020 Choice​ Outstanding Academic Title The moving body—pervasively occupied by fitness activities, intense training and dieting regimes, recreational practices, and high-profile sporting mega-events—holds a vital function in contemporary society. As the body moves—as it performs, sweats, runs, and jumps—it sets in motion an intricate web of scientific rationalities, spatial arrangements, corporate imperatives, and identity politics (i.e. politics of gender, race, social class, etc.). It represents vitality in its productive and physiological capacities, it drives a complex economy of experiences and products, and it is a meaningful site of cultural identities and politics. Contributors to Sport, Physical Culture, and the Moving Body work from a simple premise: as it moves, the material body matters. Adding to the burgeoning fields of sport studies and body studies, the works featured here draw upon the traditions of feminist theory, posthumanism, actor network theory, and new materialism to reposition the physical, moving body as crucial to the cultural, political, environmental, and economic systems that it constitutes and within which is constituted. Once assembled, the book presents a study of bodies in motion—made to move in contexts where technique, performance, speed, strength, and vitality not only define the conduct therein, but provide the very reason for the body’s being within those economies and environments. In so doing, the contributors look to how the body moving for and about rational systems of science, medicine, markets, and geopolity shapes the social and material world in important and unexpected ways. In Sport, Physical Culture, and the Moving Body, contributors explore the extent to which the body, when moving about both ostensibly active body spaces (i.e., the gymnasium, the ball field, exercise laboratory, the track or running trail, the beach, or the sport stadium) and those places less often connected to physical activity (i.e. the home, the street, the classroom, the automobile), is bounded to technologies of life and living; and to the political arrangements that seek to capitalize upon such frames of biological vitality. To do so, the authors problematize the rise of active body science (i.e. kinesiology, sport and exercise sciences, performance biotechnology) and the effects these scientific interventions have on embodied, lived experience. Contributors to Sport, Physical Culture, and the Moving Body will be engaging a range of new and emerging theoretical perspectives, including new materialist, political ecology, developmental systems theory, and new material feminist approaches, to examine the actors and assemblages of movement-based material, political, and economic production. In so doing, contributors will vividly and powerfully illustrate the extent to which a focus on the fleshed body and its material conditions can bring forth new insights or ontological and epistemological innovation to the sociology of sport and physical activity. They will also explore the agency of the body as and amongst things. Such a performative materialist approach explicates how complex assemblages of sport and physical activity—bringing into association everything from muscle fibers and dietary proteins to stadium concrete or regional aquifers—are not only meaningful, but ecological. By focusing on the confluence of agentive materialities, disciplinary technologies, vibrant assemblages, speculative realities, and vital performativities, Sport, Physical Culture, and the Moving Body promises to offer a groundbreaking departure from representationalist tendencies and orthodoxies brought about by the cultural turn in sport and physical cultural studies. It brings the moving body and its physics back into focus: recentering moving flesh and bones as locus of social order, environmental change, and the global political economy.",Sports & Recreation,371,N/A,0,en

When You Find My Body,D. Dauphinee,Down East Books,2019-06-01,"When Geraldine “Gerry” Largay (AT trail name, Inchworm) first went missing on the Appalachian Trail in remote western Maine in 2013, the people of Maine were wrought with concern. When she was not found, the family, the wardens, and the Navy personnel who searched for her were devastated. The Maine Warden Service continued to follow leads for more than a year. They never completely gave up the search. Two years after her disappearance, her bones and scattered possessions were found by chance by two surveyors. She was on the U.S. Navy’s SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape) School land, about 2,100 feet from the Appalachian Trail. This book tells the story of events preceding Geraldine Largay’s vanishing in July 2013, while hiking the Appalachian Trail in Maine, what caused her to go astray, and the massive search and rescue operation that followed. Her disappearance sparked the largest lost-person search in Maine history, which culminated in her being presumed dead. She was never again seen alive. The author was one of the hundreds of volunteers who searched for her. Gerry’s story is one of heartbreak, most assuredly, but is also one of perseverance, determination, and faith. For her family and the searchers, especially the Maine Warden Service, it is also a story of grave sorrow. Marrying the joys and hardship of life in the outdoors, as well as exploring the search & rescue community, When You Find My Body examines dying with grace and dignity. There are lessons in the story, both large and small. Lessons that may well save lives in the future.",Biography & Autobiography,209,N/A,0,en

In this book, John Leshy, a leading expert in public lands policy, discusses the key political decisions that led to this, beginning at the very founding of the nation. He traces the emergence of a bipartisan political consensus in favor of the national government holding these vast land areas primarily for recreation, education, and conservation of biodiversity and cultural resources. That consensus remains strong and continues to shape American identity. Such a success story is a bright spot in an era of cynicism about government. This book is essential reading for anyone who cares about public lands, and it is particularly timely as the world grapples with the challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss.",History,736,N/A,0,en

HIV Interventions,Marsha Rosengarten,University of Washington Press,2010-05-01,"Winner of the Sociology of Health and Illness Book Prize HIV has changed in the presence of recent biomedical technologies. In particular, the development of anti-retroviral therapies (ARVs) for the treatment of HIV was a significant landmark in the history of the disease. Treatment with ARV drug regimens, which began in 1996, has enabled many thousands to live with the human immunodeficiency virus without progressing to AIDS. Yet ARVs have also been fraught with problems of regimen compliance, viral resistance, and iatrogenic disease. Besides intensifying the technological and ethical complexities of medicine, the drugs have also affected conceptions of risk and risk practices, in turn presenting new challenges for prevention. In order to devise safer, more effective forms of treatment, prevention, and possibly cure, Marsha Rosengarten asserts, it is essential to understand the relationship between HIV, medical technologies, and ideas about the body. HIV is an entity that constitutes and is constituted by complex material and informational environments. Recognition of this two-way traffic between the medical science of HIV and the expression of HIV in individuals and societies provides a novel basis for devising new or supplementary modes of thinking about and intervening in the epidemic. Through such diverse materials as drug advertisements, pill formulations, scientific articles, clinical trials, diagnostic test results, and viral imaging as well as interviews with those living and working with HIV, Rosengarten provides numerous demonstrations of how the entities comprising the HIV epidemic - bodies, viral resistance, diagnostic results, safe sex - are forged through dynamic relations. These various phenomena challenge existing prevention models and raise social and ethical concerns about the impact of additional technologies such as HIV pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis and the promise of vaccines and microbicides. HIV Interventions is relevant to those engaged in questions of the social and ethical dimensions of biomedicine, biotechnology, and genomics. Further, the specific focus of the project offers HIV practitioners - in the sciences and social sciences, in clinical research, clinical practice, social research, policy development and prevention education - new perspectives and analytic tools for intercepting a virus that continues to endure and, most critically, to change in the course of doing so.",Medical,160,N/A,0,en
Headwaters Park,Geoff Paddock,Arcadia Publishing,2002,"The history of Fort Wayne is deeply rooted in its connection to the three rivers that converge at its center: the Maumee, St. Mary's, and St. Joseph Rivers. This abundance of waterways provided great access and trading opportunities for the Fort Wayne area. However, their meeting place, the point at which the St. Mary's and the St. Joseph join to form the headwaters of the Maumee, served as a frequent flood plain and constantly evolving landscape. While humans declined to set up permanent settlements on the Fort Wayne ""thumb,"" it hosted many important events. From the flood of 1790 to the circus grounds of the 1850s, to the first night baseball game of 1883 to a depression area shantytown of the 1930s, the rich legacy of the Headwaters is a vital part of the fabric of Fort Wayne's history. Today, through the efforts of the Fort Wayne community and the Headwaters Flood Control and Park project, the area has been transformed into one of the most forward thinking city park projects in the country, providing a home for many area festivals and a beautiful addition to the downtown landscape of Fort Wayne.",History,134,N/A,0,en

Great Salt Lake Biology,"Bonnie K. Baxter, Jaimi K. Butler",Springer Nature,2020-07-03,"Great Salt Lake is an enormous terminal lake in the western United States. It is a highly productive ecosystem, which has global significance for millions of migrating birds who rely on this critical feeding station on their journey through the American west. For the human population in the adjacent metropolitan area, this body of water provides a significant economic resource as industries, such as brine shrimp harvesting and mineral extraction, generate jobs and income for the state of Utah. In addition, the lake provides the local population with ecosystem services, especially the creation of mountain snowpack that generates water supply, and the prevention of dust that may impair air quality. As a result of climate change and water diversions for consumptive uses, terminal lakes are shrinking worldwide, and this edited volume is written in this urgent context. This is the first book ever centered on Great Salt Lake biology. Current and novel data presented here paint a comprehensive picture, building on our past understanding and adding complexity. Together, the authors explore this saline lake from the microbial diversity to the invertebrates and the birds who eat them, along a dynamic salinity gradient with unique geochemistry. Some unusual perspectives are included, including the impact of tar seeps on the lake biology and why Great Salt Lake may help us search for life on Mars. Also, we consider the role of human perceptions and our effect on the biology of the lake. The editors made an effort to involve a diversity of experts on the Great Salt Lake system, but also to include unheard voices such as scientists at state agencies or non-profit advocacy organizations. This book is a timely discussion of a terminal lake that is significant, unique, and threatened.",Science,529,N/A,0,en
The Long Devotion,"Emily Pérez, Nancy Reddy",University of Georgia Press,2022-04-01,"The Long Devotion is a collection of poems, essays, and writing prompts that celebrates motherhood and creates a space, as poet Molly Spencer has written, to “tell an unlovely truth about family life and not have to take it back.” The poets in this book represent and describe a wide range of experiences. They write about encountering the world anew through their children; intersections of parenting and race; single parenting; adoptive, foster, and step-parenting; life with chronic illness, mental illness, and disability; and the choice to remain childless. The book is divided into four parts. “Difficulty, Ambivalence, and Joy” considers the wonder and challenges of parenting—including infertility, pregnancy, miscarriage, and life with children—and trying to write in the midst of those demands. “The Body and the Brain” explores the cerebral and bodily labor of caregiving and writing. “In the World” brings parents and their children into contact with the natural and political landscape. Finally, “Transitions” looks at how parenting and writing change as children grow up. Poems range from linear narratives and imagistic lyric to poetry comics, speculative futures, and experimental forms. Essays and poems suggest ways to write through the disruptions and chaos of family life. Prompts invite readers to use the work in this book as a starting point for their own poetry. As candid accounts of motherhood become more prevalent across literary, pop culture, and digital spaces, the way we talk about writing and mothering is changing. Poets have long challenged traditional motherhood narratives. This book brings together a new generation of exciting and provocative voices for the first time.",Literary Collections,248,N/A,0,en

The Nazis Knew My Name,"Magda Hellinger, Maya Lee",Simon and Schuster,2022-03-15,"The “thought-provoking…must-read” (Ariana Neumann, author of When Time Stopped) memoir by a Holocaust survivor who saved an untold number of lives at Auschwitz through everyday acts of courage and kindness—in the vein of A Bookshop in Berlin and The Nazi Officer’s Wife. In March 1942, twenty-five-year-old kindergarten teacher Magda Hellinger and nearly a thousand other young women were deported as some of the first Jews to be sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp. The SS soon discovered that by putting prisoners in charge of the day-to-day accommodation blocks, they could deflect attention away from themselves. Magda was one such prisoner selected for leadership and put in charge of hundreds of women in the notorious Experimental Block 10. She found herself constantly walking a dangerously fine line: saving lives while avoiding suspicion by the SS and risking execution. Through her inner strength and shrewd survival instincts, she was able to rise above the horror and cruelty of the camps and build pivotal relationships with the women under her watch, and even some of Auschwitz’s most notorious Nazi senior officers. Based on Magda’s personal account and completed by her daughter’s extensive research, this is “an unputdownable account of resilience and the power of compassion” (Booklist) in the face of indescribable evil.",Biography & Autobiography,320,N/A,0,en
Free the Beaches,Andrew W. Kahrl,Yale University Press,2018-01-01,"The story of our separate and unequal America in the making, and one man's fight against it During the long, hot summers of the late 1960s and 1970s, one man began a campaign to open some of America's most exclusive beaches to minorities and the urban poor. That man was anti-poverty activist and one‑time presidential candidate Ned Coll of Connecticut, a state that permitted public access to a mere seven miles of its 253‑mile shoreline. Nearly all of the state's coast was held privately, for the most part by white, wealthy residents. This book is the first to tell the story of the controversial protester who gathered a band of determined African American mothers and children and challenged the racist, exclusionary tactics of homeowners in a state synonymous with liberalism. Coll's legacy of remarkable successes--and failures--illuminates how our nation's fragile coasts have not only become more exclusive in subsequent decades but also have suffered greater environmental destruction and erosion as a result of that private ownership.",History,373,N/A,0,en

How Humans Learn,Joshua Eyler,Teaching and Learning in Highe,2018,"Even on good days, teaching is a challenging profession. One way to make the job of college instructors easier, however, is to know more about the ways students learn. How Humans Learn aims to do just that by peering behind the curtain and surveying research in fields as diverse as developmental psychology, anthropology, and cognitive neuroscience for insight into the science behind learning. The result is a story that ranges from investigations of the evolutionary record to studies of infants discovering the world for the first time, and from a look into how our brains respond to fear to a reckoning with the importance of gestures and language. Joshua R. Eyler identifies five broad themes running through recent scientific inquiry--curiosity, sociality, emotion, authenticity, and failure--devoting a chapter to each and providing practical takeaways for busy teachers. He also interviews and observes college instructors across the country, placing theoretical insight in dialogue with classroom experience.",Education,0,N/A,0,en

Connected Teaching,Harriet L. Schwartz,Taylor & Francis,2023-07-03,"At a time when many aspects of the faculty role are in question, Harriet Schwartz, the author of Connected Teaching, argues that the role of teachers is as important as ever and is evolving profoundly. She believes the relationships faculty have with individual students and with classes and cohorts are the essential driver of teaching and learning.This book explores teaching as a relational practice – a practice wherein connection and disconnection with students, power, identity, and emotion shape the teaching and learning endeavor. The author describes moments of energetic deep learning and what makes these powerful moments happen. She calls on readers to be open to and seek relationship, understand their own socio-cultural identity (and how this shapes internal experience and the ways in which they are met in the world), and vigilantly explore and recognize emotion in the teaching endeavor. Connected Teaching is informed and inspired by Relational Cultural Theory (RCT). The premise of RCT is that the experience of engaging in growth-fostering interactions and relationships is essential to human development. RCT’s founding scholars believed the theory would be relevant in many different settings, but this is the first book to apply them to teaching and learning in higher education. In this book, the author shows that RCT has much to offer those devoted to student learning and development, providing a foundation from which to understand the transformative potential of teaching as a relational practice.",Education,177,N/A,0,en

The Yosemite,John Muir,Binker North,1912,"In the classic nature work, The Yosemite, the great American naturalist, John Muir, describes the Yosemite valley's geography and the myriad types of trees, flowers, birds, and other animals that can be found there. The Yosemite is among the finest examples of John Muir nature writings.The Yosemite is a classic nature/outdoor adventure text and a fine example of John Muir nature writings. In this volume, Muir describes the Yosemite valley's geography and the various types of trees, flowers and animals that can be found there. John Muir (April 21, 1838 - December 24, 1914) was a Scottish-American naturalist, author, environmental philosopher and early advocate of preservation of wilderness in the United States. His letters, essays, and books telling of his adventures in nature, especially in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, have been read by millions. His activism helped to preserve the Yosemite Valley, Sequoia National Park and other wilderness areas. The Sierra Club, which he founded, is a prominent American conservation organization. The 211-mile (340 km) John Muir Trail, a hiking trail in the Sierra Nevada, was named in his honor.[2] Other such places include Muir Woods National Monument, Muir Beach, John Muir College, Mount Muir, Camp Muir and Muir Glacier. In Scotland, the John Muir Way, a 130 mile long distance route, was named in honor of him. In his later life, Muir devoted most of his time to the preservation of the Western forests. He petitioned the U.S. Congress for the National Park bill that was passed in 1890, establishing Yosemite National Park. The spiritual quality and enthusiasm toward nature expressed in his writings inspired readers, including presidents and congressmen, to take action to help preserve large nature areas. He is today referred to as the ""Father of the National Parks"" and the National Park Service has produced a short documentary about his life. Muir has been considered 'an inspiration to both Scots and Americans'. Muir's biographer, Steven J. Holmes, believes that Muir has become ""one of the patron saints of twentieth-century American environmental activity,"" both political and recreational. As a result, his writings are commonly discussed in books and journals, and he is often quoted by nature photographers such as Ansel Adams. ""Muir has profoundly shaped the very categories through which Americans understand and envision their relationships with the natural world,"" writes Holmes. Muir was noted for being an ecological thinker, political spokesman, and religious prophet, whose writings became a personal guide into nature for countless individuals, making his name ""almost ubiquitous"" in the modern environmental consciousness. According to author William Anderson, Muir exemplified ""the archetype of our oneness with the earth"", [ while biographer Donald Worster says he believed his mission was ""...saving the American soul from total surrender to materialism."" 403 On April 21, 2013, the first ever John Muir Day was celebrated in Scotland, which marked the 175th anniversary of his birth, paying homage to the conservationist. Muir was born in the small house at left. His father bought the adjacent building in 1842, and made it the family home.",Biography & Autobiography,336,N/A,0,en

Hidden Mercy,Michael J. O'Loughlin,Broadleaf Books ,2021-11-30,"The 1980s and 1990s, the height of the AIDS crisis in the United States, was decades ago now, and many of the stories from this time remain hidden: A Catholic nun from a small Midwestern town packs up her life to move to New York City, where she throws herself into a community under assault from HIV and AIDS. A young priest sees himself in the many gay men dying from AIDS and grapples with how best to respond, eventually coming out as gay and putting his own career on the line. A gay Catholic with HIV loses his partner to AIDS and then flees the church, focusing his energy on his own health rather than fight an institution seemingly rejecting him. Set against the backdrop of the HIV and AIDS epidemic of the late twentieth century and the Catholic Church's crackdown on gay and lesbian activists, journalist Michael O'Loughlin searches out the untold stories of those who didn't look away, who at great personal cost chose compassion--even as he seeks insight for LGBTQ people of faith struggling to find a home in religious communities today. This is one journalist's--gay and Catholic himself--compelling picture of those quiet heroes who responded to human suffering when so much of society--and so much of the church--told them to look away. These pure acts of compassion and mercy offer us hope and inspiration as we continue to confront existential questions about what it means to be Americans, Christians, and human beings responding to those most in need.",Social Science,296,N/A,0,en

The focus is not only on refugee education as an issue of access and equity, but also on this phenomenon as seen through the lens of internationalization. What competencies are called for among university faculty and staff welcoming refugee-background students to their institutional contexts? How might “distance learning” be considered anew? These challenges and opportunities for institutional growth will be closely considered by this group of authors from educational leadership, social work, curriculum development, and higher education itself. They address key world regions, and sub-topics ranging from online education in refugee camps to the Brazilian and Colombian responses to the emerging crisis in Venezuela. Scholars researching refugee education cross-nationally often find that refugee education literature is parsed by disciplinary field. This book, in contrast, offers a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary overview of refugee education issues around the world. These perspectives also provide key insights for faculty and staff at higher education institutions that currently enroll asylees or refugees, as well as those that may do so in the future.",Education,321,5,1,en
Mutiny on the Rising Sun,Jared Ross Hardesty,NYU Press,2021-10-19,"A little-known story of mutiny and murder illustrating the centrality of smuggling and slavery in early American society On the night of June 1, 1743, terror struck the schooner Rising Sun. After completing a routine smuggling voyage where the crew sold enslaved Africans in exchange for chocolate, sugar, and coffee in the Dutch colony of Suriname, the ship traveled eastward along the South American coast. Believing there was an opportunity to steal the lucrative cargo and make a new life for themselves, three sailors snuck below deck, murdered four people, and seized control of the vessel. Mutiny on the Rising Sun recounts the origins, events, and eventual fate of the Rising Sun’s final smuggling voyage in vivid detail. Starting from that horrible night in June 1743, it narrates a deeply human history of smuggling, providing an incredible story of those caught in the webs spun by illicit commerce. The case generated a rich documentary record that illuminates an international chocolate smuggling ring, the lives of the crew and mutineers, and the harrowing experience of the enslaved people trafficked by the Rising Sun. Smuggling stood at the center of the lives of everyone involved with the business of the schooner. Larger forces, such as imperial trade restrictions, created the conditions for smuggling, but individual actors, often driven by raw ambition and with little regard for the consequences of their actions, designed, refined, and perpetuated this illicit commerce. At once startling and captivating, Mutiny on the Rising Sun shows how illegal trade created demand for exotic products like chocolate, and how slavery and smuggling were integral to the development of American capitalism.",History,278,N/A,0,en

Each chapter begins with a compelling story that draws the reader into new ways of thinking. Each author then looks beyond stewardship from the context of her or his own discipline and experiences. Some reimagine creation care by expanding on the traditional notion of stewardship. Others set aside the stewardship model and offer alternative ways to understand our presence within the broader creation. The chapters mark out ways to live better in the places we inhabit as individuals, communities, and institutions. Collectively, the essays in Beyond Stewardship offer an expanded and enlivened understanding of the place of humans in the context of God's creation.",,252,N/A,0,en

Redefining Disability,,BRILL,2022-02-14,"The reality of disability—of what it means to be disabled—has primarily been written by non-disabled people. Disability and disabled individuals are often described with pity, presented as burdens, or are background figures in larger non-disabled narratives. Redefining Disability challenges the outsider-dominated approach to disability by centering the disabled experience. This edited volume, featuring all disabled authors and creators, combines traditional academic works with personal reflections, visual art, and poetry. These works address disability and race, sexuality and disability, disability cultures, accommodation, self-diagnosis, and how we manage the obstacles ableist institutions place in our way. The authors address a variety of disabilities, including sensory, chronic pain, mobility, developmental disorders, and mental illness. It is through these testimonies that we hope to redefine disability on our terms; to clearly state that disability is not a bad word, and that all disabled lives have value. Redefining Disability is interdisciplinary, with broad application for undergraduate courses, graduate seminars, or to read for pleasure.

One summer. Two rivals. A plot twist they didn't see coming... Nora Stephens' life is books—she’s read them all—and she is not that type of heroine. Not the plucky one, not the laidback dream girl, and especially not the sweetheart. In fact, the only people Nora is a heroine for are her clients, for whom she lands enormous deals as a cutthroat literary agent, and her beloved little sister Libby. Which is why she agrees to go to Sunshine Falls, North Carolina for the month of August when Libby begs her for a sisters’ trip away—with visions of a small town transformation for Nora, who she’s convinced needs to become the heroine in her own story. But instead of picnics in meadows, or run-ins with a handsome country doctor or bulging-forearmed bartender, Nora keeps bumping into Charlie Lastra, a bookish brooding editor from back in the city. It would be a meet-cute if not for the fact that they’ve met many times and it’s never been cute. If Nora knows she’s not an ideal heroine, Charlie knows he’s nobody’s hero, but as they are thrown together again and again—in a series of coincidences no editor worth their salt would allow—what they discover might just unravel the carefully crafted stories they’ve written about themselves.",Fiction,417,N/A,0,en

Discover the heartwarming friends to lovers romance that became a sensation on TikTok—now with a new chapter and a Q&A with the author! The friend zone is not the end zone for Bree Camden, who is helplessly in love with her longtime best friend and extremely hot NFL legend, Nathan Donelson. The only problem is that she can’t admit her true feelings, because he clearly sees her as a best friend with no romantic potential, and the last thing Bree wants is to ruin their relationship. But those abs . . . Nope! Nothing but good old-fashioned, no-touching-the-sexiest-man-alive, platonic friendship for Bree. In any case, she has other things to worry about. After a car accident ended her chance at becoming a professional ballerina, Bree changed paths and now owns her own dance studio, with big dreams to expand it. But one more rent increase could mean the end of the studio entirely. Then, as usual, Nathan comes to the rescue and buys the entire building. A stubborn Bree is not happy about it and decides to rebel with a couple—okay, maybe more than a couple—of tequila shots. Then her plan backfires as she spills her deepest, darkest secret to a TMZ reporter. One viral video later, the world thinks Nathan and Bree are the perfect couple. Before they can really talk about her confession, Nathan’s publicist proposes a big opportunity that could mean financial security for Bree. The catch? They have to pretend to be in love. For three whole weeks. What will happen when Bree gives in to the feelings she’s been desperately hiding for so long, and could she be imagining that Nathan is actually enjoying it?

Museums and Digital Culture,"Tula Giannini, Jonathan P. Bowen",Springer,2019-05-16,"This book explores how digital culture is transforming museums in the 21st century. Offering a corpus of new evidence for readers to explore, the authors trace the digital evolution of the museum and that of their audiences, now fully immersed in digital life, from the Internet to home and work. In a world where life in code and digits has redefined human information behavior and dominates daily activity and communication, ubiquitous use of digital tools and technology is radically changing the social contexts and purposes of museum exhibitions and collections, the work of museum professionals and the expectations of visitors, real and virtual. Moving beyond their walls, with local and global communities, museums are evolving into highly dynamic, socially aware and relevant institutions as their connections to the global digital ecosystem are strengthened. As they adopt a visitor-centered model and design visitor experiences, their priorities shift to engage audiences, convey digital collections, and tell stories through exhibitions. This is all part of crafting a dynamic and innovative museum identity of the future, made whole by seamless integration with digital culture, digital thinking, aesthetics, seeing and hearing, where visitors are welcomed participants. The international and interdisciplinary chapter contributors include digital artists, academics, and museum professionals. In themed parts the chapters present varied evidence-based research and case studies on museum theory, philosophy, collections, exhibitions, libraries, digital art and digital future, to bring new insights and perspectives, designed to inspire readers.

Chaucer and the Ethics of Time,Gillian Adler,University of Wales Press,2022-02-15,"Geoffrey Chaucer wrote at a turning point in the history of timekeeping, but many of his poems demonstrate a greater interest in the moral dimension of time than in the mechanics of the medieval clock. Chaucer and the Ethics of Time examines Chaucer’s sensitivity to the insecurity of human experience amid the temporal circumstances of change and time-passage, as well as strategies for ethicising historical vision in several of his major works. While wasting time was sometimes viewed as a sin in the late Middle Ages, Chaucer resists conventional moral dichotomies and explores a complex and challenging relationship between the interior sense of time and the external pressures of linearism and cyclicality. Chaucer’s diverse philosophical ideas about time unfold through the reciprocity between form and discourse, thus encouraging a new look at not only the characters’ ruminations on time in the tradition of St Augustine and Boethius, but also manifold narrative sequences and structures, including anachronism.",Literary Criticism,223,N/A,0,en

There is so much about her analysis that I relate to and grapple with on a daily basis as a Latina feminist."" Damon Young: ""Like watching the world’s best Baptist preacher but with sermons about intersectionality and Beyoncé instead of Ecclesiastes."" Melissa Harris Perry: “I was waiting for an author who wouldn’t forget, ignore, or erase us black girls...I was waiting and she has come in Brittney Cooper.” Michael Eric Dyson: “Cooper may be the boldest young feminist writing today...and she will make you laugh out loud.” So what if it’s true that Black women are mad as hell? They have the right to be. In the Black feminist tradition of Audre Lorde, Brittney Cooper reminds us that anger is a powerful source of energy that can give us the strength to keep on fighting. Far too often, Black women’s anger has been caricatured into an ugly and destructive force that threatens the civility and social fabric of American democracy. But Cooper shows us that there is more to the story than that. Black women’s eloquent rage is what makes Serena Williams such a powerful tennis player. It’s what makes Beyoncé’s girl power anthems resonate so hard. It’s what makes Michelle Obama an icon. Eloquent rage keeps us all honest and accountable. It reminds women that they don’t have to settle for less. When Cooper learned of her grandmother's eloquent rage about love, sex, and marriage in an epic and hilarious front-porch confrontation, her life was changed. And it took another intervention, this time staged by one of her homegirls, to turn Brittney into the fierce feminist she is today. In Brittney Cooper’s world, neither mean girls nor fuckboys ever win. But homegirls emerge as heroes. This book argues that ultimately feminism, friendship, and faith in one's own superpowers are all we really need to turn things right side up again.

Supper Club,Lara Williams,Penguin,2020-09-01,"Named a Best Book of the Year: Vogue * TIME * Real Simple * Kirkus Reviews A New York Times Book Review Editors' Choice For fans of Sally Rooney's Normal People: A sharply intelligent and intimate debut novel about a secret society of hungry young women who meet after dark and feast to reclaim their appetites--and their physical spaces--that posits the question: If you feed a starving woman, what will she grow into? Roberta spends her life trying not to take up space. At almost thirty, she is adrift and alienated from life. Stuck in a mindless job and reluctant to pursue her passion for food, she suppresses her appetite and recedes to the corners of rooms. But when she meets Stevie, a spirited and effervescent artist, their intense friendship sparks a change in Roberta, a shift in her desire for more. Together, they invent the Supper Club, a transgressive and joyous collective of women who gather to celebrate, rather than admonish, their hungers. They gather after dark and feast until they are sick; they break into private buildings and leave carnage in their wake; they embrace their changing bodies; they stop apologizing. For these women, each extraordinary yet unfulfilled, the club is a way to explore, discover, and push the boundaries of the space they take up in the world. Yet as the club expands, growing in both size and rebellion, Roberta is forced to reconcile herself to the desire and vulnerabilities of the body--and the past she has worked so hard to repress.

Zoo Studies,"Tracy McDonald, Daniel Vandersommers",McGill-Queen's University Press,2019-06-19,"Do both the zoo and the mental hospital induce psychosis, as humans are treated as animals and animals are treated as humans? How have we looked at animals in the past, and how do we look at them today? How have zoos presented themselves, and their purpose, over time? In response to the emergence of environmental and animal studies, anthropologists, sociologists, philosophers, theorists, literature scholars, and historians around the world have begun to explore the significance of zoological parks, past and present. Zoo Studies considers the modern zoo from a range of approaches and disciplines, united in a desire to blur the boundaries between human and nonhuman animals. The volume begins with an account of the first modern mental hospital, La Salpêtrière, established in 1656, and the first panoptical zoo, the menagerie at Versailles, created in 1662 by the same royal architect; the final chapter presents a choreographic performance that imagines the Toronto Zoo as a place where the human body can be inspired by animal bodies. From beginning to end, through interdisciplinary collaboration, this volume decentres the human subject and offers alternative ways of thinking about zoos and their inhabitants. This collection immerses readers in the lives of animals and their experiences of captivity and asks us to reflect on our own assumptions about both humans and animals.

Culturally Sustaining Pedagogies,"Django Paris, H. Samy Alim",Teachers College Press,2017,"Culturally Sustaining Pedagogies raises fundamental questions about the purpose of schooling in changing societies. Bringing together an intergenerational group of prominent educators and researchers, this volume engages and extends the concept of culturally sustaining pedagogy (CSP)—teaching that perpetuates and fosters linguistic, literate, and cultural pluralism as part of schooling for positive social transformation. The authors propose that schooling should be a site for sustaining the cultural practices of communities of color, rather than eradicating them. Chapters present theoretically grounded examples of how educators and scholars can support Black, Indigenous, Latinx, Asian/Pacific Islander, South African, and immigrant students as part of a collective movement towards educational justice in a changing world. Book Features: A definitive resource on culturally sustaining pedagogies, including what they look like in the classroom and how they differ from deficit-model approaches.Examples of teaching that sustain the languages, literacies, and cultural practices of students and communities of color.Contributions from the founders of such lasting educational frameworks as culturally relevant pedagogy, funds of knowledge, cultural modeling, and third space.

New Testament Interpretation,I. Howard Marshall,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2006-10-01,"These eighteen pieces have been commissioned to provide a succinct yet comprehensive guide to the best of recent evangelical thinking about how the New Testament is to be interpreted, so that it may speak most clearly to today's world. The need for such a handbook can be felt more keenly as on the one side a secularized world dismisses the biblical faith as outmoded, unworkable, and unsatisfying; and, on the other, numerous Christian communities, committed to taking that faith with ultimate seriousness, are driven by controversies about how to read and understand the Bible. Following the editor's introduction, in which I. Howard Marshall examines a familiar New Testament passage in order to exemplify the problems and rewards that await the careful interpreter, the essays are arranged under four headings, beginning with overviews of the history of New Testament study and the role of the interpreter's presuppositions in this enterprise; then going on to discuss the various critical tools, the methods of exegesis, and the application of the New Testament to the faith and life of the contemporary reader. An annotated bibliography concludes the presentation. Because the issues involved here have too often been ignored in many quarters, more than one approach to or opinion about a given matter may surface in these essays; yet, undergirding this diversity is the author's shared conviction, as conservative evangelicals with a high regard for the authority of Holy Scripture, that we are called upon to study the Bible with the full use of our minds. As the editor writes, The passages which we interpret must be the means through which God speaks to men and women today. Our belief in the inspiration of the Bible is thus a testimony that New Testament exegesis is not just a problem; it is a real possibility. God can and does speak to men through even the most ignorant of expositors of his Word. At the same time he calls us on to devote ourselves to his Word and use every resource to make its message the more clear.",Religion,407,N/A,0,en

Everything I Don't Know,Jerzy Ficowski,N/A,2021-09-14,"Poetry. Jewish Studies. What good luck to finally have in English the writings of the brilliant Jerzy Ficowski, the poet who lived at least seventeen lives, fighting in the Warsaw Uprising, and later traveling for years with the Roma people through the roads of Poland, opposing his government, and watching the authorities ban his poems, a poet who translated from Spanish and Romanian and Yiddish and Roma, but most of all from the tongue of silence...Beautifully translated by Jennifer Grotz and Piotr Sommer, these poems also document the tragedy of the Holocaust, with the direct and uncompromising voice with which he reminds us of the great poets such as Różewicz and Świrszczyńska, while remaining, all the while, himself. Read a piece such as 'I was unable to save / a single life' in a bookstore, and I guarantee you will want to take this book with you, to keep it for the rest of your life.--Ilya Kaminsky Thanks to these brilliant, careful, inspired translations, we can now read Jerzy Ficowski, one of Poland's best kept secrets. This book is a marvel in its weird clarity and extraordinary range of styles and subjects, from the perfectly unassuming paradox of the title, all the way through to its final poems about bumblebees and Satie and mother nature, who scratches herself and 'shudders / with a tsunami.' How fortunate we are to have the unassailable evidence that all along, there was yet another genius of 20th century Polish poetry.--Matthew Zapruder",,192,N/A,0,en

South Flight,Jasmine Elizabeth Smith,University of Georgia Press,2022-02-15,"In her debut poetry collection, Jasmine Elizabeth Smith takes inspiration from Oklahoma Black history. In the wake of the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921, Jim Waters makes the difficult decision to leave behind his lover, Beatrice Vernadene Chapel, who as a Black woman must navigate the dangerous climate that produced the Jim Crow South and Red Summer. As Beatrice and Jim write letters to one another and hold imagined conversations with blues musicians Ida B. Cox, Robert Johnson, Charlie Patton, Ethel Waters, and the ghosts of Greenwood, the couple interrogates themes of blues epistemology, Black feminism, fraught attachments, and the way in which Black Americans have often changed their geographical regions with the hope of improving their conditions. The poetry collection South Flight is a eulogy, a blues, an unabashed love letter, and ragtime to the history of resistance, migration, and community in Black Oklahoma.",Poetry,101,N/A,0,en

Strong Towns,"Charles L. Marohn, Jr.",John Wiley & Sons,2019-10-01,"A new way forward for sustainable quality of life in cities of all sizes Strong Towns: A Bottom-Up Revolution to Build American Prosperity is a book of forward-thinking ideas that breaks with modern wisdom to present a new vision of urban development in the United States. Presenting the foundational ideas of the Strong Towns movement he co-founded, Charles Marohn explains why cities of all sizes continue to struggle to meet their basic needs, and reveals the new paradigm that can solve this longstanding problem. Inside, you’ll learn why inducing growth and development has been the conventional response to urban financial struggles—and why it just doesn’t work. New development and high-risk investing don’t generate enough wealth to support itself, and cities continue to struggle. Read this book to find out how cities large and small can focus on bottom-up investments to minimize risk and maximize their ability to strengthen the community financially and improve citizens’ quality of life. Develop in-depth knowledge of the underlying logic behind the “traditional” search for never-ending urban growth Learn practical solutions for ameliorating financial struggles through low-risk investment and a grassroots focus Gain insights and tools that can stop the vicious cycle of budget shortfalls and unexpected downturns Become a part of the Strong Towns revolution by shifting the focus away from top-down growth toward rebuilding American prosperity Strong Towns acknowledges that there is a problem with the American approach to growth and shows community leaders a new way forward. The Strong Towns response is a revolution in how we assemble the places we live.",Business & Economics,262,N/A,0,en
Pastimes,Ruth Russell,McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages,1999-12-01,"Pastimes is an introductory text. It gathers together the state of the art in leisure science and practice, reflecting as well a wide range of literature from the disciplines of sociology, psychology, economics, political science, and anthropology. More than a text that teaches the foundational meanings and roles of leisure, however, Pastimes is also a point of view. This text presents leisure as a human phenomenon that is both individual and collective, vital to survival and frivolous, historical and contemporary, good and bad. There are three main parts. Part one blends philosophy, religious studies, and the humanities in considering leisure as a condition of being human. Not only do chapters 1 through 4 establish the basic definitions and parameters for studying leisure, they ask readers to consider these concepts from their own personal framework. Part two is a focus on leisure's role in creating and reflecting society. Chapters 5 through 8 build on the personal relevancy of leisure discussed in part one and teach about leisure's contemporary cultural significance. These chapters rely on anthropology, sociology, and psychology concepts. Leisure's personal and cultural vitality are brought to a pragmatic conclusion in part three: leisure's use as a social instrument.

The text has become one of the most widely adopted titles in university courses worldwide. In this new edition of the book, the phenomenon of leisure is presented through new research findings and contemporary societal dilemmas to suggest that leisure is one of the most interesting, relevant, and exciting subjects of study today. The book reflects a wide range of material from the disciplines of leisure studies, sociology, psychology, economics, political science, anthropology, geography, the humanities, and media and cultural studies. Indeed, more than a textbook, this is very much a point of view. Leisure is presented as a human phenomenon that is individual and collective, vital and frivolous, historical and contemporary, factual and subjective, and good and bad. As a learning tool, this sixth edition teaches more. It contains updated and new illustrations of concepts through field-based cases, biographical features, exploratory activities, and research studies. In the first part, leisure is defined as a condition of humanity. Its meanings are traced through the humanities and history, as well as in todays connotations. The benefits of leisure are presented, ranging from freedom to pleasure to risk to spirituality, and leisures benefit to healthful well-being is demonstrated. As well, part one of the text presents theories for explaining leisure behavior. Part Two discusses leisure as a cultural mirror -- its societal context. Chapters include leisure and anthropology, geography, technology, popular culture, and taboo recreation. Finally, in Part Three, the functional side of leisure is explored in terms of its instrumental relationship to work, money, time, and equity.

Who Cleans the Park?,"John Krinsky, Maud Simonet",University of Chicago Press,2017-03-24,"America’s public parks are in a golden age. Hundreds of millions of dollars—both public and private—fund urban jewels like Manhattan’s Central Park. Keeping the polish on landmark parks and in neighborhood playgrounds alike means that the trash must be picked up, benches painted, equipment tested, and leaves raked. Bringing this often-invisible work into view, however, raises profound questions for citizens of cities. In Who Cleans the Park? John Krinsky and Maud Simonet explain that the work of maintaining parks has intersected with broader trends in welfare reform, civic engagement, criminal justice, and the rise of public-private partnerships. Welfare-to-work trainees, volunteers, unionized city workers (sometimes working outside their official job descriptions), staff of nonprofit park “conservancies,” and people sentenced to community service are just a few of the groups who routinely maintain parks. With public services no longer being provided primarily by public workers, Krinsky and Simonet argue, the nature of public work must be reevaluated. Based on four years of fieldwork in New York City, Who Cleans the Park? looks at the transformation of public parks from the ground up. Beginning with studying changes in the workplace, progressing through the public-private partnerships that help maintain the parks, and culminating in an investigation of a park’s contribution to urban real-estate values, the book unearths a new urban order based on nonprofit partnerships and a rhetoric of responsible citizenship, which at the same time promotes unpaid work, reinforces workers’ domination at the workplace, and increases the value of park-side property. Who Cleans the Park? asks difficult questions about who benefits from public work, ultimately forcing us to think anew about the way we govern ourselves, with implications well beyond the five boroughs.",Political Science,304,N/A,0,en

To Change the World,James Davison Hunter,Oxford University Press,2010-04-14,"The call to make the world a better place is inherent in the Christian belief and practice. But why have efforts to change the world by Christians so often failed or gone tragically awry? And how might Christians in the 21st century live in ways that have integrity with their traditions and are more truly transformative? In To Change the World, James Davison Hunter offers persuasive--and provocative--answers to these questions. Hunter begins with a penetrating appraisal of the most popular models of world-changing among Christians today, highlighting the ways they are inherently flawed and therefore incapable of generating the change to which they aspire. Because change implies power, all Christian eventually embrace strategies of political engagement. Hunter offers a trenchant critique of the political theologies of the Christian Right and Left and the Neo-Anabaptists, taking on many respected leaders, from Charles Colson to Jim Wallis and Stanley Hauerwas. Hunter argues that all too often these political theologies worsen the very problems they are designed to solve. What is really needed is a different paradigm of Christian engagement with the world, one that Hunter calls ""faithful presence""--an ideal of Christian practice that is not only individual but institutional; a model that plays out not only in all relationships but in our work and all spheres of social life. He offers real-life examples, large and small, of what can be accomplished through the practice of ""faithful presence."" Such practices will be more fruitful, Hunter argues, more exemplary, and more deeply transfiguring than any more overtly ambitious attempts can ever be. Written with keen insight, deep faith, and profound historical grasp, To Change the World will forever change the way Christians view and talk about their role in the modern world.",Religion,369,N/A,0,en

In this thought-provoking exploration of why certain events, products, and people capture our attention and imaginations, Matthew E. May examines the elusive element behind so many innovative breakthroughs in fields ranging from physics and marketing to design and popular culture. Combining unusual simplicity and surprising power, elegance is characterized by four key elements—seduction, subtraction, symmetry, and sustainability. In a compelling, story-driven narrative that sheds light on the need for elegance in design, engineering, art, urban planning, sports, and work, May offers surprising evidence that what’s “not there” often trumps what is.

Digital Literacies for Learning,"Allan Martin, Dan Madigan",Facet Publishing,2006,"In the 21st century, digital tools enable information to be generated faster and in greater profusion than ever before, to the point where its extent and value are literally beyond imagining. Such quantities can only be meaningfully addressed using more digital tools, and thus our relationship to information is fundamentally changed. This situation presents a particular challenge to processes of learning and teaching, and demands a response from both information professionals and educators. Enabling education in a digital environment means not only changing the form in which learning opportunities are offered, but also enabling students to survive and prosper in digitally based learning environments. This collection brings together a global community of educators, educational researchers, librarians and IT strategists, to consider how learners need to be equipped in an educational environment that is increasingly suffused with digital technology. Traditional notions of literacy need to be challenged, and new literacies, including information literacy and IT literacy, need to be considered as foundation elements for digitally involved learners. Leading international experts from the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Mexico and throughout Europe contribute to the debate, and Hannelore Rader, Librarian and Dean of the University Libraries, University of Louisville, Kentucky, provides the foreword. The book is in two parts: In Part 1, Literacies in the Digital Age, the contributors analyse how digital technologies have enabled transformative change in the ways in which learning can be constructed, and discuss the nature of the new literacies that have emerged in this new virtual and e-learning environment. In Part 2, Enabling and Supporting Digital Literacies, the contributors go on to consider the ways in which digital literacies can be made available to learners, and how these literacies are being relocated in a more student-centred environment within the broader perspective of learning. Readership: This book takes the issues raised in the successful Information and IT Literacy, also co-edited by Allan Martin, into a broader context. It is essential reading for all information professionals and educators involved in developing strategies and practices for learning in a digital age.",Computers,273,N/A,0,en

The Ark Before Noah,Irving Finkel,Anchor,2014-03-25,"The recent translation of a Babylonian tablet launches a groundbreaking investigation into one of the most famous stories in the world, challenging the way we look at ancient history. Since the Victorian period, it has been understood that the story of Noah, iconic in the Book of Genesis, and a central motif in Judaism, Christianity and Islam, derives from a much older story that existed centuries before in ancient Babylon. But the relationship between the Babylonian and biblical traditions was shrouded in mystery. Then, in 2009, Irving Finkel, a curator at the British Museum and a world authority on ancient Mesopotamia, found himself playing detective when a member of the public arrived at the museum with an intriguing cuneiform tablet from a family collection. Not only did the tablet reveal a new version of the Babylonian Flood Story; the ancient poet described the size and completely unexpected shape of the ark, and gave detailed boat building specifications. Decoding this ancient message wedge by cuneiform wedge, Dr. Finkel discovered where the Babylonians believed the ark came to rest and developed a new explanation of how the old story ultimately found its way into the Bible. In The Ark Before Noah, Dr. Finkel takes us on an adventurous voyage of discovery, opening the door to an enthralling world of ancient voices and new meanings.",History,446,N/A,0,en
"A Methodology for the Systematic Collection, Storage, and Retrieval of Trend Data for the U.S. Army Engineers Recreation Program","Dennis B. Propst, Robert V. Abby",N/A,1981,"This report describes past, current, and proposed recreation information systems developed to assist Corps personnel in solving daily management and planning problems. The systems designed to collect and store trend data are still in their infancy and are being managed by the Recreation Research Program at the U.S. Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station (WES). The trend data described in this report were collected as part of a pilot study at three Corps campgrounds during the summer of 1979. This report also describes the system of Recreation Research and Demonstration Units (RRDU) and other agencies that collect, store, and utilize recreation user information. The need to develop additional means of collecting trend data is based, in part, on the weaknesses of past Corps of Engineers recreation information systems. These problems, as well as the steps the Corps is taking to gather more reliable visitation and other trend data, are a cornerstone of this report. A major product of the proposed recreation user system will be the forecasting of national and regional trends in terms of recreation participation, sales of recreational equipment, and other factors that affect recreation use. Part of this system, the collection of more reliable visitation data, has already been implemented. The mechanics of the proposed recreation user system, potential uses, and relationship to existing systems are herein described. (Author).",Data tapes,32,N/A,0,en

"Be the Pine, Be the Ball",Paul J.

Be the Pine, Be the Ball also reveals the compelling beauty and power of haiku, the most popular poetic form in the world. Through the brevity of its style, precise language, and ability to reveal how ordinary moments and elements of our lives are pathways to a better understanding of ourselves and the world around us, haiku can have both a meditative and consequential effect on the reader. A key to the connection between haiku and golf is that both foster powers of concentration and detailed observation with a related reduction of distractions. Both seek to cultivate a more tranquil and disciplined mind and to translate that condition into how a life is lived and a game is played.",Poetry,284,N/A,0,en

The Biology of Sharks and Rays,A. Peter Klimley,University of Chicago Press,2013-07-31,"The Biology of Sharks and Rays is a comprehensive resource on the biological and physiological characteristics of the cartilaginous fishes: sharks, rays, and chimaeras. In sixteen chapters, organized by theme, A. Peter Klimley covers a broad spectrum of topics, including taxonomy, morphology, ecology, and physiology. For example, he explains the body design of sharks and why the ridged, toothlike denticles that cover their entire bodies are present on only part of the rays’ bodies and are absent from those of chimaeras. Another chapter explores the anatomy of the jaws and the role of the muscles and teeth in jaw extension, seizure, and handling of prey. The chapters are richly illustrated with pictures of sharks, diagrams of sensory organs, drawings of the body postures of sharks during threat and reproductive displays, and maps showing the extent of the species’ foraging range and long-distance migrations. Each chapter commences with an anecdote from the author about his own personal experience with the topic, followed by thought-provoking questions and a list of recommended readings in the scientific literature. The book will be a useful textbook for advanced ichthyology students as well as an encyclopedic source for those seeking a greater understanding of these fascinating creatures.",Science,525,5,1,en

The Modern Pilgrim,"Paul Post, Paulus Gijsbertus Johannes Post, Jos Pieper, Marinus van Uden",Peeters Publishers,1998,"This book is the product of a relatively long history of pilgrimage research in a Dutch theological setting. It is intended as a report for an international audience on this long-running programme. Two lines are followed in the book. The first is the track of liturgical studies, in which an historical, European ethnological and anthropological approach has predominated. The second is a social science track, with specific content coming from psychology of religion. The combination of these two lines has been extremely fruitful. In addition to results of various surveys of contemporary pilgrimage practice and the expansion of research into ritual and cultural context in which modern pilgrims find themselves, special attention is also bestowed on historiographic issues involved in orienting pilgrimage research, and its theoretical and methodological aspects. The places of pilgrimage examined here are Wittem, Dokkum and Amsterdam in The Netherlands, Banneux in Belgium, Lourdes and La Salette in France, and Santiago de Compostela in Spain. The central question which informs the whole study is to what extent one can perhaps speak of a new type of pilgrim today, the ""modern pilgrim"".",Religion,388,N/A,0,en

The Acorn People,Ron Jones,Laurel Leaf,1996-06-11,"This true story of a boy who must overcome prejudice and weakness to treat a group of special needs children with the respect—and love—they deserve “will give your innards a bear hug. . . . You will read this book with a lump in your throat.” (Lincoln Journal) From Ron Jones, a teacher who started the classroom program that inspired the movie The Wave, comes a memoir about a life-changing summer. Ron expected that his time as a counselor at Camp Wiggin would be filled with sunny days spent hiking, swimming, and boating. But when he arrives on day one, his illusions are quickly shattered. He knew that the kids would be “handicapped,” but he didn’t anticipate having to care for children who can barely walk or see or retain the use of their limbs. At first, the severity of the campers’ disabilities seems too much to bear. But everything changes once Ron gets to know his group—kids who call themselves “the Acorn People” because of the acorn necklaces they wear around their necks. The campers teach him that, inside, they are the same as any average kid, and with encouragement, determination, and friendship, nothing is impossible. “A fantastic and beautiful story.”—Seattle Times “Uncomfortably moving, yet told in surprisingly unsentimental terms. . . . Succinct and tender, it will haunt the reader long after the brief passages have been read.”—Houston Chronicle ""Ron Jones' true story of a group of handicapped children at summer camp is one of the most poignant, beautiful and eloquent tales to come this way in a long time.""—Flint Journal",Young Adult Nonfiction,92,N/A,0,en

Jamie and Charlotte are looking for a winter break reprieve in Sussex after a fall semester that almost got them killed. But nothing about their time off is proving simple, including Holmes and Watson’s growing feelings for each other.

Other papers describe applications of the novel risk-related econometric techniques to real-life economic situations.

Dipterocarp Forest Ecosystems: Towards Sustainable Management,"Andreas Schulte, D Schone",World Scientific,1996-07-30,"The Dipterocarp forests of South-East Asia constitute a dominant component of the world's tropical forests. As such, they are intertwined with a Pandora's box of problems that have plagued the world for decades; Over- and underdevelopment, poverty, hunger, population growth, exploitation of natural resources, environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity, the debt crisis and, of late, climate change. The world community has responded to the crucial role of these forests and the dangers facing them with funds, and a myriad of programmers, projects, institutions, conferences and networks. Apparently neither a lack of knowledge nor finance constrains the dissipation of sustainable management practices: the fate of the world's Dipterocarp forests will certainly depend on the involvement of scientists from many nations and disciplines, but will perhaps ultimately, rest with local policymakers, forest administrators and line foresters. Unfortunately, these two groups rarely share realms, readings or reasoning: practical foresters, invariably very involved with the challenges of day-to-day forest management in remote, isolated environments, may long remain oblivious to scientific developments. Traditionally though they do find solutions to problems, gain deep insights into forest responses and practical constraints, and sometimes even report in semi-obscure publications, which rarely reach the scientific circuit.The editors of the book, both experienced forest and soil scientists and practical forest managers, have attempted to bridge the gap between the realms of forest science and practice in Dipterocarp ecology, management and utilization.",Technology & Engineering,682,N/A,0,en

Fountain,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2012-01-16,"For public and school libraries, this resource reflects recent changes in Library of Congress subject headings and authority files, and provides bilingual information essential to reference librarians and catalogers serving Spanish speakers. Libraries must provide better access to their collections for all users, including Spanish-language materials. The American Library Association has recognized this increasing need. Subject Headings for School and Public Libraries: Bilingual Fourth Edition is the only resource available that provides both authorized and reference entries in English and Spanish. A first-check source for the most frequently used headings needed in school and public libraries, this book incorporates thousands of new and revised entries to assist in applying LCSH and CSH headings. Of the approximately 30,000 headings listed, most include cross-references, and all of the cross-reference terms are translated. MARC21 tags are included for all authorized entries to simplify entering them into computerized catalogs, while indexes to all headings and free-floating subdivisions are provided in translation from Spanish to English. This book gives librarians access to accurate translations of the subject terms printed in books published and cataloged in English-speaking countriesinvaluable information in settings with Spanish-speaking patrons.",Language Arts & Disciplines,487,N/A,0,en

In 1994/95, the La Bahia Apartments site and Coast Hotel parking lot site at the corner of West Cliff Drive and Bay Street were both analyzed to determine the feasibility of developing either site into a 275-300 room, group oriented conference hotel as part of the preparation of the City's Beach/South Laurel Plan (B/SOL Area Plan) ... Subsequent to the recommendations of the B/SOL Area Plan, the property owner submitted a plan to the City to develop the La Bahia site into a 118-room hotel with day spa, but without a conference facility ... Subsequent to approval of the project in 2003, the applicant decided not to pursue this permit project and has allowed the permit to expire.

Hummingbird Salamander,Jeff VanderMeer,MCD,2021-04-06,"Named one of NPR's Best Books of 2021 From the author of Annihilation, a brilliant speculative thriller of dark conspiracy, endangered species, and the possible end of all things. Security consultant “Jane Smith” receives an envelope with a key to a storage unit that holds a taxidermied hummingbird and clues leading her to a taxidermied salamander. Silvina, the dead woman who left the note, is a reputed ecoterrorist and the daughter of an Argentine industrialist. By taking the hummingbird from the storage unit, Jane sets in motion a series of events that quickly spin beyond her control. Soon, Jane and her family are in danger, with few allies to help her make sense of the true scope of the peril. Is the only way to safety to follow in Silvina’s footsteps? Is it too late to stop? As she desperately seeks answers about why Silvina contacted her, time is running out—for her and possibly for the world. Hummingbird Salamander is Jeff VanderMeer at his brilliant, cinematic best, wrapping profound questions about climate change, identity, and the world we live in into a tightly plotted thriller full of unexpected twists and elaborate conspiracy.",Fiction,266,N/A,0,en
Don't Know Tough,Eli Cranor,Hachette UK,2022-08-04,"'A searing and stunningly poignant study in what makes us and what breaks us' S. A. Cosby, New York Times bestselling author of Razorblade Tears and Blacktop Wasteland 'A gripping novel about rage and trauma, redemption and damnation, football and family' Steph Cha Friday Night Lights with a Southern Gothic twist - a powerful debut noir for fans of S. A. Cosby and Megan Abbott. In Denton, Arkansas, the fate of the high school football team rests on the shoulders of Billy Lowe, a volatile but talented running back. Billy comes from an extremely troubled home: a trailer park where he is terrorized by his unstable mother's abusive boyfriend. Billy takes out his anger on the field, but when his savagery crosses a line, he faces suspension. Without Billy Lowe, the Denton Pirates can kiss their playoff bid goodbye. But the head coach, Trent Powers, who just moved from California with his wife and two children for this job, has more than just his paycheck riding on Billy's bad behavior.

American Prison,Shane Bauer,Penguin,2018-09-18,"An enraging, necessary look at the private prison system, and a convincing clarion call for prison reform.” —NPR.org New York Times Book Review 10 Best Books of 2018 * One of President Barack Obama’s favorite books of 2018 * Winner of the 2019 J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize * Winner of the Helen Bernstein Book Award for Excellence in Journalism * Winner of the 2019 RFK Book and Journalism Award * A New York Times Notable Book A ground-breaking and brave inside reckoning with the nexus of prison and profit in America: in one Louisiana prison and over the course of our country's history. In 2014, Shane Bauer was hired for $9 an hour to work as an entry-level prison guard at a private prison in Winnfield, Louisiana. An award-winning investigative journalist, he used his real name; there was no meaningful background check. Four months later, his employment came to an abrupt end. But he had seen enough, and in short order he wrote an exposé about his experiences that won a National Magazine Award and became the most-read feature in the history of the magazine Mother Jones. Still, there was much more that he needed to say. In American Prison, Bauer weaves a much deeper reckoning with his experiences together with a thoroughly researched history of for-profit prisons in America from their origins in the decades before the Civil War. For, as he soon realized, we can't understand the cruelty of our current system and its place in the larger story of mass incarceration without understanding where it came from. Private prisons became entrenched in the South as part of a systemic effort to keep the African-American labor force in place in the aftermath of slavery, and the echoes of these shameful origins are with us still. The private prison system is deliberately unaccountable to public scrutiny. Private prisons are not incentivized to tend to the health of their inmates, or to feed them well, or to attract and retain a highly-trained prison staff. Though Bauer befriends some of his colleagues and sympathizes with their plight, the chronic dysfunction of their lives only adds to the prison's sense of chaos. To his horror, Bauer finds himself becoming crueler and more aggressive the longer he works in the prison, and he is far from alone. A blistering indictment of the private prison system, and the powerful forces that drive it, American Prison is a necessary human document about the true face of justice in America.",Political Science,384,N/A,0,en

Your Sons Are at Your Service,Aaron Y. Zelin,Columbia University Press,2020-02-11,"Tunisia became one of the largest sources of foreign fighters for the Islamic State—even though the country stands out as a democratic bright spot of the Arab uprisings and despite the fact that it had very little history of terrorist violence within its borders prior to 2011. In Your Sons Are at Your Service, Aaron Y. Zelin uncovers the longer history of Tunisian involvement in the jihadi movement and offers an in-depth examination of the reasons why so many Tunisians became drawn to jihadism following the 2011 revolution. Zelin highlights the longer-term causes that affected jihadi recruitment in Tunisia, including the prior history of Tunisians joining jihadi organizations and playing key roles in far-flung parts of the world over the past four decades. He contends that the jihadi group Ansar al-Sharia in Tunisia was able to take advantage of the universal prisoner amnesty, increased openness, and the lack of governmental policy toward it after the revolution. In turn, this provided space for greater recruitment and subsequent mobilization to fight abroad once the Tunisian government cracked down on the group in 2013. Zelin marshals cutting-edge empirical findings, extensive primary source research, and on-the-ground fieldwork, including a variety of documents in Arabic going as far back as the 1980s and interviews with Ansar al-Sharia members and Tunisian fighters returning from Syria. The first book on the history of the Tunisian jihadi movement, Your Sons Are at Your Service is a meticulously researched account that challenges simplified views of jihadism’s appeal and success.",Political Science,277,N/A,0,en

ISIS,"Michael Weiss, Hassan Hassan",Simon and Schuster,2015-01-29,"A revelatory look inside the world's most dangerous terrorist group. Initially dismissed by US President Barack Obama, along with other fledgling terrorist groups, as a “jayvee squad” compared to al-Qaeda, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has shocked the world by conquering massive territories in both countries and promising to create a vast new Muslim caliphate that observes the strict dictates of Sharia law. In ISIS: Inside the Army of Terror, American journalist Michael Weiss and Syrian analyst Hassan Hassan explain how these violent extremists evolved from a nearly defeated Iraqi insurgent group into a jihadi army of international volunteers who behead Western hostages in slickly produced videos and have conquered territory equal to the size of Great Britain. Beginning with the early days of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the founder of ISIS’s first incarnation as “al-Qaeda in Iraq,” Weiss and Hassan explain who the key players are—from their elusive leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to the former Saddam Baathists in their ranks—where they come from, how the movement has attracted both local and global support, and where their financing comes from. Political and military maneuvering by the United States, Iraq, Iran, and Syria have all fueled ISIS’s astonishing and explosive expansion. Drawing on original interviews with former US military officials and current ISIS fighters, the authors also reveal the internecine struggles within the movement itself, as well as ISIS’s bloody hatred of Shiite Muslims, which is generating another sectarian war in the region. Just like the one the US thought it had stopped in 2011 in Iraq. Past is prologue and America’s legacy in the Middle East is sowing a new generation of terror.",Political Science,271,3,1,en
The Drone Wars,Seth J. Frantzman,Bombardier Books,2021-06-22,"In the battle for the streets of Mosul in Iraq, drones in the hands of ISIS terrorists made life hell for the Iraq army and civilians. Today, defense companies are racing to develop the lasers, microwave weapons, and technology necessary for confronting the next drone threat. Seth J. Frantzman takes the reader from the midnight exercises with Israel’s elite drone warriors, to the CIA headquarters where new drone technology was once adopted in the 1990s to hunt Osama bin Laden. This rapidly expanding technology could be used to target nuclear power plants and pose a threat to civilian airports. In the Middle East, the US used a drone to kill Iranian arch-terrorist Qasem Soleimani, a key Iranian commander. Drones are transforming the battlefield from Syria to Libya and Yemen. For militaries and security agencies—the main users of expensive drones—the UAV market is expanding as well; there were more than 20,000 military drones in use by 2020. Once the province of only a few militaries, drones now being built in Turkey, China, Russia, and smaller countries like Taiwan may be joining the military drone market. It’s big business, too—$100 billion will be spent over the next decade on drones. Militaries may soon be spending more on drones than tanks, much as navies transitioned away from giant vulnerable battleships to more agile ships. The future wars will be fought with drones and won by whoever has the most sophisticated technology.",History,228,N/A,0,en

Sofia Coppola,Hannah Strong,Abrams,2022-05-17,"An illustrated critical survey of Academy Award–winning writer and director Sofia Coppola’s career, covering everything from her groundbreaking music videos through her latest films In the two decades since her first feature film was released, Sofia Coppola has created a tonally diverse, meticulously crafted, and unapologetically hyperfeminine aesthetic across a wide range of multimedia work. Her films explore untenable relationships and the euphoria and heartbreak these entail, and Coppola develops these themes deftly and with discernment across her movies and music videos. From The Virgin Suicides and Marie Antoinette to Lost in Translation and The Beguiled, Coppola’s award-nominated filmography is also unique in how its consistent visual aesthetic is informed by and in conversation with contemporary fine art and photography. Sofia Coppola offers a rich and intimate look at the overarching stylistic and thematic components of Coppola's work.

Modern Romance,"Aziz Ansari, Eric Klinenberg",Penguin,2016-06-14,"The #1 New York Times Bestseller “An engaging look at the often head-scratching, frequently infuriating mating behaviors that shape our love lives.” —Refinery 29 A hilarious, thoughtful, and in-depth exploration of the pleasures and perils of modern romance from Aziz Ansari, the star of Master of None and one of this generation’s sharpest comedic voices At some point, every one of us embarks on a journey to find love. We meet people, date, get into and out of relationships, all with the hope of finding someone with whom we share a deep connection. This seems standard now, but it’s wildly different from what people did even just decades ago. Single people today have more romantic options than at any point in human history. With technology, our abilities to connect with and sort through these options are staggering. So why are so many people frustrated? Some of our problems are unique to our time. “Why did this guy just text me an emoji of a pizza?” “Should I go out with this girl even though she listed Combos as one of her favorite snack foods? Combos?!” “My girlfriend just got a message from some dude named Nathan. Who’s Nathan? Did he just send her a photo of his penis? Should I check just to be sure?” But the transformation of our romantic lives can’t be explained by technology alone. In a short period of time, the whole culture of finding love has changed dramatically. A few decades ago, people would find a decent person who lived in their neighborhood. Their families would meet and, after deciding neither party seemed like a murderer, they would get married and soon have a kid, all by the time they were twenty-four. Today, people marry later than ever and spend years of their lives on a quest to find the perfect person, a soul mate. For years, Aziz Ansari has been aiming his comic insight at modern romance, but for Modern Romance, the book, he decided he needed to take things to another level. He teamed up with NYU sociologist Eric Klinenberg and designed a massive research project, including hundreds of interviews and focus groups conducted everywhere from Tokyo to Buenos Aires to Wichita. They analyzed behavioral data and surveys and created their own online research forum on Reddit, which drew thousands of messages. They enlisted the world’s leading social scientists, including Andrew Cherlin, Eli Finkel, Helen Fisher, Sheena Iyengar, Barry Schwartz, Sherry Turkle, and Robb Willer. The result is unlike any social science or humor book we’ve seen before. In Modern Romance, Ansari combines his irreverent humor with cutting-edge social science to give us an unforgettable tour of our new romantic world.",Humor,290,5,1,en

Through mechanisms designed by Southern Democrats that specifically excluded maids and farm workers, the gap between blacks and whites actually widened despite postwar prosperity.

There are political and economic issues of the allocation of resources, environmental conflict, new work roles, and differential power. There are personal issues: leisure as challenge and consumption, development, and entertainment. There is the ""other side"" of leisure with everything for sale. There are the diverse symbolic meanings of leisure in a market culture. Major forms of leisure are explored including tourism, sport, mass media, the arts, and outdoor recreation.

Leisure and Human Development,Douglas A. Kleiber,N/A,2016-07,"This is an examination of the link between human development and behavior in a context, leisure, that has been described as encompassing one third of people's time. This text examines human development as it affects and is affected by leisure -- what people do when they are relatively free to choose their behaviors. Douglas Kleiber and Francis McGuire, two highly respected academics, developed this book around age-based periods of life. The authors assert that leisure relates to human development in three fundamental ways: human development influences leisure behaviour, leisure behaviors influence development, leisure plays a role in moderating the effects of life events. In developing these themes, the authors have invited highly qualified academics to draw on their expertise in fleshing them out, not only by age and life stage but also by activity themes that carry across the life cycle. The book approaches the topic of leisure across the lifespan from a developmental perspective: the orderly, patterned, enduring trajectory of life. A central idea of this book is that both theories for developmental psychology and research findings can lead to practical application -- the so what question is addressed throughout the book. Thus, even though it is a book bounded by developmental theory, it is immediately useful for the student (or anyone else) seeking to understand leisure in everyday life across the lifespan. The authors of these chapters imply, both directly and indirectly, that leisure can be and is identity producing. This is an important book, edited and written by leading authors in the field. It will find a lasting readership among all those interested in understanding and improving human development.",Developmental psychology,372,N/A,0,en

Statistical Power Analysis,"Kevin R. Murphy, Brett Myors, Kevin Murphy, Allen Wolach",Routledge,2003-08-01,"This book presents a simple and general method for conducting statistical power analysis based on the widely used F statistic. The book illustrates how these analyses work and how they can be applied to problems of studying design, to evaluate others' research, and to choose the appropriate criterion for defining ""statistically significant"" outcomes. Statistical Power Analysis examines the four major applications of power analysis, concentrating on how to determine: *the sample size needed to achieve desired levels of power; *the level of power that is needed in a study; *the size of effect that can be reliably detected by a study; and *sensible criteria for statistical significance. Highlights of the second edition include: a CD with an easy-to-use statistical power analysis program; a new chapter on power analysis in multi-factor ANOVA, including repeated-measures designs; and a new One-Stop PV Table to serve as a quick reference guide. The book discusses the application of power analysis to both traditional null hypothesis tests and to minimum-effect testing. It demonstrates how the same basic model applies to both types of testing and explains how some relatively simple procedures allow researchers to ask a series of important questions about their research. Drawing from the behavioral and social sciences, the authors present the material in a nontechnical way so that readers with little expertise in statistical analysis can quickly obtain the values needed to carry out the power analysis. Ideal for students and researchers of statistical and research methodology in the social, behavioral, and health sciences who want to know how to apply methods of power analysis to their research.",Psychology,247,N/A,0,en

The Sioux Chef’s healthful plates embrace venison and rabbit, river and lake trout, duck and quail, wild turkey, blueberries, sage, sumac, timpsula or wild turnip, plums, purslane, and abundant wildflowers.

Habitat Suitability and Distribution Models,"Antoine Guisan, Wilfried Thuiller, Niklaus E. Zimmermann",Cambridge University Press,2017-09-14,"This book introduces the key stages of niche-based habitat suitability model building, evaluation and prediction required for understanding and predicting future patterns of species and biodiversity. Beginning with the main theory behind ecological niches and species distributions, the book proceeds through all major steps of model building, from conceptualization and model training to model evaluation and spatio-temporal predictions. Extensive examples using R support graduate students and researchers in quantifying ecological niches and predicting species distributions with their own data, and help to address key environmental and conservation problems.

In an Ireland doubly ravaged by war and disease, Nurse Julia Power works at an understaffed hospital in the city center, where expectant mothers who have come down with the terrible new Flu are quarantined together. Into Julia's regimented world step two outsiders—Doctor Kathleen Lynn, a rumoured Rebel on the run from the police, and a young volunteer helper, Bridie Sweeney. In the darkness and intensity of this tiny ward, over three days, these women change each other's lives in unexpected ways. They lose patients to this baffling pandemic, but they also shepherd new life into a fearful world. With tireless tenderness and humanity, carers and mothers alike somehow do their impossible work. In The Pull of the Stars, Emma Donoghue once again finds the light in the darkness in this new classic of hope and survival against all odds.",Fiction,269,N/A,0,en

"Gen Z, Explained","Roberta Katz, Sarah Ogilvie, Jane Shaw, Linda Woodhead",University of Chicago Press,2022-10-26,"An optimistic and nuanced portrait of a generation that has much to teach us about how to live and collaborate in our digital world. Born since the mid-1990s, members of Generation Z comprise the first generation never to know the world without the internet, and the most diverse generation yet. As Gen Z starts to emerge into adulthood and enter the workforce, what do we really know about them? And what can we learn from them? Gen Z, Explained is the authoritative portrait of this significant generation. It draws on extensive interviews that display this generation’s candor, surveys that explore their views and attitudes, and a vast database of their astonishingly inventive lexicon to build a comprehensive picture of their values, daily lives, and outlook. Gen Z emerges here as an extraordinarily thoughtful, promising, and perceptive generation that is sounding a warning to their elders about the world around them—a warning of a complexity and depth the “OK Boomer” phenomenon can only suggest. ​ Much of the existing literature about Gen Z has been highly judgmental. In contrast, this book provides a deep and nuanced understanding of a generation facing a future of enormous challenges, from climate change to civil unrest. What’s more, they are facing this future head-on, relying on themselves and their peers to work collaboratively to solve these problems. As Gen Z, Explained shows, this group of young people is as compassionate and imaginative as any that has come before, and understanding the way they tackle problems may enable us to envision new kinds of solutions. This portrait of Gen Z is ultimately an optimistic one, suggesting they have something to teach all of us about how to live and thrive in this digital world.",History,275,N/A,0,en

KG: A to Z,Kevin Garnett,Simon and Schuster,2021-02-23,"NATIONAL BESTSELLER​ A unique, unfiltered memoir from the NBA champion and fifteen-time all-star ahead of his induction into the Hall of Fame. Kevin Garnett was one of the most dominant players the game of basketball has ever seen. He was also one of its most outspoken. Over the course of his illustrious twenty-one-year NBA career, he elevated trash talk to an art form and never shied away from sharing his thoughts on controversial subjects. In KG A to Z, published ahead of Garnett’s induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame, he looks back on his life and career with the same raw candor. Garnett describes the adversity he faced growing up in South Carolina before ultimately relocating to Chicago, where he became one of the top prospects in the nation. He details his headline-making decision to skip college and become the first player in two decades to enter the draft directly from high school, starting a trend that would be followed by future superstars like Kobe Bryant and LeBron James. He shares stories of playing with and against Bryant, James, Michael Jordan, and other NBA greats, and he chronicles his professional ups and downs, including winning a championship with the Boston Celtics. He also speaks his mind on a range of topics beyond basketball, such as fame, family, racism, spirituality, and music. Garnett’s draft decision wasn’t the only way he’d forever change the game. His ability to play on the perimeter as a big man foreshadowed the winning strategy now universally adopted by the league. He applies this same innovative spirit here, organizing the contents alphabetically as an encyclopedia. If you thought Kevin Garnett was exciting, inspiring, and unfiltered on the court, just wait until you read what he has to say in these pages.",Sports & Recreation,320,N/A,0,en

Meet Generation Z,James Emery White,Baker Books,2017-01-17,"Move over Boomers, Xers, and Millennials; there's a new generation--making up more than 25 percent of the US population--that represents a seismic cultural shift.

James Emery White explains who this generation is, how it came to be, and the impact it is likely to have on the nation and the faith.

Fight,John Della Volpe,St. Martin's Press,2022-01-18,"From John Della Volpe, the director of polling at the Harvard Institute of Politics, Fight is an exploration of Gen Z, the issues that matter most to them, and how they will shape the future. 9/11. The war on terror. Hurricane Katrina. The 2008 financial crisis. The housing crisis. The opioid epidemic. Mass school shootings. Global warming. The Trump presidency. COVID-19. Since they were born, Generation Z (also known as ""zoomers"")—those born from the late 1990s to early 2000s—have been faced with an onslaught of turmoil, destruction and instability unprecedented in modern history. And it shows: they are more stressed, anxious, and depressed than previous generations, a phenomenon John Della Volpe has documented heavily through decades of meeting with groups of young Americans across the country. But Gen Z has not buckled under this tremendous weight. On the contrary, they have organized around issues from gun control to racial and environmental justice to economic equity, becoming more politically engaged than their elders, and showing a unique willingness to disrupt the status quo. In Fight: How Gen Z Is Channeling Their Passion and Fear to Save America, Della Volpe draws on his vast experience to show the largest forces shaping zoomers' lives, the issues they care most about, and how they are—despite older Americans' efforts to label Gen Z as overly sensitive, lazy, and entitled—rising to the unprecedented challenges of their time to take control of their country and our future.",Political Science,146,N/A,0,en
Linguistics in Philosophy,Zeno Vendler,Cornell University Press,2019-06-30,"This book is a major attempt to reconcile the empirical basis of linguistic science with the a priori nature of philosophical reasoning. Its purpose is to show how the methods and findings of linguistic science, especially of transformational grammar, can be used to cast light upon central problems of analytic philosophy. After dealing with recent objections to the use of linguistic techniques in philosophy, the author shows, with great force and clarity, how these techniques can be applied to such problems as the analysis of singular terms, the concepts of fact, event, and causality, and the meaning of the word ""good.""",Philosophy,229,N/A,0,en

Over the last few years L2 motivation research has taken an exciting new turn by focusing increasingly on the language learner’s situated identity and various self-perceptions. As a result, the concept of L2 motivation is currently in the process of being radically reconceptualised and re-theorised in the context of contemporary notions of self and identity. With contributions by leading European, North American and Asian scholars, this volume brings together the first comprehensive anthology of key conceptual and empirical papers that mark this important paradigmatic shift.",Language Arts & Disciplines,377,5,1,en

Wanted! Mountain Cedars,Elizabeth McGreevy,N/A,2021-04-15,"This controversial, eye-opening book by Elizabeth McGreevy suggests a different perception of Mountain Cedars (also called Ashe Junipers). It digs into the politics, history, economics, culture, and ecology surrounding these trees in the Hill Country of Texas from the 1700s to the present. Since the 1920s, reporters, writers, scientists, landowners, politicians, and cedar fever victims have characterized the trees as a non-native, water-hogging, grass-killing, toxic, useless species to justify its removal. The result has been a glut of Mountain Cedar tall tales. Yet before the 1890s, people highly respected Mountain Cedars. The Mountain Cedars they reported were large timber trees with strong, decay-resistant heartwood. Most were cut down and sold to boost the young Hill Country economy. The clearcutting of old-growth forests and dense woodlands and the continuous overgrazing of prairies that followed led to mass soil degradation and erosion. Acting as nature's bandage, Mountain Cedars morphed into pioneering bushes and spread across degraded soils. This book tracks down the origins of the tall tales to determine what is true, what is false, and what is somewhere in between. Through a series of revelations, the author replaces anti-cedar sentiments with a more constructive, less emotional approach to Hill Country land management.",,0,N/A,0,en

Preference Data for Environmental Valuation,"John Whitehead, Tim Haab, Ju-Chin Huang",Routledge,2012-03-15,"The monetary valuation of environmental goods and services has evolved from a fringe field of study in the late 1970s and early 1980s to a primary focus of environmental economists over the past decade. Despite its rapid growth, practitioners of valuation techniques often find themselves defending their practices to both users of the results of applied studies and, perhaps more troubling, to other practitioners. One of the more heated threads of this internal debate over valuation techniques revolves around the types of data to use in performing a valuation study. In the infant years of the development of valuation techniques, two schools of thought emerged: the revealed preference school and the stated preference school, the latter of which is perhaps most associated with the contingent valuation method. In the midst of this debate an exciting new approach to non-market valuation was developed in the 1990s: a combination and joint estimation of revealed preference and stated preference data. There are two primary objectives for this book. One objective is to fill a gap in the nonmarket valuation ""primer"" literature. A number of books have appeared over the past decade that develop the theory and methods of nonmarket valuation but each takes an individual nonmarket valuation method approach. This book considers each of these valuation methods in combination with another method. These relationships can be exploited econometrically to obtain more valid and reliable estimates of willingness-to-pay relative to the individual methods. The second objective is to showcase recent and novel applications of data combination and joint estimation via a set of original, state-of-the-art studies that are contributed by leading researchers in the field. This book will be accessible to economists and consultants working in business or government, as well as an invaluable resource for researchers and students alike.",Business & Economics,371,N/A,0,en

Limited undergraduate and graduate programs educate their students about social justice issues, thus, resulting in licensed teachers who lack the content knowledge, comfort level and pedagogical tools on how to educate students about issues related to social justice. Grounded in the transformative pedagogy theoretical framework, this book will offer practical lessons and strategies on a wide variety of social issues (e.g., body, race, self-identity, immigration) that can be used in teacher education and the PK-12 setting. The goal is for teacher educators and practitioners to feel more comfortable with teaching about and for social justice and believe this resource will enhance their content and pedagogical knowledge in the quest to achieve that goal. The purpose of this book is to provide physical education teacher educators and PK-12 physical education teachers with lesson plans and resources on how to address social justice issues in a physical education setting. This book will include sample lesson plans/activities that address a wide variety of social issues – the what, the how and the challenges and possibilities that the author(s) encountered when teaching such a lesson/activity. Addressing social justice issues has been limited in physical education, both in higher education and PK-12, especially in the United States. Numerous scholars, internationally, have engaged in research studies that explored how social justice issues are addressed in physical education teacher education.

With generational divides wider than ever, parents, educators, and employers have an urgent need to understand today’s rising generation of teens and young adults. Born in the mid-1990s up to the mid-2000s, iGen is the first generation to spend their entire adolescence in the age of the smartphone. With social media and texting replacing other activities, iGen spends less time with their friends in person—perhaps contributing to their unprecedented levels of anxiety, depression, and loneliness. But technology is not the only thing that makes iGen distinct from every generation before them; they are also different in how they spend their time, how they behave, and in their attitudes toward religion, sexuality, and politics. They socialize in completely new ways, reject once sacred social taboos, and want different things from their lives and careers. More than previous generations, they are obsessed with safety, focused on tolerance, and have no patience for inequality. With the first members of iGen just graduating from college, we all need to understand them: friends and family need to look out for them; businesses must figure out how to recruit them and sell to them; colleges and universities must know how to educate and guide them. And members of iGen also need to understand themselves as they communicate with their elders and explain their views to their older peers. Because where iGen goes, so goes our nation—and the world.",Social Science,452,4,3,en

The Responsible Methodologist,Aaron M. Kuntz,Routledge,2016-06-03,"Winner of The University of Alabama 2017 President’s Faculty Research Award What does it mean to be a responsible methodologist? Certainly it is more than being a research middle-manager who ensures that the tools used in a thesis or dissertation are of the right gauge. In The Responsible Methodologist, leading education scholar Aaron Kuntz uses the latest movements in social theory to challenge qualitative researchers to reconceptualize their work away from the technocratic toward an intervention, an ethical disruption of the norm, an activist stance toward progressive social change. Inviting creativity and vision, he insists that the responsible methodologist become a force leading the discourse toward social justice. His book-challenges the technocratic role given to qualitative methodologists in university settings;-urges them to become a force for change through Foucault’s parrhesia, risky truth-telling;-includes research projects that have incorporated this vision. http://amkuntz.people.ua.edu/",Psychology,248,N/A,0,en

The App Generation,"Howard Gardner, Katie Davis",Yale University Press,2013-10-22,"No one has failed to notice that the current generation of youth is deeply--some would say totally--involved with digital media. Professors Howard Gardner and Katie Davis name today's young people The App Generation, and in this spellbinding book they explore what it means to be ""app-dependent"" versus ""app-enabled"" and how life for this generation differs from life before the digital era. Gardner and Davis are concerned with three vital areas of adolescent life: identity, intimacy, and imagination. Through innovative research, including interviews of young people, focus groups of those who work with them, and a unique comparison of youthful artistic productions before and after the digital revolution, the authors uncover the drawbacks of apps: they may foreclose a sense of identity, encourage superficial relations with others, and stunt creative imagination. On the other hand, the benefits of apps are equally striking: they can promote a strong sense of identity, allow deep relationships, and stimulate creativity. The challenge is to venture beyond the ways that apps are designed to be used, Gardner and Davis conclude, and they suggest how the power of apps can be a springboard to greater creativity and higher aspirations.",Psychology,258,N/A,0,en

Sustainable Transportation in Natural and Protected Areas,Francesco Orsi,Routledge,2015-07-16,"Protected areas are at the centre of nature-based tourism, which is increasingly popular across the world. As visitor numbers increase, so does awareness of the harmful effects that large crowds may have on both natural resources and individuals’ recreational experience. This volume considers the challenge of transportation to and within natural and protected areas, the improvement of which has already been recognised as having great potential for mitigating the environmental impacts of ecotourism. While several books have focused considerable attention to the management of protected areas in general, little has been said about the specific issue of sustainable transport, an emerging trend that is already reshaping visitation patterns in natural settings. This book provides current knowledge on issues associated with the transportation of visitors in natural and protected areas, and a comprehensive overview of the technical and strategic options available to tackle these issues. It approaches the subject via three main topics: preferences, or the visitors' attitudes towards transportation; practices, where current approaches are assessed through examples and case-studies of successful experiences and methodologies from around the world; and policies, where suggestions and recommendations are put forward for both local scale strategies and broad-scale regulatory action with global relevance. Contributors include academics in the field of natural resource management and tourism, with extensive experience in protected area management and active partnerships with natural park administrations.",Nature,305,N/A,0,en

Frannie and Louis met online when they were both little and have been pen pals ever since. They have never met face-to-face, and they don’t know each other’s real names. All they know is that they both have a mysterious tendency to lose things. Well, not lose them really. Things just seem to mysteriously disappear. When they each receive surprising news in the mail, they set off on a road trip to Austin, Texas, looking for answers—and each other. Along the way, each one begins to find, as if by magic, important things the other has lost. And by the time they finally meet in person, they realize that the things you lose might be things you weren’t meant to have at all, and that you never know what—or who—you might find if you just take a chance. “The characters and the road trip alone are a winning combination.

Creolizing Contradance in the Caribbean,Peter Manuel,Temple University Press,2011-10-14,"The contradance and quadrille, in their diverse forms, were the most popular, widespread, and important genres of creole Caribbean music and dance in the nineteenth century. Throughout the region they constituted sites for interaction of musicians and musical elements of different racial, social, and ethnic origins, and they became crucibles for the evolution of genres like the Cuban danzón and son, the Dominican merengue, and the Haitian mereng. Creolizing Contradance in the Caribbean is the first book to explore this phenomenon in detail and with a pan-regional perspective. Individual chapters by respected area experts discuss the Spanish, French, and English-speaking Caribbean, covering musical and choreographic features, social dynamics, historical development and significance, placed in relation to the broader Caribbean historical context. This groundbreaking text fills a significant gap in studies of Caribbean cultural history and of social dance.",History,288,N/A,0,en
Valuing Environmental and Natural Resources,"Timothy C. Haab, Kenneth E. McConnell",Edward Elgar Publishing,2002-01-01,"Non-market valuation has become a broadly accepted and widely practiced means of measuring the economic values of the environment and natural resources. In this book, the authors provide a guide to the statistical and econometric practices that economists employ in estimating non-market values. The authors develop the econometric models that underlie the basic methods: contingent valuation, travel cost models, random utility models and hedonic models. They analyze the measurement of non-market values as a procedure with two steps: the estimation of parameters of demand and preference functions and the calculation of benefits from the estimated models. Each of the models is carefully developed from the preference function to the behavioral or response function that researchers observe. The models are then illustrated with datasets that characterize the kinds of data researchers typically deal with. The real world data and clarity of writing in this book will appeal to environmental economists, students, researchers and practitioners in multilateral banks and government agencies.",Business & Economics,343,N/A,0,en
