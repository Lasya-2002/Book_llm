The Maltreatment of Children,S.M. Smith,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The maltreatment of children is an issue that has always been with us and civilized societies provide a range of services both social and medical to care for the children and families afflicted. In recent years, greater attention has been drawn to the medical aspects by competent authorities in the fields of forensic medicine, forensic psychiatry, epidemiological psychiatry, child psychiatry and family psychiatry; as well as the social aspects by those child welfare and child care agencies who have the difficult and distasteful task of removing children, with the help of the courts, from parents who can abuse them and are not able to care for them adequately. A multitude of social agencies, whose range of ac tivities involve both the care and, where possible, the social betterment of afflicted families are now involved. Not least in importance is an increase in our global knowledge to help in the prevention or better treatment of these problems. This means more informa tion on familial and genetic factors in human central nervous system develop ment in its broadest sense. This would include how the central nervous system originates, mediates and controls the build up, speed of development and im pulsive release, mastery and direction of aggressive drives and impulses. Very little is so far known about these factors.",Medical,457,N/A,0,en

The Social Life of Information,"John Seely Brown, Paul Duguid",Harvard Business Review Press,2017-02-21,"Understand the human place in a digital world. “Should be read by anyone interested in understanding the future,” The Times Literary Supplement raved about the original edition of The Social Life of Information. We’re now living in that future, and one of the seminal books of the Internet Age is more relevant than ever. The future was a place where technology was supposed to empower individuals and obliterate social organizations. Pundits predicted that information technology would spell the end of almost everything—from mass media to bureaucracies, universities, politics, and governments. Clearly, we are not living in that future. The Social Life of Information explains why. John Seely Brown and Paul Duguid show us how to look beyond mere information to the social context that creates and gives meaning to it. Arguing elegantly for the important role that human sociability plays, even—perhaps especially—in the digital world, The Social Life of Information gives us an optimistic look beyond the simplicities of information and individuals. It shows how a better understanding of the contribution that communities, organizations, and institutions make to learning, working, and innovating can lead to the richest possible use of technology in our work and everyday lives. With a new introduction by David Weinberger and reflections by the authors on developments since the book’s first publication, this new edition is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the human place in a digital world.",Business & Economics,333,N/A,0,en

Digital Literacies for Learning,"Allan Martin, Dan Madigan",Facet Publishing,2006,"In the 21st century, digital tools enable information to be generated faster and in greater profusion than ever before, to the point where its extent and value are literally beyond imagining. Such quantities can only be meaningfully addressed using more digital tools, and thus our relationship to information is fundamentally changed. This situation presents a particular challenge to processes of learning and teaching, and demands a response from both information professionals and educators. Enabling education in a digital environment means not only changing the form in which learning opportunities are offered, but also enabling students to survive and prosper in digitally based learning environments. This collection brings together a global community of educators, educational researchers, librarians and IT strategists, to consider how learners need to be equipped in an educational environment that is increasingly suffused with digital technology. Traditional notions of literacy need to be challenged, and new literacies, including information literacy and IT literacy, need to be considered as foundation elements for digitally involved learners. Leading international experts from the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Mexico and throughout Europe contribute to the debate, and Hannelore Rader, Librarian and Dean of the University Libraries, University of Louisville, Kentucky, provides the foreword. The book is in two parts: In Part 1, Literacies in the Digital Age, the contributors analyse how digital technologies have enabled transformative change in the ways in which learning can be constructed, and discuss the nature of the new literacies that have emerged in this new virtual and e-learning environment. In Part 2, Enabling and Supporting Digital Literacies, the contributors go on to consider the ways in which digital literacies can be made available to learners, and how these literacies are being relocated in a more student-centred environment within the broader perspective of learning. Readership: This book takes the issues raised in the successful Information and IT Literacy, also co-edited by Allan Martin, into a broader context. It is essential reading for all information professionals and educators involved in developing strategies and practices for learning in a digital age.",Computers,273,N/A,0,en
To Err Is Human,"Institute of Medicine, Committee on Quality of Health Care in America",National Academies Press,2000-03-01,"Experts estimate that as many as 98,000 people die in any given year from medical errors that occur in hospitals. That's more than die from motor vehicle accidents, breast cancer, or AIDSâ€""three causes that receive far more public attention. Indeed, more people die annually from medication errors than from workplace injuries. Add the financial cost to the human tragedy, and medical error easily rises to the top ranks of urgent, widespread public problems. To Err Is Human breaks the silence that has surrounded medical errors and their consequenceâ€""but not by pointing fingers at caring health care professionals who make honest mistakes. After all, to err is human. Instead, this book sets forth a national agendaâ€""with state and local implicationsâ€""for reducing medical errors and improving patient safety through the design of a safer health system. This volume reveals the often startling statistics of medical error and the disparity between the incidence of error and public perception of it, given many patients' expectations that the medical profession always performs perfectly. A careful examination is made of how the surrounding forces of legislation, regulation, and market activity influence the quality of care provided by health care organizations and then looks at their handling of medical mistakes. Using a detailed case study, the book reviews the current understanding of why these mistakes happen. A key theme is that legitimate liability concerns discourage reporting of errorsâ€""which begs the question, ""How can we learn from our mistakes?"" Balancing regulatory versus market-based initiatives and public versus private efforts, the Institute of Medicine presents wide-ranging recommendations for improving patient safety, in the areas of leadership, improved data collection and analysis, and development of effective systems at the level of direct patient care. To Err Is Human asserts that the problem is not bad people in health careâ€""it is that good people are working in bad systems that need to be made safer. Comprehensive and straightforward, this book offers a clear prescription for raising the level of patient safety in American health care. It also explains how patients themselves can influence the quality of care that they receive once they check into the hospital. This book will be vitally important to federal, state, and local health policy makers and regulators, health professional licensing officials, hospital administrators, medical educators and students, health caregivers, health journalists, patient advocatesâ€""as well as patients themselves.

An Introduction to Statistical Learning,"Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jonathan Taylor",Springer Nature,2023-08-01,"An Introduction to Statistical Learning provides an accessible overview of the field of statistical learning, an essential toolset for making sense of the vast and complex data sets that have emerged in fields ranging from biology to finance, marketing, and astrophysics in the past twenty years. This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, deep learning, survival analysis, multiple testing, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike, who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. Four of the authors co-wrote An Introduction to Statistical Learning, With Applications in R (ISLR), which has become a mainstay of undergraduate and graduate classrooms worldwide, as well as an important reference book for data scientists. One of the keys to its success was that each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in the R scientific computing environment. However, in recent years Python has become a popular language for data science, and there has been increasing demand for a Python-based alternative to ISLR. Hence, this book (ISLP) covers the same materials as ISLR but with labs implemented in Python. These labs will be useful both for Python novices, as well as experienced users.",Mathematics,617,N/A,0,en

Deep Learning,"Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville",MIT Press,2016-11-10,"An introduction to a broad range of topics in deep learning, covering mathematical and conceptual background, deep learning techniques used in industry, and research perspectives. “Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject.” —Elon Musk, cochair of OpenAI; cofounder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX Deep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models.

Microaggression Theory,"Gina C. Torino, David P. Rivera, Christina M. Capodilupo, Kevin L. Nadal, Derald Wing Sue",John Wiley & Sons,2018-10-02,"Get to know the sociopolitical context behind microaggressions Microaggressions are brief, everyday exchanges that send denigrating messages to certain individuals because of their group membership (e.g., race, gender, culture, religion, social class, sexual orientation, etc.). These daily, common manifestations of aggression leave many people feeling vulnerable, targeted, angry, and afraid. How has this become such a pervasive part of our social and political rhetoric, and what is the psychology behind it? In Microaggression Theory, the original research team that created the microaggressions taxonomy, Gina Torino, David Rivera, Christina Capodilupo, Kevin Nadal, and Derald Wing Sue, address these issues head-on in a fascinating work that explores the newest findings of microaggressions in their sociopolitical context. It delves into how the often invisible nature of this phenomenon prevents perpetrators from realizing and confronting their own complicity in creating psychological dilemmas for marginalized groups, and discusses how prejudice, privilege, safe spaces, and cultural appropriation have become themes in our contentious social and political discourse. Details the psychological effects of microaggressions in separate chapters covering clinical impact, trauma, related stress syndromes, and the effect on perpetrators Examines how microaggressions affect education, employment, health care, and the media Explores how social policies and practices can minimize the occurrence and impact of microaggressions in a range of environments Investigates how microaggressions relate to larger social movements If you come across the topic of microaggressions in your day-to-day life, you can keep the conversation going in a productive manner—with research to back it up!",Psychology,400,N/A,0,en

Alexander the Great,Richard Stoneman,Yale University Press,2008-01-01,"Alexander the Great (356-323 B.C.) precipitated immense historical change in the Mediterranean and Near Eastern worlds. But the resonance his legend achieved over the next two millennia stretched even farther across foreign cultures, religious traditions, and distant nations. This engaging and handsomely illustrated book for the first time gathers together hundreds of the colorful Alexander legends that have been told and retold around the globe. Richard Stoneman, a foremost expert on the Alexander myths, introduces us first to the historical Alexander and then to the Alexander of legend, an unparalleled mythic icon who came to represent the heroic ideal in cultures from Egypt to Iceland, from Britain to Malaya. Alexander came to embody the concerns of Hellenistic man; he fueled Roman ideas on tyranny and kingship; he was a talisman for fourth-century pagans and a hero of chivalry in the early Middle Ages. He appears in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic writings, frequently as a prophet of God. Whether battling winged foxes or meeting with the Amazons, descending to the underworld or inventing the world s first diving bell, Alexander inspired as a hero, even a god. Stoneman traces Alexander s influence in ancient literature and folklore and in later literatures of east and west. His book provides the definitive account of the legends of Alexander the Great a powerful leader in life and an even more powerful figure in the history of literature and ideas.""",History,352,N/A,0,en
Conditioned Emotional Reactions,"John B. Watson, Rosalie Rayner",Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2013-01-10,"Psychology Classics: The Case of Little Albert Conditioned Emotional Reactions by John B. Watson and Rosalie Rayner is one of the most influential, infamous and iconic research articles ever published in the history of psychology. Commonly referred to as ""The Case of Little Albert"" this psychology classic attempted to show how fear could be induced in an infant through classical conditioning. Originally published in 1920, Conditioned Emotional Reactions remains among the most frequently cited journal articles in introductory psychology courses and textbooks. A psychology classic is by definition a must read. However, most seminal texts within the discipline remain unread by a majority of psychology students. A detailed, well written description of a classic study is fine to a point, but there is absolutely no substitute for understanding and engaging with the issues under review than by reading the authors unabridged ideas, thoughts and findings in their entirety. Bonus Material: One of the most dramatic aspects of Watson and Rayner's original study was that they had planned to test a number of methods by which they could remove Little Albert's conditioned fear responses. However, as Watson noted ""Unfortunately Albert was taken from the hospital the day the above tests were made. Hence the opportunity of building up an experimental technique by means of which we could remove the conditioned emotional responses was denied us."" This unforeseen turn of events was something that obviously stayed with Watson, as under his guidance some three years later, Mary Cover Jones conducted a follow-up study - A Laboratory Study of Fear: The Case of Peter - which illustrated how fear may be removed under laboratory conditions.

Divorced, estranged from his only daughter, the retired life insurance salesman seeks only solitude and anonymity.

Meanwhile, the wry and acerbic Nathan has undertaken something he calls The Book of Human Folly, in which he proposes ""to set down in the simplest, clearest language possible an account of every blunder, every pratfall, every embarrassment, every idiocy, every foible, and every inane act I had committed during my long and checkered career as a man."" But life takes over instead, and Nathan's despair is swept away as he finds himself more and more implicated in the joys and sorrows of others. The Brooklyn Follies is Paul Auster's warmest, most exuberant novel, a moving and unforgettable hymn to the glories and mysteries of ordinary human life.",Fiction,324,5,1,en
Linear Algebra Done Right,Sheldon Axler,Springer Science & Business Media,1997-07-18,"This text for a second course in linear algebra, aimed at math majors and graduates, adopts a novel approach by banishing determinants to the end of the book and focusing on understanding the structure of linear operators on vector spaces. The author has taken unusual care to motivate concepts and to simplify proofs. For example, the book presents - without having defined determinants - a clean proof that every linear operator on a finite-dimensional complex vector space has an eigenvalue. The book starts by discussing vector spaces, linear independence, span, basics, and dimension. Students are introduced to inner-product spaces in the first half of the book and shortly thereafter to the finite- dimensional spectral theorem. A variety of interesting exercises in each chapter helps students understand and manipulate the objects of linear algebra. This second edition features new chapters on diagonal matrices, on linear functionals and adjoints, and on the spectral theorem; some sections, such as those on self-adjoint and normal operators, have been entirely rewritten; and hundreds of minor improvements have been made throughout the text.",Mathematics,276,N/A,0,en

Milkman,Anna Burns,Graywolf Press,2018-12-04,"Winner of the Man Booker Prize “Everything about this novel rings true. . . . Original, funny, disarmingly oblique and unique.”—The Guardian In an unnamed city, middle sister stands out for the wrong reasons. She reads while walking, for one. And she has been taking French night classes downtown. So when a local paramilitary known as the milkman begins pursuing her, she suddenly becomes “interesting,” the last thing she ever wanted to be. Despite middle sister’s attempts to avoid him—and to keep her mother from finding out about her maybe-boyfriend—rumors spread and the threat of violence lingers. Milkman is a story of the way inaction can have enormous repercussions, in a time when the wrong flag, wrong religion, or even a sunset can be subversive.

So Sophie knows it’s not paranoia or post-divorce, living-alone-again jitters, when she becomes convinced that a crazed reader is sneaking into her apartment to reenact scenes from her books. The police, however, can’t tell a good plot from an unmarked grave. When a filmmaker friend is brutally murdered in the manner of a death scene in one of his movies, Sophie becomes convinced that a copycat killer is on the loose —and that she’s the next target. If she doesn’t solve the mystery, her own bestseller will spell out her doom. Cursing her grisly imagination (why, oh, why did she have to pick the ax?), Sophie engages in some real-life gumshoe tactics. The man who swoops in to save her in dark alleys is mysterious new love interest Anatoly Darinsky. Of course, if this were fiction, Anatoly would be her prime suspect.…",Fiction,357,N/A,0,en

Structured Electronic Design,"Arie van Staveren, Chris J.M. Verhoeven, Arthur H.M. van Roermund",Springer Science & Business Media,2001,"Analog design still has, unfortunately, a flavor of art. Art can be beautiful. However, art in itself is difficult to teach to students and difficult to transfer from experienced analog designers to new trainee designers in companies. Structured Electronic Design: High-Performance Harmonic Oscillators and Bandgap References aims to systemize analog design. The use of orthogonalization of the design of the fundamental quality aspects (noise, distortion, and bandwidth) and hierarchy in the subsequent design steps, enables designers to achieve high-performance designs, in a relatively short time. As a result of the systematic design procedure, the effect of design decisions on the circuit performance is made clear. Additionally, the use of resources for reaching a specified performance is tracked. This book, therefore, describes the structured electronic design of high-performance harmonic oscillators and bandgap references. The structured design of harmonic oscillators includes the maximization of the carrier-to- noise ratio by means of tapping, i.e. an impedance adaption method for noise matching. The bandgap reference, a popular implementation of a voltage reference, is studied via the unusual concept of the linear combination of base-emitter voltages. The presented method leads to the design of high-performance references in CMOS and Bipolar technology. Using this concept, on a high level of abstraction the quality with respect to, for instance, noise and power-supply rejection can be identified. In this book, it is shown with several design examples that this method provides an excellent starting point for the design of high-performance bandgap references. Auxiliary to the harmonic-oscillator and bandgap reference design are the negative- feedback amplifiers. In this book the systematic design of the dynamic behavior is emphasized. By means of the identification of the dominant poles, it is possible to give an upper limit of the attainable bandwidth, even before the real frequency compensation is accomplished. Structured Electronic Design: High-Performance Harmonic Oscillators and Bandgap References is a valuable book for researchers and designers, as well as students in the field of analog design. It helps both the experienced and trainee designer to come to grips with the design of analog circuits. The presented method is illustrated by several well- described design examples.",Science,294,N/A,0,en

Critical English for Academic Purposes,Sarah Benesch,Routledge,2001-03-01,"Critical English for Academic Purposes: Theory, Politics, and Practice is the first book to combine the theory and practice of two fields: English for academic purposes and critical pedagogy. English for academic purposes (EAP) grounds English language teaching in the cognitive and linguistic demands of academic situations, tailoring instruction to specific rather than general purposes. Critical pedagogy acknowledges students' and teachers' subject-positions, that is, their class, race, gender, and ethnicity, and encourages them to question the status quo. Critical English for academic purposes engages students in the types of activities they are asked to carry out in academic classes while inviting them to question and, in some cases, transform those activities, as well as the conditions from which they arose. It takes into account the real challenges non-native speakers of English face in their discipline-specific classes while viewing students as active participants who can help shape academic goals and assignments. Critical English for Academic Purposes: Theory, Politics, and Practice: * relates English for academic purposes and critical pedagogy, revealing and problematizing the assumptions of both fields, * provides theoretical and practical responses to academic syllabi and other institutional demands to show that teachers can both meet target demands and take students' subjectivities into account in a climate of negotiation and possibility, * offers ""rights analysis"" as a critical counterpart to needs analysis, * discusses the politics of ""coverage"" in lecture classes and proposes alternatives, and * features teaching examples that address balancing the curriculum for gender; building community in an EAP class of students from diverse economic and social backgrounds; students' rights; and organizing students to change unfavorable conditions. This book is intended for undergraduate and graduate courses for preservice and in-service ESL and EAP teachers.

Processing interclausal Relationships,"Jean Costermans, Michel Fayol",Psychology Press,2014-03-18,"During the last 10 years, more and more linguistic and psycholinguistic research has been devoted to the study of discourse and written texts. Much of this research deals with the markers that underline the connections and the breaks between clauses and sentences plus the use of these markers -- by adults and children -- in the production and comprehension of oral and written material. In this volume, major observations and theoretical views from both sides of the Atlantic are brought together to appeal to a wide range of linguists, psychologists, and speech therapists. The volume presents contributions from researchers interested specifically in adult language and from others concerned with developmental aspects of language. Some contributors deal primarily with production, whereas others concentrate on comprehension. Some direct their attention to oral discourse while others focus on written texts. To preserve overall coherence, however, the contributors were given the following recommendations: * With regard to the level of linguistic analysis, the emphasis should be on the clause level -- more particularly, on the relationships between clauses. * Special emphasis should also be placed on linguistic markers (e.g., connectives, markers of segmentation, punctuation). * An overview of a given field of research should be offered, and current research should be put into perspective. * For contributors in the developmental field, attention should be paid to the fact that an account of the acquisition of some language functions throughout childhood should be included only if general principles of interclause relations that might be masked by the exclusive examination of adult evidence could be derived from it.",Language Arts & Disciplines,301,N/A,0,en

Watching While Black,Beretta E. Smith-Shomade,Rutgers University Press,2013-01-10,"Television scholarship has substantially ignored programming aimed at Black audiences despite a few sweeping histories and critiques. In this volume, the first of its kind, contributors examine the televisual diversity, complexity, and cultural imperatives manifest in programming directed at a Black and marginalized audience. Watching While Black considers its subject from an entirely new angle in an attempt to understand the lives, motivations, distinctions, kindred lines, and individuality of various Black groups and suggest what television might be like if such diversity permeated beyond specialized enclaves. It looks at the macro structures of ownership, producing, casting, and advertising that all inform production, and then delves into television programming crafted to appeal to black audiences—historic and contemporary, domestic and worldwide. Chapters rethink such historically significant programs as Roots and Black Journal, such seemingly innocuous programs as Fat Albert and bro’Town, and such contemporary and culturally complicated programs as Noah’s Arc, Treme, and The Boondocks. The book makes a case for the centrality of these programs while always recognizing the racial dynamics that continue to shape Black representation on the small screen. Painting a decidedly introspective portrait across forty years of Black television, Watching While Black sheds much-needed light on under-examined demographics, broadens common audience considerations, and gives deference to the the preferences of audiences and producers of Black-targeted programming.",Social Science,280,5,1,en

Confronting Prejudice and Discrimination,"Robyn K. Mallett, Margo J. Monteith",Academic Press,2019-03-09,"Confronting Prejudice and Discrimination: The Science of Changing Minds and Behaviors focuses on confrontation as a strategy for reducing bias and discrimination. The volume tackles questions that people face when they wish to confront bias: What factors influence people's decisions to confront or ignore bias in its various forms? What are the motives and consequences of confrontation? How can confrontation be approached individually, through education and empowerment, and in specific contexts (e.g., health care) to yield favourable outcomes? These questions are paramount in contemporary society, where confrontation of bias is increasingly evident. Moreover, great strides in the scientific study of confrontation in the past 20 years has yielded valuable insights and answers. This volume is an essential resource for students and researchers with an interest in prejudice and prejudice reduction, and will also be valuable to non-academics who wish to stand up to bias through confrontation. - Addresses factors that determine individuals' decisions to confront stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination - Analyzes how personal and collective motives shape responses in confrontation-relevant situations - Examines the consequences of confrontation from the perspectives of targets, perpetrators and bystanders - Provides a roadmap for how to prepare for and engage in successful confrontations at the individual level - Covers confronting bias in various settings including in schools, health care, the workplace and on the internet - Discusses confrontation in the context of racism, sexism, sexual harassment and other forms of bias, including intersectional forms of bias",Psychology,371,N/A,0,en

Graduate Algebra,Louis Halle Rowen,American Mathematical Soc.,2006,"This book is an expanded text for a graduate course in commutative algebra, focusing on the algebraic underpinnings of algebraic geometry and of number theory. Accordingly, the theory of affine algebras is featured, treated both directly and via the theory of Noetherian and Artinian modules, and the theory of graded algebras is included to provide the foundation for projective varieties. Major topics include the theory of modules over a principal ideal domain, and its applicationsto matrix theory (including the Jordan decomposition), the Galois theory of field extensions, transcendence degree, the prime spectrum of an algebra, localization, and the classical theory of Noetherian and Artinian rings. Later chapters include some algebraic theory of elliptic curves (featuring theMordell-Weil theorem) and valuation theory, including local fields. One feature of the book is an extension of the text through a series of appendices. This permits the inclusion of more advanced material, such as transcendental field extensions, the discriminant and resultant, the theory of Dedekind domains, and basic theorems of rings of algebraic integers. An extended appendix on derivations includes the Jacobian conjecture and Makar-Limanov's theory of locally nilpotent derivations. Grobnerbases can be found in another appendix. Exercises provide a further extension of the text. The book can be used both as a textbook and as a reference source.",Mathematics,464,N/A,0,en

The texts critique the ways in which narratives of nationhood and womanhood naturalize and essentialize difference and hierarchy. The authors explore uses of sexualized/gendered imagery in defining the space of the nation and sexualized/gendered metaphors of state fatherhood and motherhood in defining the distribution of power within that space. of the nation (e.g. feminized landscapes and battlefields) and sexualized /gendered metaphors of state fatherhood and motherhood in defining the distribution of power within that space. The particular histories of nationalism and partition are different in the countries involved, but commonalities in the narrative structures, state ad nation-building strategies, patriarchal patterns of control, and mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion are striking.

The Race between Education and Technology,"Claudia Goldin, Lawrence F. Katz",Harvard University Press,2009-07-01,"This book provides a careful historical analysis of the co-evolution of educational attainment and the wage structure in the United States through the twentieth century. The authors propose that the twentieth century was not only the American Century but also the Human Capital Century. That is, the American educational system is what made America the richest nation in the world. Its educational system had always been less elite than that of most European nations. By 1900 the U.S. had begun to educate its masses at the secondary level, not just in the primary schools that had remarkable success in the nineteenth century. The book argues that technological change, education, and inequality have been involved in a kind of race. During the first eight decades of the twentieth century, the increase of educated workers was higher than the demand for them. This had the effect of boosting income for most people and lowering inequality. However, the reverse has been true since about 1980. This educational slowdown was accompanied by rising inequality. The authors discuss the complex reasons for this, and what might be done to ameliorate it.",Business & Economics,497,N/A,0,en

O'Neill (Jr.),"Oxford University Press, USA",2010,"Verification in an Age of Insecurity takes the reader into some of the most urgent arms control issues facing the world community, including the nuclear activities of rogue states and threats from sophisticated non-state actors. In the book, national security expert Philip D. O'Neill, Jr. identifies and addresses issues from the resuscitated disarmament agenda, from the comprehensive test ban to fissile material and biological weapons. O'Neill examines the need for shifts in verification standards and policy suitable for our volatile era and beyond it. He surveys recent history to show how established verification procedures fail to produce the certainty necessary to meet today's threats. Verification in an Age of Insecurity goes beyond a discussion of rogue states like North Korea to offer suggestions on how best to bring compliance policy up to date with modern threats.",History,224,N/A,0,en

Sula,Toni Morrison,Knopf,2002-04-05,"Sula and Nel are born in the Bottom—a small town at the top of a hill. Sula is wild, and daring; she does what she wants, while Nel is well-mannered, a mamma’s girl with a questioning heart. Growing up they forge a bond stronger than anything, stronger even than the dark secret they have to bear. Strong enough, it seems, to last a lifetime—until, decades later, as the girls become women, Sula’s anarchy leads to a betrayal that may be beyond forgiveness. One of The Atlantic’s Great American Novels of the Past 100 Years Masterful, richly textured, bittersweet, and vital, Sula is a modern masterpiece about love and kinship, about living in an America birthed from slavery. Nobel Prize laureate Toni Morrison gives life to characters who struggle with what society tells them to be, and the love they long for and crave as Black women. Most of all, they ask: When can we let go? What must we hold back? And just how much can be shared in a friendship?",Fiction,193,N/A,0,en

The Shakespeare Myth,Graham Holderness,Manchester University Press,1988,"""Q. Is 'the Shakespeare connection' (a) a family tree, (b) a drug racket, (c) a railway journey? A. It is all three. From the Carling Black Label television advertisement to the design of the £20 note, from Tony Hancock and Edna Everage to the Stratford Memorial Theatre, from O level exam question to Zeffirelli on the big screen, Shakespeare has permeated English life like no one before or since. The plays and their legendary author function and flourish in more varied and diverse forms than are usually reckoned. Through post-structuralist linguistics, historiographical research, psychoanalytic theories and feminist sexual politics, radical criticism exposes the existence of a culturally produced and historically-determined 'Shakespeare myth'. This anthology of specifically-commissioned essays and interviews directly addresses that myth, as it works through ideology, popular culture, sexual politics, and the institutions of theatre, education and broadcasting. It demonstrates how the 'Shakespeare myth' functions in contemporary culture as an ideological framework for containing consensus and for sustaining delusions of unity, integration and harmony in the cultural superstructures of a divided and fractured society. For every particular present, Shakespeare is here, now, always, what is currently being made of him: to disclose the process of that making is the object of The Shakespeare myth."" -- Back cover",Drama,248,N/A,0,en

The Poems of T. S. Eliot,T. S. Eliot,Johns Hopkins University Press,2015-12-15,"A monumental event in Eliot scholarship. Winner of the CHOICE Outstanding Academic Title of the Choice ACRL, Pegasus Award for Criticism of the Poetry Magazine This critical edition of T. S. Eliot’s Poems establishes a new text of the Collected Poems 1909–1962, rectifying accidental omissions and errors that have crept in during the century since Eliot’s astonishing debut, ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock."" As well as the masterpieces, the edition contains the poems of Eliot’s youth, which were rediscovered only decades later, others that circulated privately during his lifetime, and love poems from his final years, written for his wife Valerie Eliot. Christopher Ricks and Jim McCue have provided a commentary that illuminates the imaginative life of each poem. Calling upon Eliot’s critical writings, as well as his drafts, letters, and other original materials, they illustrate not only the breadth of Eliot’s interests and the range of his writings, but how it was that the author of ""Gerontion"" came to write ""Triumphal March"" and then Four Quartets. Thanks to the family and friends who recognized Eliot’s genius and preserved his writings from an early age, the archival record is exceptionally complete, enabling us to follow in unique detail the progress of a mind that never ceased exploring. This first volume respects Eliot’s decisions by opening with his Collected Poems 1909–1962 as he arranged and issued it, shortly before his death fifty years ago. This is followed by poems uncollected but either written for or suitable for publication, and by a new reading text of the drafts of The Waste Land. The volume concludes with the commentary on all of these poems. The second volume opens with the two books of verse of other kinds that Eliot issued, Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats and his translation of St.-John Perse’s Anabase. Different again are the verses informal, improper, or clubmanlike. Each of these sections has its own commentary. Finally, pertaining to the entire edition, there is a textual history that contains not only variants from all known drafts and the many printings but also extended passages amounting to hundreds of lines of compelling verse.

Sensory Evaluation of Food: Principles and Practices,"Harry T.

It covers all the basic techniques of sensory testing, from simple discrimination tests to home use placements for consumers. It provides a practical guide to how tests are conducted and, for the reader who wishes a deeper understanding, provides the fundamental psychological and statistical theories that form the basis and rationale for sensory test design. Statistics used in sensory evaluation are demonstrated as integrated applications in the context of appropriate sensory methods and are also presented as a stand-alone material in appendixes. Statistical applications are tailored to common and relevance are obvious, and space is not wasted on designs or analyses that are not suitable for data collection from human observers. The text presents divergent philosophies in a balanced manner. Chapters are constructed so that beginning students who want only practical aspects of conducting sensory tests will find clear instructions on how tests should be conducted. Advanced students and practitioners will profit from the detailed section on rationale and sensory evaluation issues. ""It covers the entire spectrum of sensory analysis.

Thousands of students have turned to Lipson for no-nonsense advice on how to cite sources properly—and avoid plagiarism—when writing their research papers. With his latest book, Cite Right, Lipson once again provides much-needed counsel in a concise and affordable handbook for students and researchers. Building on Doing Honest Work in College, Lipson’s new book offers a wealth of information on an even greater range of citation styles and details the intricacies of many additional kinds of sources. Lipson’s introductory essay, Why Cite, explains the reasons it is so important to use citations—and to present them accurately—in research writing. In subsequent chapters, Lipson explains the main citation styles students and researchers are likely to encounter in their academic work: Chicago; MLA; APA; CSE (biological sciences); AMA (medical sciences); ACS (chemistry, mathematics, and computer science); physics, astrophysics, and astronomy; Bluebook and ALWD (law); and AAA (anthropology and ethnography). His discussions of these styles are presented simply and clearly with examples drawn from a wide range of source types crossing all disciplines, from the arts and humanities to science, law, and medicine.

The Ecology of Human Development,Urie BRONFENBRENNER,Harvard University Press,2009-06-30,"Here is a book that challenges the very basis of the way psychologists have studied child development. According to Urie Bronfenbrenner, one of the world's foremost developmental psychologists, laboratory studies of the child's behavior sacrifice too much in order to gain experimental control and analytic rigor. Laboratory observations, he argues, too often lead to ""the science of the strange behavior of children in strange situations with strange adults for the briefest possible periods of time."" To understand the way children actually develop, Bronfenbrenner believes that it will be necessary to observe their behavior in natural settings, while they are interacting with familiar adults over prolonged periods of time. This book offers an important blueprint for constructing such a new and ecologically valid psychology of development. The blueprint includes a complete conceptual framework for analysing the layers of the environment that have a formative influence on the child. This framework is applied to a variety of settings in which children commonly develop, ranging from the pediatric ward to daycare, school, and various family configurations. The result is a rich set of hypotheses about the developmental consequences of various types of environments. Where current research bears on these hypotheses, Bronfenbrenner marshals the data to show how an ecological theory can be tested. Where no relevant data exist, he suggests new and interesting ecological experiments that might be undertaken to resolve current unknowns. Bronfenbrenner's groundbreaking program for reform in developmental psychology is certain to be controversial. His argument flies in the face of standard psychological procedures and challenges psychology to become more relevant to the ways in which children actually develop. It is a challenge psychology can ill-afford to ignore.",Psychology,349,N/A,0,en

In covering established and emerging methods, it also provides an invaluable source of information for faculty teaching qualitative research methods. The contents of the Handbook are arranged into two volumes covering seven key themes: Volume One: History and Tradition Part One: Influential Traditions: underpinning qualitative research: positivism, interpretivism, pragmatism, constructionism, critical, poststructuralism, hermeneutics, postcolonialism, critical realism, mixed methods, grounded theory, feminist and indigenous approaches. Part Two: Research Designs: ethnography, field research, action research, case studies, process and practice methodologies. Part Three: The Researcher: positionality, reflexivity, ethics, gender and intersectionality, writing from the body, and achieving critical distance. Part Four: Challenges: research design, access and departure, choosing participants, research across boundaries, writing for different audiences, ethics in international research, digital ethics, and publishing qualitative research. Volume Two: Methods and Challenges Part One: Contemporary methods: interviews, archival analysis, autoethnography, rhetoric, historical, stories and narratives, discourse analysis, group methods, sociomateriality, fiction, metaphors, dramaturgy, diary, shadowing and thematic analysis. Part Two: Visual methods: photographs, drawing, video, web images, semiotics and symbols, collages, documentaries. Part Three: Methodological developments: aesthetics and smell, fuzzy set comparative analysis, sewing quilts, netnography, ethnomusicality, software, ANTI-history, emotion, and pattern matching.",Business & Economics,1161,N/A,0,en

Individual Psychology of Alfred Adler,Alfred Adler,Harper Collins,1964-12-30,"When we hear such expressions as feelings of inferiority and insecurity, striving for self-enhancement and power, woman's revolt against her feminine role, the oversolicitous mother, the dethronement of the first-born, the need for affection; when maladjustment is spoken of as self-centeredness, psychological health as other-centeredness; psychiatry as the science of interpersonal relations, neurotic symptoms as ego-defenses and forms of aggression, to mention only a few instances—we are meeting ideas in which Alfred Adler was the pioneer from 1907, the date of his first important publication, until his death in 1937. The purpose of the present volume is to make Adler's contributions to the theory and practice of psychology available in a systematic and at the same time authentic form. To this end we made selections from his writ- ings and organized them with the aim of approximating the general presentation of a college textbook. Because every word in the main body of the work is Adler's, the outcome of our efforts, if we have been successful, should be the equivalent of a textbook by Adler on Individual Psychology, the name which he gave to his system.",Psychology,548,5,1,en

Semantic Role Labeling,"Martha Palmer, Daniel Gildea, Nianwen Xue",Morgan & Claypool Publishers,2011-02-02,"This book is aimed at providing an overview of several aspects of semantic role labeling. Chapter 1 begins with linguistic background on the definition of semantic roles and the controversies surrounding them. Chapter 2 describes how the theories have led to structured lexicons such as FrameNet, VerbNet and the PropBank Frame Files that in turn provide the basis for large scale semantic annotation of corpora. This data has facilitated the development of automatic semantic role labeling systems based on supervised machine learning techniques. Chapter 3 presents the general principles of applying both supervised and unsupervised machine learning to this task, with a description of the standard stages and feature choices, as well as giving details of several specific systems. Recent advances include the use of joint inference to take advantage of context sensitivities, and attempts to improve performance by closer integration of the syntactic parsing task with semantic role labeling. Chapter 3 also discusses the impact the granularity of the semantic roles has on system performance. Having outlined the basic approach with respect to English, Chapter 4 goes on to discuss applying the same techniques to other languages, using Chinese as the primary example. Although substantial training data is available for Chinese, this is not the case for many other languages, and techniques for projecting English role labels onto parallel corpora are also presented.

Interpersonal Relationships and Health,"Christopher Rolfe Agnew, Susan C. South",OUP Us,2014,"Gathering leading thinkers in social and clinical psychology, public health, medicine, and sociology, Interpersonal Relationships and Health considers theoretical and empirical issues relevant to understanding the social and clinical psychological mechanisms linking close relationship processes with mental and physical health outcomes. The volume arises out of a recent explosion of interest, across multiple academic and research fields, in the ways that interpersonal relationships affect health and well-being. This volume pulls together a range of scholars who focus on different aspects of relationships and health in order to encourage both collaboration and cross-disciplinary initiatives. This is the first edited volume to pull together noted experts across myriad disciplines whose research is at the intersection of human relationships and health. Topics addressed include key biological processes that influence and, in turn, are influenced by close relationships. Interpersonal Relationships and Health presents research that demonstrates the connections between interpersonal relationships, mental and physical health outcomes, and biophysical markers that figure prominently in the fields of psychoneuroimmunology, endocrinology, and cardiology. In addition, it highlights recent work on marital, family, and social relationships and their interplay with health and well-being. Chapters also address sexual health among young and older adults, as well as clinical intervention efforts that focus on the role of relational factors in influencing health. Each chapter highlights extant theoretical and empirical findings and suggests future avenues for research in this burgeoning area.",Health & Fitness,305,N/A,0,en

The Canadian Oxford Dictionary,Katherine Barber,"Oxford University Press, USA",1998,"We all use Canadian English every day: when we order a pizza ""all-dressed"", hope to get a ""seat-sale"" to go south during ""March break"", or ""book off"" work to meet with a ""CGA"" to discuss ""RRSPs"". Language embodies our nation''s identity, and The Canadian Oxford Dictionary, in its 1,728 pages,covers all aspects of Canadian life. Never before have Canadians been able to see their language, and themselves, so accurately and comprehensively described in a dictionary. The loggers of the west coast, the wheat farmers of the Prairies, the fishermen of the Atlantic provinces, the trappers ofthe North; Canada''s Aboriginal peoples, its British and French settlers, and the more recent arrivals, whether they came from Ukraine, Italy, South Asia or elsewhere - all have contributed to making Canadian English unique, and the dictionary thus reflects the great sweep of Canadian life. Itcontains over 2,000 distinctly Canadian words and meanings, more than any other Canadian dictionary, covering every region of the country. Whether you call your favorite doughnut a jambuster, a bismark, a Burlington bun, or the more prosaic jelly doughnut may depend on where you live in Canada, butthey will all be found in The Canadian Oxford Dictionary. Of course, this is not just a dictionary of Canadian words: its 130,000 entries combine in one reference book information on English as it is used worldwide and as it is used particularly in Canada. Definitions, worded for ease ofcomprehension, are presented so the meaning most familiar to Canadians appears first and foremost. Each of these entries is exceptionally reliable, the result of thorough research into the language and Oxford''s unparalleled language resources. Five professionally trained lexicographers spent fiveyears examining databases containing over 20 million words of Canadian text from more than 8,000 Canadian sources of an astonishing diversity. Inuit Art Quarterly, The Fiddlehead, Canadian Business, and Equinox; the work of writers such as Jack Hodgins, Sandra Birdsell, David Adams Richards, andPierre Berton; daily and weekly newspapers from across the country; and, of course, the Canadian Tire catalogue - all find a place in the evidence of The Canadian Oxford Dictionary. The lexicographers also examined an additional 20 million words of international English sources. For many Canadiansone of the more puzzling aspects of writing is trying to determine whether to use the American spelling or the British spelling. Should it be ""colour"" or ""color"", ""theater"" or ""theatre"", ""programme"" or ""program""? By examining our extensive Canadian databases, our lexicographers have been able todetermine which, in fact, is the more common spelling: colour, theatre and program. Favoured Canadian pronunciations have also been determined by surveying a nationwide group of respondents. Oxford''s thorough research has also ensured that new words that have recently appeared are well-represented.So if you''re someone who puts on your ""bicycle shorts"" and ""blades"" over to the gym to do some ""crunches"" for your ""abs"" followed by work on your ""lats"", ""pecs"" and ""delts"", finishing up with a ""step"" class, because you''re afraid that being a ""chocoholic"" who loves ""comfort food"" will affect your""body mass index"" and you want to avoid ""yo-yo dieting"", you''ll find all these common words in The Canadian Oxford Dictionary. An added feature of this dictionary is its encyclopedic element. It includes short biographies of over 800 Canadians, ranging from Elvis Stojko, Celine Dion and JeanBeliveau to Nellie McClung, Lester B. Pearson, and Kim Campbell. It also contains entries on 5,000 individuals and mythical figures of international significance, and almost 6,000 place names, more than 1,200 of them Canadian. Indeed, all Canadian towns with a population of 5,000 or more arefeatured, and their entries not only explain the origin of the place name, but also include the population based on the 1996 census. With the publication of The Canadian Oxford Dictionary, Oxford University Press adds another work to its highly respected range of dictionaries, and Canadians finallyhave a dictionary that truly reflects their nations.",Language Arts & Disciplines,1738,N/A,0,en

"The Chicago Guide to Fact-Checking, Second Edition",Brooke Borel,University of Chicago Press,2023-05-23,"This book will help you: Recognize what information to fact-check Identify the quality and ranking of source materials Learn to fact-check a variety of media types: newspaper; magazine; social media; public and commercial radio and television, books, films, etc. Navigate relationships with editors, writers, and producers Recognize plagiarism and fabrication Discern conflicting facts, gray areas, and litigious materials Learn record keeping best practices for tracking sources Test your own fact-checking skills An accessible, one-stop guide to the why, what, and how of contemporary editorial fact-checking. Over the past few years, fact-checking has been widely touted as a corrective to the spread of misinformation, disinformation, conspiracy theories, and propaganda through the media. “If journalism is a cornerstone of democracy,” says author Brooke Borel, “then fact-checking is its building inspector.” In The Chicago Guide to Fact-Checking, Borel, an experienced fact-checker, draws on the expertise of more than 200 writers, editors, and fellow checkers representing the New Yorker, Popular Science, This American Life, Vogue, and many other outlets. She covers best practices for editorial fact-checking in a variety of media—from magazine and news articles, both print and online, to books and podcasts—and the perspectives of both in-house and freelance checkers. In this second edition, Borel covers the evolving media landscape, with new guidance on checking audio and video sources, polling data, and sensitive subjects such as trauma and abuse. The sections on working with writers, editors, and producers have been expanded, and new material includes fresh exercises and advice on getting fact-checking gigs. Borel also addresses the challenges of fact-checking in a world where social media, artificial intelligence, and the metaverse may make it increasingly difficult for everyone—including fact-checkers—to identify false information. The answer, she says, is for everyone to approach information with skepticism—to learn to think like a fact-checker. The Chicago Guide to Fact-Checking is the practical—and thoroughly vetted—guide that writers, editors, and publishers continue to consult to maintain their credibility and solidify their readers’ trust.",Language Arts & Disciplines,246,N/A,0,en

The Contest of Meaning,Richard Bolton,MIT Press,1992-02-25,"Photography's great success gives the impression that the major questions that have haunted the medium are now resolved. On the contrary, the most important questions about photography are just beginning to be asked. These fourteen essays, with over 200 illustrations, critically examine prevailing beliefs about the medium and suggest new ways to explain the history of photography. They are organized around the questions: What are the social consequences of aesthetic practice? How does photography construct sexual difference? How is photography used to promote class and national interests? What are the politics of photographic truth? The Contest of Meaning summarizes the challenges to traditional photographic history that have developed in the last decade out of a consciously political critique of photographic production. Contributions by a wide range of important Americans critics reexamine the complex—and often contradictory—roles of photography within society. Douglas Crimp, Christopher Phillips, Benjamin Buchloh, and Abigail Solomon Godeau examine the gradually developed exclusivity of art photography and describe the politics of canon formation throughout modernism. Catherine Lord, Deborah Bright, Sally Stein, and Jan Zita Grover examine the ways in which the female is configured as a subject, and explain how sexual difference is constructed across various registers of photographic representation. Carol Squiers, Esther Parada, and Richard Bolton clarify the ways in which photography serves as a form of mass communication, demonstrating in particular how photographic production is affected by the interests of the powerful patrons of communications. The three concluding essays, by Rosalind Krauss, Martha Rosler, and Allan Sekula, critically examine the concept of photographic truth by exploring the intentions informing various uses of ""objective"" images within society.",Photography,438,N/A,0,en

The Routledge Handbook of Planning Theory,"Michael Gunder, Ali Madanipour, Vanessa Watson",Routledge,2017-08-23,"The Routledge Handbook of Planning Theory presents key contemporary themes in planning theory through the views of some of the most innovative thinkers in planning. They introduce and explore their own specialized areas of planning theory, to conceptualize their contemporary positions and to speculate how these positions are likely to evolve and change as new challenges emerge. In a changing and often unpredictable globalized world, planning theory is core to understanding how planning and its practices both function and evolve. As illustrated in this book, planning and its many roles have changed profoundly over the recent decades; so have the theories, both critical and explanatory, about its practices, values and knowledges. In the context of these changes, and to contribute to the development of planning research, this handbook identifies and introduces the cutting edge, and the new emerging trajectories, of contemporary planning theory. The aim is to provide the reader with key insights into not just contemporary planning thought, but potential future directions of both planning theory and planning as a whole. This book is written for an international readership, and includes planning theories that address, or have emerged from, both the global North and parts of the world beyond.",Architecture,362,N/A,0,en
The Rocks,Grace Karskens,Melbourne Univ. Publishing,2013-04-18,"The Rocks is Sydney's earliest surviving neighbourhood. Grace Karskens builds up a vivid picture of the lives of its earliest white inhabitants. A wealth of historical documents, pictures, maps and archaeological evidence allows her to recover the words and gestures, tastes and habits, aspirations and fears, of the dealers, publicans, labourers, artisans, watermen, washerwomen, servants and prostitutes who lived there. What sort of town did these people make? What did it look like? How did they treat their neighbours? And what of other human relations—how did men and women behave sexually? What did they think was 'moral' behaviour? What were their marriages like? How did they bring up their children? Grace Karskens shows it was a place very different from the usual images of a brutal 'gaol colony': it was, rather, a preindustrial town, a face-to-face society, marked more by movement and opportunity, dialogue and negotiation than by coercion, discipline and punishment.",History,366,N/A,0,en

Neuropsychologist and child development expert Maryann Wolf answers these questions in this ambitious and provocative book that chronicles the remarkable journey of written language not only throughout our evolution but also over the course of a single child’s life, showing why a growing percentage have difficulty mastering these abilities. With fascinating down-to-earth examples and lively personal anecdotes, Wolf asserts that the brain that examined the tiny clay tablets of the Sumerians is a very different brain from the one that is immersed in today’s technology-driven literacy, in which visual images on the screen are paving the way for a reduced need for written language—with potentially profound consequences for our future.",Education,340,N/A,0,en

Margaret Atwood,"John Moss, Tobi Kozakewich",University of Ottawa Press,2006-10-28,"Margaret Atwood enjoys a unique prominence in Canadian letters. With over thirty books to her credit, in genres ranging from children's writing to dystopic novels, she is as creatively diverse as she is internationally acclaimed. Her success, however, has been double-edged: the very popularity that makes her such a prominent figure in the literary world also renders her vulnerable to claims of being a ""sell-out,"" as she relates in her Empson lectures. The Open Eye negotiates the space between these positions, acknowledging Atwood's remarkable achievement while considering how it impacts on national politics and identity. The range of perspectives in this volume is stimulating and enlightening. The Open Eye begins with a focus on Atwood as she presents herself and is presented in Canada and abroad, and then proceeds to consider, more broadly, the intersection of life and literature that Atwood's works and persona effect. It offers fresh insight into Atwood's early writing, redresses the critical void regarding her poetry and shorter prose pieces, and provides a critical base from which readers can assess Atwood's most recent novels. A common thread throughout these essays is the recognition of Atwood's importance in the literary realm in general, and in Canadian literature more particularly.",Literary Criticism,181,N/A,0,en

Here, nurses remember their first ""sticks,"" first births, and first deaths, and reflect on what gets them though long, demanding shifts, and keeps them in the profession. The stories reveal many voices from nurses at different stages of their careers: One nurse-in-training longs to be trusted with more ""important"" procedures, while another questions her ability to care for nursing home residents. An efficient young emergency room nurse finds his life and career irrevocably changed by a car accident. A nurse practitioner wonders whether she has violated professional boundaries in her care for a homeless man with AIDS, and a home care case manager is the sole attendee at a funeral for one of her patients. What connects these stories is the passion and strength of the writers, who struggle against burnout and bureaucracy to serve their patients with skill, empathy, and strength.",Medical,256,N/A,0,en

Abstract Algebra,Paul B. Garrett,CRC Press,2007-09-25,"Designed for an advanced undergraduate- or graduate-level course, Abstract Algebra provides an example-oriented, less heavily symbolic approach to abstract algebra. The text emphasizes specifics such as basic number theory, polynomials, finite fields, as well as linear and multilinear algebra. This classroom-tested, how-to manual takes a more narrative approach than the stiff formalism of many other textbooks, presenting coherent storylines to convey crucial ideas in a student-friendly, accessible manner. An unusual feature of the text is the systematic characterization of objects by universal mapping properties, rather than by constructions whose technical details are irrelevant. Addresses Common Curricular Weaknesses In addition to standard introductory material on the subject, such as Lagrange's and Sylow's theorems in group theory, the text provides important specific illustrations of general theory, discussing in detail finite fields, cyclotomic polynomials, and cyclotomic fields. The book also focuses on broader background, including brief but representative discussions of naive set theory and equivalents of the axiom of choice, quadratic reciprocity, Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions, and some basic complex analysis.

Bringing together more than four hundred poems and excerpts from longer works that were written by more than two hundred and fifty poets, both famous and unknown, the book charts the emergence of slavery as part of the collective consciousness of the English-speaking world. The book includes: poems by forty women, ranging from abolitionists Hannah More and Mary Robinson to Frances Seymour, the Countess of Herford; works by more than twenty African or African American poets, including familiar names (Phillis Wheatley), intriguing figures (Afro-Dutch Latin scholar Johannes Capitein), and newly rediscovered black poets (an anonymous veteran of the Revolutionary War); and poetry by such canonical writers as Dryden, Defoe, Pope, Johnson, Blake, Boswell, Burns, Wordsworth, and Coleridge."" ""The poems speak of the themes of slavery: capture, torture, endurance, rebellion, thwarted romances, and spiritual longing. They also raise intriguing questions about the contradications between cultural attitudes and public policy of the time.

It is often thought that responsibility is a complex notion, but this monograph proposes a simple analytical framework that makes it possible to disentangle the different concepts of fairness that deal with neutralizing inequalities for which the individuals are not held responsible, rewarding their effort, respecting their choices, or staying neutral with respect to their responsibility sphere. It dwells on paradoxes and impossibilities only as a way to highlight important ethical options and always proposes solutions and reasonable compromises among the conflicting values surrounding equality and responsibility. The theory is able to incorporate disincentive problems and is illustrated in the examination of applied policy issues such as: income redistribution when individuals may be held responsible for their choices of labor supply or education; social and private insurance when individuals may be held responsible for their risky lifestyle; second chance policies; the measurement of inequality of opportunities and social mobility.",Business & Economics,571,N/A,0,en

Braganca, Minsung Byun, David Crighton, Kiran Darbha, Jefferson Lowrey, Pavel Malyutin, Abhinav Priyadarshi, Rashmi Katagall, IBM Redbooks",IBM Redbooks,2012-08-31,"IBM WebSphere® Message Broker is a lightweight, advanced enterprise service bus (ESB) that provides a broad range of integration capabilities that enable companies to rapidly integrate internal applications and connect to partner applications. Messages from business applications can be transformed, augmented and routed to other business applications. The types and complexity of the integration required will vary by company, application types, and a number of other factors. Processing logic in WebSphere Message Broker is implemented using message flows. Through message flows, messages from business applications can be transformed, augmented, and routed to other business applications. Message flows are created by connecting nodes together. A wide selection of built-in nodes are provided with WebSphere Message Broker. These nodes perform tasks that are associated with message routing, transformation, and enrichment. Message flows are created and tested using the Message Broker Toolkit, a sophisticated, easy-to-use programming tool that provides a full range of programming aids. This IBM® Redbooks® publication focuses on two specific integration requirements that apply to many midmarket companies. The first is the ability to use WebSphere Message Broker to integrate Microsoft.NET applications into a broader connectivity solution. WebSphere Message Broker V8 introduces the ability to integrate with existing Microsoft .NET Framework applications. A .NET assembly can be called from within a message flow and the WebSphere Message Broker runtime can host and run .NET code. Solutions explored in this book cover connectivity to applications using Windows Communications Framework (WCF), Microsoft Message Queuing, Microsoft Dynamics CRM, and other Microsoft applications. The second is the ability to integrate WebSphere Message Broker with file transfer networks, specifically with WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition and IBM Sterling Connect Direct.",Computers,510,N/A,0,en

SDL is the Speci?cation and Description Language ?rst standardized by the world telecommunications body, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), more than 20 years ago in 1976. While the original language and domain of application has evolved signi?cantly, the foundations of SDL as a graphical, state-transition and process-communication language for real-time systems have remained. Today SDL has also grown to be one notation in the set of uni?ed modelling languages recommended by the ITU (ASN.1, MSC, SDL, ODL, and TTCN) that can be used in methodology taking engineering of systems from requirements capture through to testing and operation. The SDL Forum is held every two years and has become the most imp- tant event in the calendar for anyone involved in SDL and related languages and technology.

"A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations, Eighth Edition",Kate L. Turabian,University of Chicago Press,2013-04-09,"A little more than seventy-five years ago, Kate L. Turabian drafted a set of guidelines to help students understand how to write, cite, and formally submit research writing. Seven editions and more than nine million copies later, the name Turabian has become synonymous with best practices in research writing and style. Her Manual for Writers continues to be the gold standard for generations of college and graduate students in virtually all academic disciplines. Now in its eighth edition, A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations has been fully revised to meet the needs of today’s writers and researchers. The Manual retains its familiar three-part structure, beginning with an overview of the steps in the research and writing process, including formulating questions, reading critically, building arguments, and revising drafts. Part II provides an overview of citation practices with detailed information on the two main scholarly citation styles (notes-bibliography and author-date), an array of source types with contemporary examples, and detailed guidance on citing online resources. The final section treats all matters of editorial style, with advice on punctuation, capitalization, spelling, abbreviations, table formatting, and the use of quotations. Style and citation recommendations have been revised throughout to reflect the sixteenth edition of The Chicago Manual of Style. With an appendix on paper format and submission that has been vetted by dissertation officials from across the country and a bibliography with the most up-to-date listing of critical resources available, A Manual for Writers remains the essential resource for students and their teachers.",Reference,465,5,1,en

Plant Engineer's Reference Book,DENNIS A SNOW,Elsevier,2013-10-22,"* Useful to engineers in any industry * Extensive references provided throughout * Comprehensive range of topics covered * Written with practical situations in mind A plant engineer is responsible for a wide range of industrial activities, and may workin any industry. The breadth of knowledge required by such professionals is so wide that previous books addressing plant engineering have either been limited to certain subjects or cursory in their treatment of topics. The Plant Engineer's Reference Bookis the first volume to offer complete coverage of subjects of interest to the plant engineer. This reference work provides a primary source of information for the plant engineer. Subjects include selection of a suitable site for a factory and provisionof basic facilities (including boilers, electrical systems, water, HVAC systems, pumping systems and floors and finishes). Detailed chapters deal with basic issues such as lubrication, corrosion, energy conservation, maintenance and materials handling aswell as environmental considerations, insurance matters and financial concerns. The authors chosen to contribute to the book are experts in their various fields. The Editor has experience of a wide range of operations in the UK, other Europeancountries, the USA, and elsewhere in the world. Produced with the backing of the Institution of Plant Engineers, this work is the primary source of information for plant engineers in any industry worldwide.",Business & Economics,796,N/A,0,en

Discovering Computer Science,Jessen Havill,CRC Press,2020-10-12,"""Havill's problem-driven approach introduces algorithmic concepts in context and motivates students with a wide range of interests and backgrounds."" -- Janet Davis, Associate Professor and Microsoft Chair of Computer Science, Whitman College ""This book looks really great and takes exactly the approach I think should be used for a CS 1 course. I think it really fills a need in the textbook landscape."" -- Marie desJardins, Dean of the College of Organizational, Computational, and Information Sciences, Simmons University ""Discovering Computer Science is a refreshing departure from introductory programming texts, offering students a much more sincere introduction to the breadth and complexity of this ever-growing field."" -- James Deverick, Senior Lecturer, The College of William and Mary ""This unique introduction to the science of computing guides students through broad and universal approaches to problem solving in a variety of contexts and their ultimate implementation as computer programs."" -- Daniel Kaplan, DeWitt Wallace Professor, Macalester College Discovering Computer Science: Interdisciplinary Problems, Principles, and Python Programming is a problem-oriented introduction to computational problem solving and programming in Python, appropriate for a first course for computer science majors, a more targeted disciplinary computing course or, at a slower pace, any introductory computer science course for a general audience. Realizing that an organization around language features only resonates with a narrow audience, this textbook instead connects programming to students’ prior interests using a range of authentic problems from the natural and social sciences and the digital humanities. The presentation begins with an introduction to the problem-solving process, contextualizing programming as an essential component. Then, as the book progresses, each chapter guides students through solutions to increasingly complex problems, using a spiral approach to introduce Python language features. The text also places programming in the context of fundamental computer science principles, such as abstraction, efficiency, testing, and algorithmic techniques, offering glimpses of topics that are traditionally put off until later courses. This book contains 30 well-developed independent projects that encourage students to explore questions across disciplinary boundaries, over 750 homework exercises, and 300 integrated reflection questions engage students in problem solving and active reading. The accompanying website — https://www.discoveringcs.net — includes more advanced content, solutions to selected exercises, sample code and data files, and pointers for further exploration.",Computers,534,N/A,0,en

Instrumentation Reference Book,Walt Boyes,Butterworth-Heinemann,2009-11-25,"The discipline of instrumentation has grown appreciably in recent years because of advances in sensor technology and in the interconnectivity of sensors, computers and control systems. This 4e of the Instrumentation Reference Book embraces the equipment and systems used to detect, track and store data related to physical, chemical, electrical, thermal and mechanical properties of materials, systems and operations. While traditionally a key area within mechanical and industrial engineering, understanding this greater and more complex use of sensing and monitoring controls and systems is essential for a wide variety of engineering areas--from manufacturing to chemical processing to aerospace operations to even the everyday automobile. In turn, this has meant that the automation of manufacturing, process industries, and even building and infrastructure construction has been improved dramatically. And now with remote wireless instrumentation, heretofore inaccessible or widely dispersed operations and procedures can be automatically monitored and controlled. This already well-established reference work will reflect these dramatic changes with improved and expanded coverage of the traditional domains of instrumentation as well as the cutting-edge areas of digital integration of complex sensor/control systems. - Thoroughly revised, with up-to-date coverage of wireless sensors and systems, as well as nanotechnologies role in the evolution of sensor technology - Latest information on new sensor equipment, new measurement standards, and new software for embedded control systems, networking and automated control - Three entirely new sections on Controllers, Actuators and Final Control Elements; Manufacturing Execution Systems; and Automation Knowledge Base - Up-dated and expanded references and critical standards",Technology & Engineering,929,4,1,en

Standard C++ IOStreams and Locales,"Angelika Langer, Klaus Kreft",Addison-Wesley Professional,2000,"Standard C++ provides a foundation for creating new, improved, and more powerful C++ components. IOStreams and locales are two such major components for text internationalization. As critical as these two APIs are, however, there are few resources devoted to explaining them. ""Standard C++ IOStreams and Locales"" fills this informational gap. It provides a comprehensive description of, and reference to, the iostreams and locales classes, showing how to put them to use and offering advanced information on customizing and extending their basic operation. Written by two experts involved with the development of the standard, this book reveals the rationale behind the design of the APIs and points out their potential pitfalls. This book serves as both a guide and a reference to C++ components.

Node List Tolerance Analysis,Robert R. Boyd,CRC Press,2018-10-03,"Developed at UC Berkeley more than two decades ago, SPICE software is the tool of choice for performing nominal analysis for electronic circuits. However, attempts to use SPICE for worst-case analysis (WCA) reveal several shortcomings, including: a 400-sample limit for Monte Carlo Analysis (MCA); lack of Rot-Sum-Square (RSS) analysis, asymmetric component tolerances, Fast MCA, or AC sensitivity capability; no single-run method of tolerancing inputs; and no predefined beta (skewed) or bimodal (gapped) distributions for MCA. While several commercial versions of SPICE may have corrected some of these limitations, they still remain rather expensive. Based on extensive experience in WCA, Node List Tolerance Analysis: Enhancing SPICE Capabilities with Mathcad presents software methods that overcome the many limitations of SPICE WCA using less expensive tools. The author demonstrates correct and incorrect methods of extreme value analysis, demonstrates the necessity of tolerancing multiple inputs, and provides output histograms for unusual inputs. He also shows how to detect non-monotonic components, which cause severe errors in all WCA methods except MCA. The book also includes demonstrations of tolerance analysis of three-phase AC circuits.

The Morality of Knowledge in Conversation,"Tanya Stivers, Lorenza Mondada, Jakob Steensig",Cambridge University Press,2011-06-02,"Each time we take a turn in conversation we indicate what we know and what we think others know. However, knowledge is neither static nor absolute. It is shaped by those we interact with and governed by social norms - we monitor one another for whether we are fulfilling our rights and responsibilities with respect to knowledge, and for who has relatively more rights to assert knowledge over some state of affairs. This book brings together an international team of leading linguists, sociologists and anthropologists working across a range of European and Asian languages to document some of the ways in which speakers manage the moral domain of knowledge in conversation. The volume demonstrates that if we are to understand how speakers manage issues of agreement, affiliation and alignment - something clearly at the heart of human sociality - we must understand the social norms surrounding epistemic access, primacy and responsibilities.",Language Arts & Disciplines,357,N/A,0,en

Handbook of Lasers,Marvin J. Weber,CRC Press,2000-09-21,"Lasers continue to be an amazingly robust field of activity. Anyone seeking a photon source is now confronted with an enormous number of possible lasers and laser wavelengths to choose from, but no single, comprehensive source to help them make that choice. The Handbook of Lasers provides an authoritative compilation of lasers, their properties, and original references in a readily accessible form. Organized by lasing media-solids, liquids, and gases-each section is subdivided into distinct laser types. Each type carries a brief description, followed by tables listing the lasing element or medium, host, lasing transition and wavelength, operating properties, primary literature citations, and, for broadband lasers, reported tuning ranges. The importance and value of the Handbook of Lasers cannot be overstated. Serving as both an archive and as an indicator of emerging trends, it reflects the state of knowledge and development in the field, provides a rapid means of obtaining reference data, and offers a pathway to the literature. It contains data useful for comparison with predictions and for developing models of processes, and may reveal fundamental inconsistencies or conflicts in the data.",Technology & Engineering,1240,4,1,en

C++ Coding Standards,"Herb Sutter, Andrei Alexandrescu",Pearson Education,2004-10-25,"Consistent, high-quality coding standards improve software quality, reduce time-to-market, promote teamwork, eliminate time wasted on inconsequential matters, and simplify maintenance. Now, two of the world's most respected C++ experts distill the rich collective experience of the global C++ community into a set of coding standards that every developer and development team can understand and use as a basis for their own coding standards. The authors cover virtually every facet of C++ programming: design and coding style, functions, operators, class design, inheritance, construction/destruction, copying, assignment, namespaces, modules, templates, genericity, exceptions, STL containers and algorithms, and more. Each standard is described concisely, with practical examples. From type definition to error handling, this book presents C++ best practices, including some that have only recently been identified and standardized-techniques you may not know even if you've used C++ for years. Along the way, you'll find answers to questions like What's worth standardizing--and what isn't? What are the best ways to code for scalability? What are the elements of a rational error handling policy? How (and why) do you avoid unnecessary initialization, cyclic, and definitional dependencies? When (and how) should you use static and dynamic polymorphism together? How do you practice ""safe"" overriding? When should you provide a no-fail swap? Why and how should you prevent exceptions from propagating across module boundaries? Why shouldn't you write namespace declarations or directives in a header file? Why should you use STL vector and string instead of arrays? How do you choose the right STL search or sort algorithm? What rules should you follow to ensure type-safe code? Whether you're working alone or with others, C++ Coding Standards will help you write cleaner code--and write it faster, with fewer hassles and less frustration.",Computers,489,N/A,0,en

Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights. Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field. Learn how to: make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy); overcome a lack of motivation and willpower; design your environment to make success easier; get back on track when you fall off course; ...and much more. Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.",Business & Economics,321,3.5,7,en

Discovering Modern C++,Peter Gottschling,Addison-Wesley Professional,2015-12-23,"As scientific and engineering projects grow larger and more complex, it is increasingly likely that those projects will be written in C++. With embedded hardware growing more powerful, much of its software is moving to C++, too. Mastering C++ gives you strong skills for programming at nearly every level, from “close to the hardware” to the highest-level abstractions. In short, C++ is a language that scientific and technical practitioners need to know. Peter Gottschling’s Discovering Modern C++ is an intensive introduction that guides you smoothly to sophisticated approaches based on advanced features. Gottschling introduces key concepts using examples from many technical problem domains, drawing on his extensive experience training professionals and teaching C++ to students of physics, math, and engineering. This book is designed to help you get started rapidly and then master increasingly robust features, from lambdas to expression templates. You’ll also learn how to take advantage of the powerful libraries available to C++ programmers: both the Standard Template Library (STL) and scientific libraries for arithmetic, linear algebra, differential equations, and graphs. Throughout, Gottschling demonstrates how to write clear and expressive software using object orientation, generics, metaprogramming, and procedural techniques. By the time you’re finished, you’ll have mastered all the abstractions you need to write C++ programs with exceptional quality and performance.",Computers,1559,4,1,en
Effective Modern C++,Scott Meyers,"""O'Reilly Media, Inc.""",2014-11-11,"Coming to grips with C++11 and C++14 is more than a matter of familiarizing yourself with the features they introduce (e.g., auto type declarations, move semantics, lambda expressions, and concurrency support). The challenge is learning to use those features effectively—so that your software is correct, efficient, maintainable, and portable. That’s where this practical book comes in. It describes how to write truly great software using C++11 and C++14—i.e. using modern C++. Topics include: The pros and cons of braced initialization, noexcept specifications, perfect forwarding, and smart pointer make functions The relationships among std::move, std::forward, rvalue references, and universal references Techniques for writing clear, correct, effective lambda expressions How std::atomic differs from volatile, how each should be used, and how they relate to C++'s concurrency API How best practices in ""old"" C++ programming (i.e., C++98) require revision for software development in modern C++ Effective Modern C++ follows the proven guideline-based, example-driven format of Scott Meyers' earlier books, but covers entirely new material. ""After I learned the C++ basics, I then learned how to use C++ in production code from Meyer's series of Effective C++ books. Effective Modern C++ is the most important how-to book for advice on key guidelines, styles, and idioms to use modern C++ effectively and well. Don't own it yet? Buy this one.

Effective C++,Scott Meyers,Pearson Education,2005-05-12,"“Every C++ professional needs a copy of Effective C++. It is an absolute must-read for anyone thinking of doing serious C++ development. If you’ve never read Effective C++ and you think you know everything about C++, think again.” — Steve Schirripa, Software Engineer, Google “C++ and the C++ community have grown up in the last fifteen years, and the third edition of Effective C++ reflects this. The clear and precise style of the book is evidence of Scott’s deep insight and distinctive ability to impart knowledge.” — Gerhard Kreuzer, Research and Development Engineer, Siemens AG The first two editions of Effective C++ were embraced by hundreds of thousands of programmers worldwide. The reason is clear: Scott Meyers’ practical approach to C++ describes the rules of thumb used by the experts — the things they almost always do or almost always avoid doing — to produce clear, correct, efficient code. The book is organized around 55 specific guidelines, each of which describes a way to write better C++. Each is backed by concrete examples. For this third edition, more than half the content is new, including added chapters on managing resources and using templates. Topics from the second edition have been extensively revised to reflect modern design considerations, including exceptions, design patterns, and multithreading. Important features of Effective C++ include: Expert guidance on the design of effective classes, functions, templates, and inheritance hierarchies. Applications of new “TR1” standard library functionality, along with comparisons to existing standard library components. Insights into differences between C++ and other languages (e.g., Java, C#, C) that help developers from those languages assimilate “the C++ way” of doing things.",Computers,320,4.5,2,en

Network Troubleshooting Tools,Joseph D Sloan,"O'Reilly Media, Inc.",2001,"Over the years, thousands of tools have been developed for debugging TCP/IP networks. They range from very specialized tools that do one particular task, to generalized suites that do just about everything except replace bad Ethernet cables. Even better, many of them are absolutely free. There's only one problem: who has time to track them all down, sort through them for the best ones for a particular purpose, or figure out how to use them? Network Troubleshooting Tools does the work for you--by describing the best of the freely available tools for debugging and troubleshooting. You can start with a lesser-known version of ping that diagnoses connectivity problems, or take on a much more comprehensive program like MRTG for graphing traffic through network interfaces. There's tkined for mapping and automatically monitoring networks, and Ethereal for capturing packets and debugging low-level problems. This book isn't just about the tools available for troubleshooting common network problems. It also outlines a systematic approach to network troubleshooting: how to document your network so you know how it behaves under normal conditions, and how to think about problems when they arise, so you can solve them more effectively. The topics covered in this book include: Understanding your network Connectivity testing Evaluating the path between two network nodes Tools for capturing packets Tools for network discovery and mapping Tools for working with SNMP Performance monitoring Testing application layer protocols Software sources If you're involved with network operations, this book will save you time, money, and needless experimentation.",Computers,376,N/A,0,en

"Youth Mobilization in Vichy Indochina and Its Legacies, 1940 to 1970",Anne Raffin,Lexington Books,2005,"To what extent, and precisely how, are nationalism and patriotism transnational processes? Youth Mobilization in Vichy Indochina and Its Legacies analyzes the causes and consequences of state-sponsored patriotic youth associations during World War II in French Indochina. Providing an historical account of the transnational policy process of youth mobilization during World War II, this book describes how officials transplanted French doctrines to Indochina with sensitivity toward the varying local political contexts and cultural traditions the French believed they had found there. Engaging the work of Benedict Anderson on nationalism in the Third World, Raffin details the mechanisms by which a set of French colonial practices and discourses sponsored by the colonial state promoted nationalism among local youth and helped to lead the countries of the former French Indochina toward militaristic regimes. This well-researched volume provides a valuable contribution to a period of Indochinese history that is still little studied, and is important reading for students and scholars of colonial history who seek a long-term historical perspective on empire and post-empire state building.",History,290,N/A,0,en

The Statistics Vocabulary Workbook is an awesome tool to use before a course of study as it will help you develop a strong working Insider’s Language before you even begin your review. Learn the Secret to Success! After nearly 20 years of teaching Lewis Morris discovered a startling fact: Most students didn’t struggle with the subject, they struggled with the language. It was never about brains or ability. His students simply didn’t have the knowledge of the specific language needed to succeed. Through experimentation and research, he discovered that for any subject there was a list of essential words, that, when mastered, unlocked a student’s ability to progress in the subject. Lewis called this set of vocabulary the “Insider’s Words”. When he applied these “Insider’s Words” the results were incredible. His students began to learn with ease. He was on his way to developing the landmark series of workbooks and applications to teach this “Insider’s Language” to students around the world.",Reference,161,N/A,0,en

Intraoperative Neurophysiologic Monitoring,"Gloria M. Galloway, Marc R. Nuwer, Jaime R. Lopez, Khaled M. Zamel",Cambridge University Press,2010-10-28,"Intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring has shown a steady increase in use for surgeries in which neural structures may be at risk of injury. Some of the surgical techniques used carry inherent risks, and these risks have changed the way in which neurophysiologic monitoring has impacted patient safety and quality of care during surgical procedures. It is therefore crucial that those performing and interpreting intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring are adequately trained. This book is a comprehensive guide to the current practice of intraoperative neurophysiology with chapters on various modalities and clinical uses. Separate chapters devoted to anesthesia, operating room environment, special considerations in pediatrics and the interpretation and reporting of neurophysiologic data are useful and complementary. Questions and detailed answers on the topics covered can be found on the accompanying website for study review.

Paloscia",VSP,2000-02,"This book contains a selection of refereed papers presented at the 6 Specialist Meeting on Microwave Radiometry and Remote Sensing of the Environment held in Florence, Italy on March 15-18, 1999. Over the last two decades, passive microwave remote sensing has made considerable progress, and has achieved significant results in the study of the Earth's surface and atmosphere. Many years of observations with ground-based and satellite-borne sensors have made an important contribution to improving our knowledge of many geophysical processes of the Earth's environment and of global changes. The evolution in microwave radiometers aboard satellites has increased steadily over recent years. At the same time, many investigations have been carried out both to improve the algorithms for the retrieval of geophysical parameters and to develop new technologies. The book is divided into four main sections: three of these are devoted to the observation of the Earth's surface and atmosphere, and the fourth, to future missions and new technologies. The first section deals with the study of sea and land surfaces, and reports recent advances in remote sensing of ocean wind, sea ice, soil moisture and vegetation biomass, including electromagnetic modelling and the assimilation of radiometric data in models of land surface processes. The following two sections are devoted to the measurement of atmospheric quantities which are of fundamental importance in climatology and meteorology, and, since they influence radio-wave propagation, they also impact on several other fields, including geodesy, navigational satellite and radioastronomy. The last section presents an overview of new technologies and plans for future missions.",Science,582,N/A,0,en

Book by Book,Michael Dirda,Henry Holt and Company,2007-04-01,"A Pulitzer Prize-winning critic's often surprising meditation on those places where life and books intersect and what might be learned from both Once out of school, most of us read for pleasure. Yet there is another equally important, though often overlooked, reason that we read: to learn how to live. Though books have always been understood as life-teachers, the exact way in which they instruct, cajole, and convince remains a subject of some mystery. Drawing on sources as diverse as Dr. Seuss and Simone Weil, P. G. Wodehouse and Isaiah Berlin, Pulitzer prize-winning critic Michael Dirda shows how the wit, wisdom, and enchantment of the written word can inform and enrich nearly every aspect of life, from education and work to love and death. Organized by significant life events and abounding with quotations from great writers and thinkers, Book by Book showcases Dirda's considerable knowledge, which he wears lightly.

Advances in Role and Reference Grammar,"Robert D. Van Valin, Jr.",John Benjamins Publishing,1992-01-01,"This volume presents research on major issues in syntactic theory within Role and Reference Grammar. This theory was first presented in detail in Functional Syntax and Universal Grammar [FSUG], and these papers represent both expansions and applications of the theory to a wide range of phenomena. The first section contains an introduction to the theory which is the most thorough statement of it since FSUG, summarizing the features of Role and Reference Grammar established there and developing new theoretical components and analyses of syntactic phenomena not discussed in the earlier work. Throughout the discussion features of RRG are compared and contrasted with comparable features of other syntactic theories. The remainder of the volume is devoted to detailed analyses of specific problems, e.g. control, case marking, in a wide variety of languages, e.g. Mandarin Chinese, Nootka, Mparntwe Arrernte and Turkish. Thus the works presented here illustrate well the strong cross-linguistic approach to syntactic theory and description in Role and Reference Grammar.",Language Arts & Disciplines,583,N/A,0,en

"Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium, Phosphorus, Magnesium, Vitamin D, and Fluoride","Institute of Medicine, Food and Nutrition Board, Standing Committee on the Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intakes",National Academies Press,1999-10-17,"Since 1941, Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) has been recognized as the most authoritative source of information on nutrient levels for healthy people. Since publication of the 10th edition in 1989, there has been rising awareness of the impact of nutrition on chronic disease. In light of new research findings and a growing public focus on nutrition and health, the expert panel responsible for formulation RDAs reviewed and expanded its approachâ€""the result: Dietary Reference Intakes. This new series of references greatly extends the scope and application of previous nutrient guidelines. For each nutrient the book presents what is known about how the nutrient functions in the human body, what the best method is to determine its requirements, which factors (caffeine or exercise, for example) may affect how it works, and how the nutrient may be related to chronic disease. The first volume of Dietary Reference Intakes includes calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, vitamin D, and fluoride. The second book in the series presents information about thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, biotin, and choline. Based on analysis of nutrient metabolism in humans and data on intakes in the U.S. population, the committee recommends intakes for each age groupâ€""from the first days of life through childhood, sexual maturity, midlife, and the later years. Recommendations for pregnancy and lactation also are made, and the book identifies when intake of a nutrient may be too much. Representing a new paradigm for the nutrition community, Dietary Reference Intakes encompasses: Estimated Average Requirements (EARs). These are used to set Recommended Dietary Allowances. Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs). Intakes that meet the RDA are likely to meet the nutrient requirement of nearly all individuals in a life-stage and gender group. Adequate Intakes (AIs). These are used instead of RDAs when an EAR cannot be calculated. Both the RDA and the AI may be used as goals for individual intake. Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs). Intakes below the UL are unlikely to pose risks of adverse health effects in healthy people. This new framework encompasses both essential nutrients and other food components thought to pay a role in health, such as dietary fiber. It incorporates functional endpoints and examines the relationship between dose and response in determining adequacy and the hazards of excess intake for each nutrient.",Medical,449,4,1,en

Programming in D,Ali Cehreli,CreateSpace,2015-08-19,"The main aim of this book is to teach D to readers who are new to computer programming. Although having experience in other programming languages is certainly helpful, this book starts from the basics. D is a multi-paradigm system programming language that combines a wide range of powerful programming concepts from the lowest to the highest levels. It has C-like syntax and static typing. It pragmatically combines efficiency, control, and modeling power, with safety and programmer productivity in mind. Each chapter is based on the contents of the previous ones, introducing as few new concepts as possible. It is recommended that the book is read in linear fashion, without skipping chapters if possible. Although this book was written with beginners in mind, it covers almost all features of D. More experienced programmers can use the book as a D language reference by starting from the index section. Blurbs from the back cover: ""D is pristine, clean, immensely powerful, and arguably the actual state-of-the-art programming language. Ali's book is a gem. Clear, concise, and complete."" - Olivier Henley ""I have been using Ali's online D book to teach D at the university level. It is up-to-date, complete, and most importantly, extremely readable. Having a print version is even better! This is now the 'go-to' book for learning D programming."" - Chuck Allison, Professor and Chair, Computer Science Department, Utah Valley University ""Ali's explanations are succinct and on target. I like that he provides rationale for why D was designed in a particular way and how I can use it most effectively. This is the best computer language book I've read."" - Robbin Carlson, Luthier and Enterprise Architect ""I taught a CS2 Data Structures class in D with more success and student appreciation than when using either C++ or Java as it's an ideal language to express the relevant concepts at all scales, from detailed to big picture, without needless complexity. Ali Çehreli's tutorial played a central role supporting students especially during the first half of the course - without it the course simply would not have worked, so ""many thanks Ali"" - and an important part of that is its linearity - it can be read with only backward dependencies. This meant that with hard work even students of little experience and only moderate current abilities could get up to speed, and we saw just that. It is hard to overstate this factor. I unreservedly recommend this book to all."" - Dr. Carl Sturtivant, University of Minnesota Department of Computer Science & Engineering ""This book is one of the best guides through the language that I've seen."" - Andrew Wray, D Enthusiast ""I encourage anyone considering D to read this book. Not exactly 'D for Dummies' but it's easy to follow even if you don't have much experience with compiled languages."" - bachmeier, Reddit user ""Having worked through the book, I have to say this is one of the easiest to follow and distraction free read there is and the fact that it made learning a new language a total breeze really impressed me."" - Imran Khan, Student",,798,N/A,0,en

The series volumes are not the outcome of a symposium. Rather, each editor has the potential to examine a chosen area with a broad perspective, both in subject matter as well as in the choice of chapter authors. The international perspective, especially with regard to public health initiatives, is emphasized where appropriate. The editors, whose trainings are both research- and practice-oriented, have the opportunity to develop a primary objective for their book; define the scope and focus, and then invite the leading authorities from around the world to be part of their initiative. The authors are encouraged to provide an overview of the field, discuss their own research, and relate the research findings to potential human health consequences.",Science,442,N/A,0,en

Dietary Reference Intakes for Sodium and Potassium,"National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, Health and Medicine Division, Food and Nutrition Board, Committee to Review the Dietary Reference Intakes for Sodium and Potassium",National Academies Press,2019-08-26,"As essential nutrients, sodium and potassium contribute to the fundamentals of physiology and pathology of human health and disease. In clinical settings, these are two important blood electrolytes, are frequently measured and influence care decisions. Yet, blood electrolyte concentrations are usually not influenced by dietary intake, as kidney and hormone systems carefully regulate blood values. Over the years, increasing evidence suggests that sodium and potassium intake patterns of children and adults influence long-term population health mostly through complex relationships among dietary intake, blood pressure and cardiovascular health. The public health importance of understanding these relationships, based upon the best available evidence and establishing recommendations to support the development of population clinical practice guidelines and medical care of patients is clear. This report reviews evidence on the relationship between sodium and potassium intakes and indicators of adequacy, toxicity, and chronic disease. It updates the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) using an expanded DRI model that includes consideration of chronic disease endpoints, and outlines research gaps to address the uncertainties identified in the process of deriving the reference values and evaluating public health implications.",Medical,595,N/A,0,en

Developing Feedback for Pupil Learning,Ruth Dann,Routledge,2017-08-21,"Feedback is often considered to be one of the pivotal enablers of formative assessment. This key topic has received considerable attention within research literature and has been studied by a number of leading experts in the field. This book is positioned at the heart of these debates and offers a specific contribution to ‘exploring’ and ‘exploiting’ the learning gap which feedback seeks to shift. Developing Feedback for Pupil Learning seeks to synthesise what we know about feedback and learning into more in-depth understandings of what influences both the structure of and changes to the learning gap. This research-informed but accessibly written enquiry is at the very heart of teaching, learning and assessment. It offers a timely contribution to understanding what works (and what doesn’t) for whom and why. Split into three main parts, it covers: Feedback for learning in theory, policy and practice; Conceptualising the ‘learning gap’; New futures for feedback. This text will be essential reading for students, teachers, researchers and all those who engage with issues related to teaching, learning and assessment academically.",Education,294,N/A,0,en

Elizabethan Naval Administration,"C.S. Knighton, David Loades",Routledge,2016-04-29,"This is the first general selection from the substantial body of surviving documents about Elizabeth’s navy. It is a companion to The Navy of Edward VI and Mary I (Vol.157 in the NRS Series), where the apparatus serving both volumes was printed, and it complements the other NRS volumes that deal specifically with the Spanish Armada. This collection concentrates (though not exclusively so) on the early years of Elizabeth’s reign when there was no formal war. From 1558-1585 the navy was involved in a number of small-scale campaigns, pursuit of pirates and occasional shows of force. The documents selected emphasize the financial and administrative processes that supported these operations, such as mustering, victualing, demobilisation, and ship maintenance and repair. The fleet varied in size from about 30 to 45 ships during the period and a vast amount of maintenance and repair was required. The main component of the volume is the massively detailed Navy Treasurer's account for 1562-3 which is followed by and collated with the corresponding Exchequer Account. The documents illustrate just how efficiently the dockyards functioned. They were one of the great early Elizabethan achievements.",History,828,N/A,0,en

Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing,"Ruslan Mitkov, Nicolas Nicolov",John Benjamins Publishing,1997-01-01,"This volume is based on contributions from the First International Conference on Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing (RANLP'95) held in Tzigov Chark, Bulgaria, 14-16 September 1995. This conference was one of the most important and competitively reviewed conferences in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for 1995 with submissions from more than 30 countries. Of the 48 papers presented at RANLP'95, the best (revised) papers have been selected for this book, in the hope that they reflect the most significant and promising trends (and latest successful results) in NLP. The book is organised thematically and the contributions are grouped according to the traditional topics found in NLP: morphology, syntax, grammars, parsing, semantics, discourse, grammars, generation, machine translation, corpus processing and multimedia. To help the reader find his/her way, the authors have prepared an extensive index which contains major terms used in NLP; an index of authors which lists the names of the authors and the page numbers of their paper(s); a list of figures; and a list of tables. This book will be of interest to researchers, lecturers and graduate students interested in Natural Language Processing and more specifically to those who work in Computational Linguistics, Corpus Linguistics and Machine Translation.",Language Arts & Disciplines,487,N/A,0,en

The Common European Sales Law in Context,"Gerhard Dannemann, Stefan Vogenauer",OUP Oxford,2013-03-21,"European Contract Law unification projects have recently advanced from the Draft Common Frame of Reference (2009) to a European Commission proposal for an optional Common European Sales Law (2011) which is to facilitate cross-border marketing. This book investigates for the first time how CESL and DCFR rules would interact with various aspects of domestic law, represented by English and German law. Nineteen chapters, co-authored by British and German scholars, examine such interface issues for eg pre-contractual relationships, notions of contract, formation, interpretation, and remedies, extending to non-discrimination, third parties, transfers or rights, aspects of property law, and collective proceedings. They go beyond a critical analysis of CESL and DCFR rules by demonstrating where and how CESL rules would interact with neighbouring areas of English and German law before English and German courts, how domestic traditions might influence the application, which aspects might motivate sellers and buyers to choose or reject CESL, and which might serve as model for national legislators. The findings are summarized in the final two chapters.",Law,1149,N/A,0,en

The Architect in Practice,"David Chappell, Michael H. Dunn",John Wiley & Sons,2015-12-02,"Throughout its many editions, The Architect in Practice has remained a leading textbook used in the education of architects. While the content of the book has developed, the message and philosophy has remained constant: to provide students of architecture and young practitioners with a readable guide to the profession, outlining an architect's duties to their client and contractor, the key aspects of running a building contract, and the essentials of management, finance and drawing office procedure. The eleventh edition follows in that tradition. The text has been brought up to date to ensure it follows the new RIBA Plan of Work 2013 as the guide to the architect’s workflow. In addition, a number of changes to standard forms of contract were made with the publication of the JCT 2011 suite of contracts, and the RIBA Standard Form for the Appointment of an Architect 2010 (2012 Revision). These new forms are fully covered. In addition, the opportunity has been taken to reorganise the layout so that the content flows in a way that is more consistent with current architectural practice, and to deal with the increasing use of BIM.

Digilect,Ágnes Veszelszki,Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG,2017-06-26,"The high degree of internet penetration and its social (and linguistic) effects evidently influence how people, and especially the highly susceptible younger generations, use language. The primary aim of the book is not only to identify the characteristic features of the digital language variety (this has already been done by several works) but to examine how digital communication affects the language of other mediums of communication: orality, handwritten texts, digitally created but not digitally perceived, that is printed texts, including in particular advertisements (which quickly respond to linguistic change). Naturally, the book presents the characteristics of the digital language variety (and coins the term digilect) but only to give a framework to the impact analysis. It is important to document changes in progress and thus direct attention to potential outcomes. The current linguistic change is different from previous ones primarily in its speed and form of spreading, and it not only brings innovative grammatical forms and writing/spelling solutions but may also have far-reaching cultural and educational consequences in the long run.",Language Arts & Disciplines,366,N/A,0,en

"Introduction to Polymers, Third Edition","Robert J. Young, Peter A. Lovell",CRC Press,2011-06-27,"Thoroughly updated, Introduction to Polymers, Third Edition presents the science underpinning the synthesis, characterization and properties of polymers. The material has been completely reorganized and expanded to include important new topics and provide a coherent platform for teaching and learning the fundamental aspects of contemporary polymer science. New to the Third Edition Part I This first part covers newer developments in polymer synthesis, including ‘living’ radical polymerization, catalytic chain transfer and free-radical ring-opening polymerization, along with strategies for the synthesis of conducting polymers, dendrimers, hyperbranched polymers and block copolymers. Polymerization mechanisms have been made more explicit by showing electron movements. Part II In this part, the authors have added new topics on diffusion, solution behaviour of polyelectrolytes and field-flow fractionation methods. They also greatly expand coverage of spectroscopy, including UV visible, Raman, infrared, NMR and mass spectroscopy. In addition, the Flory–Huggins theory for polymer solutions and their phase separation is treated more rigorously. Part III A completely new, major topic in this section is multicomponent polymer systems. The book also incorporates new material on macromolecular dynamics and reptation, liquid crystalline polymers and thermal analysis. Many of the diagrams and micrographs have been updated to more clearly highlight features of polymer morphology. Part IV The last part of the book contains major new sections on polymer composites, such as nanocomposites, and electrical properties of polymers. Other new topics include effects of chain entanglements, swelling of elastomers, polymer fibres, impact behaviour and ductile fracture. Coverage of rubber-toughening of brittle plastics has also been revised and expanded. While this edition adds many new concepts, the philosophy of the book remains unchanged. Largely self-contained, the text fully derives most equations and cross-references topics between chapters where appropriate.

Genetics of Acquired Antimicrobial Resistance in Animal and Zoonotic Pathogens," Axel Cloeckaert, Michel Stanislas Zygmunt, Benoît Doublet",Frontiers Media SA,2018-01-26,"Development and spread of antimicrobial resistance is the result of an evolutionary process by which microorganisms adapt to antibiotics through several mechanisms including alteration of drug target by mutation and horizontal transfer of resistance genes. The concomitant occurrence of independent antimicrobial resistance mechanisms is a serious threat to human health and has appeared in several emerging epidemic clones over the past decade in humans and also in animals. The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial drug resistance among animal and zoonotic foodborne pathogens is of particular concern for public health. In this Ebook, we gathered a collection of articles which deal with the most important aspects of the genetics of acquired antimicrobial resistance extending from medically-important resistance, emerging epidemic resistant clones, main mobile genetic elements spreading resistance, resistomes, dissemination between animals and humans, to the “One Health” concept.",,196,N/A,0,en

Mayer",John Wiley & Sons,2016-02-19,"The essential e-learning design manual, updated with the latest research, design principles, and examples e-Learning and the Science of Instruction is the ultimate handbook for evidence-based e-learning design. Since the first edition of this book, e-learning has grown to account for at least 40% of all training delivery media. However, digital courses often fail to reach their potential for learning effectiveness and efficiency. This guide provides research-based guidelines on how best to present content with text, graphics, and audio as well as the conditions under which those guidelines are most effective. This updated fourth edition describes the guidelines, psychology, and applications for ways to improve learning through personalization techniques, coherence, animations, and a new chapter on evidence-based game design. The chapter on the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning introduces three forms of cognitive load which are revisited throughout each chapter as the psychological basis for chapter principles. A new chapter on engagement in learning lays the groundwork for in-depth reviews of how to leverage worked examples, practice, online collaboration, and learner control to optimize learning. The updated instructor's materials include a syllabus, assignments, storyboard projects, and test items that you can adapt to your own course schedule and students. Co-authored by the most productive instructional research scientist in the world, Dr. Richard E. Mayer, this book distills copious e-learning research into a practical manual for improving learning through optimal design and delivery. Get up to date on the latest e-learning research Adopt best practices for communicating information effectively Use evidence-based techniques to engage your learners Replace popular instructional ideas, such as learning styles with evidence-based guidelines Apply evidence-based design techniques to optimize learning games e-Learning continues to grow as an alternative or adjunct to the classroom, and correspondingly, has become a focus among researchers in learning-related fields. New findings from research laboratories can inform the design and development of e-learning. However, much of this research published in technical journals is inaccessible to those who actually design e-learning material. By collecting the latest evidence into a single volume and translating the theoretical into the practical, e-Learning and the Science of Instruction has become an essential resource for consumers and designers of multimedia learning.",Business & Economics,507,N/A,0,en

Romantic Women Poets,"Lilla Maria Crisafulli, Cecilia Pietropoli",Rodopi,2007,"Romantic Women Poets: Genre and Gender focuses on the part played by women poets in the creation of the literary canon in the Romantic period in Britain. Its thirteen essays enrich our panoramic view of an age that is traditionally dominated by male authors such as Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley, Keats and Scott. Instead the volume concentrates on the poetical theory and practice of such extraordinary and fascinating women as Joanna Baillie, Charlotte Smith, Anna Laetita Barbauld, Dorothy Wordsworth, Helen Maria Williams, Lady Morgan, Ann Radcliffe, Mary Shelley, Letitia Elizabeth Landon, Anna Seward, and Lady Caroline Lamb. Female and male poetics, gender and genres, literary forms and poetic modes are extensively discussed together with the diversity of behaviour and personal responses that the individual women poets offered to their age and provoked in their readers. There have been several important collections of essays in this particular area of study in the last few years, but this volume reflects and complements much of this earlier critical work with specific strengths of its own.",Law,281,N/A,0,en

Qualitative Research in Practice,"Sharan B. Merriam, Robin S. Grenier",John Wiley & Sons,2019-01-14,"A practical introduction to qualitative research across fields and disciplines Qualitative Research in Practice offers a hands-on introduction to qualitative research design, methods, data, and analysis. Designed as a companion text for any course involving qualitative research, this book explores the different types of qualitative studies with relevant examples and analysis by the researchers themselves. The workbook format makes it easy to use in the classroom or the field, and the depth of information makes it a valuable resource for students of social work, psychology, counseling, management, education, health care, or any field in which qualitative research is conducted. While quantitative research is primarily concerned with numerical data, qualitative research methods are more flexible, responsive, and open to contextual information. To a qualitative researcher, a situation is defined by the participants’ perspectives, making it the primary method of inquiry for understanding social phenomena through the lens of experience. This book introduces the essentials of qualitative research, bolstered by expert analysis and discussion that provides deeper insight than a traditional textbook format would allow. Understand the fundamental nature of qualitative research Learn how to accurately assess and evaluate qualitative research Explore qualitative research’s many forms and applications Gain insight on qualitative research in a variety of fields and disciplines How does one codify an experience? Is it possible to measure emotion in units? Qualitative research fills the void where numbers cannot reach. It is the best tool we have for studying the unquantifiable aspects of the human experience, and it is an essential tool in a wide variety of fields. Qualitative Research in Practice provides translatable skills in a practical format to quicken your transition from “learning” to “using.”",Education,482,N/A,0,en

Reliability Analysis for Asset Management of Electric Power Grids,Robert Ross,John Wiley & Sons,2018-12-28,"A practical guide to facilitate statistically well-founded decisions in the management of assets of an electricity grid Effective and economic electric grid asset management and incident management involve many complex decisions on inspection, maintenance, repair and replacement. This timely reference provides statistically well-founded, tried and tested analysis methodologies for improved decision making and asset management strategy for optimum grid reliability and availability. The techniques described are also sufficiently robust to apply to small data sets enabling asset managers to deal with early failures or testing with limited sample sets. The book describes the background, concepts and statistical techniques to evaluate failure distributions, probabilities, remaining lifetime, similarity and compliancy of observed data with specifications, asymptotic behavior of parameter estimators, effectiveness of network configurations and stocks of spare parts. It also shows how the graphical representation and parameter estimation from analysis of data can be made consistent, as well as explaining modern upcoming methodologies such as the Health Index and Risk Index. Key features: Offers hands-on tools and techniques for data analysis, similarity index, failure forecasting, health and risk indices and the resulting maintenance strategies. End-of-chapter problems and solutions to facilitate self-study via a book companion website.

Assessment of Planetary Protection Requirements for Spacecraft Missions to Icy Solar System Bodies,"National Research Council, Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences, Space Studies Board, Committee on Planetary Protection Standards for Icy Bodies in the Outer Solar System",National Academies Press,2012-07-10,"NASA's exploration of planets and satellites during the past 50 years has led to the discovery of traces of water ice throughout the solar system and prospects for large liquid water reservoirs beneath the frozen ICE shells of multiple satellites of the giant planets of the outer solar system. During the coming decades, NASA and other space agencies will send flybys, orbiters, subsurface probes, and, possibly, landers to these distant worlds in order to explore their geologic and chemical context. Because of their potential to harbor alien life, NASA will select missions that target the most habitable outer solar system objects. This strategy poses formidable challenges for mission planners who must balance the opportunity for exploration with the risk of contamination by Earth's microbes, which could confuse the interpretation of data obtained from these objects. The 2000 NRC report Preventing the Forward Contamination of Europa provided a criterion that was adopted with prior recommendations from the Committee on Space Research of the International Council for Science. This current NRC report revisits and extends the findings and recommendations of the 2000 Europa report in light of recent advances in planetary and life sciences and, among other tasks, assesses the risk of contamination of icy bodies in the solar system.",Science,94,N/A,0,en
Philosophy of Mathematics and Natural Science,Hermann Weyl,Princeton University Press,2021-09-14,"When mathematician Hermann Weyl decided to write a book on philosophy, he faced what he referred to as ""conflicts of conscience""--the objective nature of science, he felt, did not mesh easily with the incredulous, uncertain nature of philosophy. Yet the two disciplines were already intertwined. In Philosophy of Mathematics and Natural Science, Weyl examines how advances in philosophy were led by scientific discoveries--the more humankind understood about the physical world, the more curious we became. The book is divided into two parts, one on mathematics and the other on the physical sciences. Drawing on work by Descartes, Galileo, Hume, Kant, Leibniz, and Newton, Weyl provides readers with a guide to understanding science through the lens of philosophy. This is a book that no one but Weyl could have written--and, indeed, no one has written anything quite like it since.",Mathematics,332,N/A,0,en

The Handbook of Lasers provides an authoritative compilation of lasers, their properties, and original references in a readily accessible form. Organized by lasing media-solids, liquids, and gases-each section is subdivided into distinct laser types. Each type carries a brief description, followed by tables listing the lasing element or medium, host, lasing transition and wavelength, operating properties, primary literature citations, and, for broadband lasers, reported tuning ranges. The importance and value of the Handbook of Lasers cannot be overstated. Serving as both an archive and as an indicator of emerging trends, it reflects the state of knowledge and development in the field, provides a rapid means of obtaining reference data, and offers a pathway to the literature.

Nonlinear Functional Analysis and its Applications,E. Zeidler,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-12-11,"As long as a branch of knowledge offers an abundance of problems, it is full of vitality. David Hilbert Over the last 15 years I have given lectures on a variety of problems in nonlinear functional analysis and its applications. In doing this, I have recommended to my students a number of excellent monographs devoted to specialized topics, but there was no complete survey-type exposition of nonlinear functional analysis making available a quick survey to the wide range of readers including mathematicians, natural scientists, and engineers who have only an elementary knowledge of linear functional analysis. I have tried to close this gap with my five-part lecture notes, the first three parts of which have been published in the Teubner-Texte series by Teubner-Verlag, Leipzig, 1976, 1977, and 1978. The present English edition was translated from a completely rewritten manuscript which is significantly longer than the original version in the Teubner-Texte series. The material is organized in the following way: Part I: Fixed Point Theorems. Part II: Monotone Operators. Part III: Variational Methods and Optimization. Parts IV jV: Applications to Mathematical Physics. The exposition is guided by the following considerations: (a) What are the supporting basic ideas and what intrinsic interrelations exist between them? (/3) In what relation do the basic ideas stand to the known propositions of classical analysis and linear functional analysis? ( y) What typical applications are there?

It is the process, procedures and authority used to accept or reject all components, drug product containers, closures, in-process materials, packaging material, labeling and drug products, and the authority to review production records to assure that no errors have occurred.The quality which is supposed to be achieved is not a concept which can be controlled by easy, numerical or other means, but it is the control over the intrinsic quality of a test facility and its studies. The aim of this book is to share useful and practical knowledge about quality control in several fields with the people who want to improve their knowledge.",Technology & Engineering,548,N/A,0,en

Interfaces Between Language And Cognition,"Yury Y. Shtyrov, Andriy Myachykov, Christoph Scheepers",Frontiers E-books,2013-06-28,"Cognitive mechanisms underlying linguistic communication do not only rely upon retrieval and processing of linguistic information; they also involve constant updating and organizing of this linguistic information in relation with other, more general, cognitive mechanisms. Some existing theoretical models assume such a tight interactive link between domain-general and domain-specific sources of information in the cognitive organization of the linguistic faculty and during language use. Domain-specific constraints may include, for example, grammatical as well as lexical and pragmatic knowledge. Domain-general constraints comprise processing limitations imposed by the cognitive mechanisms of memory, attention, learning, and social interaction. However, much of the existing research tends to focus on one or the other of the aforementioned areas, while integrative accounts are still rather sparse at present. Therefore, the aim of this Research Topic of Frontiers in Cognition is to bring together researchers who, with in their respective research fields and by using different methodologies, represent integrative approaches to the study of language. We invite submissions from a wide range of interrelated areas of research: cognitive architectures of language, aspects of language processing, linguistic development, bilingualism, language embodiment, neuropsychology of linguistic function, among others. We would like to solicit original research contributions discussing behavioral, neurophysiological, and computational evidence as well as papers on methodological and/or theoretical aspects of the interplay between linguistic and non-linguistic cognitive processes.",,211,N/A,0,en

Nietzsche and Architecture,Lucy Huskinson,Bloomsbury Publishing,2024-07-25,"Nietzsche and Architecture explores Nietzsche's relationship to the architects, buildings, and modern architectural movements he went on to inspire, and situates his philosophy more appropriately and comprehensively within the field of architectural studies, architectural history, and theory. Divided into two parts, the book first examines Nietzsche's philosophy of architecture, exploring his notions of rhythm, ornament, style, and power. It then goes on to examine Nietzsche's ambiguous architectural legacy, scrutinising iconic architects, thinkers, designs, and cultural movements to ascertain their relationship with Nietzschean ideas, from the crystal architecture of Bruno Taut and Peter Behrens, to the 'new styles' of the Bauhaus and Le Corbusier, Louis H. Sullivan's desire for the heights, and the cultural propaganda of 'Nazi architecture'. Clearly explaining the subtleties and complexities of Nietzsche's architectural thought, Nietzsche and Architecture provides an accessible insight into Nietzsche's philosophy and its significance to the development of modern architecture in the 19th and early 20th centuries, shedding vital light on the continued relevance of Nietzsche to architecture today.",Architecture,431,N/A,0,en

Heavy-Duty Wheeled Vehicles,"Boris Nikolaevich Belousov, Sergey D Popov",SAE International,2014-01-27,"Heavy-duty wheeled vehicles (HDWVs) are all-wheel-drive vehicles that carry 25 tons or more and have three or more axles. They transport heavy, bulky cargo such as raw minerals, timber, construction materials, pre-fabricated modules, weapons, combat vehicles, and more. HDWVs are used in a variety of industries (mining, logging, construction, energy) and are critical to a country’s economy and defense. These vehicles have unique development requirements due to their high loads, huge dimensions, and specific operating conditions. Hauling efficiencies can be improved by increasing vehicle load capacity; however capacities are influenced by legislation, road limits, and design. Designing HDWVs differs from other multi-purpose all-wheel-drive vehicles. The chassis must be custom-designed to suit the customer’s particular purpose. The number of axles is another variable, as well as which ones are driving and which are driven. Tires are also customizable. Translated by SAE from Russian, this book narrates the history of HDWVs and presents the theory and calculations required to design them. It summarizes results of the authors’ academic research and experience and presents innovative technical solutions used for electric and hydrostatic transmissions, steering systems, and active safety of these vehicles. The book consists of three parts. Part one covers HDWV design history and general design methods, including basic vehicle design, and evaluating HDWV use conditions. Part one also covers general operation requirements and consumer needs, and a brief analysis of structural components of existing HDWVs and prototypes. Part two outlines information needs for designing HDWVs. Part three reviews basic theory and calculation of innovative technical solutions, as well as special requirements for component parts. This comprehensive title provides the following information about HDWVs: • History of design and manufacture. • Manufacturers’ summary design data. • Background data on sample vehicles. • Component calculation examples. • Overview of motion theory, which is useful in design and placement of bulky cargo.",Technology & Engineering,579,N/A,0,en

Traditionally, the eld of medical data analysis can be devided into classical topics such as medical statistics, sur- val analysis, biometrics and medical informatics. Recently, however, time series analysis by physicists, machine learning and data mining with methods such as neural networks, Bayes networks or fuzzy computing by computer scientists have contributed important ideas to the led of medical data analysis. Although all these groups have similar intentions, there was nearly no exchange or discussion between them. With the growing possibilities for storing and ana- zing patient data, even in smaller health care institutions, the need for a rational treatment of all these data emerged as well. Therefore, the need for data exchange and presentation systems grew also. The goal of the symposium is to collect all these relevant aspects together. It provides an international forum for the sharing and exchange of original re- arch results, ideas and practical experiences among researchers and application developers from di erent areas related to medical applications dealing with the analysis of medical data.

Software Abstractions,Daniel Jackson,MIT Press,2012,"An approach to software design that introduces a fully automated analysis giving designers immediate feedback, now featuring the latest version of the Alloy language. In Software Abstractions Daniel Jackson introduces an approach to software design that draws on traditional formal methods but exploits automated tools to find flaws as early as possible. This approach—which Jackson calls “lightweight formal methods” or “agile modeling”—takes from formal specification the idea of a precise and expressive notation based on a tiny core of simple and robust concepts but replaces conventional analysis based on theorem proving with a fully automated analysis that gives designers immediate feedback. Jackson has developed Alloy, a language that captures the essence of software abstractions simply and succinctly, using a minimal toolkit of mathematical notions. This revised edition updates the text, examples, and appendixes to be fully compatible with Alloy 4.",Computers,373,N/A,0,en

"Emerging Approaches for Typing, Detection, Characterization, and Traceback of Escherichia coli, 2nd Edition"," Pina M. Fratamico, Chitrita DebRoy, David S. Needleman",Frontiers Media SA,2018-05-02,"Pathogenic Escherichia coli strains cause a large number of diseases in humans, including diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, hemolytic uremic syndrome, urinary tract infections, and neonatal meningitis, while in animals they cause diseases such as calf scours and mastitis in cattle, post-weaning diarrhea and edema disease in pigs, and peritonitis and airsacculitis in chickens. The different E. coli pathotypes are characterized by the presence of specific sets of virulence-related genes. Therefore, it is not surprising that pathogenic E. coli constitutes a genetically heterogeneous family of bacteria, and they are continuing to evolve. Rapid and accurate molecular methods are critically needed to detect and trace pathogenic E. coli in food and animals. They are also needed for epidemiological investigations to enhance food safety, as well as animal and human health and to minimize the size and geographical extent of outbreaks. The serotype of E. coli strains has traditionally been determined using antisera raised against the >180 different O- (somatic) and 53 H- (flagellar) antigens. However, there are many problems associated with serotyping, including: it is labor-intensive and time consuming; cross reactivity of the antisera with different serogroups occurs; antisera are available only in specialized laboratories; and many strains are non-typeable. Molecular serotyping targeting O-group-specific genes within the E. coli O-antigen gene clusters and genes that are involved in encoding for the different flagellar types offers an improved approach for determining the E. coliO- and H-groups. Furthermore, molecular serotyping can be coupled with determination of specific sets of virulence genes carried by the strain offering the possibility to determine O-group, pathotype, and the pathogenic potential simultaneously. Sequencing of the O-antigen gene clusters of all of the known O-groups of E. coli is now complete, and the sequences have been deposited in the GenBank database. The sequence information has revealed that some E. coli serogroups have identical sequences while others have point mutations or insertion sequences and type as different serogroups in serological reactions. There are also a number of other ambiguities in serotyping that need to be resolved. Furthermore, new E. coli O-groups are being identified. Therefore, there is an essential need to resolve these issues and to revise the E. coli serotype nomenclature based on these findings. There are emerging technologies that can potentially be applied for molecular serotyping and detection and characterization of E. coli. On a related topic, the genome sequence of thousands of E. coli strains have been deposited in GenBank, and this information is revealing unique markers such as CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) and virulence gene markers that could be used to identify E. coli pathotypes. Whole genome sequencing now provides the opportunity to study the role of horizontal gene transfer in the evolution and emergence of pathogenic E. coli strains. Whole genome sequencing approaches are being investigated for genotyping and outbreak investigation for regulatory and public health needs; however, there is a need for establishing bioinformatics pipelines able to handle large amounts of data as we move toward the use of genetic approaches for non-culture-based detection and characterization of E. coli and for outbreak investigations.",,172,N/A,0,en

Intelligent Robotics and Applications,"Honghai Liu, Han Ding, Zhenhua Xiong, Xiangyang Zhu",Springer Science & Business Media,2010-10-21,"The market demand for skills, knowledge and adaptability have positioned robotics to be an important field in both engineering and science. One of the most highly visible applications of robotics has been the robotic automation of many industrial tasks in factories. In the future, a new era will come in which we will see a greater success for robotics in non-industrial environments. In order to anticipate a wider deployment of intelligent and autonomous robots for tasks such as manufacturing, healthcare, ent- tainment, search and rescue, surveillance, exploration, and security missions, it is essential to push the frontier of robotics into a new dimension, one in which motion and intelligence play equally important roles. The 2010 International Conference on Intelligent Robotics and Applications (ICIRA 2010) was held in Shanghai, China, November 10–12, 2010. The theme of the c- ference was “Robotics Harmonizing Life,” a theme that reflects the ever-growing interest in research, development and applications in the dynamic and exciting areas of intelligent robotics. These volumes of Springer’s Lecture Notes in Artificial Intel- gence and Lecture Notes in Computer Science contain 140 high-quality papers, which were selected at least for the papers in general sessions, with a 62% acceptance rate Traditionally, ICIRA 2010 holds a series of plenary talks, and we were fortunate to have two such keynote speakers who shared their expertise with us in diverse topic areas spanning the rang of intelligent robotics and application activities.",Computers,785,N/A,0,en

"Finite Volumes for Complex Applications VIII - Hyperbolic, Elliptic and Parabolic Problems","Clément Cancès, Pascal Omnes",Springer,2017-05-22,"This book is the second volume of proceedings of the 8th conference on ""Finite Volumes for Complex Applications"" (Lille, June 2017). It includes reviewed contributions reporting successful applications in the fields of fluid dynamics, computational geosciences, structural analysis, nuclear physics, semiconductor theory and other topics. The finite volume method in its various forms is a space discretization technique for partial differential equations based on the fundamental physical principle of conservation, and recent decades have brought significant advances in the theoretical understanding of the method. Many finite volume methods preserve further qualitative or asymptotic properties, including maximum principles, dissipativity, monotone decay of free energy, and asymptotic stability. Due to these properties, finite volume methods belong to the wider class of compatible discretization methods, which preserve qualitative properties of continuous problems at the discrete l evel. This structural approach to the discretization of partial differential equations becomes particularly important for multiphysics and multiscale applications. The book is useful for researchers, PhD and master’s level students in numerical analysis, scientific computing and related fields such as partial differential equations, as well as for engineers working in numerical modeling and simulations.",Mathematics,530,N/A,0,en

The standard spoken language is used by educated people in their interactions with people from different regions and different social groups, and is also the dialect used in films, plays and the media. This book, a much expanded version of the author s Grammar of Spoken Tamil (1979), is the first such grammar to contain examples both in Tamil script and in transliteration, and the first to be written so as to be accessible to students studying the modern spoken language as well as to linguists and other specialists. The book has benefitted from extensive native-speaker input and the author s own long experience of teaching Tamil to English-speakers.",Foreign Language Study,260,4.5,2,en

He is remembered domestically for the hope and encouragement he instilled in the struggle for civil rights, his support for the freedom riders and for equality for women. Abroad, his memory lives in his handling of the Cold War against an aggressive Soviet Union and such events as the Berlin crisis and Wall, his intervention in the Vietnam War, the invasion of Cuba and Bay of Pigs disaster, the Cuban Missile crisis, and the beginnings of space exploration—all of which tested the young, relatively inexperienced, leader. Includes a detailed chronology detailing John F. Kennedy’s life, family, and work. The A to Z section includes family members, his handling of the Cold War, and such events as the Berlin crisis and Wall, his intervention in the Vietnam War, the invasion of Cuba and Bay of Pigs disaster, the Cuban Missile crisis, and the beginnings of space exploration.

Citation Analysis in Research Evaluation,Henk F. Moed,Springer Science & Business Media,2006-03-30,"This book is written for members of the scholarly research community, and for persons involved in research evaluation and research policy. More specifically, it is directed towards the following four main groups of readers: – All scientists and scholars who have been or will be subjected to a quantitative assessment of research performance using citation analysis. – Research policy makers and managers who wish to become conversant with the basic features of citation analysis, and about its potentialities and limitations. – Members of peer review committees and other evaluators, who consider the use of citation analysis as a tool in their assessments. – Practitioners and students in the field of quantitative science and technology studies, informetrics, and library and information science. Citation analysis involves the construction and application of a series of indicators of the ‘impact’, ‘influence’ or ‘quality’ of scholarly work, derived from citation data, i.e. data on references cited in footnotes or bibliographies of scholarly research publications. Such indicators are applied both in the study of scholarly communication and in the assessment of research performance. The term ‘scholarly’ comprises all domains of science and scholarship, including not only those fields that are normally denoted as science – the natural and life sciences, mathematical and technical sciences – but also social sciences and humanities.",Science,334,N/A,0,en

Argument Structure and Grammatical Relations,"Pirkko Suihkonen, Bernard Comrie, Valery Solovyev",John Benjamins Publishing,2012,"This book is a collection of articles dealing with various aspects of grammatical relations and argument structure in the languages of Europe and North and Central Asia (LENCA). Topics covered with respect to individual languages are: split-intransitivity (Basque), causativization (Agul), transitives and causatives (Korean and Japanese), aspectual domain and quantification (Finnish and Udmurt), head-marking principles (Athabaskan languages), and pragmatics (Eastern Khanty and Xibe). Typology of argument-structure properties of 'give' (LENCA), typology of agreement systems, asymmetry in argument structure, typology of the Amdo Sprachbund, spatial realtors (Northeastern Turkic), core argument patterns (languages of Northern California), and typology of grammatical relations (LENCA) are the topics of articles based on cross-linguistic data. The broad empirical sweep and the fine-tuned theoretical analysis highlight the central role of argument structure and grammatical relations with respect to a plethora of linguistic phenomena.",Language Arts & Disciplines,423,N/A,0,en

To facilitate a detailed development of the theoretical material, the authors reject the traditional historical ""case study"" approach in favor of the theory's logical development, followed by examples that illuminate facets of the theory. The book may be divided into three parts: field analysis, basic electromagnetic theory, and applications. Basic laws and concepts — along with their implications — are thoroughly discussed before detailed mathematical analysis is undertaken. In addition to rigorous treatments of all relevant derivations and proofs, appropriate emphasis is placed upon the physical significance of mathematical operations.",Science,545,N/A,0,en

The non-academic does not want to invest ample time reading the minutia, which they often contained. This book is a quick, non-academic read. First, it tells why it is critical to know about religion, even if you do not practice, are an agnostic, or even an atheist. Corporate America needs to know about religion too since they make policies that affect employees of different beliefs and frequently come under public scrutiny.

XML and Web Technologies for Data Sciences with R,"Deborah Nolan, Duncan Temple Lang",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-11-29,"Web technologies are increasingly relevant to scientists working with data, for both accessing data and creating rich dynamic and interactive displays. The XML and JSON data formats are widely used in Web services, regular Web pages and JavaScript code, and visualization formats such as SVG and KML for Google Earth and Google Maps. In addition, scientists use HTTP and other network protocols to scrape data from Web pages, access REST and SOAP Web Services, and interact with NoSQL databases and text search applications. This book provides a practical hands-on introduction to these technologies, including high-level functions the authors have developed for data scientists. It describes strategies and approaches for extracting data from HTML, XML, and JSON formats and how to programmatically access data from the Web. Along with these general skills, the authors illustrate several applications that are relevant to data scientists, such as reading and writing spreadsheet documents both locally and via Google Docs, creating interactive and dynamic visualizations, displaying spatial-temporal displays with Google Earth, and generating code from descriptions of data structures to read and write data. These topics demonstrate the rich possibilities and opportunities to do new things with these modern technologies. The book contains many examples and case-studies that readers can use directly and adapt to their own work. The authors have focused on the integration of these technologies with the R statistical computing environment. However, the ideas and skills presented here are more general, and statisticians who use other computing environments will also find them relevant to their work.

As a result we have only three review articles in Volume 5. From the beginning of this series it has been our aim, as editors, to achieve variation in the scope, style, and length of individual articles sufficient to match the needs of the individual topic, rather than to restrain authors within rigid limits. It has not been our experience that this flexibility has led to unnecessary exuberance on the part of the authors. We feel that the major articles now entering the series are entirely justified. The article by Professor Delves on ""Variational Techniques in the Nuclear Three-Body Problem"" is an authoritative, definitive article on a subject which forms a cornerstone of nuclear physics. If we start with two body interactions, then the three-nucleon system is, perhaps, the only many nucleon system whose exact description may lie within the scope of human ingenuity.

Alternatives for High-Level Waste Salt Processing at the Savannah River Site,"National Research Council, Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology, Board on Radioactive Waste Management, Committee on Cesium Processing Alternatives for High-Level Waste at the Savannah River Site",National Academies Press,2000-10-30,"The Second World War introduced the world to nuclear weapons and their consequences. Behind the scene of these nuclear weapons and an aspect of their consequences is radioactive waste. Radioactive waste has varying degrees of harmfulness and poses a problem when it comes to storage and disposal. Radioactive waste is usually kept below ground in varying containers, which depend on how radioactive the waste it. High-level radioactive waste (HLW) can be stored in underground carbon-steel tanks. However, radioactive waste must also be further immobilized to ensure our safety. There are several sites in the United States where high-level radioactive waste (HLW) are stored; including the Savannah River Site (SRS), established in 1950 to produce plutonium and tritium isotopes for defense purposes. In order to further immobilize the radioactive waste at this site an in-tank precipitation (ITP) process is utilized. Through this method, the sludge portion of the tank wastes is being removed and immobilized in borosilicate glass for eventual disposal in a geological repository. As a result, a highly alkaline salt, present in both liquid and solid forms, is produced. The salt contains cesium, strontium, actinides such as plutonium and neptunium, and other radionuclides. But is this the best method? The National Research Council (NRC) has empanelled a committee, at the request of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), to provide an independent technical review of alternatives to the discontinued in-tank precipitation (ITP) process for treating the HLW stored in tanks at the SRS. Alternatives for High-Level Waste Salt Processing at the Savannah RIver Site summarizes the finding of the committee which sought to answer 4 questions including: ""Was an appropriately comprehensive set of cesium partitioning alternatives identified and are there other alternatives that should be explored?"" and ""Are there significant barriers to the implementation of any of the preferred alternatives, taking into account their state of development and their ability to be integrated into the existing SRS HLW system?""",Science,154,N/A,0,en

Terrestrial Photosynthesis in a Changing Environment,"Jaume Flexas, Francesco Loreto, Hipólito Medrano",Cambridge University Press,2012-07-19,"Understanding how photosynthesis responds to the environment is crucial for improving plant production and maintaining biodiversity in the context of global change. Covering all aspects of photosynthesis, from basic concepts to methodologies, from the organelle to whole ecosystem levels, this is an integrated guide to photosynthesis in an environmentally dynamic context. Focusing on the ecophysiology of photosynthesis – how photosynthesis varies in time and space, responds and adapts to environmental conditions and differs among species within an evolutionary context – the book features contributions from leaders in the field. The approach is interdisciplinary and the topics covered have applications for ecology, environmental sciences, agronomy, forestry and meteorology. It also addresses applied fields such as climate change, biomass and biofuel production and genetic engineering, making a valuable contribution to our understanding of the impacts of climate change on the primary productivity of the globe and on ecosystem stability.",Science,753,N/A,0,en

Einstein's Theories of Relativity and Gravitation,James Malcolm Bird,N/A,1921,"Einstein's theory of relativity confounded and excited both professional and amateur scientists with its explanation of the intricacies of how the world and the universe truly work, rather than how people wished or believed they worked. His view of relativity dismantled Newton's theory of space and time as absolutes, adding the concept of curved space-time, which deals with the velocity of motion. Einstein explains his theory of physics in a way that was designed not only for scientists with a knowledge of the complicated math involved but for the general reader as well.",Gravitation,382,4.5,152,en

Stability Analysis and Nonlinear Observer Design using Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Models,"Zsófia Lendek, T. M. Guerra, Robert Babuška, Bart De Schutter",Springer,2010-11-26,"Many problems in decision making, monitoring, fault detection, and control require the knowledge of state variables and time-varying parameters that are not directly measured by sensors. In such situations, observers, or estimators, can be employed that use the measured input and output signals along with a dynamic model of the system in order to estimate the unknown states or parameters. An essential requirement in designing an observer is to guarantee the convergence of the estimates to the true values or at least to a small neighborhood around the true values. However, for nonlinear, large-scale, or time-varying systems, the design and tuning of an observer is generally complicated and involves large computational costs. This book provides a range of methods and tools to design observers for nonlinear systems represented by a special type of a dynamic nonlinear model -- the Takagi--Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model. The TS model is a convex combination of affine linear models, which facilitates its stability analysis and observer design by using effective algorithms based on Lyapunov functions and linear matrix inequalities. Takagi--Sugeno models are known to be universal approximators and, in addition, a broad class of nonlinear systems can be exactly represented as a TS system. Three particular structures of large-scale TS models are considered: cascaded systems, distributed systems, and systems affected by unknown disturbances. The reader will find in-depth theoretic analysis accompanied by illustrative examples and simulations of real-world systems. Stability analysis of TS fuzzy systems is addressed in detail. The intended audience are graduate students and researchers both from academia and industry. For newcomers to the field, the book provides a concise introduction dynamic TS fuzzy models along with two methods to construct TS models for a given nonlinear system",Technology & Engineering,204,N/A,0,en

Intelligent Multimedia Communication: Techniques and Applications,"Chang Wen Chen, Zhu Li, Shiguo Lian",Springer Science & Business Media,2011-07-06,"Multimedia data are used more and more widely in human being's life, e.g., videoconferencing, visual telephone, IPTV, etc. Nearly most of the applications need multimedia transmission techniques that send multimedia data from one side to another side and keep the properties of efficiency, robustness and security. Here, the efficiency denotes the time cost of transmission operations, the robustness denotes the ability to survive transmission errors or noises, and the security denotes the protection of the transmitted media content. Recently, various intelligent or innovative techniques are invented, which bring vast performance improvements to practical applications. For example, such content transmission techniques as p2p, sensor network and ad hoc network are constructed, which adaptively use the peers’ properties to improve the network’s resources. Multimedia adaptation techniques can adjust the multimedia data rate in order to compliant with the network’s bandwidth. Scalable encryption techniques can generate the data stream that can be correctly decrypted after bit rate conversion. Ubiquitous multimedia services make the user share any kind of content anywhere. The book includes fourteen chapters highlighting current concepts, issues and emerging technologies. Distinguished scholars from many prominent research institutions around the world contribute to the book. The book covers various aspects, including not only some fundamental knowledge and the latest key techniques, but also typical applications and open issues. For example, the covered topics include the present and future video coding standards, stereo and multiview coding techniques, free-viewpoint TV techniques, wireless broadcasting techniques, media streaming techniques, wireless media transmission techniques and systems, and User-Generated Content sharing.",Mathematics,509,N/A,0,en

The Mediterranean Sea in the Era of Global Change 1,"Christophe Migon, Paul Nival, Antoine Sciandra",John Wiley & Sons,2020-04-28,"Due to its particular characteristics, the Mediterranean Sea is often viewed as a microcosm of the World Ocean. Its proportionally-reduced dimensions and peculiar hydrological circulation render it susceptible to environmental and climatic constraints, which are rapidly evolving. The Mediterranean is therefore an ideal site to examine, in order to better understand a number of key oceanographic phenomena. This is especially true of the Ligurian Sea where, due to its geology, oceanic conditions are found close to the coast. As such, 30 years ago, an offshore time-series site provided a fresh impetus to a long history of marine biology research, which has generated a very important body of data and knowledge. This is the first volume, in a two-volume series, that summarizes this research. Across these two books, the reader will find 13 chapters that examine the geology, physics, chemistry and biology of the Ligurian Sea ? always with the goal of providing key elements of oceanography in a changing world.",Science,238,N/A,0,en

Surface and Defect Properties of Solids,"M W Roberts, John M Thomas",Royal Society of Chemistry,2007-10-31,"Specialist Periodical Reports provide systematic and detailed review coverage of progress in the major areas of chemical research. Written by experts in their specialist fields the series creates a unique service for the active research chemist, supplying regular critical in-depth accounts of progress in particular areas of chemistry. For over 90 years The Royal Society of Chemistry and its predecessor, the Chemical Society, have been publishing reports charting developments in chemistry, which originally took the form of Annual Reports. However, by 1967 the whole spectrum of chemistry could no longer be contained within one volume and the series Specialist Periodical Reports was born. The Annual Reports themselves still existed but were divided into two, and subsequently three, volumes covering Inorganic, Organic and Physical Chemistry. For more general coverage of the highlights in chemistry they remain a 'must'. Since that time the SPR series has altered according to the fluctuating degree of activity in various fields of chemistry. Some titles have remained unchanged, while others have altered their emphasis along with their titles; some have been combined under a new name whereas others have had to be discontinued. The current list of Specialist Periodical Reports can be seen on the inside flap of this volume.",Technology & Engineering,212,N/A,0,en

Ambivalent Engagement,Joseph Chinyong Liow,Brookings Institution Press,2017-07-11,"The paradox of U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia The Obama administration's pivot-to-Asia policy establishes an important place for Southeast Asia in U.S. foreign policy. But Washington's attention to the region has fluctuated dramatically, from the intense intervention of the cold war era to near neglect in more recent years. As a consequence, countries in Southeast Asia worry that the United States once again will become distracted by other problems and disengage from the region. This book written by an astute observer of the region and U.S. policy casts light on the sources of these anxieties. A main consideration is that it still is not clear how Southeast Asia fits into U.S. strategy for Asia and the broader world. Is the region central to U.S. policymaking, or an afterthought? Ambivalent Engagement highlights a dilemma that is becoming increasingly conspicuous and problematic. Southeast Asia continues to rely on the United States to play an active role in the region even though it is an external power. But the countries of Southeast Asia have very different views about precisely what role the United States should play. The consequences of this ambivalence will grow in importance with the expanding role of yet another outside power, China.",Political Science,298,N/A,0,en

High-Risk Breast Cancer,"Joseph Ragaz, Irving M. Ariel",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The most meaningful reward to clinicians and researchers is the absence of recurrent malignancy in their patients. While in some patients the disease will be cured by resection alone, in other similarly staged cases the disease will recur despite adequate loco regional and systemic therapies. Hence, risk assessment is a complex issue with many related or unrelated prognostic factors determining outcome. The purpose of this volume is to review some of the most relevant prognostic factors of newly diagnosed breast cancer, focusing on fea tures determining the magnitude of risk. The ultimate value of establishing the significance of each prognostic factor in a given patient will be the resulting ability to plan individu alized therapies for patients at different risk of recurrence at the time of diagnosis. To secure the maximum benefit for high-risk patients, while avoiding undue toxicity in those with low-risk lesions, a well-integrated analysis of all known prognostic factors will be essential in the early postdiagnos tic period. In addition to well-established staging criteria such as axillary nodes, tumor size, receptors, scanning and radiographic examinations, the more sophisticated labora tory techniques, as discussed by several authors herein, will playa crucial role in risk assessment. Most of them, - ploidy determination, oncogenes, tumor markers, monoclonal anti bodies, growth factors, etc. -are presently available in only a minority of treatment centers.",Medical,375,N/A,0,en

Conceptual Structure in Lexical Items,Kristel Proost,John Benjamins Publishing,2007-11-07,"This volume deals with the occurrence of lexical gaps in the domain of linguistic action verbs. Though these constitute a considerable proportion of the verb inventory of many languages, not all concepts of verbal communication may be expressed by lexical items in any particular one of them. Introducing a conceptual system which allows gaps to be searched for systematically, this study shows which concepts of verbal communication are and which are not lexicalised in English, German and Dutch. The lexicalisation patterns observed shed light on the way in which verbal behaviour is conceptualised in a particular speech community. To complete the picture, the volume also addresses the question of whether communication concepts which may not be expressed by verbs may be lexicalised by fixed multiword expressions.",Language Arts & Disciplines,322,N/A,0,en

Privacy in Context,Helen Nissenbaum,Stanford University Press,2009-11-24,"Privacy is one of the most urgent issues associated with information technology and digital media. This book claims that what people really care about when they complain and protest that privacy has been violated is not the act of sharing information itself—most people understand that this is crucial to social life —but the inappropriate, improper sharing of information. Arguing that privacy concerns should not be limited solely to concern about control over personal information, Helen Nissenbaum counters that information ought to be distributed and protected according to norms governing distinct social contexts—whether it be workplace, health care, schools, or among family and friends. She warns that basic distinctions between public and private, informing many current privacy policies, in fact obscure more than they clarify. In truth, contemporary information systems should alarm us only when they function without regard for social norms and values, and thereby weaken the fabric of social life.",Law,304,N/A,0,en

Concert Life in Nineteenth-Century New Orleans,John H. Baron,LSU Press,2013-12-09,"During the nineteenth century, New Orleans thrived as the epicenter of classical music in America, outshining New York, Boston, and San Francisco before the Civil War and rivaling them thereafter. While other cities offered few if any operatic productions, New Orleans gained renown for its glorious opera seasons. Resident composers, performers, publishers, teachers, instrument makers, and dealers fed the public's voracious cultural appetite. Tourists came from across the United States to experience the city's thriving musical scene. Until now, no study has offered a thorough history of this exciting and momentous era in American musical performance history. John H. Baron's Concert Life in Nineteenth-Century New Orleans impressively fills that gap. Baron's exhaustively researched work details all aspects of New Orleans's nineteenth-century musical renditions, including the development of orchestras; the surrounding social, political, and economic conditions; and the individuals who collectively made the city a premier destination for world-class musicians. Baron includes a wide-ranging chronological discussion of nearly every documented concert that took place in the Crescent City in the 1800s, establishing Concert Life in Nineteenth-Century New Orleans as an indispensable reference volume.",Music,645,N/A,0,en

Crying in H Mart,Michelle Zauner,Vintage,2021-04-20,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • From the indie rock sensation known as Japanese Breakfast, an unforgettable memoir about family, food, grief, love, and growing up Korean American—“in losing her mother and cooking to bring her back to life, Zauner became herself” (NPR). • CELEBRATING OVER ONE YEAR ON THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER LIST In this exquisite story of family, food, grief, and endurance, Michelle Zauner proves herself far more than a dazzling singer, songwriter, and guitarist. With humor and heart, she tells of growing up one of the few Asian American kids at her school in Eugene, Oregon; of struggling with her mother's particular, high expectations of her; of a painful adolescence; of treasured months spent in her grandmother's tiny apartment in Seoul, where she and her mother would bond, late at night, over heaping plates of food. As she grew up, moving to the East Coast for college, finding work in the restaurant industry, and performing gigs with her fledgling band--and meeting the man who would become her husband--her Koreanness began to feel ever more distant, even as she found the life she wanted to live. It was her mother's diagnosis of terminal cancer, when Michelle was twenty-five, that forced a reckoning with her identity and brought her to reclaim the gifts of taste, language, and history her mother had given her. Vivacious and plainspoken, lyrical and honest, Zauner's voice is as radiantly alive on the page as it is onstage. Rich with intimate anecdotes that will resonate widely, and complete with family photos, Crying in H Mart is a book to cherish, share, and reread.",Biography & Autobiography,257,4,1,en

Essential Radio Astronomy,"James J. Condon, Scott M. Ransom",Princeton University Press,2016-04-05,"The ideal text for a one-semester course in radio astronomy Essential Radio Astronomy is the only textbook on the subject specifically designed for a one-semester introductory course for advanced undergraduates or graduate students in astronomy and astrophysics. It starts from first principles in order to fill gaps in students' backgrounds, make teaching easier for professors who are not expert radio astronomers, and provide a useful reference to the essential equations used by practitioners. This unique textbook reflects the fact that students of multiwavelength astronomy typically can afford to spend only one semester studying the observational techniques particular to each wavelength band. Essential Radio Astronomy presents only the most crucial concepts—succinctly and accessibly. It covers the general principles behind radio telescopes, receivers, and digital backends without getting bogged down in engineering details. Emphasizing the physical processes in radio sources, the book's approach is shaped by the view that radio astrophysics owes more to thermodynamics than electromagnetism. Proven in the classroom and generously illustrated throughout, Essential Radio Astronomy is an invaluable resource for students and researchers alike. The only textbook specifically designed for a one-semester course in radio astronomy Starts from first principles Makes teaching easier for astronomy professors who are not expert radio astronomers Emphasizes the physical processes in radio sources Covers the principles behind radio telescopes and receivers Provides the essential equations and fundamental constants used by practitioners Supplementary website includes lecture notes, problem sets, exams, and links to interactive demonstrations An online illustration package is available to professors",Science,376,N/A,0,en

Heat Wave,Eric Klinenberg,University of Chicago Press,2015-05-06,"The “compelling” story behind the 1995 Chicago weather disaster that killed hundreds—and what it revealed about our broken society (Boston Globe). On July 13, 1995, Chicagoans awoke to a blistering day in which the temperature would reach 106 degrees. The heat index—how the temperature actually feels on the body—would hit 126. When the heat wave broke a week later, city streets had buckled; records for electrical use were shattered; and power grids had failed, leaving residents without electricity for up to two days. By July 20, over seven hundred people had perished—twenty times the number of those struck down by Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Heat waves kill more Americans than all other natural disasters combined. Until now, no one could explain either the overwhelming number or the heartbreaking manner of the deaths resulting from the 1995 Chicago heat wave. Meteorologists and medical scientists have been unable to account for the scale of the trauma, and political officials have puzzled over the sources of the city’s vulnerability. In Heat Wave, Eric Klinenberg takes us inside the anatomy of the metropolis to conduct what he calls a “social autopsy,” examining the social, political, and institutional organs of the city that made this urban disaster so much worse than it ought to have been. He investigates why some neighborhoods experienced greater mortality than others, how city government responded, and how journalists, scientists, and public officials reported and explained these events. Through years of fieldwork, interviews, and research, he uncovers the surprising and unsettling forms of social breakdown that contributed to this human catastrophe as hundreds died alone behind locked doors and sealed windows, out of contact with friends, family, community groups, and public agencies. As this incisive and gripping account demonstrates, the widening cracks in the social foundations of American cities made visible by the 1995 heat wave remain in play in America’s cities today—and we ignore them at our peril. Includes photos and a new preface on meeting the challenges of climate change in urban centers “Heat Wave is not so much a book about weather, as it is about the calamitous consequences of forgetting our fellow citizens. . . . A provocative, fascinating book, one that applies to much more than weather disasters.” —Chicago Sun-Times “It’s hard to put down Heat Wave without believing you’ve just read a tale of slow murder by public policy.” —Salon “A classic. I can’t recommend it enough.” —Chris Hayes",Nature,342,N/A,0,en

Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence,"National Research Council, Federal Judicial Center, Policy and Global Affairs, Committee on Science, Technology, and Law, Committee on the Development of the Third Edition of the Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence",National Academies Press,2011-10-26,"The Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence, Third Edition, assists judges in managing cases involving complex scientific and technical evidence by describing the basic tenets of key scientific fields from which legal evidence is typically derived and by providing examples of cases in which that evidence has been used. First published in 1994 by the Federal Judicial Center, the Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence has been relied upon in the legal and academic communities and is often cited by various courts and others. Judges faced with disputes over the admissibility of scientific and technical evidence refer to the manual to help them better understand and evaluate the relevance, reliability and usefulness of the evidence being proffered. The manual is not intended to tell judges what is good science and what is not. Instead, it serves to help judges identify issues on which experts are likely to differ and to guide the inquiry of the court in seeking an informed resolution of the conflict. The core of the manual consists of a series of chapters (reference guides) on various scientific topics, each authored by an expert in that field. The topics have been chosen by an oversight committee because of their complexity and frequency in litigation. Each chapter is intended to provide a general overview of the topic in lay terms, identifying issues that will be useful to judges and others in the legal profession. They are written for a non-technical audience and are not intended as exhaustive presentations of the topic. Rather, the chapters seek to provide judges with the basic information in an area of science, to allow them to have an informed conversation with the experts and attorneys.",Political Science,1034,4.5,4,en

The Subject's Point of View,Katalin Farkas,OUP Oxford,2010-08-19,"Descartes's philosophy has had a considerable influence on the modern conception of the mind, but many think that this influence has been largely negative. The main project of The Subject's Point of View is to argue that discarding certain elements of the Cartesian conception would be much more difficult than critics seem to allow, since it is tied to our understanding of basic notions, including the criteria for what makes someone a person, or one of us. The crucial feature of the Cartesian view defended here is not dualism - which is not adopted - but internalism. Internalism is opposed to the widely accepted externalist thesis, which states that some mental features constitutively depend on certain features of our physical and social environment. In contrast, this book defends the minority internalist view, which holds that the mind is autonomous, and though it is obviously affected by the environment, this influence is merely contingent and does not delimit what is thinkable in principle. Defenders of the externalist view often present their theory as the most thoroughgoing criticism of the Cartesian conception of the mind; Katalin Farkas offers a defence of an uncompromising internalist Cartesian conception.",Philosophy,245,N/A,0,en

A Grammar of Gaagudju,Mark Harvey,Walter de Gruyter,2011-07-22,"Gaagudju is a previously undescribed and now nearly extinct language of northern Australia. This grammar provides an overall description of the language. Australian languages generally show a high degree of structural similarity to one another. Gaagudju conforms to some of the common Australian patterns, yet diverges significantly from others. Thus while it has a standard Australian phonological inventory, its prosodic systems differ from those of most Australian languages, with stressed and unstressed syllables showing marked differences in realisation. Like many northern languages, it has complex systems of both prefixation and suffixation to nominals and verbs. Prefixation provides information about nominal classification (4 classes), mood, and pronominal cross-reference (Subjects, Objects, and Indirect Objects). Suffixation provides information about case, tense, and aspect. As in many languages, there is a clear distinction between productive and unproductive morphology. Gaagudju differs from most Australian languages in that a considerable amount of its morphology is unproductive, showing complex and irregular allomorphic variation. Gaagudju is like most Australian languages in that it may be described as a free word order language. However, word order is not totally free and strictly ordered phrasal compounding structures are significant (e.g. in the formation of denominal verbs).",Language Arts & Disciplines,517,N/A,0,en

Philosophy in an Age of Science,Hilary Putnam,Harvard University Press,2012-04-17,"Hilary Putnam's unceasing self-criticism has led to the frequent changes of mind he is famous for, but his thinking is also marked by considerable continuity. A simultaneous interest in science and ethicsÑunusual in the current climate of contentionÑhas long characterized his thought. In Philosophy in an Age of Science, Putnam collects his papers for publicationÑhis first volume in almost two decades. Mario De Caro and David Macarthur's introduction identifies central themes to help the reader negotiate between Putnam past and Putnam present: his critique of logical positivism; his enduring aspiration to be realist about rational normativity; his anti-essentialism about a range of central philosophical notions; his reconciliation of the scientific worldview and the humanistic tradition; and his movement from reductive scientific naturalism to liberal naturalism. Putnam returns here to some of his first enthusiasms in philosophy, such as logic, mathematics, and quantum mechanics. The reader is given a glimpse, too, of ideas currently in development on the subject of perception. Putnam's work, contributing to a broad range of philosophical inquiry, has been said to represent a Òhistory of recent philosophy in outline.Ó Here it also delineates a possible future.",Philosophy,672,N/A,0,en

"The WTO Dispute Settlement System, 1995-2003","Federico Ortino, Ernst-Ulrich Petersmann",Kluwer Law International B.V.,2004-01-01,"In its ten years of existence, the World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement system has continued to differentiate itself in many ways from more conventional international judicial proceedings such as those before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) or regional integration courts. The regular participation of third parties, the emphasis at all levels of the ?ordinary meaning? of the text of WTO rules, and the raft of proposed amendments to the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) all characterise WTO jurisprudence. In twenty-six incisive contributions, this book covers both the ?legislative? and ?(quasi) judicial? activities encompassed by the WTO dispute settlement system. Essays concerned with rules emphasise proposed improvements and clarifications in such areas as special and differential treatment of less-developed countries, surveillance of implementation, compensation, and suspension of concessions. Other contributions discuss such jurisprudential and practical issues as discrimination, trade-related environmental measures, subsidies and countervailing measures, and trade-related intellectual property rights. The authors refer frequently to the panel, Appellate Body and arbitration reports, a chronological list of which appears as an annex. The contributors include WTO arbitrators, members of the WTO Appellate Body, WTO panelists, and academics from a broad spectrum of countries engaged as legal advisers by the WTO, by governments, or by non-governmental organisations. More than a mere snapshot of the current status of the WTO dispute settlement system, this outstanding work represents a comprehensive analysis that brings a fast-moving and crucially significant body of international law into sharp focus.",Law,632,N/A,0,en

I knew that hiring Poppy could be a mistake, but what choice did I have? Nobody else wants to work with a King—my crime lord father made sure of that before my brothers and I sent him to prison.

Sociopolitical Perspectives on Language Policy and Planning in the USA,"Thom Huebner, Kathryn A. Davis",John Benjamins Publishing,1999-11-15,"This volume is the result of a colloquium on socio-political dimensions of language policy and language planning held at the 1997 American Association of Applied Linguistics (AAAL) Conference. The focus is on language planning and policy in the USA, but the issues raised will be applicable to other parts of the world as well. Three broad issues are addressed: general aspects, case studies dealing with certain languages or ethnic groups, and language planning in practice. The first, general, part, provides a historical analysis of language planning and language policy in the US, and proceeds to deal with maintenance and loss of indigenous languages, and the constraints imposed by current policies and how these constraints can be effectively dealt with. The second part contains a number of case studies. It discusses aspects of planning policies pertaining to pidgin languages, gestural languages used by the deaf (ASL) and constraints in foreign language education; this part also raises issues relating to ethnic groups, concentrating on the position of Mexicans and Puerto Ricans in the US. In the third part some practical issues are raised by looking into the role of language and culture in teaching reading, foreign language policy in higher education, Hawaiian language regenisis, and gender neutralization in American English. The book is a tribute to Charlene Junko Sato, a sociolinguist and a language activist. She died in 1996 and will be remembered for her work not only in linguistics, but also for her dedication in advancing Hawaiian Pidgin, influencing language policy through various publications and court-room appearances.",Language Arts & Disciplines,384,N/A,0,en

In the Ring,Robert S. Bennett,Crown,2008-02-19,"Robert S. Bennett has been a lawyer for more than forty years. In that time, he’s taken on dozens of high-proﬁle and groundbreaking cases and emerged as the go-to guy for the nation’s elite. Bob Bennett gained international recognition as one of America’s best lawyers for leading the defense of President Bill Clinton in the Paula Jones case. But long before, and ever since, representing a sitting president, he has fought for justice for many famous (and some now infamous) clients. This is his story. Born in Brooklyn and an amateur boxer in his youth, Bennett has always brought his street ﬁghter’s mentality to the courtroom. His case history is a who’s who of ﬁgures who have dominated legal headlines: super lobbyist Tommy Corcoran, former Secretaries of Defense Clark Clifford and Caspar Weinberger, Marge Schott, and, most recently, New York Times reporter Judith Miller and former World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz. Bennett also served as special counsel to the Senate during the ABSCAM and Keating Five scandals and was a leading member of the National Review Board for the Protection of Children & Young People, created by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops in response to the sex abuse allegations. Taking the reader deep within his most intriguing and difﬁcult cases, In the Ring shows how Bennett has argued for what’s right, won for his clients, and effected his share of change on the system.

The Ashtray,Errol Morris,University of Chicago Press,2018-05-16,"Filmmaker Errol Morris offers his perspective on the world and his powerful belief in the necessity of truth. In 1972, philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn threw an ashtray at Errol Morris. This book is the result. At the time, Morris was a graduate student. Now we know him as one of the most celebrated and restlessly probing filmmakers of our time, the creator of such classics of documentary investigation as The Thin Blue Line and The Fog of War. Kuhn, meanwhile, was—and, posthumously, remains—a star in his field, the author of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, a landmark book that has sold well over a million copies and introduced the concept of “paradigm shifts” to the larger culture. And Morris thought the idea was bunk. The Ashtray tells why—and in doing so, it makes a powerful case for Morris’s way of viewing the world, and the centrality to that view of a fundamental conception of the necessity of truth. “For me,” Morris writes, “truth is about the relationship between language and the world: a correspondence idea of truth.” He has no patience for philosophical systems that aim for internal coherence and disdain the world itself. Morris is after bigger game: he wants to establish as clearly as possible what we know and can say about the world, reality, history, our actions and interactions. It’s the fundamental desire that animates his filmmaking, whether he’s probing Robert McNamara about Vietnam or the oddball owner of a pet cemetery. Truth may be slippery, but that doesn’t mean we have to grease its path of escape through philosophical evasions. Rather, Morris argues powerfully, it is our duty to do everything we can to establish and support it. In a time when truth feels ever more embattled, under siege from political lies and virtual lives alike, The Ashtray is a bracing reminder of its value, delivered by a figure who has, over decades, uniquely earned our trust through his commitment to truth. No Morris fan should miss it.",Philosophy,224,N/A,0,en

"I, Me, Mine",Béatrice Longuenesse,Oxford University Press,2016-12-22,"Béatrice Longuenesse presents an original exploration of our understanding of ourselves and the way we talk about ourselves. In the first part of the book she discusses contemporary analyses of our use of 'I' in language and thought, and compares them to Kant's account of self-consciousness, especially the type of self-consciousness expressed in the proposition 'I think.' According to many contemporary philosophers, necessarily, any instance of our use of 'I' is backed by our consciousness of our own body. For Kant, in contrast, 'I think' just expresses our consciousness of being engaged in bringing rational unity into the contents of our mental states. In the second part of the book, Longuenesse analyzes the details of Kant's view and argues that contemporary discussions in philosophy and psychology stand to benefit from Kant's insights into self-consciousness and the unity of consciousness. The third and final part of the book outlines similarities between Kant's view of the structure of mental life grounding our uses of 'I' in 'I think' and in the moral 'I ought to,' on the one hand; and Freud's analysis of the organizations of mental processes he calls 'ego' and 'superego' on the other hand. Longuenesse argues that Freudian metapsychology offers a path to a naturalization of Kant's transcendental view of the mind. It offers a developmental account of the normative capacities that ground our uses of 'I,' which Kant thought could not be accounted for without appealing to a world of pure intelligences, distinct from the empirical, natural world of physical entities.",Philosophy,278,N/A,0,en

What makes some workers show up on time, perform admirably, work enthusiastically, get along with coworkers, and make conscientious decisions? That supreme quality is honesty, and its the character equivalent of the good-worker gene. In Hire Honesty, author Bill McConnell explains how good-worker genes affect the productivity, compatibility, and profitability of your business. Then he provides details and specific methods for screening, selecting, and managing employees so they will become and remain productive and contented in their jobs. He describes the tools needed for effective interviewing and hiring and he shows employers how to use them. Employers will learn about: honesty as the foundation of exceptional job performance; good-worker genes; managed conversations; all-about-you interviews; and trust as the principle motivator for honest workers. McConnell, who spent twenty-eight years as CEO of Patusan Trading Company, a wholesaler and importer of oriental rugs, and five years as general manager of Triple Creek Ranch, named the worlds top-ranked luxury hotel in 2014, developed and implemented the techniques of Hire Honesty in settings as diverse as remote Himalayan villages and elite American resorts.

"The Good, the Bad & the Difference",Randy Cohen,Harmony,2003-03-25,"The man behind the New York Times Magazine’s immensely popular column “The Ethicist”–syndicated in newspapers across the United States and Canada as “Everyday Ethics”–casts an eye on today’s manners and mores with a provocative, thematic collection of advice on how to be good in the real world. Every week in his column on ethics, Randy Cohen takes on conundrums presented in letters from perplexed people who want to do the right thing (or hope to get away with doing the wrong thing), and responds with a skillful blend of moral authority and humor. Cohen’s wisdom and witticisms have now been collected in The Good, the Bad & the Difference, a collection of his columns as wise and funny as a combination of “Dear Abby,” Plato, and Mel Brooks. The columns are supplemented with second thoughts on (and sometimes complete reversals of) his original replies, follow-up notes on how his advice affected the actions of various letter writers, reactions from readers both pro and con, and observations from such “guest ethicists” as David Eggers and the author’s mom. Each chapter also features an “Ethics Pop Quiz,” and readers will be invited to post their answers on the book’s Web site. The best of them will appear in a future paperback edition of the book. The Good, the Bad & the Difference is divided into seven sections: •Civic Life (what we do in public) •Family Life (what we do at home) •Social Life (what we do in other people’s homes) •Commercial Life (what we do in situations where money is a factor) •Medical Life (the rights and obligations of patients and caregivers) •Work Life (ethics for the professional sphere) •School Life (moral questions from and about kids) Each section provides a window into how we live today, shedding light on the ways in which a more ethical approach to the decisions we make, and to our daily behavior, can make a big difference in how we feel about ourselves tomorrow.",Philosophy,306,N/A,0,en

Logical Form and Language,"Gerhard Preyer, Georg Peter",Oxford University Press,2002,"One of the central issues of analytic philosophy and especially the theory of language is the concept of logical form. As typically understood this concept covers investigations into universal logical features underlying languages. However, from Frege and Russell onwards logical form analysts were no longer confined to such narrow linguistic perspectives. For them, investigating the logical form of language took the wider philosophical perspective of trying to understand language as our principal means for representing the world. From Russell's theory of definite descriptions to Davidson's truth-theoretical analyses of adverbial modification, citation, and reported speech, to lay open the logical structures underlying language is seen as a way of revealing the structure and features of the thereby represented world. Seventeen specially written essays by eminent philosophers and linguists appear for the first time in this anthology. Logical Form and Language brings together exciting new contributions from diverse points of view, which illuminate the lively current debate about this topic.",Language Arts & Disciplines,534,N/A,0,en

Bureaucratic Language in Government and Business,Roger W. Shuy,Georgetown University Press,1998-07-01,"Plunging into the verbal quagmire of official language used by bureaucrats in both government and business, distinguished linguist Roger W. Shuy develops new techniques based on linguistic principles to improve their communication with the public. Shuy presents nine case studies that reveal representative problems with bureaucratic language. He characterizes the traits of bureaucratic language candidly, though somewhat sympathetically, and he describes how linguists can provide bureaucrats with both the tools for communicating more clearly and also the authority to implement these changes. Drawing on documents cited in class action lawsuits brought against the Social Security Administration and Medicare, Shuy offers a detailed linguistic analysis of these agencies’ problems with written and oral communication, and he outlines a training program he developed for government writers to solve them. Moving on to the private sector, Shuy analyzes examples of the ways that businesses such as car dealerships, real estate and insurance companies, and commercial manufacturers sometimes fail to communicate effectively. Although typically bureaucracies change their use of language only when a lawsuit threatens, Shuy argues that clarity in communication is a cost effective strategy for preventing or at least reducing litigation. Bureaucratic Language in Government and Business explains why bureaucratic language can be so hard to understand and what can be done about it.",Language Arts & Disciplines,218,N/A,0,en

Formation Control,Hyo-Sung Ahn,Springer,2019-03-29,"This monograph introduces recent developments in formation control of distributed-agent systems. Eschewing the traditional concern with the dynamic characteristics of individual agents, the book proposes a treatment that studies the formation control problem in terms of interactions among agents including factors such as sensing topology, communication and actuation topologies, and computations. Keeping pace with recent technological advancements in control, communications, sensing and computation that have begun to bring the applications of distributed-systems theory out of the industrial sphere and into that of day-to-day life, this monograph provides distributed control algorithms for a group of agents that may behave together. Unlike traditional control laws that usually require measurements with respect to a global coordinate frame and communications between a centralized operation center and agents, this book provides control laws that require only relative measurements and communications between agents without interaction with a centralized operator. Since the control algorithms presented in this book do not require any global sensing and any information exchanges with a centralized operation center, they can be realized in a fully distributed way, which significantly reduces the operation and implementation costs of a group of agents. Formation Control will give both students and researchers interested in pursuing this field a good grounding on which to base their work.",Technology & Engineering,368,N/A,0,en
"Experimental Philosophy, Rationalism, and Naturalism","Eugen Fischer, John Collins",Routledge,2015-04-24,"Experimental philosophy is one of the most exciting and controversial philosophical movements today. This book explores how it is reshaping thought about philosophical method. Experimental philosophy imports experimental methods and findings from psychology into philosophy. These fresh resources can be used to develop and defend both armchair methods and naturalist approaches, on an empirical basis. This outstanding collection brings together leading proponents of this new meta-philosophical naturalism, from within and beyond experimental philosophy. They explore how the empirical study of philosophically relevant intuition and cognition transforms traditional philosophical approaches and facilitates fresh ones. Part One examines important uses of traditional ""armchair"" methods which are not threatened by experimental work and develops empirically informed accounts of such methods that can potentially stand up to experimental scrutiny. Part Two analyses different uses and rationales of experimental methods in several areas of philosophy and addresses the key methodological challenges to experimental philosophy: Do its experiments target the intuitions that matter in philosophy? And how can they support conclusions about the rights and wrongs of philosophical views? Essential reading for students of experimental philosophy and metaphilosophy, Experimental Philosophy, Rationalism, and Naturalism will also interest students and researchers in related areas such as epistemology and the philosophies of language, perception, mind and action, science and psychology.",Philosophy,376,N/A,0,en

Through an examination of the language of everyday conversation, interviews, consultations, task-based dialogues, football commentaries, radio-play productions and intercultural conversations, the book demonstrates the effect of informational, discourse-external and personal factors on form and shows how speakers position themselves in relation to their discourse, orchestrate different tasks, move between different 'voices', and negotiate meaning.

Natural and Artifactual Objects in Contemporary Metaphysics,Richard Davies,Bloomsbury Publishing,2019-01-10,"What is an object? How do we look at them? Why do they matter? This collection presents a lively, timely discussion of natural and artifactual objects, considering the relationship between them from a range of philosophical perspectives, including the philosophy of biology, the metaphysics of space and the philosophy of perception. Beginning from the starting point that natural objects are bona fide, endowed with some natural border between themselves and everything else, while artifactual objects depend on the observation of tacit conventions and may include the ordinary objects of everyday life, this volume explores, contextualises and interrogates objects. Contributors discuss a variety of objects including physical, scientific and mental ones, as well as things that appear to question the limits of object-hood, including holes, Quinean 'posits' and language. The very first collection to address this growing topic within analytic philosophy, Natural and Artifactual Objects in Contemporary Metaphysics represents a highly original work, showcasing some of the most important and influential philosophers working in Europe today.",Philosophy,245,N/A,0,en

For ""classic"" linguistics there appears to be a need for a review of the state of the art which will provide a reference base for the rapid advances in research undertaken from a variety of theoretical standpoints, while in the more recent branches of communication science the handbooks will give researchers both an verview and orientation. To attain these objectives, the series will aim for a standard comparable to that of the leading handbooks in other disciplines, and to this end will strive for comprehensiveness, theoretical explicitness, reliable documentation of data and findings, and up-to-date methodology. The editors, both of the series and of the individual volumes, and the individual contributors, are committed to this aim. The languages of publication are English, German, and French. The main aim of the series is to provide an appropriate account of the state of the art in the various areas of linguistics and communication science covered by each of the various handbooks; however no inflexible pre-set limits will be imposed on the scope of each volume. The series is open-ended, and can thus take account of further developments in the field. This conception, coupled with the necessity of allowing adequate time for each volume to be prepared with the necessary care, means that there is no set time-table for the publication of the whole series. Each volume will be a self-contained work, complete in itself. The order in which the handbooks are published does not imply any rank ordering, but is determined by the way in which the series is organized; the editor of the whole series enlist a competent editor for each individual volume. Once the principal editor for a volume has been found, he or she then has a completely free hand in the choice of co-editors and contributors. The editors plan each volume independently of the others, being governed only by general formal principles. The series editor only intervene where questions of delineation between individual volumes are concerned. It is felt that this (modus operandi) is best suited to achieving the objectives of the series, namely to give a competent account of the present state of knowledge and of the perception of the problems in the area covered by each volume.",Language Arts & Disciplines,873,N/A,0,en

Enzyme-Mediated Immunoassay,"H.M. Lenhoff, That T. Ngo",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"T. T. Ngo and H. M. Lenhoff Department of Developmental and Cell Biology University of California, Irvine, CA 92717 In 1959, Yalow and Berson used insulin labeled with radioactive iodine to develop a quantitative immunological method for determining the amount of insulin in human plasma. Their method depends upon ~ competition between insulin labeled with radioactive iodine (II 1) and unlabeled insulin from plasma for a fixed and limited number of specific binding sites on the antibody to insulin. The amount of the labeled insulin bound to the antibody is inversely proportional to the amount of insulin in the plasma sample. Their method, which is so elegantly simple in concept, is made possible by the ability to detect with ease extremely low levels of radioactivity, and by the exquisite specificity of an antibody capable of specifically binding the analyte. Such a combination of sensitivity and specificity is the basis of this versatile analytical tool called radioimmunoassay (RIA). Twelve years later, Engvall and Perlmann (1971) and Van Weemen and Schuurs (1971) independently introduced the use of enzymes as another category of sensitive and even more versatile labels for use in immunoassays. Engvall and Perlmann (l971) coined the term ELISA, which stands for Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay.",Science,481,N/A,0,en

This collection is marked by an incredible diversity of genres, styles, and themes, reflecting the wide-ranging experiences and historical contexts of its authors. From the existential questions pursued by Dostoevsky and the introspective journey of Proust, to the pioneering adventures penned by Verne and the critical social commentary of Dickens, this anthology showcases the multifaceted nature of human thought and expression. Standout pieces within the volume capture the essence of their time while also speaking to universal themes of love, struggle, freedom, and morality, making the anthology a vibrant tapestry of human experience. The contributors to this volume represent a whos who of historical literary giants, each bringing their unique voice to the collective table. Authors such as Jane Austen and Charlotte Brontë offer keen insights into the gender dynamics of their time, while the visionary science fiction of H.G. Wells and the dark romanticism of Edgar Allan Poe present radical departures from the realist tradition, challenging readers to explore new psychological and societal frontiers. The anthology, thereby, not only aligns with various historical, cultural, and literary movements but also weaves a dialogue between these movements, highlighting the evolution of narrative and thought across ages and geographies. These varied voices together enrich the readers understanding of the broad spectrum of human expression and the complexity of the human condition. 90 Masterpieces of World Literature (Vol.I) is an essential volume for anyone seeking to explore the depth and breadth of literary genius across the ages. It offers a unique opportunity to delve into the works that have not only defined but also continuously reshaped the landscape of world literature. Readers are encouraged to immerse themselves in the richness of this collection, discovering within its pages a world of ideas, stories, and perspectives that are at once enlightening, provocative, and boundlessly imaginative. This anthology serves as both a gateway and a guide for those eager to embark on a comprehensive literary journey, making it an invaluable addition to any personal library.",Literary Criticism,19155,N/A,0,en

"Reference Data on Atoms, Molecules, and Ions","A.A. Radzig, B.M. Smirnov",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This reference book contains information about the structure and properties of atomic and molecular particles, as well as some of the nuclear parameters. It includes data which can be of use when studying atomic and molecular processes in the physics of gases, chemistry of gases and gas optics, in plasma physics and plasma chemistry, in physical chemistry and radiation chemistry, in geophysics, astrophysics, solid-state physics and a variety of cross-discipli nary fields of science and technology. Our aim was to collect carefully selected and estimated numerical values for a wide circle of microscopic parameters in a relatively ""not thick"" book. These values are of constant use in the work of practical investigators. In essence, the book represents a substantially revised and extended edi tion of our reference book published in Russian in 1980. Two main reasons made it necessary to rework the material. On the one hand, a great deal of new high-quality data has appeared in the past few years and furthermore we have enlisted many sources of information previously inaccessible to us. On the other hand, we have tried to insert extensive information on new, rapidly progressing branches of physical research, such as multiply charged ions, Rydberg atoms, van der Waals and excimer molecules, complex ions, etc. All this brings us to the very edge of studies being carried out in the field.",Science,475,N/A,0,en

PERCEPTION in Architecture,"Miriam Mlecek, Claudia Perren",Cambridge Scholars Publishing,2015-02-27,"Definitions of space are as diverse as the disciplines in which it plays a fundamental role; from science and philosophy to art and architecture, each field’s perception of space is often simplified or reduced. This consequently denies access to ‘new spaces’, whose definitions and perspectives, strategies and impacts on human perception are rarely considered in any cohesive manner. This is where the Aedes Network Campus Berlin (ANCB) programme ‘No Space Without Traits’ came in: particularly through artistic approaches, it aimed to open doors into spatial worlds that until now have remained closed. The symposium ‘PERCEPTION in Architecture. HERE and NOW’ was part of this programme and invited critical and comprehensive contributions by academics, artists, architects, designers and curators. These presentations are brought together in this volume to reflect upon new spatial concepts and thus access ‘new spaces’ of perception in architecture. The symposium stimulated a discourse focused on spaces as a collective entity, notions of spatial truth, the multiplicity of experience, and Wahrnehmnungsapparate, as well as physical, visual, acoustic and virtual manifestations of space in relation to social, cultural, historical and political forces.",Architecture,223,N/A,0,en

Radiative Transfer,Hélène Frisch,Springer Nature,2022-05-26,"This book discusses analytic and asymptotic methods relevant to radiative transfer in dilute media, such as stellar and planetary atmospheres. Several methods, providing exact expressions for the radiation field in a semi-infinite atmosphere, are described in detail and applied to unpolarized and polarized continuous spectra and spectral lines. Among these methods, the Wiener–Hopf method, introduced in 1931 for a stellar atmospheric problem, is used today in fields such as solid mechanics, diffraction theory, or mathematical finance. Asymptotic analyses are carried out on unpolarized and polarized radiative transfer equations and on a discrete time random walk. Applicable when photons undergo a large number of scatterings, they provide criteria to distinguish between large-scale diffusive and non-diffusive behaviors, typical scales of variation of the radiation field, such as the thermalization length, and specific descriptions for regions close and far from boundaries. Its well organized synthetic view of exact and asymptotic methods of radiative transfer makes this book a valuable resource for both graduate students and professional scientists in astrophysics and beyond.",Science,611,N/A,0,en

Principles of Adsorption and Reaction on Solid Surfaces,Richard I. Masel,John Wiley & Sons,1996-03-22,"Principles of Adsorption and Reaction on Solid Surfaces As with other books in the field, Principles of Adsorption and Reaction on Solid Surfaces describes what occurs when gases come in contact with various solid surfaces. But, unlike all the others, it also explains why. While the theory of surface reactions is still under active development, the approach Dr. Richard Masel takes in this book is to outline general principles derived from thermodynamics and reaction rate theory that can be applied to reactions on surfaces, and to indicate ways in which these principles may be applied. The book also provides a comprehensive treatment of the latest quantitative surface modeling techniques with numerous examples of their use in the fields of chemical engineering, physical chemistry, and materials science. A valuable working resource and an excellent graduate-level text, Principles of Adsorption and Reaction on Solid Surfaces provides readers with: * A detailed look at the latest advances in understanding and quantifying reactions on surfaces * In-depth reviews of all crucial background material * 40 solved examples illustrating how the methods apply to catalysis, physical vapor deposition, chemical vapor deposition, electrochemistry, and more * 340 problems and practice exercises * Sample computer programs * Universal plots of many key quantities * Detailed, class-tested derivations to help clarify key results The recent development of quantitative techniques for modeling surface reactions has led to a number of exciting breakthroughs in our understanding of what happens when gases come in contact with solid surfaces. While many books have appeared describing various experimental modeling techniques and the results obtained through their application, until now, there has been no single-volume reference devoted to the fundamental principles governing the processes observed. The first book to focus on governing principles rather than experimental techniques or specific results, Principles of Adsorption and Reaction on Solid Surfaces provides students and professionals with a quantitative treatment of the application of principles derived from the fields of thermodynamics and reaction rate theory to the investigation of gas adsorption and reaction on solid surfaces. Writing for a broad-based audience including, among others, chemical engineers, chemists, and materials scientists, Dr. Richard I. Masel deftly balances basic background in areas such as statistical mechanics and kinetics with more advanced applications in specialized areas. Principles of Adsorption and Reaction on Solid Surfaces was also designed to provide readers an opportunity to quickly familiarize themselves with all of the important quantitative surface modeling techniques now in use. To that end, the author has included all of the key equations involved as well as numerous real-world illustrations and solved examples that help to illustrate how the equations can be applied. He has also provided computer programs along with universal plots that make it easy for readers to apply results to their own problems with little computational effort. Principles of Adsorption and Reaction on Solid Surfaces is a valuable working resource for chemical engineers, physical chemists, and materials scientists, and an excellent text for graduate students in those disciplines.",Technology & Engineering,826,5,1,en

Somatic Embryogenesis in Woody Plants,"S. Mohan Jain, Pramod P.K. Gupta, R.J. Newton",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The quality of human life has been maintained and enhanced for generations by the use of trees and their products. In recent years, ever rising human population growth has put tremendous pressure on trees and tree products; growing awareness of the potential of previously unexploited tree resources and environmental pollution have both accelerated development of new technologies for tree propagation, breeding and improvement. Biotechnology of trees may be the answer to solve the problems which cannot be solved by conventional breeding methods. The combination of biotechnology and conventional methods such as plant propagation and breeding may be a novel approach to improving and multiplying in large number the trees and woody plants. So far, plant tissue culture technology has largely been exploited in the propagation of ornamental plants, especially foliage house plants, by com mercial companies. Generally, tissue culture of woody plants has been recal citrant. However, limited success has been achieved in tissue culture of angiosperm and gymnosperm woody plants. A number of recent reports on somatic embryogenesis in woody plants such as Norway spruce (Picea abies), Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), Sandalwood (Santalurn album), Citrus, Mango (Mangifera indica), etc. , offer a ray of hope of: a) inexpensive clonal propa gation for large-scale production of plants or ""emblings"" or ""somatic embryo plants"", b) protoplast work, c) cryopreservation, d) genetic transformation, and e) artificial or manufactured seed production.",Science,512,N/A,0,en

"Detectors, Reference Frames, and Time",Alexander R. H. Smith,Springer,2019-07-03,"This thesis uses the tools of quantum information science to uncover fascinating new insights about the intersection of quantum theory and relativity. It is divided into three self-contained parts, the first of which employs detector models to investigate how the information content of quantum fields depends on spacetime curvature and global spacetime topology. The behavior of Unruh-DeWitt detectors on curved spacetimes are investigated, following which these detectors are used to probe the vacuum state of a scalar field in various topologies. This leads to a generalization of the entanglement harvesting protocol involving detectors in arbitrary curved spacetimes admitting a Wightman function. The second part extends the theory of quantum reference frames to those associated with noncompact groups. Motivated by the pursuit of a relational relativistic quantum theory where the group of reference frames is the Poincaré group, the author then generalizes a communication protocol between two parties lacking a common reference frame to the scenario where the group of transformations of their reference frame is a one-dimensional noncompact Lie group. Finally, the third part, inspired by theories of quantum gravity, generalizes the conditional probability interpretation of time, a proposed mechanism for time to emerge from a fundamentally timeless Universe. While the conditional probability interpretation of time is based upon conditioning a solution to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation on a subsystem of the universe that acts a clock, the author extends this approach to include an interaction between the system being used as a clock and a system whose evolution the clock is tracking.",Science,171,N/A,0,en

Knowing How,"John Bengson, Marc A. Moffett",Oxford University Press,2012-01-06,"Knowledge how to do things is a pervasive and central element of everyday life. Yet it raises many difficult questions that must be answered by philosophers and cognitive scientists aspiring to understand human cognition and agency.

Migration,Hugh Dingle,Oxford University Press,2014,"Migration, broadly defined as directional movement to take advantage of spatially distributed resources, is a dramatic behaviour and an important component of many life histories that can contribute to the fundamental structuring of ecosystems. In recent years, our understanding of migration has advanced radically with respect to both new data and conceptual understanding. It is now almost twenty years since publication of the first edition, and an authoritative and up-to-date sequel that provides a taxonomically comprehensive overview of the latest research is therefore timely. The emphasis throughout this advanced textbook is on the definition and description of migratory behaviour, its ecological outcomes for individuals, populations, and communities, and how these outcomes lead to natural selection acting on the behaviour to cause its evolution. It takes a truly integrative approach, showing how comparisons across a diversity of organisms and biological disciplines can illuminate migratory life cycles, their evolution, and the relation of migration to other movements. Migration: The Biology of Life on the Move focuses on migration as a behavioural phenomenon with important ecological consequences for organisms as diverse as aphids, butterflies, birds and whales. It is suitable for senior undergraduate and graduate level students taking courses in behaviour, spatial ecology, 'movement ecology', and conservation. It will also be of interest and use to a broader audience of professional ecologists and behaviourists seeking an authoritative overview of this rapidly expanding field.",Science,340,N/A,0,en
A Clinician's Guide to Normal Cognitive Development in Childhood,"Elisabeth Hollister Sandberg, Becky L. Spritz",Routledge,2011-03-17,"Clinicians and practitioners-in-training can often lose sight of the normal developmental landscape that underlies behavior, especially in the field of cognitive development. It exists in an insular bubble within the broader field of psychology, and within each sub-domain there is a wide continuum between the anchors of atypical and optimal development. Clinicians need to learn, and to be reminded of, the unique peculiarities of developing cognitive skills in order to appreciate normal developmental phenomena. In A Clinician's Guide to Normal Cognitive Development in Childhood, every chapter provides students and established professionals with an accessible set of descriptions of normal childhood cognition, accompanied by suggestions for how to think about normal development in a clinical context. Each sub-topic within cognitive development is explicated through a succinct presentation of empirical data in that area, followed by a discussion of the ethical implications. With an extensive review of data and clinical practice techniques, professionals and students alike will benefit enormously from this resource.",Psychology,268,N/A,0,en

Natural Kinds and Genesis,Stewart Umphrey,Lexington Books,2016-08-22,"In Natural Kinds and Genesis: The Classification of Material Entities, Stewart Umphrey raises and answers two questions: What is it to be a natural kind? And are there in fact any natural kinds? First, using the everyday understanding of things, he argues that natural kinds may be understood as classes or as types, and that the members or tokens of such kinds are individual continuants. A continuant is essentially a being-in-becoming, a material thing which changes and yet remains the same, in virtue of its nature or essence, as long as it exists. In the primary sense of the term, then, a natural kind is a class whose members closely resemble one another substantially, in virtue of their essences. Alternatively, it is a type whose tokens exemplify it in virtue of their essences. To answer the second question, one must make use of relevant scientific theories as well. Umphrey agrees with scientific essentialists that there are natural kinds, but he argues that most of the chemical, physical, and biological kinds posited in current theories are not natural kinds in the primary sense of the term. The natural-kinds realism he affirms is thus quite restricted: it requires the existence of enduring things which closely resemble one another in virtue of their essences, and such things exist, apparently, only if they have come into being, or emerged, in the course of symmetry-breaking events. Natural Kinds and Genesis will be of interest to philosophers of science and to those interested in the metaphysics of natural kinds and their members.",Philosophy,187,N/A,0,en

Many professional engineers working in industry feel that the gap between theory and practice in applying control and systems theory is widening, despite efforts to develop control algorithms. Papers presented at the meeting ranged from the theoretical aspects to the practical applications of artificial intelligence in real-time control. Themes were: the methodology of artificial intelligence techniques in control engineering; the application of artificial intelligence techniques in different areas of control; and hardware and software requirements.

The Anthropology of Education Policy,"Angelina E. Castagno, Teresa McCarty",Taylor & Francis,2017-07-06,"Advancing a rapidly growing field of social science inquiry—the anthropology of policy—this volume extends and solidifies this body of work, focusing on education policy. Its goal is to examine timely issues in education policy from a critical anthropological, ethnographic, and comparative perspective, and through this to theorize new ways of understanding how policy ""does its work."" At the center is a commitment to an engaged anthropology of education policy that uses anthropological knowledge to imagine and foster more equitable and just forms of schooling. The authors examine the ways in which education policy processes create, reflect, and contest regimes of knowledge and power, sorting and stratifying people, ideas, and resources in particular ways. In contrast to conventional analyses of policy as text-based, dictated, linear, and rational, an anthropological perspective positions policy at the interface of top-down, bottom-up, and meso-level processes, and as de facto and de jure. Demonstrating how education policy operates as a social, cultural, and deeply ideological process ""on the ground,"" each chapter clearly delineates the implications of these understandings for educational access, opportunity, and equity. Providing a single ""go to"" source on the disciplinary history, theoretical framework, methodology, and empirical applications of the anthropology of education policy across a range of education topics, policy debates, and settings, the book updates and expands on seminal works in the field, carving out an important niche in anthropological studies of public policy.",Education,271,N/A,0,en

Niedermeyer's Electroencephalography,"Donald L. Schomer, F. H. Lopes da Silva",Lippincott Williams & Wilkins,2011,"""This edition has several new features, reflective of the changes that have occurred in our field over the last 5 years since the fifth edition. More and more, the field of digital recording has expanded; however, in order to understand some of the shortcomings and pitfalls of digital EEG, people need to still address the issues of basic analog recording principles. With an increased use of digital recording, laboratories have collected new and different ""technical artifacts."" We present here an attempt to start a database for such artifacts in a hopes that future editions will continue to expand upon this and offer a fairly complete library for beginning individuals interested in our field. As noted in the fifth edition, epilepsy monitoring units (EMU's) have continued to mushroom. Similar growth has occurred in the use of EEG monitoring in newborn, cardiac, trauma, and post-operative intensive care units. With the significant advances in wireless communication and easy access to the Internet, such recordings can also be viewed and transmitted locally virtually instantaneously and can allow for well-trained clinical neurophysiologists to see and opine about patients' conditions on a very time-relevant basis. Hopefully, as future generations may show, this ability will significantly influence our patients' outcomes. Similarly, the field of intraoperative clinical neurophysiology for spinal cord function, cranial nerve function, and cranial vascular therapies has continued to evolve along with the wireless and iInternet communications. This has allowed for close monitoring of neurologic function during critical periods of operations, again with a time course that allows for corrective actions to be taken on a meaningful time frame""--Provided by publisher.",Medical,1308,N/A,0,en

Structuring the Components of the Image Matching Problem,"Joseph A. Ratkovic, Rand Corporation",N/A,1979,"This Note briefly describes the matching process. The major emphasis is in describing the elements of the matching process--the scene, matching algorithms, and errors--and determining their roles in and effect on the matching process. A means is provided for structuring the map matching problem. Thescene is defined by the degree of homogeneity and the number of independent elements in each homogeneous region. The errors are further broken up into categories which are mutually exclusive, comprehensive, and positively related to a preprocessing technique or algorithm required to accommodate them. The errors are thus broken up into one of the following categories: global, regional, local, and nonstructured. Finally, the matching algorithms are defined as being of a feature matching correlation or hybrid type. The latter type is a new glass of algorithm developed at Rand which bridges the gap between feature matching and correlation types of algorithms. (Author).",Cruise missiles,42,N/A,0,en

21st Century Criminology: A Reference Handbook,J. Mitchell Miller,SAGE Publications,2009-08-06,"Criminology has experienced tremendous growth over the last few decades, evident, in part, by the widespread popularity and increased enrollment in criminology and criminal justice departments at the undergraduate and graduate levels across the U.S. and internationally. Evolutionary paradigmatic shift has accompanied this surge in definitional, disciplinary and pragmatic terms. Though long identified as a leading sociological specialty area, criminology has emerged as a stand-alone discipline in its own right, one that continues to grow and is clearly here to stay. Criminology, today, remains inherently theoretical but is also far more applied in focus and thus more connected to the academic and practitioner concerns of criminal justice and related professional service fields. Contemporary criminology is also increasingly interdisciplinary and thus features a broad variety of ideological orientations to and perspectives on the causes, effects and responses to crime. 21st Century Criminology: A Reference Handbook provides straightforward and definitive overviews of 100 key topics comprising traditional criminology and its modern outgrowths. The individual chapters have been designed to serve as a ""first-look"" reference source for most criminological inquires. Both connected to the sociological origins of criminology (i.e., theory and research methods) and the justice systems′ response to crime and related social problems, as well as coverage of major crime types, this two-volume set offers a comprehensive overview of the current state of criminology. From student term papers and masters theses to researchers commencing literature reviews, 21st Century Criminology is a ready source from which to quickly access authoritative knowledge on a range of key issues and topics central to contemporary criminology. This two-volume set in the SAGE 21st Century Reference Series is intended to provide undergraduate majors with an authoritative reference source that will serve their research needs with more detailed information than encyclopedia entries but not so much jargon, detail, or density as a journal article or research handbook chapter. 100 entries or ""mini-chapters"" highlight the most important topics, issues, questions, and debates any student obtaining a degree in this field ought to have mastered for effectiveness in the 21st century. Curricular-driven, chapters provide students with initial footholds on topics of interest in researching term papers, in preparing for GREs, in consulting to determine directions to take in pursuing a senior thesis, graduate degree, career, etc. Comprehensive in coverage, major sections include The Discipline of Criminology, Correlates of Crime, Theories of Crime & Justice, Measurement & Research, Types of Crime, and Crime & the Justice System. The contributor group is comprised of well-known figures and emerging young scholars who provide authoritative overviews coupled with insightful discussion that will quickly familiarize researchers, students, and general readers alike with fundamental and detailed information for each topic. Uniform chapter structure makes it easy for students to locate key information, with most chapters following a format of Introduction, Theory, Methods, Applications, Comparison, Future Directions, Summary, Bibliography & Suggestions for Further Reading, and Cross References.

Handbook of Applied Cryptography,"Alfred J. Menezes, Paul C. van Oorschot, Scott A. Vanstone",CRC Press,2018-12-07,"Cryptography, in particular public-key cryptography, has emerged in the last 20 years as an important discipline that is not only the subject of an enormous amount of research, but provides the foundation for information security in many applications. Standards are emerging to meet the demands for cryptographic protection in most areas of data communications. Public-key cryptographic techniques are now in widespread use, especially in the financial services industry, in the public sector, and by individuals for their personal privacy, such as in electronic mail. This Handbook will serve as a valuable reference for the novice as well as for the expert who needs a wider scope of coverage within the area of cryptography. It is a necessary and timely guide for professionals who practice the art of cryptography. The Handbook of Applied Cryptography provides a treatment that is multifunctional: It serves as an introduction to the more practical aspects of both conventional and public-key cryptography It is a valuable source of the latest techniques and algorithms for the serious practitioner It provides an integrated treatment of the field, while still presenting each major topic as a self-contained unit It provides a mathematical treatment to accompany practical discussions It contains enough abstraction to be a valuable reference for theoreticians while containing enough detail to actually allow implementation of the algorithms discussed Now in its third printing, this is the definitive cryptography reference that the novice as well as experienced developers, designers, researchers, engineers, computer scientists, and mathematicians alike will use.",Mathematics,810,N/A,0,en
"Information Security Policies, Procedures, and Standards",Douglas J. Landoll,CRC Press,2017-03-27,"Information Security Policies, Procedures, and Standards: A Practitioner's Reference gives you a blueprint on how to develop effective information security policies and procedures. It uses standards such as NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, and COBIT, and regulations such as HIPAA and PCI DSS as the foundation for the content. Highlighting key terminology, policy development concepts and methods, and suggested document structures, it includes examples, checklists, sample policies and procedures, guidelines, and a synopsis of the applicable standards. The author explains how and why procedures are developed and implemented rather than simply provide information and examples. This is an important distinction because no two organizations are exactly alike; therefore, no two sets of policies and procedures are going to be exactly alike. This approach provides the foundation and understanding you need to write effective policies, procedures, and standards clearly and concisely. Developing policies and procedures may seem to be an overwhelming task. However, by relying on the material presented in this book, adopting the policy development techniques, and examining the examples, the task will not seem so daunting. You can use the discussion material to help sell the concepts, which may be the most difficult aspect of the process. Once you have completed a policy or two, you will have the courage to take on even more tasks. Additionally, the skills you acquire will assist you in other areas of your professional and private life, such as expressing an idea clearly and concisely or creating a project plan.",Business & Economics,157,5,3,en

The Elements of Statistical Learning,"Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-11-11,"During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book’s coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression & path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for “wide” data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.",Mathematics,545,4,1,en

What Money Can't Buy,Michael J. Sandel,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux",2012-04-24,"In What Money Can't Buy, renowned political philosopher Michael J. Sandel rethinks the role that markets and money should play in our society. Should we pay children to read books or to get good grades? Should we put a price on human life to decide how much pollution to allow? Is it ethical to pay people to test risky new drugs or to donate their organs? What about hiring mercenaries to fight our wars, outsourcing inmates to for-profit prisons, auctioning admission to elite universities, or selling citizenship to immigrants willing to pay? In his New York Times bestseller What Money Can't Buy, Michael J. Sandel takes up one of the biggest ethical questions of our time: Isn't there something wrong with a world in which everything is for sale? If so, how can we prevent market values from reaching into spheres of life where they don't belong? What are the moral limits of markets? Over recent decades, market values have crowded out nonmarket norms in almost every aspect of life. Without quite realizing it, Sandel argues, we have drifted from having a market economy to being a market society. In Justice, an international bestseller, Sandel showed himself to be a master at illuminating, with clarity and verve, the hard moral questions we confront in our everyday lives. Now, in What Money Can't Buy, he provokes a debate that's been missing in our market-driven age: What is the proper role of markets in a democratic society, and how can we protect the moral and civic goods that markets do not honor and money cannot buy?",Philosophy,246,4,5,en

Continuum Theory of Inhomogeneities in Simple Bodies,"W. Noll, R. A. Toupin, C. C. Wang",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The term ""dislocation"" is used in several different senses in the literature of mechanics. In the elassic work of VOLTERRA, WEINGARTEN, and SOMIGLIANA, it refers to particular solutions of the equations of linear elasticity, in which a con tinuous field of strain does not correspond, globally, to a continuous field of dis placement. The configuration of the body so obtained, even when that body is free of all load, is subject to interior stress that does not vanish, and in general no deformation of the body as a wh oIe can bring it into a stress-free configuration. Nevertheless, if any sufficiently sm all part of the body is considered by itself, a configuration for it in which the stress is everywhere zero may be found at once. In this work constitutiL""e assumptions provide the basic data. These consist in prescribed stress-free configurations for each material point and in prescribed elastic moduli governing the response to deformation from the stress-free configuration at each material point. Everything follows from these data, ineluding the dislocations present, if any. In particular, the common boundary-value problems of linear elasticity may be set and solved for the dislocated body.",Science,187,N/A,0,en

The Pluto System After New Horizons,S. Alan Stern,University of Arizona Press,2021-08-10,"Once perceived as distant, cold, dark, and seemingly unknowable, Pluto had long been marked as the farthest and most unreachable frontier for solar system exploration. After Voyager accomplished its final planetary reconnaissance at Neptune in 1989, Pluto and its cohort in the Kuiper Belt beckoned as the missing puzzle piece for completing the first reconnaissance of our solar system. In the decades following Voyager, a mission to the Pluto system was not only imagined but also achieved, culminating with the historic 2015 flyby by the New Horizons spacecraft. Pluto and its satellite system (“the Pluto system”), including its largest moon, Charon, have been revealed to be worlds of enormous complexity that fantastically exceed preconceptions. The Pluto System After New Horizons seeks to become the benchmark for synthesizing our understanding of the Pluto system. The volume’s lead editor is S. Alan Stern, who also serves as NASA’s New Horizons Principal Investigator; co-editors Richard P. Binzel, William M. Grundy, Jeffrey M. Moore, and Leslie A. Young are all co-investigators on New Horizons. Leading researchers from around the globe have spent the last five years assimilating Pluto system flyby data returned from New Horizons. The chapters in this volume form an enduring foundation for ongoing study and understanding of the Pluto system. The volume also advances insights into the nature of dwarf planets and Kuiper Belt objects, providing a cornerstone for planning new missions that may return to the Pluto system and explore others of the myriad important worlds beyond Neptune.",Science,684,N/A,0,en

The proposal to hold this symposium originated with the German Society of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics (GAMM) late in 1964 and was examined by a committee of IUTAM especially appointed for this purpose. The basis of this examination was a report in which the present situation in the field and the possible aims of the symposium were surveyed. Briefly, the aims of the symposium were stated to be 1. the unification of the various approaches developed in recent years with the aim of penetrating into the microscopic world of matter by means of continuum theories; 2. the bridging of the gap between microscopic (or atomic) research on mechanics on one hand, and the phenomenological (or continuum mechanical) approach on the other hand; 3. the physical interpretation and the relation to actual material behaviour of the quantities and laws introduced into the new theories, together with applications; 4. the further development of the theories, where necessary, and the clarification of open questions; 5. a stocktaking of present achievements and the prognosis for future developments.

Metaheuristic Clustering,"Swagatam Das, Ajith Abraham, Amit Konar",Springer Science & Business Media,2009-03-24,"Cluster analysis means the organization of an unlabeled collection of objects or patterns into separate groups based on their similarity. The task of computerized data clustering has been approached from diverse domains of knowledge like graph theory, multivariate analysis, neural networks, fuzzy set theory, and so on. Clustering is often described as an unsupervised learning method but most of the traditional algorithms require a prior specification of the number of clusters in the data for guiding the partitioning process, thus making it not completely unsupervised. Modern data mining tools that predict future trends and behaviors for allowing businesses to make proactive and knowledge-driven decisions, demand fast and fully automatic clustering of very large datasets with minimal or no user intervention. In this volume, we formulate clustering as an optimization problem, where the best partitioning of a given dataset is achieved by minimizing/maximizing one (single-objective clustering) or more (multi-objective clustering) objective functions. Using several real world applications, we illustrate the performance of several metaheuristics, particularly the Differential Evolution algorithm when applied to both single and multi-objective clustering problems, where the number of clusters is not known beforehand and must be determined on the run. This volume comprises of 7 chapters including an introductory chapter giving the fundamental definitions and the last Chapter provides some important research challenges. Academics, scientists as well as engineers engaged in research, development and application of optimization techniques and data mining will find the comprehensive coverage of this book invaluable.",Computers,266,N/A,0,en

In short, the book includes a crash course in applied mathematics, ranging from elementary trigonometry to the classical tensor calculus. Comprised of 11 chapters, this book begins with an introduction to fundamental mathematical concepts such as sets, relations, and functions; N-tuples, vectors, and matrices; and vector algebra and calculus. The discussion then turns to the concept of relativity and elementary foundations of Newtonian mechanics, as well as the principle of special relativity and its interpretation by means of empiricism and rationalism. Subsequent chapters focus on the status of the doctrine of conventionalism in the theory of special relativity; the commensurability of classical and relativistic mechanics; mathematical foundations of special relativistic physics; and the classical or Newtonian theory of gravitation. The principle of general covariance and its relation to the principle of general relativity are also examined. The final chapter addresses the fundamental question as to the actual information concerning the structure of spacetime that is conveyed to us through the theory of general relativity.

Data Science,"Ivo D. Dinov, Milen Velchev Velev",Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG,2021-12-06,"The amount of new information is constantly increasing, faster than our ability to fully interpret and utilize it to improve human experiences. Addressing this asymmetry requires novel and revolutionary scientific methods and effective human and artificial intelligence interfaces. By lifting the concept of time from a positive real number to a 2D complex time (kime), this book uncovers a connection between artificial intelligence (AI), data science, and quantum mechanics. It proposes a new mathematical foundation for data science based on raising the 4D spacetime to a higher dimension where longitudinal data (e.g., time-series) are represented as manifolds (e.g., kime-surfaces). This new framework enables the development of innovative data science analytical methods for model-based and model-free scientific inference, derived computed phenotyping, and statistical forecasting. The book provides a transdisciplinary bridge and a pragmatic mechanism to translate quantum mechanical principles, such as particles and wavefunctions, into data science concepts, such as datum and inference-functions. It includes many open mathematical problems that still need to be solved, technological challenges that need to be tackled, and computational statistics algorithms that have to be fully developed and validated. Spacekime analytics provide mechanisms to effectively handle, process, and interpret large, heterogeneous, and continuously-tracked digital information from multiple sources. The authors propose computational methods, probability model-based techniques, and analytical strategies to estimate, approximate, or simulate the complex time phases (kime directions). This allows transforming time-varying data, such as time-series observations, into higher-dimensional manifolds representing complex-valued and kime-indexed surfaces (kime-surfaces). The book includes many illustrations of model-based and model-free spacekime analytic techniques applied to economic forecasting, identification of functional brain activation, and high-dimensional cohort phenotyping. Specific case-study examples include unsupervised clustering using the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (MCSI), model-based inference using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, and model-free inference using the UK Biobank data archive. The material includes mathematical, inferential, computational, and philosophical topics such as Heisenberg uncertainty principle and alternative approaches to large sample theory, where a few spacetime observations can be amplified by a series of derived, estimated, or simulated kime-phases. The authors extend Newton-Leibniz calculus of integration and differentiation to the spacekime manifold and discuss possible solutions to some of the ""problems of time"". The coverage also includes 5D spacekime formulations of classical 4D spacetime mathematical equations describing natural laws of physics, as well as, statistical articulation of spacekime analytics in a Bayesian inference framework. The steady increase of the volume and complexity of observed and recorded digital information drives the urgent need to develop novel data analytical strategies. Spacekime analytics represents one new data-analytic approach, which provides a mechanism to understand compound phenomena that are observed as multiplex longitudinal processes and computationally tracked by proxy measures. This book may be of interest to academic scholars, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, artificial intelligence and machine learning engineers, biostatisticians, econometricians, and data analysts. Some of the material may also resonate with philosophers, futurists, astrophysicists, space industry technicians, biomedical researchers, health practitioners, and the general public.",Computers,490,N/A,0,en

Bibliography of Magnetic Materials and Tabulation of Magnetic Transition Temperatures,T. F. Connolly,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This referenced compilation of magnetic transition temperatures represents (with the Addendum) papers actually received by the RMIC through May 1972 and consists of two lists (alphabetical by compounds), one for Curie and one for Neel temperatures. Where different values appeared in the literature for a single compound, all are listed with sepa rate references given for each. There is no attempt at critical evaluation, which, except for a few welt-studied and well characterized materials, would hardly be worth the effort. All that one can say for most of the compounds is that for a given material with a certain (or all too often uncertain) history of preparati'on and treatment, stoichiometry, homoge neity, and chemical or structural purity a magnetic transition was indicated at the temperature(s) listed. Only when the reasons for different values are explicitly stated in the literature do they appear as brief comments in the body of the lists. In order to include the most recent data, and to eliminate the delay involved in recomposition of the lists, an addendum is provided. While this requires the perusal of two lists rather than one, it does ensure that the compilation represents the entire RMIC collection at the moment of going to press. The 2478 references are restricted to those papers specifying a Curie or Neel temperature and do not reflect the complete magnetics literature even for the materials listed.",Science,183,N/A,0,en

Synthetic Aperture Radar,J. Patrick Fitch,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Radar, like most well developed areas, has its own vocabulary. Words like Doppler frequency, pulse compression, mismatched filter, carrier frequency, in-phase, and quadrature have specific meaning to the radar engineer. In fact, the word radar is actually an acronym for RAdio Detection And Rang ing. Even though these words are well defined, they can act as road blocks which keep people without a radar background from utilizing the large amount of data, literature, and expertise within the radar community. This is unfortunate because the use of digital radar processing techniques has made possible the analysis of radar signals on many general purpose digi tal computers. Of special interest are the surface mapping radars, such as the Seasat and the shuttle imaging radars, which utilize a technique known as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to create high resolution images (pic tures). This data appeals to cartographers, agronomists, oceanographers, and others who want to perform image enhancement, parameter estima tion, pattern recognition, and other information extraction techniques on the radar imagery. The first chapter presents the basics of radar processing: techniques for calculating range (distance) by measuring round trip propagation times for radar pulses. This is the same technique that sightseers use when calculat ing the width of a canyon by timing the round trip delay using echoes. In fact, the corresponding approach in radar is usually called the pulse echo technique.",Technology & Engineering,175,N/A,0,en
Lunar Science: A Post - Apollo View,Stuart Ross Taylor,Elsevier,2016-06-06,"Lunar Science: A Post-Apollo View: Scientific Results and Insights from the Lunar Samples explains the scientific results and discoveries of the manned Apollo lunar missions as they are understood. The emphasis is less on sample description and data and more on the interpretative aspects of the study, with the aim of providing a coherent story of the evolution of the moon and its origin as revealed by the lunar samples and the Apollo missions. This text has seven chapters; the first of which provides a historical background of efforts to study the moon prior to the Apollo missions, including lunar photogeologic mapping and direct exploration by spacecraft. Attention then turns to the Apollo missions and the lunar samples collected, beginning with Apollo 11 that landed on the moon on July 20, 1969 and followed by more missions. The next chapter describes the geology of the moon, with emphasis on craters, central peaks and peak rings, the large ringed basins, rilles, and maria lava flows. The reader is also introduced to the nature of the lunar surface material, the maria basalts, the highlands, and the moon's interior. This book concludes with a discussion on the evidence that has been gathered by the Apollo missions that offers insights into the origin and evolution of the moon. An epilogue reflects on the usefulness of manned space flight. This book will appeal to lunar scientists as well as to those with an interest in astronomy and space exploration.",Science,393,N/A,0,en

Mechanics,Florian Scheck,Springer Science & Business Media,2010-03-23,"Purpose and Emphasis. Mechanics not only is the oldest branch of physics but was and still is the basis for all of theoretical physics. Quantum mechanics can hardly be understood, perhaps cannot even be formulated, without a good kno- edge of general mechanics. Field theories such as electrodynamics borrow their formal framework and many of their building principles from mechanics. In short, throughout the many modern developments of physics where one frequently turns back to the principles of classical mechanics its model character is felt. For this reason it is not surprising that the presentation of mechanics re?ects to some - tent the development of modern physics and that today this classical branch of theoretical physics is taught rather differently than at the time of Arnold S- merfeld, in the 1920s, or even in the 1950s, when more emphasis was put on the theoryandtheapplicationsofpartial-differentialequations. Today, symmetriesand invariance principles, the structure of the space–time continuum, and the geom- rical structure of mechanics play an important role. The beginner should realize that mechanics is not primarily the art of describing block-and-tackles, collisions of billiard balls, constrained motions of the cylinder in a washing machine, or - cycle riding.",Science,568,N/A,0,en

Mathematics and Computer Science in Medical Imaging,"Max A. Viergever, Andrew Todd-Pokropek",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Medical imaging is an important and rapidly expanding area in medical science. Many of the methods employed are essentially digital, for example computerized tomography, and the subject has become increasingly influenced by develop ments in both mathematics and computer science. The mathematical problems have been the concern of a relatively small group of scientists, consisting mainly of applied mathematicians and theoretical physicists. Their efforts have led to workable algorithms for most imaging modalities. However, neither the fundamentals, nor the limitations and disadvantages of these algorithms are known to a sufficient degree to the physicists, engineers and physicians trying to implement these methods. It seems both timely and important to try to bridge this gap. This book summarizes the proceedings of a NATO Advanced Study Institute, on these topics, that was held in the mountains of Tuscany for two weeks in the late summer of 1986. At another (quite different) earlier meeting on medical imaging, the authors noted that each of the speakers had given, there, a long introduction in their general area, stated that they did not have time to discuss the details of the new work, but proceeded to show lots of clinical results, while excluding any mathematics associated with the area.",Computers,535,N/A,0,en

Flight Dynamics. Modeling Characterization and Performance,Carlo E.D. Riboldi,Società Editrice Esculapio,2024-07-22,"This text offers an analytic description of the dynamic behavior of an aircraft in flight. The explanation firstly covers in detail the build up and characterization of an analytic model for aircraft in flight. The proposed derivation process allows the reader to obtain an in-depth knowledge of the principles and assumptions employed in the obtainment of the equations describing the dynamic response of an aircraft, in parallel yielding suggestions on how to easily obtain models for other flying machines. Secondly, the model representing aircraft dynamics is populated, employing as much as possible additional simple models, linking basic aerodynamic and geometrical characteristics of an aircraft to the corresponding re- presentation in terms of coefficients. Finally, the dynamic performance of a typical aircraft is analyzed, making use of the notions on the dynamic behavior and on the typical values and balance of aircraft-specific coefficients. In this latter part, following an analysis of a equilibrium conditions, static and dynamic stability qualities are analyzed. An introduction to the conditioning of free dynamics through the design of a stability augmentation system is included as well. This book aims to support engineers as well as engineering students at the graduate level, of- fering a concise yet in-depth description of the dynamic behavior of a flying aircraft, trying to keep a rigorous approach to a greater extent than what is usual in the field. This should hopefully foster the comprehension of the key features in the model derivation process, and consequently the range of validity and applicability of the corresponding formulation. This focus on analytic modeling provides the reader with a key-asset when dealing with engineering problems, for example flight simulation, model identification and flight control design. Therefore, the present books attempts to mark a first relevant step in consolidating the notions required to face more specialized topics in aeronautical engineering.",Technology & Engineering,705,N/A,0,en
Perspectives in Turbulence Studies,"Hans U. Meier, Peter Bradshaw",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The present volume entitled ""Perspectives in Turbulence Stud ies"" is dedicated to Dr. Ing. E. h. Julius C. Rotta in honour of his 75th birthday. J. C. Rotta, born on January 1, 1912, started his outstanding career in an unusual way, namely in a drawing office (1928 - 1931). At the same time he - as a purely self taught perso- took a correspondence course in airplane construction. From 1934 to 1945 he worked in the aircraft industry on different subjects in the fields of flight mechanics, structures, air craft design, and aerodynamics. In 1945 he moved to Gottingen and worked from that time at the Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt (AVA, now DFVLR) and the Max-Planck-Institut fur Stromungsforschung (1947-1958), interrupted only by a stay in the U. S. at the Glenn L. Martin Company (1954 - 1955) and a visiting professorship at the Laval University in Quebec, Canada (1956). Already during his activities in industry, Dr. Rotta discovered his special liking for aerodynamics. In Gottingen, he was attracted by Ludwig Prandtl's discussions about problems associated with turbulence and in particular his new contribution to fully developed turbulence, published in 1945. At that time, W. Heisenberg and C. F. v. Weizacker pub lished their results on the energy spectra of isotropic turbu lence at large wave numbers. Since that time his main research interest in reasearch has been in turbulence problems.",Science,512,N/A,0,en

Assessment of Planetary Protection Requirements for Spacecraft Missions to Icy Solar System Bodies,"National Research Council, Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences, Space Studies Board, Committee on Planetary Protection Standards for Icy Bodies in the Outer Solar System",National Academies Press,2012-08-10,"NASA's exploration of planets and satellites during the past 50 years has led to the discovery of traces of water ice throughout the solar system and prospects for large liquid water reservoirs beneath the frozen ICE shells of multiple satellites of the giant planets of the outer solar system. During the coming decades, NASA and other space agencies will send flybys, orbiters, subsurface probes, and, possibly, landers to these distant worlds in order to explore their geologic and chemical context. Because of their potential to harbor alien life, NASA will select missions that target the most habitable outer solar system objects. This strategy poses formidable challenges for mission planners who must balance the opportunity for exploration with the risk of contamination by Earth's microbes, which could confuse the interpretation of data obtained from these objects. The 2000 NRC report Preventing the Forward Contamination of Europa provided a criterion that was adopted with prior recommendations from the Committee on Space Research of the International Council for Science. This current NRC report revisits and extends the findings and recommendations of the 2000 Europa report in light of recent advances in planetary and life sciences and, among other tasks, assesses the risk of contamination of icy bodies in the solar system.",Science,94,N/A,0,en

Forensic DNA Typing,John M. Butler,Elsevier,2005-02-08,"Forensic DNA Typing, Second Edition, is the only book available that specifically covers detailed information on mitochondrial DNA and the Y chromosome. It examines the science of current forensic DNA typing methods by focusing on the biology, technology, and genetic interpretation of short tandem repeat (STR) markers, which encompass the most common forensic DNA analysis methods used today. The book covers topics from introductory level right up to cutting edge research. High-profile cases are addressed throughout the text, near the sections dealing with the science or issues behind these cases. Ten new chapters have been added to accommodate the explosion of new information since the turn of the century. These additional chapters cover statistical genetic analysis of DNA data, an emerging field of interest to DNA research. Several chapters on statistical analysis of short tandem repeat (STR) typing data have been contributed by Dr. George Carmody, a well-respected professor in forensic genetics. Specific examples make the concepts of population genetics more understandable. This book will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in forensic DNA analysis, forensic scientists, population geneticists, military and private and public forensic laboratories (for identifying individuals through remains), and students of forensic science. *The only book available that specifically covers detailed information on mitochondrial DNA and the Y chromosome*Chapters cover the topic from introductory level right up to ""cutting edge"" research*High-profile cases are addressed throughout the book, near the sections dealing with the science or issues behind these cases*NEW TO THIS EDITION: D.N.A.

This series provides recommended intakes, such as Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs), for use in planning nutritionally adequate diets for individuals based on age and gender. In addition, a new reference intake, the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL), has also been established to assist an individual in knowing how much is ""too much"" of a nutrient. Based on the Institute of Medicine's review of the scientific literature regarding dietary micronutrients, recommendations have been formulated regarding vitamins A and K, iron, iodine, chromium, copper, manganese, molybdenum, zinc, and other potentially beneficial trace elements such as boron to determine the roles, if any, they play in health. The book also: Reviews selected components of food that may influence the bioavailability of these compounds. Develops estimates of dietary intake of these compounds that are compatible with good nutrition throughout the life span and that may decrease risk of chronic disease where data indicate they play a role. Determines Tolerable Upper Intake levels for each nutrient reviewed where adequate scientific data are available in specific population subgroups. Identifies research needed to improve knowledge of the role of these micronutrients in human health.

Handbook of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging for Physicists,Michael Ljungberg,CRC Press,2022-02-08,"Mathematical modelling is an important part of nuclear medicine. Therefore, several chapters of this book have been dedicated towards describing this topic. In these chapters, an emphasis has been put on describing the mathematical modelling of the radiation transport of photons and electrons, as well as on the transportation of radiopharmaceuticals between different organs and compartments. It also includes computer models of patient dosimetry. Two chapters of this book are devoted towards introducing the concept of biostatistics and radiobiology. These chapters are followed by chapters detailing dosimetry procedures commonly used in the context of diagnostic imaging, as well as patient-specific dosimetry for radiotherapy treatments. For safety reasons, many of the methods used in nuclear medicine and molecular imaging are tightly regulated. Therefore, this volume also highlights the basic principles for radiation protection. It discusses the process of how guidelines and regulations aimed at minimizing radiation exposure are determined and implemented by international organisations. Finally, this book describes how different dosimetry methods may be utilized depending on the intended target, including whole-body or organ-specific imaging, as well as small-scale to cellular dosimetry. This text will be an invaluable resource for libraries, institutions, and clinical and academic medical physicists searching for a complete account of what defines nuclear medicine. The most comprehensive reference available providing a state-of-the-art overview of the field of nuclear medicine Edited by a leader in the field, with contributions from a team of experienced medical physicists, chemists, engineers, scientists, and clinical medical personnel Includes the latest practical research in the field, in addition to explaining fundamental theory and the field's history",Medical,317,N/A,0,en

Even though it started as far back as the 1960s with simulated evolution, the subject is still evolving. During this time, new metaheuristic optimization approaches, like evolutionary algorithms, genetic algorithms, swarm intelligence, etc., were being developed and new fields of usage in artificial intelligence, machine learning, combinatorial and numerical optimization, etc., were being explored. However, even with so much work done, novel research into new techniques and new areas of usage is far from over.

Reference,"Jeanette K. Gundel, Nancy Hedberg",Oxford University Press,2008-01-29,"The ability to produce and understand referring expressions is basic to human language use and human cognition. Reference comprises the ability to think of and represent objects (both real and imagined/fictional), to indicate to others which of these objects we are talking about, and to determine what others are talking about when they use a nominal expression. The articles in this volume are concerned with some of the central themes and challenges in research on reference within the cognitive sciences - philosophy (including philosophy of language and mind, logic, and formal semantics), theoretical and computational linguistics, and cognitive psychology. The papers address four basic questions: What is reference? What is the appropriate analysis of different referring forms, such as definite descriptions? How is reference resolved? and How do speaker/writers select appropriate referring forms, such as pronouns vs. full noun phrases, demonstrative vs. personal pronouns, and overt vs. null/zero pronominal forms? Some of the papers assume and build on existing theories, such as Centering Theory and the Givenness Hierarchy framework; others propose their own models of reference understanding or production. The essays examine reference from a number of disciplinary and interdisciplinary perspectives, informed by different research traditions and employing different methodologies. While the contributors to the volume were primarily trained in one of the four represented disciplines-computer science, linguistics, philosophy and psychology, and use methodologies typical of that discipline, each of them bridges more than one discipline in their methodology and/or their approach.",Language Arts & Disciplines,288,N/A,0,en

"The NSTA Quick-reference Guide to the NGSS, K-12",Ted Willard,National Science Teachers Association,2015,"Since the release of the first draft of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), NSTA has been at the forefront in promoting the standards and helping science educators become familiar with and learn to navigate this exciting but complex document. Later, when the final version was released and states began adopting the standards, NSTA started to develop resources that would assist educators with their implementation. Along the way, NSTA learned that even the simplest of resources, like a one-page cheat sheet, can be extremely useful. Many of those tools are collected here, including * a two-page "" cheat sheet"" that describes the practices, core ideas, and crosscutting concepts that make up the three dimensions described in A Framework for K- 12 Science Education; * an "" Inside the Box"" graphic that spells out all of the individual sections of text that appear on a page of the NGSS; * a Venn diagram comparing the practices in NGSS, Common Core State Standards, Mathematics, and Common Core State Standards, English Language Arts; and * matrices showing how the NGSS are organized by topic and disciplinary core idea. This guide also provides the appropriate performance expectations; disciplinary core ideas; practices; crosscutting concepts; connections to engineering, technology, and applications of science; and connections to nature of science. It is designed to be used with the NGSS. The book' s emphasis is on easy. Find the parts of the standards most relevant to you, acquaint yourself with the format, and find out what each of the different parts means. The NSTA Quick-Reference Guides to the NGSS are also available in grade-specific versions-- one each for elementary, middle, and high school. These Quick-Reference Guides are indispensable to science teachers at all levels, as well as to administrators, curriculum developers, and teacher educators.",Science,0,N/A,0,en

This lively, innovative text helps students connect technique and substance, appreciate the value of both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, and make ethical research decisions. It weaves actual research ""stories"" into the presentation of research topics, and it emphasizes validity, authenticity, and practical significance as overarching research goals. The text is divided into three sections: Foundations of Research (5 chapters), Research Design and Data Collection (7 chapters), and Analyzing and Reporting Data (3 chapters). This tripartite conceptual framework honors traditional quantitative approaches while reflecting the growing popularity of qualitative studies, mixed method designs, and school-based techniques.

An Introduction to Exponential Random Graph Modeling,Jenine K. Harris,SAGE Publications,2013-12-23,"This volume introduces the basic concepts of Exponential Random Graph Modeling (ERGM), gives examples of why it is used, and shows the reader how to conduct basic ERGM analyses in their own research. ERGM is a statistical approach to modeling social network structure that goes beyond the descriptive methods conventionally used in social network analysis. Although it was developed to handle the inherent non-independence of network data, the results of ERGM are interpreted in similar ways to logistic regression, making this a very useful method for examining social systems. Recent advances in statistical software have helped make ERGM accessible to social scientists, but a concise guide to using ERGM has been lacking. This book fills that gap, by using examples from public health, and walking the reader through the process of ERGM model-building using R statistical software and the statnet package. An Introduction to Exponential Random Graph Modeling is a part of SAGE’s Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences (QASS) series, which has helped countless students, instructors, and researchers learn cutting-edge quantitative techniques.",Social Science,138,N/A,0,en

Pyrotechnic Chemistry,Kenneth Kosanke,Journal of Pyrotechnics Incorporated,2004-01-01,"This text is written at an introductory to intermediate level. As such it is intended for readers with limited prior knowledge of chemistry or limited knowledge regarding specific areas of applied pyrotechnics. One goal of this text was to provide an extensive list of references, thus directing readers to sources of additional information. With a total of approximately 400 references that goal has been met; however, for the most part, citations to material that is readily found in numerous reference texts have not been included. Only when the information is attributable to a limited number of authors are specific references generally cited.The chapters are a collection of 19 papers written by 12 authors, covering most of the important ar-eas of pyrotechnic chemistry. While this format causes the text to be written in styles that differ somewhat from chapter to chapter, it also provides an opportunity to have each of the chapters written by persons with expertise and current knowledge in each of the various subject areas.

A Framework for K-12 Science Education,"National Research Council, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Board on Science Education, Committee on a Conceptual Framework for New K-12 Science Education Standards",National Academies Press,2012-02-28,"Science, engineering, and technology permeate nearly every facet of modern life and hold the key to solving many of humanity's most pressing current and future challenges. The United States' position in the global economy is declining, in part because U.S. workers lack fundamental knowledge in these fields. To address the critical issues of U.S. competitiveness and to better prepare the workforce, A Framework for K-12 Science Education proposes a new approach to K-12 science education that will capture students' interest and provide them with the necessary foundational knowledge in the field. A Framework for K-12 Science Education outlines a broad set of expectations for students in science and engineering in grades K-12. These expectations will inform the development of new standards for K-12 science education and, subsequently, revisions to curriculum, instruction, assessment, and professional development for educators. This book identifies three dimensions that convey the core ideas and practices around which science and engineering education in these grades should be built. These three dimensions are: crosscutting concepts that unify the study of science through their common application across science and engineering; scientific and engineering practices; and disciplinary core ideas in the physical sciences, life sciences, and earth and space sciences and for engineering, technology, and the applications of science. The overarching goal is for all high school graduates to have sufficient knowledge of science and engineering to engage in public discussions on science-related issues, be careful consumers of scientific and technical information, and enter the careers of their choice. A Framework for K-12 Science Education is the first step in a process that can inform state-level decisions and achieve a research-grounded basis for improving science instruction and learning across the country. The book will guide standards developers, teachers, curriculum designers, assessment developers, state and district science administrators, and educators who teach science in informal environments.",Education,400,N/A,0,en

As pop culture, games are as important as film or television—but game design has yet to develop a theoretical framework or critical vocabulary. In Rules of Play Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman present a much-needed primer for this emerging field. They offer a unified model for looking at all kinds of games, from board games and sports to computer and video games. As active participants in game culture, the authors have written Rules of Play as a catalyst for innovation, filled with new concepts, strategies, and methodologies for creating and understanding games. Building an aesthetics of interactive systems, Salen and Zimmerman define core concepts like ""play,"" ""design,"" and ""interactivity."" They look at games through a series of eighteen ""game design schemas,"" or conceptual frameworks, including games as systems of emergence and information, as contexts for social play, as a storytelling medium, and as sites of cultural resistance. Written for game scholars, game developers, and interactive designers, Rules of Play is a textbook, reference book, and theoretical guide.

Novel Approaches to Minimising Mycotoxin Contamination,"Mar Rodríguez Jovita, Félix Núñez",MDPI,2020-05-22,"Contamination of foods and agricultural commodities by various types of toxigenic fungi is a concerning issue for human and animal health. Moulds naturally present in foods can produce mycotoxins and contaminate foodstuffs under favourable conditions of temperature, relative humidity, pH, and nutrient availability. Mycotoxins are, in general, stable molecules that are difficult to remove from foods once they have been produced. Therefore, the prevention of mycotoxin contamination is one of the main goals of the agriculture and food industries. Chemical control or decontamination techniques may be quite efficient; however, the more sustainable and restricted use of fungicides, the lack of efficiency in some foods, and the consumer demand for chemical-residue-free foods require new approaches to control this hazard. Therefore, food safety demands continued research efforts for exploring new strategies to reduce mycotoxin contamination. This Special Issue contains original contributions and reviews that advance the knowledge about the most current promising approaches to minimize mycotoxin contamination, including biological control agents, phytochemical antifungal compounds, enzyme detoxification, and the use of novel technologies.",Science,244,N/A,0,en

Control Methods in PDE-Dynamical Systems,Fabio Ancona,American Mathematical Soc.,2007,"While rooted in controlled PDE systems, this 2005 AMS-IMS-SIAM Summer Research Conference sought to reach out to a rather distinct, yet scientifically related, research community in mathematics interested in PDE-based dynamical systems. Indeed, this community is also involved in the study of dynamical properties and asymptotic long-time behavior (in particular, stability) of PDE-mixed problems. It was the editors' conviction that the time had become ripe and the circumstances propitious for these two mathematical communities--that of PDE control and optimization theorists and that of dynamical specialists--to come together in order to share recent advances and breakthroughs in their respective disciplines. This conviction was further buttressed by recent discoveries that certain energy methods, initially devised for control-theoretic a-priori estimates, once combined with dynamical systems techniques, yield wholly new asymptotic results on well-established, nonlinear PDE systems, particularly hyperb These expectations are now particularly well reflected in the contributions to this volume, which involve nonlinear parabolic, as well as hyperbolic, equations and their attractors; aero-elasticity, elastic systems; Euler-Korteweg models; thin-film equations; Schrodinger equations; beam equations; etc. in addition, the static topics of Helmholtz and Morrey potentials are also prominently featured.

Immunobiotics: Interactions of Beneficial Microbes with the Immune System,"Julio Villena, Haruki Kitazawa",Frontiers Media SA,2018-01-26,"The term “immunobiotics” has been proposed to define microbial strains able to beneficially regulate the mucosal immune system. Research in immunobiotics has significantly evolved as researchers employed cutting-edge technologies to investigate the complex interactions of these beneficial microorganisms with the immune system. During the last decade, our understanding of immunobiotics-host interaction was profoundly transformed by the discovery of microbial molecules and host receptors involved in the modulation of gut associated immune system, as well as the systemic and distant mucosal immune systems. In recent years, there has been a substantial increase in the number of reports describing the beneficial effects of immunobiotics in diseases such as intestinal and respiratory infections, allergy, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, immunosuppression, and several other immune-mediated conditions. Evidence is also emerging of immunobiotics related molecules with immunomodulatory functions leading to the production of pharmabiotics, which may positively influence human or animal health. Therefore, research in immunobiotics continue to contribute not only to food but also medical and pharmaceutical fields.

Principles of Computer System Design,"Jerome H. Saltzer, M. Frans Kaashoek",Morgan Kaufmann,2009-05-21,"Principles of Computer System Design is the first textbook to take a principles-based approach to the computer system design. It identifies, examines, and illustrates fundamental concepts in computer system design that are common across operating systems, networks, database systems, distributed systems, programming languages, software engineering, security, fault tolerance, and architecture.Through carefully analyzed case studies from each of these disciplines, it demonstrates how to apply these concepts to tackle practical system design problems. To support the focus on design, the text identifies and explains abstractions that have proven successful in practice such as remote procedure call, client/service organization, file systems, data integrity, consistency, and authenticated messages. Most computer systems are built using a handful of such abstractions. The text describes how these abstractions are implemented, demonstrates how they are used in different systems, and prepares the reader to apply them in future designs.The book is recommended for junior and senior undergraduate students in Operating Systems, Distributed Systems, Distributed Operating Systems and/or Computer Systems Design courses; and professional computer systems designers. - Concepts of computer system design guided by fundamental principles - Cross-cutting approach that identifies abstractions common to networking, operating systems, transaction systems, distributed systems, architecture, and software engineering - Case studies that make the abstractions real: naming (DNS and the URL); file systems (the UNIX file system); clients and services (NFS); virtualization (virtual machines); scheduling (disk arms); security (TLS) - Numerous pseudocode fragments that provide concrete examples of abstract concepts - Extensive support.

First published in 2004, Customs and Beliefs of the |xam reproduces Dorothea Bleek's selection of |xam narratives from the well-known Bleek and Lloyd Collection that was originally published in the journal Bantu Studies during the 1930s. Collated and edited by Jeremy Hollman, the extracts include detailed notes on each of the narratives, as well as Bleek's 'sketch' of |xam grammar. This substantially revised second edition integrates new scholarship on the Bleek and Lloyd archive, and restores previously omitted material. The introduction to each narrative has been expanded to contextualise it within the archive as a whole and, where relevant, reference it to the Notebook of which it is a part. This includes meticulous cross-referencing with the Bleek and Lloyd Collection catalogue code and the Notebook number and line reference. Each of the texts has also been critically reassessed, with additional editorial notes and commentaries, in particular with respect to the |xam words themselves and the ways in which they have been translated. A synopsis of each narrative is provided in an appendix, with cross references to the Bleek and Lloyd notebooks. Customs and Beliefs of the |xam, second edition, is an in-depth, detailed and authoritative resource that will be invaluable to scholars, heritage workers and activists alike.",Juvenile Nonfiction,600,N/A,0,en

NMR Crystallography,"Robin K. Harris, Roderick E. Wasylishen, Melinda J. Duer",John Wiley & Sons,2012-12-19,"The content of this volume has been added to eMagRes (formerly Encyclopedia of Magnetic Resonance) - the ultimate online resource for NMR and MRI. The term ""NMR Crystallography"" has only recently come into common usage, and even now causes raised eyebrows within some parts of the diffraction community. The power of solid-state NMR to give crystallographic information has considerably increased since the CPMAS suite of techniques was introduced in 1976. In the first years of the 21st century, the ability of NMR to provide information to support and facilitate the analysis of single-crystal and powder diffraction patterns has become widely accepted. Indeed, NMR can now be used to refine diffraction results and, in favorable cases, to solve crystal structures with minimal (or even no) diffraction data. The increasing ability to relate chemical shifts (including the tensor components) to the crystallographic location of relevant atoms in the unit cell via computational methods has added significantly to the practice of NMR crystallography. Diffraction experts will increasingly welcome NMR as an allied technique in their structural analyses. Indeed, it may be that in the future crystal structures will be determined by simultaneously fitting diffraction patterns and NMR spectra. This Handbook is organised into six sections. The first contains an overview and some articles on fundamental NMR topics, followed by a section concentrating on chemical shifts, and one on coupling interactions. The fourth section contains articles describing how NMR results relate to fundamental crystallography concepts and to diffraction methods. The fifth section concerns specific aspects of structure, such as hydrogen bonding. Finally, four articles in the sixth section give applications of NMR crystallography to structural biology, organic & pharmaceutical chemistry, inorganic & materials chemistry, and geochemistry. About EMR Handbooks / eMagRes Handbooks The Encyclopedia of Magnetic Resonance (up to 2012) and eMagRes (from 2013 onward) publish a wide range of online articles on all aspects of magnetic resonance in physics, chemistry, biology and medicine. The existence of this large number of articles, written by experts in various fields, is enabling the publication of a series of EMR Handbooks / eMagRes Handbooks on specific areas of NMR and MRI. The chapters of each of these handbooks will comprise a carefully chosen selection of articles from eMagRes. In consultation with the eMagRes Editorial Board, the EMR Handbooks / eMagRes Handbooks are coherently planned in advance by specially-selected Editors, and new articles are written (together with updates of some already existing articles) to give appropriate complete coverage. The handbooks are intended to be of value and interest to research students, postdoctoral fellows and other researchers learning about the scientific area in question and undertaking relevant experiments, whether in academia or industry.

Digital Video Image Quality and Perceptual Coding,"H.R. Wu, K.R. Rao",CRC Press,2017-12-19,"The hand is quicker than the eye. In many cases, so is digital video. Maintaining image quality in bandwidth- and memory-restricted environments is quickly becoming a reality as thriving research delves ever deeper into perceptual coding techniques, which discard superfluous data that humans cannot process or detect. Surveying the topic from a Human Visual System (HVS)-based approach, Digital Video Image Quality and Perceptual Coding outlines the principles, metrics, and standards associated with perceptual coding, as well as the latest techniques and applications. This book is divided broadly into three parts. First, it introduces the fundamental theory, concepts, principles, and techniques underlying the field, such as the basics of compression, HVS modeling, and coding artifacts associated with current well-known techniques. The next section focuses on picture quality assessment criteria; subjective and objective methods and metrics, including vision model based digital video impairment metrics; testing procedures; and international standards regarding image quality. Finally, practical applications come into focus, including digital image and video coder designs based on the HVS as well as post-filtering, restoration, error correction, and concealment techniques. The permeation of digital images and video throughout the world cannot be understated. Nor can the importance of preserving quality while using minimal storage space, and Digital Video Image Quality and Perceptual Coding provides the tools necessary to accomplish this goal.

Racism in America,Steven L. Foy,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2020-02-24,"This book explains how race, once a differentiating factor, became a major basis for stratification in the United States that pervaded scientific thought, religious doctrine, governmental policy, and the patterned actions of decision-makers in all sectors of social life. Racism in America: A Reference Handbook diverges from the typical focus of accounts of racism on interpersonal prejudice and discrimination to situate racism within structural processes to demonstrate the systematic nature of racial discrimination. Racial progress, though notable, has largely addressed symptoms of the racialized social system rather than tackling the ways in which the system is inherently patterned to benefit whites. This book provides evidence that racial discrimination is not an occasional decision made by individuals. The book provides readers with a background and history of race in America; a thorough treatment of the problems, controversies, and solutions related to race; a perspectives section including essays from experts in a variety of related fields; profiles of important people and organizations; and a section dedicated to data and documents. Its organizational strategy benefits the reader, first explaining core concepts and providing context for racism in America before moving into more specific applications in the work of relevant experts and providing directions for further study.",Social Science,364,N/A,0,en

Paleodemography,"Robert D. Hoppa, James W.

However, paleodemographic theory relies on several assumptions that cannot easily be validated by the researcher, and if incorrect, can lead to large errors or biases. In this book, physical anthropologists, mathematical demographers and statisticians tackle these methodological issues for reconstructing demographic structure for skeletal samples. Topics discussed include how skeletal morphology is linked to chronological age, assessment of age from the skeleton, demographic models of mortality and their interpretation, and biostatistical approaches to age structure estimation from archaeological samples. This work will be of immense importance to anyone interested in paleodemography, including biological and physical anthropologists, demographers, geographers, evolutionary biologists and statisticians.",Social Science,277,N/A,0,en

Handbook of Genetics,Robert King,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The purpose of the first four volumes of the Handbook of Genetics is to bring together collections of relatively short, authoritative essays or an notated compilations of data on topics of significance to geneticists. Many of the essays will deal with various aspects of the biology of certain species or species groups selected because they are favorite subjects for genetic investigation in nature or the laboratory. Often there will be an encyclo pedic amount of information available on such species, with new papers appearing daily. Most of these will be written for specialists in a jargon that is bewildering to a novice, and sometimes even to a veteran geneticist working with evolutionarily distant organisms. For such readers what is needed is a written introduction to the morphology, life cycle, reproductive behavior, and culture methods for the species in question. What are its particular advantages (and disadvantages) for genetic study, and what have we learned from it? Where are the classic papers, the key bibli ographies, and how does one get stocks of wild type or mutant strains? Lists giving the symbolism and descriptions for selected mutants that have been retained and are thus available for future studies are provided whenever possible. Genetic and cytological maps, mitotic karyotypes, and haploid DNA values are also included when available. Volume 4 deals with certain vertebrate species that have been studied in considerable detail from the standpoint of genetics or molecular cytogenetics.

The SAGE Encyclopedia of Qualitative Research Methods,Lisa M. Given,SAGE Publications,2008-08-19,"Qualitative research is designed to explore the human elements of a given topic, while specific qualitative methods examine how individuals see and experience the world. Qualitative approaches are typically used to explore new phenomena and to capture individuals′ thoughts, feelings, or interpretations of meaning and process. Such methods are central to research conducted in education, nursing, sociology, anthropology, information studies, and other disciplines in the humanities, social sciences, and health sciences. Qualitative research projects are informed by a wide range of methodologies and theoretical frameworks. The SAGE Encyclopedia of Qualitative Research Methods presents current and complete information as well as ready-to-use techniques, facts, and examples from the field of qualitative research in a very accessible style. In taking an interdisciplinary approach, these two volumes target a broad audience and fill a gap in the existing reference literature for a general guide to the core concepts that inform qualitative research practices. The entries cover every major facet of qualitative methods, including access to research participants, data coding, research ethics, the role of theory in qualitative research, and much more—all without overwhelming the informed reader. Key Features Defines and explains core concepts, describes the techniques involved in the implementation of qualitative methods, and presents an overview of qualitative approaches to research Offers many entries that point to substantive debates among qualitative researchers regarding how concepts are labeled and the implications of such labels for how qualitative research is valued Guides readers through the complex landscape of the language of qualitative inquiry Includes contributors from various countries and disciplines that reflect a diverse spectrum of research approaches from more traditional, positivist approaches, through postmodern, constructionist ones Presents some entries written in first-person voice and others in third-person voice to reflect the diversity of approaches that define qualitative work Key Themes Approaches and Methodologies Arts-Based Research, Ties to Computer Software Data Analysis Data Collection Data Types and Characteristics Dissemination History of Qualitative Research Participants Quantitative Research, Ties to Research Ethics Rigor Textual Analysis, Ties to Theoretical and Philosophical Frameworks The SAGE Encyclopedia of Qualitative Research Methods is designed to appeal to undergraduate and graduate students, practitioners, researchers, consultants, and consumers of information across the social sciences, humanities, and health sciences, making it a welcome addition to any academic or public library.",Social Science,1073,5,1,en

Dictionary of Electronics,,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The special interest in electronics all over the world is due to its decisive role in the scien tific and technical progress now taking place in all fields of modern technology. Electronics also plays a decisive role in the development of science, providing as it does the technical basis for various scientific experiments. The role of electronics in the development of the world's culture also deserves a special mention. That is why it is hoped that the English-German French-Dutch-Russian Dictionary of Electronics, which contains some 9.000 entries and is jointly published by Kluwer Technische Boeken, B.V. (Deventer, Holland) and Ruski Yazyk Publishers (Moscow, USSR) will be favourably received. In accordance with existing international tradition, the term «electronics» covers several fields known in Soviet classification as elec tronics proper, radio engineering, and wire communication. The entries included in this dictionary have been selected in accordance with the international understanding of the term «electronics». One of the main difficulties encountered by the compilers was that although according to some calculations the number of terms used in special literature on electronics exceeds 50.000, the vocabulary of the dictionary had to be restricted to only 9.000 entries. Therefore this dictionary cannot claim to be comprehensive. Its purpose is to enable a wide range of specialists in various countries to find the English, German, French, Dutch, or Russian equivalents of the principal and most up-to-date terms in the field of electronics. Most attention has been paid to quantum electronics, fibre optics, optoelectronics, integrated circuit technology, radiolocation and radionavigation, pulse technique, holography, etc.",Technology & Engineering,545,N/A,0,en

Recent computational as well as experimental studies have produced ample evidence that the so-called conical intersections of electronic energy surfaces, predicted by von Neumann and Wigner in 1929, are the rule rather than the exception in polyatomic molecules. It is nowadays increasingly recognized that conical intersections play a key mechanistic role in chemical reaction dynamics. This volume provides an up-to-date overview of the multi-faceted research on the role of conical intersections in photochemistry and photobiology, including basic theoretical concepts, novel computational strategies as well as innovative experiments.

Dynamics of the Earth,"V. I. Ferronsky, S.V. Ferronsky",Springer Science & Business Media,2010-06-28,"In their search for solutions to problems concerning the dynamics of the Earth as a self-gravitating body, the authors have applied the fundamentals found in their book “Jacobi Dynamics” (1987, Reidel). First, satellite observations have shown that the Earth does not remain in hydrostatic equilibrium, which forms the physical basis of modern geodynamics. Secondly, satellite data have established a relationship between the planet’s polar moment of inertia and the potential of the Earth’s outer force field, which proves the most basic point of Jacobi dynamics. This allowed the authors to revise their derivation of the classical virial theorem, introducing the concept of a volumetric force and volumetric moment, and so to obtain a generalized virial theorem in the form of Jacobi’s equation. The main dynamical effects are: the kinetic energy of oscillation of the interacting particles, which explains the physical meaning and nature of gravitational forces; separation of shells of a self-gravitating body with respect to its mass density; differences in angular velocities of the shell’s rotation; continuity in variance of the potential of the outer gravitational force field, together with reductions in the envelope of the interacting masses (volumetric center of gravity); the nature of Earth, Moon and satellite precession; the nature and generating mechanism of the planet’s electromagnetic field; the common nature of gravitational and electromagnetic energy, and other related issues. The work is a logical continuation of the book ""Jacobi Dynamics"" and is intended for researchers, teachers and students engaged in theoretical and experimental research in various branches of astronomy, geophysics, planetology and cosmogony, and for students of celestial, statistical, quantum and relativistic mechanics and hydrodynamics.",Science,267,N/A,0,en

Quantum Triangulations,"Mauro Carfora, Annalisa Marzuoli",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-01-14,"Research on polyhedral manifolds often points to unexpected connections between very distinct aspects of Mathematics and Physics. In particular triangulated manifolds play quite a distinguished role in such settings as Riemann moduli space theory, strings and quantum gravity, topological quantum field theory, condensed matter physics, and critical phenomena. Not only do they provide a natural discrete analogue to the smooth manifolds on which physical theories are typically formulated, but their appearance is rather often a consequence of an underlying structure which naturally calls into play non-trivial aspects of representation theory, of complex analysis and topology in a way which makes manifest the basic geometric structures of the physical interactions involved. Yet, in most of the existing literature, triangulated manifolds are still merely viewed as a convenient discretization of a given physical theory to make it more amenable for numerical treatment. The motivation for these lectures notes is thus to provide an approachable introduction to this topic, emphasizing the conceptual aspects, and probing, through a set of cases studies, the connection between triangulated manifolds and quantum physics to the deepest. This volume addresses applied mathematicians and theoretical physicists working in the field of quantum geometry and its applications.",Science,298,N/A,0,en

Atlas of Protein Spectra in the Ultraviolet and Visible Regions,Donald M. Kirschenbaum,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Once you have seen the spectrum of one protein you have seen the spectra of all pro teins. Or so it would seem. While the general characteristics of the absorption curve may appear to be similar for all proteins (i. e. , in acid and neutral solution there is a minimum at 250 nm, a maximum at 278-282 nm, and no absorption above 310 nm; in alkaline solution the maximum and minimum shift to longer wavelengths), there are subtle differences which can be seen when the spectra of many proteins are compared. It is these differences which reflect changes in amino acid content and in the milieu in which the protein has been dissolved. The spectra in this book provide samples of these subtle spectral differences and permit comparisons to be made. This book was prepared to have its index read and its contents referred to. For the reader who desires to know what a protein spectrum looks like in acid and alkaline media, after X-ray or UV irradiation, or after photo-oxidation or B-bromosuccinimide treatment, spectral representations of all these experimental situations and many others are available. The indicies were prepared to provide the maximum information with the minimum effort. In addition to an alphabetical listing, all spectra are referred to by species, tissues, and the organs from which they were taken. There are also ""environmental"" indicies related to the treatment the proteins received prior to having their spectra taken.

These advances include accident analysis, automation of vehicles, comfort, distraction of drivers (understanding of distraction and how to avoid it), environmental concerns, in-vehicle systems design, intelligent transport systems, methodological developments, new systems and technology, observational and case studies, safety, situation awareness, skill development and training, warnings and workload. This book brings together the most recent human factors work in the transportation domain, including empirical research, human performance and other types of modeling, analysis, and development. The issues facing engineers, scientists, and other practitioners of human factors in transportation research are becoming more challenging and more critical. The common theme across these sections is that they deal with the intersection of the human and the system. Moreover, many of the chapter topics cross section boundaries, for instance by focusing on function allocation in NextGen or on the safety benefits of a tower controller tool. This is in keeping with the systemic nature of the problems facing human factors experts in rail and road, aviation and maritime research– it is becoming increasingly important to view problems not as isolated issues that can be extracted from the system environment, but as embedded issues that can only be understood as a part of an overall system.",Technology & Engineering,596,N/A,0,en

Introduction to Nanoscience,Stuart Lindsay,American Chemical Society,2010,"Nanoscience is not just physics, chemistry, engineering, or biology, but rather an integration of all of these disciplines. The first comprehensive and interdisciplinary text of its kind, Introduction to Nanoscience is an ideal handbook for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students in physics, chemistry, electrical engineering, materials engineering, chemical engineering, bioengineering, and biology. Written from the ground up for a diverse audience, the book is divided into three parts. Part I (The Basics) offers a self-contained introduction to quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and chemical kinetics that requires no more than a basic background in college calculus. The author's conceptual approach and an array of examples and conceptual exercises enable even those students with limited mathematical knowledge to grasp the majority of the essential material. Part II (Tools) covers microscopy, single molecule manipulation and measurement, nanofabrication, and self-assembly. Part III (Applications) covers electrons in nanostructures, molecular electronics, nano-materials and nanobiology. Each chapter starts with a survey of the required basics and ends by making contact with current research literature. Introduction to Nanoscience is also the first text to incorporate the often-neglected topic of complexity in nanosystems, dealing explicity with emergent phenomena from chemistry to biology. Examples include Kramer's theory of reactions (Chapter 3); the Marcus theory of electron transfer (Chapter 8); and enzyme catalysis, molecular motors, and fluctuations in gene expression and splicing, all covered in Chapter 9. In addition, the book includes Richard Feynman's visionary essay, ""There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom,"" which describes the consequences of smallness and quantum behavior.",Science,470,N/A,0,en

Transformative Food Value Chains for Local Development,"Silke Maria Stöber, Wolfgang Bokelmann, Walter Odongo, Susanne Huyskens-Keil, Joanita Kataike",Frontiers Media SA,2024-01-26,"Understanding the capacity of food systems to undertake a transformation towards sustainability requires understanding how resources stream in and out of the systems. As complex socio-economic structures, food and agricultural value chains are important means for channeling resources, knowledge, and agency in and out of rural areas. Given their prominent role on the development agendas, there is mixed evidence as to what extent value chains and their actors can contribute to improving the livelihoods in poor rural and urban areas. In order to shape sustainable living places, transformative capacities and good governance are important mainstays. Transformative agri-food value chains are robust and often act as the sole transmission belt for returning capital, resources and identity back into vulnerable areas. Moreover, domestic or regional chains may provide urban consumers with fresh quality food that also contributes to regional identity.",Technology & Engineering,150,N/A,0,en

Cardiac Rate and Rhythm,"L.N. Bouman, H.

The pacemaker that is the source of this regular ex citation is localised normally within the sinus node ("" sino-atrial node "" node of Keith and Flack), a most intriguing small piece of tissue in the caval corner of the right atrium. A small portion of this node containing a group of probably only a few thousands of cells fires spontaneously, that means without any exter nal influence to trigger their activity. The so called pacemaker cells do this by letting their membrane potential fall to the level where an action potential will start which subsequently activates surrounding cells to fire an action po tential. The first question which is tackled in this book is which processes underly this spontaneous diastolic depolarization. This is discussed in section I, concerning the fundamental properties of pacemaker cells with special refer ence to ionic membrane currents. Although views still quite differ about the exact nature of the membrane processes that cause the automatic pacemaker dis charge there is agreement that diastolic depolarization is brought about by the interaction of a number of ionic current systems, including both inward and out ward going currents.",Medical,675,N/A,0,en

Three-Dimensional Flow in the Root Region of Wind Turbine Rotors,Galih Bangga,kassel university press GmbH,2018-06-20,"This book presents the state of the art in the analyses of three-dimensional flow over rotating wind turbine blades. Systematic studies for wind turbine rotors with different sizes were carried out numerically employing three different simulation approaches, namely the Euler, URANS and DDES methods. The main mechanisms of the lift augmentation in the blade inboard region are described in detail. The physical relations between the inviscid and viscous effects are presented and evaluated, emphasizing the influence of the flow curvature on the resulting pressure distributions. Detailed studies concerning the lift augmentation for large wind turbine rotors are considered as thick inboard airfoils characterized by massive separation are desired to stronger contribute to power production. Special attention is given to the analyses of wind turbine loads and flow field that can be helpful for the interpretation of the occurring physical phenomena. The book is aimed at students, researchers, engineers and physicists dealing with wind engineering problems, but also for a wider audience involved in flow computations.",,183,N/A,0,en

MLA Handbook,The Modern Language Association of America,Modern Language Association,2021-04-22,"Relied on by generations of writers, the MLA Handbook is published by the Modern Language Association and is the only official, authorized book on MLA style. The new, ninth edition builds on the MLA's unique approach to documenting sources using a template of core elements--facts, common to most sources, like author, title, and publication date--that allows writers to cite any type of work, from books, e-books, and journal articles in databases to song lyrics, online images, social media posts, dissertations, and more. With this focus on source evaluation as the cornerstone of citation, MLA style promotes the skills of information and digital literacy so crucial today. The many new and updated chapters make this edition the comprehensive, go-to resource for writers of research papers, and anyone citing sources, from business writers, technical writers, and freelance writers and editors to student writers and the teachers and librarians working with them. Intended for a variety of classroom contexts--middle school, high school, and college courses in composition, communication, literature, language arts, film, media studies, digital humanities, and related fields--the ninth edition of the MLA Handbook offers New chapters on grammar, punctuation, capitalization, spelling, numbers, italics, abbreviations, and principles of inclusive language Guidelines on setting up research papers in MLA format with updated advice on headings, lists, and title pages for group projects Revised, comprehensive, step-by-step instructions for creating a list of works cited in MLA format that are easier to learn and use than ever before A new appendix with hundreds of example works-cited-list entries by publication format, including websites, YouTube videos, interviews, and more Detailed examples of how to find publication information for a variety of sources Newly revised explanations of in-text citations, including comprehensive advice on how to cite multiple authors of a single work Detailed guidance on footnotes and endnotes Instructions on quoting, paraphrasing, summarizing, and avoiding plagiarism A sample essay in MLA format Annotated bibliography examples Numbered sections throughout for quick navigation Advanced tips for professional writers and scholars",Language Arts & Disciplines,339,N/A,0,en

Some government agencies expect WMSDs to be one of the major work-related disorders into the new Millenium. This book contains evaluated scientific information that will help prevent WMSDs, derived from original research and field experience via a Canadian Government sponsored project on work related musculoskeletal disorders. The expert group's goal was twofold: the first objective was to examine the work relatedness of WMSDs in the light of existing literature, and the second was to explore and synthesize information, avenues and approaches that could help in the prevention of WMSDS.",Technology & Engineering,436,N/A,0,en

These topics are traditionally taught in disparate courses, making it hard for data science or computer science students, or professionals, to efficiently learn the mathematics. This self-contained textbook bridges the gap between mathematical and machine learning texts, introducing the mathematical concepts with a minimum of prerequisites. It uses these concepts to derive four central machine learning methods: linear regression, principal component analysis, Gaussian mixture models and support vector machines. For students and others with a mathematical background, these derivations provide a starting point to machine learning texts. For those learning the mathematics for the first time, the methods help build intuition and practical experience with applying mathematical concepts.

Encyclopedia of Geochemistry,William M. White,Springer,2018-07-28,"The Encyclopedia is a complete and authoritative reference work for this rapidly evolving field. Over 300 international scientists, each experts in their specialties, have written over 330 separate topics on different aspects of geochemistry including geochemical thermodynamics and kinetics, isotope and organic geochemistry, meteorites and cosmochemistry, the carbon cycle and climate, trace elements, geochemistry of high and low temperature processes, and ore deposition, to name just a few. The geochemical behavior of the elements is described as is the state of the art in analytical geochemistry. Each topic incorporates cross-referencing to related articles, and also has its own reference list to lead the reader to the essential articles within the published literature. The entries are arranged alphabetically, for easy access, and the subject and author indices are comprehensive and extensive. Geochemistry applies chemical techniques and approaches to understanding the Earth and how it works. It touches upon almost every aspect of earth science, ranging from applied topics such as the search for energy and mineral resources, environmental pollution, and climate change to more basic questions such as the Earth’s origin and composition, the origin and evolution of life, rock weathering and metamorphism, and the pattern of ocean and mantle circulation. Geochemistry allows us to assign absolute ages to events in Earth’s history, to trace the flow of ocean water both now and in the past, trace sediments into subduction zones and arc volcanoes, and trace petroleum to its source rock and ultimately the environment in which it formed. The earliest of evidence of life is provided by chemical and isotopic traces, not fossils, preserved in rocks. Geochemistry has allowed us to unravel the history of the ice ages and thereby deduce their cause. Geochemistry allows us to determine the swings in Earth’s surface temperatures during the ice ages, determine the temperatures and pressures at which rocks have been metamorphosed, and the rates at which ancient magma chambers cooled and crystallized. The field has grown rapidly more sophisticated, in both analytical techniques that can determine elemental concentrations or isotope ratios with exquisite precision and in computational modeling on scales ranging from atomic to planetary.",Science,0,N/A,0,en

Routledge Handbook of International Family Law,"Barbara Stark, Jacqueline Heaton",Routledge,2019-01-30,"Globalisation, and the vast migrations of capital and labour that have accompanied it in recent decades, has transformed family law in once unimaginable ways. Families have been torn apart and new families have been created. Borders have become more porous, allowing adoptees and mail order brides to join new families and women fleeing domestic violence to escape from old ones. People of different nationalities marry, have children, and divorce, not necessarily in that order. They file suits in their respective home states or third states, demanding support, custody, and property. Otherwise law-abiding parents risk jail in desperate efforts to abduct their own children from foreign ex-spouses. The aim of this Handbook is to provide scholars, postgraduate students, judges, and practioners with a broad but authoritative review of current research in the area of International Family Law.

Microwave and Wireless Synthesizers,Ulrich L. Rohde,John Wiley & Sons,1997-08-25,"Over the past decade, great strides have been made in the technology of microwave oscillators and synthesizers, with digital frequency synthesizers in particular attracting much attention. These synthesizers are now being used in virtually all modern signal generators and radio communication equipment. Until now, however, detailed information about their design has been hard to come by-much of it scattered through journal articles-and most books on the subject have taken a primarily theoretical approach. Enter Microwave and Wireless Synthesizers-the first book to emphasize both practical circuit information from RF to millimeter-wave frequencies and up-to-date theory. Based on course material taught by author Ulrich L. Rohde at George Washington University and recent work done by the author at Compact Software, Inc. and Synergy Microwave Corporation, this volume is a complete revision and update of Rohde's landmark text, Digital PLL Frequency Synthesizers: Theory and Design. While it provides all the necessary theory and formulas, it also offers an in-depth look at the practical side of the phase-lock loop (PLL) in synthesizers-including special loops, loop components, and practical circuits-material that is not available in any other book. Rohde explains loop fundamentals, demonstrates the linear approach to oscillator phase noise, discusses the digital direct synthesizer technique, addresses low noise oscillator design, and provides insight into the role and design of crystal oscillators, mixers, phase/frequency discriminators, wideband high-gain amplifiers, programmable dividers, and loop filters. He goes on to cover conventional multiloop synthesizers and survey existing state-of-the-art microwave synthesizer applications. Extensive appendices review the mathematics of useful functions and various applications, including even the complex nonlinear theory of noise in large signal systems such as mixers and oscillators. Microwave and Wireless Synthesizers allows anyone with a PC running either Windows 3.11 or Windows NT to explore real-world design. It uses programs for the solution of digital phase-lock loop systems, tabulates the results, and shows how Bode diagrams are determined by the computer's graphic capabilities. It also includes examples using commercially available linear and nonlinear CAD programs to provide accurate evaluation and optimization of oscillators and other useful circuits and many practical charts. For companies involved in test and communication equipment, this book reduces design and research costs by providing a large number of proven circuits and expediting the design process. It is also an outstanding senior/graduate level textbook for electrical engineering students and an invaluable resource for practicing engineers, senior engineers, and managers who would like to be able to evaluate new trends and techniques in the field.",Technology & Engineering,664,N/A,0,en

Permanent Magnet Synchronous and Brushless DC Motor Drives,Ramu Krishnan,CRC Press,2017-12-19,"Despite two decades of massive strides in research and development on control strategies and their subsequent implementation, most books on permanent magnet motor drives still focus primarily on motor design, providing only elementary coverage of control and converters. Addressing that gap with information that has largely been disseminated only in journals and at conferences, Permanent Magnet Synchronous and Brushless DC Motor Drives is a long-awaited comprehensive overview of power electronic converters for permanent magnet synchronous machines and control strategies for variable-speed operation. It introduces machines, power devices, inverters, and control, and addresses modeling, implementation, control strategies, and flux weakening operations, as well as parameter sensitivity, and rotor position sensorless control. Suitable for both industrial and academic audiences, this book also covers the simulation, low cost inverter topologies, and commutation torque ripple of PM brushless DC motor drives. Simulation of the motor drives system is illustrated with MATLAB® codes in the text. This book is divided into three parts—fundamentals of PM synchronous and brushless dc machines, power devices, inverters; PM synchronous motor drives, and brushless dc motor drives. With regard to the power electronics associated with these drive systems, the author: Explores use of the standard three-phase bridge inverter for driving the machine, power factor correction, and inverter control Introduces space vector modulation step by step and contrasts with PWM Details dead time effects in the inverter, and its compensation Discusses new power converter topologies being considered for low-cost drive systems in PM brushless DC motor drives This reference is dedicated exclusively to PM ac machines, with a timely emphasis on control and standard, and low-cost converter topologies.

Electromagnetic Analysis Using Transmission Line Variables,Maurice Weiner,World Scientific,2001-03-02,"New Edition: Electromagnetic Analysis Using Transmission Line Variables (3rd Edition)Problems in electromagnetic propagation, especially those with complex geometries, have traditionally been solved using numerical methods, such as the method of finite differences. Unfortunately the mathematical methods suffer from a lack of physical appeal. The researcher or designer often loses sight of the physics underlying the problem, and changes in the mathematical formulation are often not identifiable with any physical change.This book employs a relatively new method for solving electromagnetic problems, one which makes use of a transmission line matrix (TLM). The propagation space is imagined to be filled with this matrix. The propagating fields and physical properties (for example, the presence of conductivity) are then mapped onto the matrix. Mathematically, the procedures are identical with the traditional numerical methods; however, the interpretation and physical appeal of the transmission line matrix are far superior. Any change in the matrix has an immediate physical significance. What is also very important is that the matrix becomes a launching pad for many improvements in the analysis (for example, the nature of coherent waves) using more modern notions of electromagnetic waves. Eventually, the purely mathematical techniques will probably give way to the transmission line matrix method.",Science,531,N/A,0,en

Contaminants and Ecological Subsidies,"Johanna M. Kraus, David M. Walters, Marc A. Mills",Springer Nature,2020-10-15,"This volume explores the effects of aquatic contaminants on ecological subsidies and food web exposure at the boundary of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. It provides the first synthesis of the findings and principles governing the “dark side” of contaminant effects on ecological subsidies. Furthermore, the volume provides extensive coverage of the tools being developed to help managers and researchers better understand the implications of contaminants movement and their effects on natural resources and ecosystem processes. Aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are linked through movements of energy and nutrients which subsidize recipient food webs. As a result, contaminants that concentrate in aquatic systems because of the effects of gravity on water and organic matter have the potential to impact both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem processes. Within the last decade, increased attention has been paid to this phenomenon, particularly the effects of aquatic contaminants on resource and contaminant export to terrestrial consumers, and the potential implications for management. This volume, curated and edited by three field leaders, incorporates empirical results, management applications and theoretical synthesis and is a key reference for academics, government researchers and consultants.",Science,384,N/A,0,en

Jurisdiction in International Litigation,Mary Keyes,Federation Press,2005,"Transport and communications technologies have made international disputes common, and a frequent practical issue is which country or countries have jurisdiction to resolve the dispute. Existing literature on private international law tends to emphasize choice of law rather than jurisdiction. Cases tend to show that the practical significance of Jurisdiction has yet to be appreciated. This groundbreaking book fills in these gaps and offers a critical analysis of the principles and the theoretical foundations applied to resolve private international jurisdictional disputes and of the manner in which those principles are applied in practice by: Describing the context in which international jurisdiction disputes are determined Explaining and critically analysing the principles of jurisdiction Explaining and critically analysing the manner in which the principles are applied Identifying the interests which motivate principles and the courts' application of the principles Recommending reforms to the principles by demonstrating that the existing principles of jurisdiction are flawed, and ought to be reformed by taking into account the law's objectives, defined by relevance to state and private interests.",Law,340,N/A,0,en
Statistical Inference for Piecewise-deterministic Markov Processes,"Romain Azais, Florian Bouguet",John Wiley & Sons,2018-07-30,"Piecewise-deterministic Markov processes form a class of stochastic models with a sizeable scope of applications: biology, insurance, neuroscience, networks, finance... Such processes are defined by a deterministic motion punctuated by random jumps at random times, and offer simple yet challenging models to study. Nevertheless, the issue of statistical estimation of the parameters ruling the jump mechanism is far from trivial. Responding to new developments in the field as well as to current research interests and needs, Statistical inference for piecewise-deterministic Markov processes offers a detailed and comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art results. It covers a wide range of general processes as well as applied models. The present book also dwells on statistics in the context of Markov chains, since piecewise-deterministic Markov processes are characterized by an embedded Markov chain corresponding to the position of the process right after the jumps.",Mathematics,306,N/A,0,en

Constitutionalising Secession,David Haljan,Bloomsbury Publishing,2014-11-01,"Constitutionalising Secession proceeds from the question, 'What, if anything, does the law have to say about a secession crisis?' But rather than approaching secession through the optic of political or nationalist institutional accommodation, this book focuses on the underpinnings to a constitutional order as a law-making community, underpinnings laid bare by secession pressures. Relying on the corrosive effects of secession, it explores the deep structure of a constitutional order and the motive forces creating and sustaining that order. A core idea is that the normativity of law is best understood, through a constitutional optic, as an integrative, associative force. Constitutionalising Secession critically analyses conceptions of constitutional order implicit in the leading models of secession, and takes as a leading case-study the judicial and legislative response to secession in Canada. The book therefore develops a concept of constitutionalism and law-making - 'associative constitutionalism' - to describe their deep structure as a continuing, integrative process of association. This model of a dynamic process of value formation can address both the association and the disassociation of constitutional systems.",Law,450,N/A,0,en

This marks a timely contribution to corpus linguistics, as many linguists are choosing to work with empirical data. Corpus based approaches have many advantages and are useful in the comparison of different languages as well as varieties of the same language, but what is often overlooked in such comparisons is the genre of language under examination. As this case study shows, genre is an important factor in interpreting patterns and distributions of forms. The book also contributes toward theories of anaphora, referentiality and Preferred Argument Structure.

Endoscopic Ultrasonography,"Frank G. Gress, Thomas J. Savides",John Wiley & Sons,2016-01-19,"Year on year, there continue to be dramatic changes in endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) since it was first introduced 30 years ago. Advances in technology have meant that as well as being used in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal disorders, EUS is now one of the primary diagnostic and therapeutic modalities used in GI endoscopy. Back and improved for a new edition, Endoscopic Ultrasonography is the market-leading book covering the topic. Written by leading experts in the field, it provides a technical how-to approach to learning this advanced endoscopic procedure. The highly-acclaimed authors provide step-by-step guidance to the fundamentals of EUS, giving clear instructions on the instruments involved, the correct sedation procedures to follow and how EUS should be performed safely and effectively. Every chapter discusses a specific aspect of EUS as it relates to a particular gastrointestinal disorder or organ system. Brand new to this edition are: 1) Seven new chapters on the hottest topics in EUS: Learning Anatomy for EUS; Elastography; Lung Cancer; Autoimmune Pancreatitis; EUS for Liver Disease; Biliary Access; Pancreatic Fluid Collection Drainage 2) A complete update of all previous chapters to reflect the most current clinical recommendations 3) A host of new color images in every chapter Endoscopic Ultrasonography 3rd edition is the ideal tool to consult to improve EUS skills and improve patient management, and an essential purchase for all gastroenterologists and endoscopists.",Medical,312,N/A,0,en

Population-Based Optimization on Riemannian Manifolds,"Robert Simon Fong, Peter Tino",Springer Nature,2022-05-17,"Manifold optimization is an emerging field of contemporary optimization that constructs efficient and robust algorithms by exploiting the specific geometrical structure of the search space. In our case the search space takes the form of a manifold. Manifold optimization methods mainly focus on adapting existing optimization methods from the usual “easy-to-deal-with” Euclidean search spaces to manifolds whose local geometry can be defined e.g. by a Riemannian structure. In this way the form of the adapted algorithms can stay unchanged. However, to accommodate the adaptation process, assumptions on the search space manifold often have to be made. In addition, the computations and estimations are confined by the local geometry. This book presents a framework for population-based optimization on Riemannian manifolds that overcomes both the constraints of locality and additional assumptions. Multi-modal, black-box manifold optimization problems on Riemannian manifolds can be tackled using zero-order stochastic optimization methods from a geometrical perspective, utilizing both the statistical geometry of the decision space and Riemannian geometry of the search space. This monograph presents in a self-contained manner both theoretical and empirical aspects of stochastic population-based optimization on abstract Riemannian manifolds.",Technology & Engineering,171,N/A,0,en

Geometrical Methods of Mathematical Physics,Bernard F. Schutz,Cambridge University Press,1980-01-28,"In recent years the methods of modern differential geometry have become of considerable importance in theoretical physics and have found application in relativity and cosmology, high-energy physics and field theory, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics and mechanics. This textbook provides an introduction to these methods - in particular Lie derivatives, Lie groups and differential forms - and covers their extensive applications to theoretical physics. The reader is assumed to have some familiarity with advanced calculus, linear algebra and a little elementary operator theory. The advanced physics undergraduate should therefore find the presentation quite accessible. This account will prove valuable for those with backgrounds in physics and applied mathematics who desire an introduction to the subject. Having studied the book, the reader will be able to comprehend research papers that use this mathematics and follow more advanced pure-mathematical expositions.",Science,272,N/A,0,en

Topics in the Formal Methodology of Empirical Sciences,Ryszard Wójcicki,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"11 original. Modifications which I introduced are radical and often far going. In my opinion the Polish text had two main drawbacks. It was overloaded with informal considerations and at the same time formal concepts included in some parts of the book were presented in a too complicated way. Of course one of the motives to revise it was also the fact that much time has passed since I finished writing the Polish version and obviously certain decisions and ideas contained in the first edition seem not quite relevant now. So it is not only the desire to make the exposition clearer but also the reasons of substantial nature which motivated writing a revised version. I do not think it desirable to bother the reader with a detailed discussion of all changes to which the Polish version was subjected and that is why I will confine myself to pointing out only the most significant ones. Explanations concerning logical and set-theoretical notions applied in the book have been shortened as much as possible, in the Polish version one whole chapter was devoted to the discussion of them.",Science,289,N/A,0,en

Reductionism has often been seen as the means of bringing the different sciences to a fundamental unity by reference to some basic science, but it shows many limitations. Multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity have also been proposed as methodologies for attaining unity without underestimating the diversity of the sciences.This volume starts with a clarification of the possible meanings of this unity and then discusses the features of the mentioned approaches to unity, evaluating the success and the shortcomings of the unification programme among different sciences and within a single science.",Science,212,N/A,0,en
Dynamics of Aircraft Flight,Gilles Louis,John Wiley & Sons,2022-06-14,"Performance calculations can be classified into three main types: lift, thrust and slope. Firstly, since the lift profile is known and unmodifiable from the time an aircraft is designed, the mass at a given speed or the speed at a given mass must be determined. Then, once the thrust of the engines and the mass are known, the slope must be calculated. Finally, once the slope is known (for example, level flight) as well as the mass, it is necessary to deduce the thrust; this is the position of the throttle control lever that ensures balance. The corresponding consumption must then be defined. Performance specifications for customer aircraft, such as manoeuvrability, fuel consumption, maintenance, safety and testability, have become ever more demanding with each generation of equipment. Major technical advances have been required: wing profiles, engines, materials to reduce mass, etc. This book presents a theoretical approach to flight mechanics that makes it possible to grasp the subject and links it with the empirical approach of manufacturers.",Technology & Engineering,210,N/A,0,en

Beyond Immanence,"Alan J. Torrance, Andrew B. Torrance",Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing,2023-05-25,"Critical insights into Kierkegaard’s influence on Barth’s theology. Karl Barth was often critical of Søren Kierkegaard’s ideas as he understood them. But close reading of the two corpora reveals that Barth owes a lot to the melancholy Dane. Both conceive of God as infinitely qualitatively different from humans, and both emphasize the shocking nearness of God in the incarnation. As public intellectuals, they used this theological vision to protect Christocentric faith from political manipulation and compromise. For Kierkegaard, this meant criticizing the state church; for Barth, this entailed resisting Nazism. Meticulously crafted by a father-son team of renowned systematic theologians, Beyond Immanence demonstrates that Kierkegaard and Barth share a theological trajectory—one that resists cynical manipulation of Christianity for political purposes in favor of uncompromising devotion to a God who is radically transcendent yet established kinship with humanity in time.",Religion,505,N/A,0,en

THE BRONZE STAR MEDAL,"MSG James T. Born, USA, Ret.",AuthorHouse,2013-12-05,"The author is a Vietnam War veteran, having served in the Mekong Delta in 1967. His unit. Mobile Support Team TWO, Detachment Alpha, was a top secret United States Naval Special Warfare team, composed of specially trained personnel from Boat Support Unit One and from SEAL Team's ONE and TWO. In it's inseption,this team was code named ""Project Zulu"". While a lot of what this group of men did is still classified, their main purpose was to disrupt enemy ambushes of PBR river boats and snatch and grab high ranking enemy officials. This was accomplished by counterambushing the enemy deep within the forbidden reaches of the Mekong Delta and its waterways. The team often remained behind the enemy lines in enemy controlled territory for days disrupting their troop and supply movements. The main motivational factor of wrtiing this book was not to highlight what the author did but to provide the general public and historians a chance to read about the valor and sacrifices that were made by 163 officers and enlisted men, from various points in Vietnam and at varrying time frames. It is a snapshot of the real war, not created in mind by Hollywood or from mistruths often found in other books from those stealing the valor.The author himself is a recepient of The Bronze Star Medal with the Combat Distinguishing Device and feels qualified to speek about the trials and tribulations of those featured in the book.

Solar power satellites.,,DIANE Publishing,N/A,"During energy crisis at the end of the Sixties, a new idea to exploit solar energy arose: Solar Power Satellites. These satellites need a huge surface to collect enough solar energy to be beamed on Earth by means of a microwave power transfer system. Different concepts appeared during last forty years and a lot of studies addressing the SPS economical feasibility have been published. In this work a particular concept is considered, the JAXA Reference Concept 2003. It is a formation flying SPS, composed by two reflectors and a central array panel. The objective of the work is to study two major problems this concept presents. Due to its dimensions, the satellite orbit will suffer from important orbital perturbations and since formation flying satellites need a tight orbit control, the first task is to derive an analytical approximation to perform relative perturbed orbit propagation for formation flying satellite. This objective is pursued starting from a H. Schaub’s formulation in which formation flying satellites unperturbed orbit is described by means of an approximated relation function of orbital element differences. This formulation is merged with another approach, developed in a previous work, which gives, analytically, orbital parameters variation when a perturbation acts on the spacecraft. The result is a very interesting algorithm, able to perform the assigned task with a relative error lower than 3% over one simulated orbit. The second objective concerns structural control. It is not possible to consider these huge satellites as rigid bodies, first natural frequencies will be certainly excited during operations. So that, the second task is the study of actuator placement optimization for flexible satellites, very useful for tight pointing requirements. A FEM model is developed modeling the SPS as a frame of beams and a global controllability index is obtained combining modal controllability and component cost analysis. The maximization of this parameter,",,297,N/A,0,en

International Remittance Payments and the Global Economy,"Bharati Basu, James T. Bang",Routledge,2014-08-07,"International Remittance Payments are described mainly as money sent by immigrants to their families and friends in their home countries. These payments provide an important source of income that is mostly used to provide for a variety of basic needs of the non-migrating members of immigrant families and thus remittance payments can be considered as a tool to reduce the poverty level of the labor sending countries. However, remittances are also used for asset accumulation by some families and for some countries they constitute a good part of foreign funds coming into the country. In-spite of their increasing volume over the last few decades, a lot of things about remittances are not known and studies estimate that about half of these money transfers are not even recorded. Since these payments are shown to reduce poverty and help economic progress in the remittance receiving countries, a better knowledge about remittances would help the debates surrounding immigration, remittances and their relation to the global economy. This book provides an overview of remittances in different parts of the world over the last thirty years. It looks at the labor sending and labor receiving countries separately. The text examines the trends, uses, motivations behind sending remittances, cost of sending them and how they are affected by the nature and the development level of different institutional factors. The remittance flows are growing over time and they are used mostly for reducing the uncertainty of life in the less developed parts of the world. However, motivation for sending remittances could be improved and thus remittances could be more conducive to economic development if 1) the relation between the remittance decision and the migration decision is better understood and 2) the costs of international money transfers are reduced. More studies about those issues would benefit the international community. Efforts should be made in all fronts to encourage such international flow of funds not only to have a redistribution of income all over the world, but also to synchronize the efforts towards global economic development and a better integration of the world economy. This book is aimed researchers, policy practitioners and post graduates studying International Economics or International Economic Relations or Political Science or Economic Development.",Business & Economics,281,N/A,0,en

The Diversity of Meaning,L. Jonathan Cohen,Routledge,2021-12-09,"First published in 1962, The Diversity of Meaning was written to provide a more constructive criticism of the philosophy of ordinary language than the more destructive approach that it was commonly subjected to at the time of publication. The book deals with a range of philosophical problems in a way that cuts underneath the more typical orthodoxies of the time. It is concerned primarily with the concept of meaning and asks not just how people ordinarily speak or think about meanings, but also what is gained or lost by their so doing. The author challenges the assumption that there is only one way of talking about meanings and instead argues that no single analysis of meaning can suit the semantics of lexicographers, language-teachers, translators, logicians, historians of ideas, psychologists and philosophers. By examining various common concepts of meaning and their relations to one another, the book sheds light on the issues most alive in philosophical controversy at the time of publication, giving it lasting relevance for those interested in the history of philosophical thought and theory.",Philosophy,384,N/A,0,en

A Minimalist Ontology of the Natural World,"Michael Esfeld, Dirk-Andre Deckert",Routledge,2017-10-25,"This book seeks to work out which commitments are minimally sufficient to obtain an ontology of the natural world that matches all of today’s well-established physical theories. We propose an ontology of the natural world that is defined only by two axioms: (1) There are distance relations that individuate simple objects, namely matter points. (2) The matter points are permanent, with the distances between them changing. Everything else comes in as a means to represent the change in the distance relations in a manner that is both as simple and as informative as possible. The book works this minimalist ontology out in philosophical as well as mathematical terms and shows how one can understand classical mechanics, quantum field theory and relativistic physics on the basis of this ontology. Along the way, we seek to achieve four subsidiary aims: (a) to make a case for a holistic individuation of the basic objects (ontic structural realism); (b) to work out a new version of Humeanism, dubbed Super-Humeanism, that does without natural properties; (c) to set out an ontology of quantum physics that is an alternative to quantum state realism and that avoids any ontological dualism of particles and fields; (d) to vindicate a relationalist ontology based on point objects also in the domain of relativistic physics.",Philosophy,189,N/A,0,en

Editors are the subject of adoration and worship, or of scorn and ridicule, depending upon whether the topic of discussion is your editor or someone else's. vi has been the standard editor for close to 30 years. Popular on Unix and Linux, it has a growing following on Windows systems, too. Most experienced system administrators cite vi as their tool of choice. And since 1986, this book has been the guide for vi. However, Unix systems are not what they were 30 years ago, and neither is this book. While retaining all the valuable features of previous editions, the 7th edition of Learning the vi and vim Editors has been expanded to include detailed information on vim, the leading vi clone. vim is the default version of vi on most Linux systems and on Mac OS X, and is available for many other operating systems too. With this guide, you learn text editing basics and advanced tools for both editors, such as multi-window editing, how to write both interactive macros and scripts to extend the editor, and power tools for programmers -- all in the easy-to-follow style that has made this book a classic. Learning the vi and vim Editors includes: A complete introduction to text editing with vi: How to move around vi in a hurry Beyond the basics, such as using buffers vi's global search and replacement Advanced editing, including customizing vi and executing Unix commands How to make full use of vim: Extended text objects and more powerful regular expressions Multi-window editing and powerful vim scripts How to make full use of the GUI version of vim, called gvim vim's enhancements for programmers, such as syntax highlighting, folding and extended tags Coverage of three other popular vi clones -- nvi, elvis, and vile -- is also included. You'll find several valuable appendixes, including an alphabetical quick reference to both vi and ex mode commands for regular vi and for vim, plus an updated appendix on vi and the Internet. Learning either vi or vim is required knowledge if you use Linux or Unix, and in either case, reading this book is essential. After reading this book, the choice of editor will be obvious for you too.",Computers,494,N/A,0,en

Object Lessons,Jami Bartlett,University of Chicago Press,2016-07-15,"A major contribution to the theory of realism, Jami Bartlett s book analyzes the processes by which literary language renders objects as real entities. Bartlett s approach is to apply theories of reference in the philosophy of language to interactions between characters and objects in nineteenth-century literature. She addresses a fundamental question of literary realism how can language evoke that which is not language? and the ways in which four key English authors answered that question. George Meredith, William Makepeace Thackeray, Elizabeth Gaskell, and Iris Murdoch probe the relationship between words and objects, and provide in their descriptions, characterizations, and plots allegories of language use. Bartlett shows, for example, how the daydreamers of Gaskell s novel ""Cranford"" confronted with objects that they will never have access to and lives they will never lead, build semantic associations between familiar and unfamiliar objects that enable them to understand references that they wouldn t otherwise. Concise and clearly written, ""Object Lessons"" is destined to become a key work in theory of the novel.""",Language Arts & Disciplines,208,N/A,0,en

"International Law for Seagoing Officers, 7th Editi",Craig H Allen,Naval Institute Press,2022-11-15,"The seventh edition of this Blue and Gold Series book brings clarity and context to international law for the seagoing professional. This book is the only work that addresses the international law of the sea from the perspective of the United States. For those who operate on, under and over the sea, international law can sometimes be as complex as it is important. Written by the same former seagoing officer and maritime law professional who authored the current edition of Farwell’s Rules of the Nautical Road, this book was designed to bring clarity and context to international law for the seagoing professional. Following an introduction to public international law and a short history of the law of the sea, the book describes the rules that apply in ports and in the adjacent maritime zones, including the territorial sea, exclusive economic zone, archipelagic waters, and the high seas. A highlight of the book are the chapters that focus on subjects of greatest interest to the seagoing professional, including military and intelligence activities in the maritime domain, maritime law enforcement activities and the use of force at sea. The appendices include the text of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and the U.S. Senate’s “understandings” of key provisions of the convention. Whether an academy cadet, a midshipman, a seasoned commanding officer, or master mariner, readers of this thorough and timely book will be rewarded with a far greater understanding of the international laws that govern ships and mariners at sea. New in this edition: Over a dozen new cases by courts and arbitration panels interpreting UNCLOS, including the South China Sea dispute between the Philippines and China. Coverage of Commercial Seafarer protections under Maritime Labor Convention. Global Responses to the Mediterranean Migrant Crisis. Coverage of the law protecting our vital submarine cables. Expanded coverage of unmanned and autonomous vessels and aircraft. Coverage on vessel health safety and quarantine measures applicable in the COVID-19 Pandemic. A new chapter surveying issues the U.S. Senate should consider in any decision regarding ratification of UNCLOS.

Parts of a Whole,Lucas Champollion,Oxford University Press,2017-03-09,"This book uses mathematical models of language to explain why there are certain gaps in language: things that we might expect to be able to say but can't. For instance, why can we say I ran for five minutes but not *I ran all the way to the store for five minutes? Why is five pounds of books acceptable, but *five pounds of book not acceptable? What prevents us from saying *sixty degrees of water to express the temperature of the water in a swimming pool when sixty inches of water can express its depth? And why can we not say *all the ants in my kitchen are numerous? The constraints on these constructions involve concepts that are generally studied separately: aspect, plural and mass reference, measurement, and distributivity. In this book, Lucas Champollion provides a unified perspective on these domains, connects them formally within the framework of algebraic semantics and mereology, and uses this connection to transfer insights across unrelated bodies of literature and formulate a single constraint that explains each of the judgments above.",Language Arts & Disciplines,331,N/A,0,en

Postmodern Philosophy and the Scientific Turn,Dorothea E. Olkowski,Indiana University Press,2012-04-23,"A groundbreaking, interdisciplinary approach to the study of consciousness: “Beautifully written, engaging throughout, and captivating” (Claire Colebrook, The Pennsylvania State University). What can come of a scientific engagement with postmodern philosophy? Some scientists have claimed that the social sciences and humanities have nothing to contribute, except perhaps peripherally, to their research. Dorothea E. Olkowski shows that mathematics itself—the historic link between science and philosophy—plays a fundamental role in the development of the worldviews that drive both fields. Focusing on language, its usage and expression of worldview, she develops a phenomenological account of human thought and action to explicate the role of philosophy in the sciences. Olkowski proposes a model of phenomenology, both scientific and philosophical, that helps make sense of reality and composes an ethics for dealing with unpredictability in our world.",Philosophy,211,N/A,0,en

House of Leaves,Mark Z. Danielewski,Pantheon,2000-03-07,"THE MIND-BENDING CULT CLASSIC ABOUT A HOUSE THAT’S LARGER ON THE INSIDE THAN ON THE OUTSIDE • A masterpiece of horror and an astonishingly immersive, maze-like reading experience that redefines the boundaries of a novel. ''Simultaneously reads like a thriller and like a strange, dreamlike excursion into the subconscious."" —Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times ""Thrillingly alive, sublimely creepy, distressingly scary, breathtakingly intelligent—it renders most other fiction meaningless."" —Bret Easton Ellis, bestselling author of American Psycho “This demonically brilliant book is impossible to ignore.” —Jonathan Lethem, award-winning author of Motherless Brooklyn One of The Atlantic’s Great American Novels of the Past 100 Years Years ago, when House of Leaves was first being passed around, it was nothing more than a badly bundled heap of paper, parts of which would occasionally surface on the Internet. No one could have anticipated the small but devoted following this terrifying story would soon command. Starting with an odd assortment of marginalized youth—musicians, tattoo artists, programmers, strippers, environmentalists, and adrenaline junkies—the book eventually made its way into the hands of older generations, who not only found themselves in those strangely arranged pages but also discovered a way back into the lives of their estranged children. Now made available in book form, complete with the original colored words, vertical footnotes, and second and third appendices, the story remains unchanged. Similarly, the cultural fascination with House of Leaves remains as fervent and as imaginative as ever. The novel has gone on to inspire doctorate-level courses and masters theses, cultural phenomena like the online urban legend of “the backrooms,” and incredible works of art in entirely unrealted mediums from music to video games. Neither Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Will Navidson nor his companion Karen Green was prepared to face the consequences of the impossibility of their new home, until the day their two little children wandered off and their voices eerily began to return another story—of creature darkness, of an ever-growing abyss behind a closet door, and of that unholy growl which soon enough would tear through their walls and consume all their dreams.",Fiction,738,4.5,18,en
The Book of Prime Number Records,Paulo Ribenboim,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This text originated as a lecture delivered November 20, 1984, at Queen's University, in the undergraduate colloquium series established to honour Professors A. J. Coleman and H. W. Ellis and to acknowledge their long-lasting interest in the quality of teaching undergraduate students. In another colloquium lecture, my colleague Morris Orzech, who had consulted the latest edition of the Guinness Book oj Records, reminded me very gently that the most ""innumerate"" people of the world are of a certain tribe in Mato Grosso, Brazil. They do not even have a word to express the number ""two"" or the concept of plurality. ""Yes Morris, I'm from Brazil, but my book will contain numbers different from 'one.' "" He added that the most boring 800-page book is by two Japanese mathematicians (whom I'll not name), and consists of about 16 million digits of the number 11. ""I assure you Morris, that in spite of the beauty of the apparent randomness of the decimal digits of 11, I'll be sure that my text will also include some words."" Acknowledgment. The manuscript of this book was prepared on the word processor by Linda Nuttall. I wish to express my appreciation for the great care, speed, and competence of her work.

A First Course in Sobolev Spaces,Giovanni Leoni,American Mathematical Soc.,2009,"Sobolev spaces are a fundamental tool in the modern study of partial differential equations. In this book, Leoni takes a novel approach to the theory by looking at Sobolev spaces as the natural development of monotone, absolutely continuous, and BV functions of one variable. In this way, the majority of the text can be read without the prerequisite of a course in functional analysis. The first part of this text is devoted to studying functions of one variable. Several of the topics treated occur in courses on real analysis or measure theory. Here, the perspective emphasizes their applications to Sobolev functions, giving a very different flavor to the treatment. This elementary start to the book makes it suitable for advanced undergraduates or beginning graduate students. Moreover, the one-variable part of the book helps to develop a solid background that facilitates the reading and understanding of Sobolev functions of several variables. The second part of the book is more classical, although it also contains some recent results. Besides the standard results on Sobolev functions, this part of the book includes chapters on BV functions, symmetric rearrangement, and Besov spaces. The book contains over 200 exercises.",Mathematics,626,N/A,0,en

Roth,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2010-05-05,"This book offers a comprehensive, multidimensional look into the major activities, groups, causes, and policing strategies related to global organized crime. Global Organized Crime: A Reference Handbook examines global organized crime dating back to its 17th-century roots. Unlike most works on the subject, which take a parochial approach by concentrating on individual countries or regions, this book uniquely details the impact of 21st-century globalization on such groups and their activities. Exploring the continuum of international organized crime and related developments from its early beginnings to the present era, the book also looks at the complicated issues that continue to influence its growth. It covers the impact of the end of the Cold War, immigration, the global drug trade, weapons sales, human smuggling and trafficking, the convergence of funding sources, and the effects of technology. What especially distinguishes this book is the connections it makes between organized crime activities and failed states, civil wars, political transitions, regional conflicts, and terrorist groups.",Social Science,329,N/A,0,en

Modern Methods in the Calculus of Variations,"Irene Fonseca, Giovanni Leoni",Springer Science & Business Media,2007-08-22,"This is the first of two books on methods and techniques in the calculus of variations. Contemporary arguments are used throughout the text to streamline and present in a unified way classical results, and to provide novel contributions at the forefront of the theory. This book addresses fundamental questions related to lower semicontinuity and relaxation of functionals within the unconstrained setting, mainly in L^p spaces. It prepares the ground for the second volume where the variational treatment of functionals involving fields and their derivatives will be undertaken within the framework of Sobolev spaces. This book is self-contained. All the statements are fully justified and proved, with the exception of basic results in measure theory, which may be found in any good textbook on the subject. It also contains several exercises. Therefore,it may be used both as a graduate textbook as well as a reference text for researchers in the field. Irene Fonseca is the Mellon College of Science Professor of Mathematics and is currently the Director of the Center for Nonlinear Analysis in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University. Her research interests lie in the areas of continuum mechanics, calculus of variations, geometric measure theory and partial differential equations. Giovanni Leoni is also a professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University. He focuses his research on calculus of variations, partial differential equations and geometric measure theory with special emphasis on applications to problems in continuum mechanics and in materials science.",Science,602,N/A,0,en
p-adic Numbers,Fernando Q. Gouvea,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-06-29,"p-adic numbers are of great theoretical importance in number theory, since they allow the use of the language of analysis to study problems relating toprime numbers and diophantine equations. Further, they offer a realm where one can do things that are very similar to classical analysis, but with results that are quite unusual. The book should be of use to students interested in number theory, but at the same time offers an interesting example of the many connections between different parts of mathematics. The book strives to be understandable to an undergraduate audience. Very little background has been assumed, and the presentation is leisurely. There are many problems, which should help readers who are working on their own (a large appendix with hints on the problem is included). Most of all, the book should offer undergraduates exposure to some interesting mathematics which is off the beaten track. Those who will later specialize in number theory, algebraic geometry, and related subjects will benefit more directly, but all mathematics students can enjoy the book.",Mathematics,285,N/A,0,en
"p-adic Numbers, p-adic Analysis, and Zeta-Functions",NEAL Koblitz,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"These lecture notes are intended as an introduction to p-adic analysis on the elementary level. For this reason they presuppose as little background as possi ble. Besides about three semesters of calculus, I presume some slight exposure to more abstract mathematics, to the extent that the student won't have an adverse reaction to matrices with entries in a field other than the real numbers, field extensions of the rational numbers, or the notion of a continuous map of topolog ical spaces. The purpose of this book is twofold: to develop some basic ideas of p-adic analysis, and to present two striking applications which, it is hoped, can be as effective pedagogically as they were historically in stimulating interest in the field. The first of these applications is presented in Chapter II, since it only requires the most elementary properties of Q ; this is Mazur's construction by p means of p-adic integration of the Kubota-Leopoldtp-adic zeta-function, which ""p-adically interpolates"" the values of the Riemann zeta-function at the negative odd integers. My treatment is based on Mazur's Bourbaki notes (unpublished).",Mathematics,134,N/A,0,en

Bestselling authors Kenneth J. Peak and Tamara D. Madensen draw on their many years of combined practitioner and academic experience to explain the importance of criminal justice and show how key trends, emerging issues, historical background, and practical lessons can be applied in the field. New to the Third Edition: An emphasis on constitutional policing, legitimacy, and procedural justice stresses the importance for police to develop a “guardian” mindset over a “soldier” mindset. New discussions of contemporary criminological theories—such as social structure theories, social process theories, social conflict theories, feminist theories, and environmental criminology theories—provide you with a concise explanation on why people commit crimes and how to prevent them in the modern world. An in-depth view of three particularly challenging problems and policy issues—terrorism, the mentally ill population, and illegal immigration—demonstrate how today’s society and the criminal justice system are affected by these issues and what can be done to address the problems. New examples and case studies of ethical dilemmas illustrate today's climate of distrust, dissension, and dysfunction to encourage you to think critically about what is considered “ethical”.

$p$-adic Analysis Compared with Real,Svetlana Katok,American Mathematical Soc.,2007,"The book gives an introduction to $p$-adic numbers from the point of view of number theory, topology, and analysis. Compared to other books on the subject, its novelty is both a particularly balanced approach to these three points of view and an emphasis on topics accessible to undergraduates. in addition, several topics from real analysis and elementary topology which are not usually covered in undergraduate courses (totally disconnected spaces and Cantor sets, points of discontinuity of maps and the Baire Category Theorem, surjectivity of isometries of compact metric spaces) are also included in the book. They will enhance the reader's understanding of real analysis and intertwine the real and $p$-adic contexts of the book. The book is based on an advanced undergraduate course given by the author. The choice of the topic was motivated by the internal beauty of the subject of $p$-adic analysis, an unusual one in the undergraduate curriculum, and abundant opportunities to compare it with its much more familiar real counterpart. The book includes a large number of exercises. Answers, hints, and solutions for most of them appear at the end of the book.

"Distributed Algorithms, second edition",Wan Fokkink,MIT Press,2018-02-02,"The new edition of a guide to distributed algorithms that emphasizes examples and exercises rather than the intricacies of mathematical models. This book offers students and researchers a guide to distributed algorithms that emphasizes examples and exercises rather than the intricacies of mathematical models. It avoids mathematical argumentation, often a stumbling block for students, teaching algorithmic thought rather than proofs and logic. This approach allows the student to learn a large number of algorithms within a relatively short span of time. Algorithms are explained through brief, informal descriptions, illuminating examples, and practical exercises. The examples and exercises allow readers to understand algorithms intuitively and from different perspectives. Proof sketches, arguing the correctness of an algorithm or explaining the idea behind fundamental results, are also included. The algorithms presented in the book are for the most part “classics,” selected because they shed light on the algorithmic design of distributed systems or on key issues in distributed computing and concurrent programming. This second edition has been substantially revised. A new chapter on distributed transaction offers up-to-date treatment of database transactions and the important evolving area of transactional memory. A new chapter on security discusses two exciting new topics: blockchains and quantum cryptography. Sections have been added that cover such subjects as rollback recovery, fault-tolerant termination detection, and consensus for shared memory. An appendix offers pseudocode descriptions of many algorithms. Solutions and slides are available for instructors. Distributed Algorithms can be used in courses for upper-level undergraduates or graduate students in computer science, or as a reference for researchers in the field.",Computers,269,N/A,0,en

Art and Mysticism,"Louise Nelstrop, Helen Appleton",Routledge,2018-06-12,"From the visual and textual art of Anglo-Saxon England onwards, images held a surprising power in the Western Christian tradition. Not only did these artistic representations provide images through which to find God, they also held mystical potential, and likewise mystical writing, from the early medieval period onwards, is also filled with images of God that likewise refracts and reflects His glory. This collection of essays introduces the currents of thought and practice that underpin this artistic engagement with Western Christian mysticism, and explores the continued link between art and theology. The book features contributions from an international panel of leading academics, and is divided into four sections. The first section offers theoretical and philosophical considerations of mystical aesthetics and the interplay between mysticism and art. The final three sections investigate this interplay between the arts and mysticism from three key vantage points. The purpose of the volume is to explore this rarely considered yet crucial interface between art and mysticism. It is therefore an important and illuminating collection of scholarship that will appeal to scholars of theology and Christian mysticism as much as those who study literature, the arts and art history.",Religion,316,N/A,0,en

Advanced Control Methodologies For Power Converter Systems,"Wensheng Luo, Yunfei Yin, Xiangyu Shao, Jianxing Liu, Ligang Wu",Springer Nature,2022-02-16,"This book aims to present some advanced control methodologies for power converters. Power electronic converters have become indispensable devices for plenty of industrial applications over the last decades. Composed by controllable power switches, they can be controlled by effective strategies to achieve desirable transient response and steady-state performance, to ensure the stability, reliability and safety of the system. The most popular control strategy of power converters is the linear proportional–integral–derivative series control which is adopted as industry standard. However, when there exist parameter changes, nonlinearities and load disturbances in the system, the performance of the controller will be significantly degraded. To overcome this problem, many advanced control methodologies and techniques have been developed to improve the converter performance. This book presents the research work on some advanced control methodologies for several types of power converters, including three-phase two-level AC/DC power converter, three-phase NPC AC/DC power converter, and DC/DC buck converter. The effectiveness and advantage of the proposed control strategies are verified via simulations and experiments. The content of this book can be divided into two parts. The first part focuses on disturbance observer-based control methods for power converters under investigation. The second part investigates intelligent control methods. These methodologies provide a framework for controller design, observer design, stability and performance analysis for the considered power converter systems.",Technology & Engineering,218,N/A,0,en

Thomas Aquinas and Contemplation,Rik Van Nieuwenhove,Oxford University Press,2021-02-24,"Contemplation, according to Thomas Aquinas, is the central goal of our life. This study considers the epistemological and metaphysical foundations of the contemplative act; the nature of the active and contemplative lives in light of Aquinas's Dominican calling; the role of faith, charity, and the gifts of the Holy Spirit in contemplation; and contemplation and the beatific vision. Rik Van Nieuwenhove argues that Aquinas espouses a profoundly intellective notion of contemplation in the strictly speculative sense, which culminates in a non-discursive moment of insight (intuitus simplex). In marked contrast to his contemporaries Aquinas therefore rejects a sapiential or affective brand of theology. He also employs a broader notion of contemplation, which can be enjoyed by all Christians, in which the gifts of the Holy Spirit are of central importance. Thomas Aquinas and Contemplation will appeal to readers interested in this key aspect of Aquinas's thought. Van Nieuwenhove provides a lucid account of central aspects of Aquinas's metaphysics, epistemology, theology, and spirituality. He also offers new insights into the nature of the theological discipline as Aquinas sees it, and how theology relates to philosophy.",Religion,318,N/A,0,en

From child thieves, poachers, conmen, prostitutes and would-be suicides to bigamists, highwaymen and murderers, the Cotswolds has had its fair share of criminals – treated in what appears to us today to be an arbitrary and often unduly harsh manner by judges and juries. What crimes were committed in this rural society in the past, and how were they punished? This book looks at the variety of punishments bestowed to miscreants – from being hanged from a portable gallows at the scene of a crime to transportation or hard labour – and why some were punished more than others. Evidence is taken from contemporary sources: prison records, newspaper accounts and broadsides that celebrated the lives and deaths of local characters.

The Hidden History of the Smock Frock,Alison Toplis,Bloomsbury Publishing,2021-04-22,"Winner of the Association of Dress Historians Book of the Year Award, 2022 Traditionally associated with rural ways of life in England, often hand-crafted and held up as one of the only items of English folk dress to survive into the 20th century, the smock frock is an object of curiosity in many museum collections. Drawing on a wide variety of sources from surviving garments to newspapers and photographs, this book reveals the hidden history of the smock frock to present new social histories. Discussing the smock frock in its widest contexts, Alison Toplis explores how garments were handmade and manufactured by the ready-made clothing industry, and bought by men of different trades. She traces the smock frock's usage across England as well as in export markets such as Australia. Following the garment's decline in the late 19th century, the book investigates how this essentially utilitarian style of workwear came to be held up as an example of disappearing 'peasant' craft in an emotional response to urbanisation, and how it was preserved by collectors under the influence of the Arts and Crafts movement. Around the turn of the 20th century, the smock frock was reinvented as both women's and children's wear and is now regularly revived in fashion collections by the likes of Molly Goddard. Drawing together extensive visual and material cultures, Alison Toplis unravels a new history of the smock frock.",Design,223,N/A,0,en

Topics in Constraint-Based Grammar of Japanese,"T. Gunji, K. Hasida",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This collection of papers reports our attempt to sketch how Japanese grammar can be represented in a constraint-based formalism. Our first attempt of this nature appeared a decade ago as Japanese Phrase Structure Grammar (Gunji 1987) and in several papers following the publication of the book. This book has evolved from a technical memo that was a progress report on the Japanese phrase structure grammar (JPSG) project, which was conducted as an activity of the JPSG Working Group at ICOT (Institute for New-Generation Computing Technology) from 1984 to 1992. JPSG implements ideas from recent developments in phrase structure grammar formalism, such as head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG), (see Pollard & Sag 1987, 1994) as applied to the Japanese language. The main goal of this project was to state various grammatical regularities exhibited in natural language in general (and in Japanese in particular) as a set of local constraints. The book is organized in two parts. Part I gives an overview of developments in our framework after the publication of Gunji (1987), introducing our fundamental assumptions as well as discussing various aspects of Japanese in the constraint based formalism and summarizing discussions of the JPSG Working Group during the above-mentioned period. Naturally, in the period after the publication of the above book, our discussion was centered on topics not covered in the book.",Education,267,N/A,0,en

Engineering Applications of Noncommutative Harmonic Analysis,"Gregory S. Chirikjian, Alexander B. Kyatkin",CRC Press,2021-02-25,"First published in 2001. The classical Fourier transform is one of the most widely used mathematical tools in engineering. However, few engineers know that extensions of harmonic analysis to functions on groups holds great potential for solving problems in robotics, image analysis, mechanics, and other areas. For those that may be aware of its potential value, there is still no place they can turn to for a clear presentation of the background they need to apply the concept to engineering problems. Engineering Applications of Noncommutative Harmonic Analysis brings this powerful tool to the engineering world. Written specifically for engineers and computer scientists, it offers a practical treatment of harmonic analysis in the context of particular Lie groups (rotation and Euclidean motion). It presents only a limited number of proofs, focusing instead on providing a review of the fundamental mathematical results unknown to most engineers and detailed discussions of specific applications. Advances in pure mathematics can lead to very tangible advances in engineering, but only if they are available and accessible to engineers. Engineering Applications of Noncommutative Harmonic Analysis provides the means for adding this valuable and effective technique to the engineer's toolbox.",Mathematics,771,N/A,0,en

Translational Dynamics and Magnetic Resonance,Paul T. Callaghan,OUP Oxford,2011-09-15,"Taking the reader through the underlying principles of molecular translational dynamics, this book outlines the ways in which magnetic resonance, through the use of magnetic field gradients, can reveal those dynamics. The measurement of diffusion and flow, over different length and time scales, provides unique insight regarding fluid interactions with porous materials, as well as molecular organisation in soft matter and complex fluids. The book covers both time and frequency domain methodologies, as well as advances in scattering and diffraction methods, multidimensional exchange and correlation experiments and orientational correlation methods ideal for studying anisotropic environments. At the heart of these new methods resides the ubiquitous spin echo, a phenomenon whose discovery underpins nearly every major development in magnetic resonance methodology. Measuring molecular translational motion does not require high spectral resolution and so finds application in new NMR technologies concerned with 'outside the laboratory' applications, in geophysics and petroleum physics, in horticulture, in food technology, in security screening, and in environmental monitoring.",Science,710,N/A,0,en

Frequency Selective Surfaces,Ben A. Munk,John Wiley & Sons,2005-03-11,"""...Ben has been the world-wide guru of this technology, providing support to applications of all types. His genius lies in handling the extremely complex mathematics, while at the same time seeing the practical matters involved in applying the results. As this book clearly shows, Ben is able to relate to novices interested in using frequency selective surfaces and to explain technical details in an understandable way, liberally spiced with his special brand of humor... Ben Munk has written a book that represents the epitome of practical understanding of Frequency Selective Surfaces. He deserves all honors that might befall him for this achievement."" -William F. Bahret. Mr. W. Bahret was with the United States Air Force but is now retired. From the early 50s he sponsored numerous projects concerning Radar Cross Section of airborne platforms in particular antennas and absorbers. Under his leadership grew many of the concepts used extensively today, as for example the metallic radome. In fact, he is by many considered to be the father of stealth technology. ""This book compiles under one cover most of Munk's research over the past three decades. It is woven with the physical insight that he has gained and further developed as his career has grown. Ben uses mathematics to whatever extent is needed, and only as needed. This material is written so that it should be useful to engineers with a background in electromagnetics. I strongly recommend this book to any engineer with any interest in phased arrays and/or frequency selective surfaces. The physical insight that may be gained from this book will enhance their ability to treat additional array problems of their own."" -Leon Peters, Jr. Professor Leon Peters, Jr., was a professor at the Ohio State University but is now retired. From the early sixties he worked on, among many other things, RCS problems involving antennas and absorbers. This book presents the complete derivation of the Periodic Method of Moments, which enables the reader to calculate quickly and efficiently the transmission and reflection properties of multi-layered Frequency Selective Surfaces comprised of either wire and/or slot elements of arbitrary shape and located in a stratified medium. However, it also gives the reader the tools to analyze multi-layered FSS's leading to specific designs of the very important Hybrid Radome, which is characterized by constant band width with angle of incidence and polarization. Further, it investigates in great detail bandstop filters with large as well as narrow bandwidth (dichroic surfaces). It also discusses for the first time, lossy elements used in producing Circuit Analog absorbers. Finally, the last chapter deals with power breakdown of FSS's when exposed to pulsed signals with high peak power. The approach followed by most other presentations simply consists of expanding the fields around the FSS, matching the boundary conditions and writing a computer program. While this enables the user to obtain calculated results, it gives very little physical insight and no help in how to design actual multi-layered FSS's. In contrast, the approach used in this title analyzes all curves of desired shapes. In particular, it discusses in great detail how to produce radomes made of FSS's located in a stratified medium (Hybrid Radomes), with constant band width for all angles of incidence and polarizations. Numerous examples are given of great practical interest. More specifically, Chapter 7 deals with the theory and design of bandpass radomes with constant bandwidth and flat tops. Examples are given for mono-, bi- and tri-planar designs. Chapter 8 deals with bandstop filters with broad as well as narrow bandwidth. Chapter 9 deals with multi-layered FSS of lossy elements, namely the so-called Circuit Analog Absorbers, designed to yield outstanding absorption with more than a decade of bandwidth. Features material previously labeled as classified by the United States Air Force.",Technology & Engineering,442,5,1,en

Energy Harvesting,"Alireza Khaligh, Omer C. Onar",CRC Press,2017-12-19,"Also called energy scavenging, energy harvesting captures, stores, and uses ""clean"" energy sources by employing interfaces, storage devices, and other units. Unlike conventional electric power generation systems, renewable energy harvesting does not use fossil fuels and the generation units can be decentralized, thereby significantly reducing transmission and distribution losses. But advanced technical methods must be developed to increase the efficiency of devices in harvesting energy from environmentally friendly, ""green"" resources and converting them into electrical energy. Recognizing this need, Energy Harvesting: Solar, Wind, and Ocean Energy Conversion Systems describes various energy harvesting technologies, different topologies, and many types of power electronic interfaces for stand-alone utilization or grid connection of energy harvesting applications. Along with providing all the necessary concepts and theoretical background, the authors develop simulation models throughout the text to build a practical understanding of system analysis and modeling. With a focus on solar energy, the first chapter discusses the I−V characteristics of photovoltaic (PV) systems, PV models and equivalent circuits, sun tracking systems, maximum power point tracking systems, shading effects, and power electronic interfaces for grid-connected and stand-alone PV systems. It also presents sizing criteria for applications and modern solar energy applications, including residential, vehicular, naval, and space applications. The next chapter reviews different types of wind turbines and electrical machines as well as various power electronic interfaces. After explaining the energy generation technologies, optimal operation principles, and possible utilization techniques of ocean tidal energy harvesting, the book explores near- and offshore approaches for harvesting the kinetic and potential energy of ocean waves. It also describes the required absorber, turbine, and generator types, along with the power electronic interfaces for grid connection and commercialized ocean wave energy conversion applications. The final chapter deals with closed, open, and hybrid-cycle ocean thermal energy conversion systems.",Science,529,N/A,0,en

Object-oriented Programming Featuring Graphical Applications in Java,Michael Jay Laszlo,Addison Wesley,2002,"The goal of this book is to explore the principle ideas of object-oriented programming using the Java programming language. It begins teaching the object-oriented power of Java by relying on textual commands instead of emphasizing the AWT or Swing libraries, providing the reader with a simple, generic introduction to the OO concepts using Java (without the language details getting in the way of the concept presentation). The author provides a thorough introduction to the three fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming: Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. The presentation of OO theory is augmented by interleaved examples that illustrate these concepts. Most of these program examples are 2-D graphics programs that provide an intuitive context for the issues that must be addressed when learning OOP. Additionally, since graphics programming is one of the strengths of the Java development environment, the examples produce interesting and unexpected images that engage and motivate the reader. It contains a concise introduction to using Design Patterns particularly the Template Method, Iterator, and Composite design patterns which relate to the graphics examples in the book and uses UML class diagrams to show the static structure of systems and sequence diagrams to show object interactions. This book is appropriate for readers who are new to object-oriented (but have experience with a non-object-oriented language) and for programmers who want to learn the graphical elements and capabilities of Java.",Computers,484,N/A,0,en

The Lincoln Highway: A Read with Jenna Pick,Amor Towles,Penguin,2021-10-05,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER More than ONE MILLION copies sold A TODAY Show Read with Jenna Book Club Pick A New York Times Notable Book, a New York Times Readers’ Choice Best Book of the Century, and Chosen by Oprah Daily, Time, NPR, The Washington Post, Bill Gates and Barack Obama as a Best Book of the Year “Wise and wildly entertaining . . . permeated with light, wit, youth.” —The New York Times Book Review “A classic that we will read for years to come.” —Jenna Bush Hager, Read with Jenna book club “Fantastic. Set in 1954, Towles uses the story of two brothers to show that our personal journeys are never as linear or predictable as we might hope.” —Bill Gates “A real joyride . . . elegantly constructed and compulsively readable.” —NPR The bestselling author of A Gentleman in Moscow and Rules of Civility and master of absorbing, sophisticated fiction returns with a stylish and propulsive novel set in 1950s America In June, 1954, eighteen-year-old Emmett Watson is driven home to Nebraska by the warden of the juvenile work farm where he has just served fifteen months for involuntary manslaughter. His mother long gone, his father recently deceased, and the family farm foreclosed upon by the bank, Emmett's intention is to pick up his eight-year-old brother, Billy, and head to California where they can start their lives anew. But when the warden drives away, Emmett discovers that two friends from the work farm have hidden themselves in the trunk of the warden's car. Together, they have hatched an altogether different plan for Emmett's future, one that will take them all on a fateful journey in the opposite direction—to the City of New York. Spanning just ten days and told from multiple points of view, Towles's third novel will satisfy fans of his multi-layered literary styling while providing them an array of new and richly imagined settings, characters, and themes. “Once again, I was wowed by Towles’s writing—especially because The Lincoln Highway is so different from A Gentleman in Moscow in terms of setting, plot, and themes. Towles is not a one-trick pony. Like all the best storytellers, he has range. He takes inspiration from famous hero’s journeys, including The Iliad, The Odyssey, Hamlet, Huckleberry Finn, and Of Mice and Men. He seems to be saying that our personal journeys are never as linear or predictable as an interstate highway. But, he suggests, when something (or someone) tries to steer us off course, it is possible to take the wheel.” – Bill Gates",Fiction,593,N/A,0,en

A Comprehensive Treatment of q-Calculus,Thomas Ernst,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-09-08,"To date, the theoretical development of q-calculus has rested on a non-uniform basis. Generally, the bulky Gasper-Rahman notation was used, but the published works on q-calculus looked different depending on where and by whom they were written. This confusion of tongues not only complicated the theoretical development but also contributed to q-calculus remaining a neglected mathematical field. This book overcomes these problems by introducing a new and interesting notation for q-calculus based on logarithms.For instance, q-hypergeometric functions are now visually clear and easy to trace back to their hypergeometric parents. With this new notation it is also easy to see the connection between q-hypergeometric functions and the q-gamma function, something that until now has been overlooked. The book covers many topics on q-calculus, including special functions, combinatorics, and q-difference equations. Apart from a thorough review of the historical development of q-calculus, this book also presents the domains of modern physics for which q-calculus is applicable, such as particle physics and supersymmetry, to name just a few.​",Mathematics,491,N/A,0,en

"Reinforcement Learning, second edition","Richard S. Sutton, Andrew G. Barto",MIT Press,2018-11-13,"The significantly expanded and updated new edition of a widely used text on reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence. Reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence, is a computational approach to learning whereby an agent tries to maximize the total amount of reward it receives while interacting with a complex, uncertain environment. In Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the field's key ideas and algorithms. This second edition has been significantly expanded and updated, presenting new topics and updating coverage of other topics. Like the first edition, this second edition focuses on core online learning algorithms, with the more mathematical material set off in shaded boxes. Part I covers as much of reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond the tabular case for which exact solutions can be found. Many algorithms presented in this part are new to the second edition, including UCB, Expected Sarsa, and Double Learning. Part II extends these ideas to function approximation, with new sections on such topics as artificial neural networks and the Fourier basis, and offers expanded treatment of off-policy learning and policy-gradient methods.

In order to do this, you’ll need to understand universal concepts, such as functions or cells, which exist in one form or another in all programming languages. The most effective way to understand these universal concepts is to compare two or more languages. In this book, the author has chosen Caml and C. To understand the principles of programming languages, it is also important to learn how to precisely define the meaning of a program, and tools for doing so are discussed.

Judicial Review Handbook,The Hon Sir Michael Fordham,Bloomsbury Publishing,2008-11-05,"Foreword by Lord Woolf, the former Lord Chief Justice. The Judicial Review Handbook is one of the leading works in public law, an indispensable source of reference and a guide to the burgeoning case law in judicial review. Established as an essential part of the library of any practitioner engaged in public law cases, the Judicial Review Handbook offers unrivalled coverage of administrative law, including, but not confined to the work of the Administrative Court and its procedures. But as anyone who has used the previous editions will acknowledge, it is much more than that. The completely revised and up-dated fifth edition is once again structured around 63 unique legal principles supported by a compendious compilation of sources and an unequalled selection of reported case quotations. It also includes essential procedural rules, forms and guidance issued by the Administrative Court. This edition builds on previous editions with deepened coverage of the impact on judicial review of both the Civil Procedure Rules and the Human Rights Act 1998 which, at the time of the previous edition, were both new arrivals in English law. Their impact, and the plethora of cases which explore their meaning and application, are fully analysed and evaluated by Michael Fordham, and quotations from the cases incorporated into the unique appendices of case extracts. The author, a leading member of the English public law bar, has been involved in many of the leading judicial review cases in recent years and is the founding editor of the Judicial Review journal.

Database Theory and Application,"Dominik Slezak, Yanchun Zhang",Springer Science & Business Media,2009-11-24,"As future generation information technology (FGIT) becomes specialized and fr- mented, it is easy to lose sight that many topics in FGIT have common threads and, because of this, advances in one discipline may be transmitted to others. Presentation of recent results obtained in different disciplines encourages this interchange for the advancement of FGIT as a whole. Of particular interest are hybrid solutions that c- bine ideas taken from multiple disciplines in order to achieve something more signi- cant than the sum of the individual parts. Through such hybrid philosophy, a new principle can be discovered, which has the propensity to propagate throughout mul- faceted disciplines. FGIT 2009 was the first mega-conference that attempted to follow the above idea of hybridization in FGIT in a form of multiple events related to particular disciplines of IT, conducted by separate scientific committees, but coordinated in order to expose the most important contributions.

Incommensurability and Cross-Language Communication,Xinli Wang,Routledge,2017-05-15,"A dominant epistemological assumption behind Western philosophy is that it is possible to locate some form of commonality between languages, traditions, or cultures - such as a common language or lexicon, or a common notion of rationality - which makes full linguistic communication between them always attainable. Xinli Wang argues that the thesis of incommensurability challenges this assumption by exploring why and how linguistic communication between two conceptually disparate languages, traditions, or cultures is often problematic and even unattainable. According to Wang's presuppositional interpretation of incommensurability, the real secret of incommensurability lies in the ontological set-ups of two competing presuppositional languages. This book provides many original contributions to the discussion of incommensurability and related issues in philosophy and offers valuable insights to scholars in other fields, such as anthropology, communication, linguistics, scientific education, and cultural studies.",Philosophy,382,N/A,0,en

Probabilistic Graphical Models,"Daphne Koller, Nir Friedman",MIT Press,2009-07-31,"A general framework for constructing and using probabilistic models of complex systems that would enable a computer to use available information for making decisions. Most tasks require a person or an automated system to reason—to reach conclusions based on available information. The framework of probabilistic graphical models, presented in this book, provides a general approach for this task. The approach is model-based, allowing interpretable models to be constructed and then manipulated by reasoning algorithms. These models can also be learned automatically from data, allowing the approach to be used in cases where manually constructing a model is difficult or even impossible. Because uncertainty is an inescapable aspect of most real-world applications, the book focuses on probabilistic models, which make the uncertainty explicit and provide models that are more faithful to reality. Probabilistic Graphical Models discusses a variety of models, spanning Bayesian networks, undirected Markov networks, discrete and continuous models, and extensions to deal with dynamical systems and relational data. For each class of models, the text describes the three fundamental cornerstones: representation, inference, and learning, presenting both basic concepts and advanced techniques. Finally, the book considers the use of the proposed framework for causal reasoning and decision making under uncertainty. The main text in each chapter provides the detailed technical development of the key ideas. Most chapters also include boxes with additional material: skill boxes, which describe techniques; case study boxes, which discuss empirical cases related to the approach described in the text, including applications in computer vision, robotics, natural language understanding, and computational biology; and concept boxes, which present significant concepts drawn from the material in the chapter. Instructors (and readers) can group chapters in various combinations, from core topics to more technically advanced material, to suit their particular needs.",Computers,1270,N/A,0,en

Strain Hardening Cement Composites: Structural Design and Performance,"Kanakubo Toshiyuki, Petr Kabele, Hiroshi Fukuyama, Yuichi Uchida, Haruhiko Suwada, Volker Slowik",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-09-25,"Strain Hardening Cement Composites, SHCC hereafter, demonstrate excellent mechanical behavior showing tensile strain hardening and multiple fine cracks. This strain hardening behavior improves the durability of concrete structures employing SHCC and the multiple fine cracks enhance structural performance. Reliable tensile performance of SHCC enables us to design structures explicitly accounting for SHCC’s tensile properties. Reinforced SHCC elements (R/SHCC) indicate large energy absorbing performance under large seismic excitation. Against various types of loads, R/SHCC elements can be designed by superimposing re-bar performance and SHCC’s tensile performance. This report focuses on flexural design, shear design, FE modeling and anti-seismic design of R/SHCC elements as well as application examples. Establishing design methods for new materials usually leads to exploring application areas and this trend should be demonstrated by collecting actual application examples of SHCC in structures.",Technology & Engineering,95,N/A,0,en

Prolog by Example,"Helder Coelho, Jose C. Cotta",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Prolog has a declarative style. A predicate definition includes both the input and output parameters, and it allows a programmer to define a desired result without being concerned about the detailed instructions of how it is to be computed. Such a declarative language offers a solution to the software crisis, because it is shorter and more concise, more powerful and understandable than present-day languages. Logic highlights novel aspects of programming, namely using the same program to compute a relation and its inverse, and supporting deductive retrieval of informa tion. This is a book about using Prolog. Its real point is the examples introduced from Chapter 3 onwards, and so a Prolog programmer does not need to read Chapters 1 and 2, which are oriented more to teachers and to students, respec tively. The book is recommended for introductory and advanced university courses, where students may need to remember the basics about logic program ming and Prolog, before starting doing. Chapters 1 and 2 were also kept for the sake of unity of the whole material. In Chapter 1 a teaching strategy is explained based on the key concepts of Pro log which are novel aspects of programming. Prolog is enhanced as a computer programming language used for solving problems that involve objects and the relationships between objects.

High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing,"Yuhong He, Qihao Weng",CRC Press,2018-06-27,"High spatial resolution remote sensing is an area of considerable current interest and builds on developments in object-based image analysis, commercial high-resolution satellite sensors, and UAVs. It captures more details through high and very high resolution images (10 to 100 cm/pixel). This unprecedented level of detail offers the potential extraction of a range of multi-resource management information, such as precision farming, invasive and endangered vegetative species delineation, forest gap sizes and distribution, locations of highly valued habitats, or sub-canopy topographic information. Information extracted in high spatial remote sensing data right after a devastating earthquake can help assess the damage to roads and buildings and aid in emergency planning for contact and evacuation. To effectively utilize information contained in high spatial resolution imagery, High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing: Data, Analysis, and Applications addresses some key questions: What are the challenges of using new sensors and new platforms? What are the cutting-edge methods for fine-level information extraction from high spatial resolution images? How can high spatial resolution data improve the quantification and characterization of physical-environmental or human patterns and processes? The answers are built in three separate parts: (1) data acquisition and preprocessing, (2) algorithms and techniques, and (3) case studies and applications. They discuss the opportunities and challenges of using new sensors and platforms and high spatial resolution remote sensing data and recent developments with a focus on UAVs. This work addresses the issues related to high spatial image processing and introduces cutting-edge methods, summarizes state-of-the-art high spatial resolution applications, and demonstrates how high spatial resolution remote sensing can support the extraction of detailed information needed in different systems. Using various high spatial resolution data, the third part of this book covers a range of unique applications, from grasslands to wetlands, karst areas, and cherry orchard trees.",Technology & Engineering,392,5,1,en
The Mathematics and Mechanics of Biological Growth,Alain Goriely,Springer,2017-05-29,"This monograph presents a general mathematical theory for biological growth. It provides both a conceptual and a technical foundation for the understanding and analysis of problems arising in biology and physiology. The theory and methods are illustrated on a wide range of examples and applications. A process of extreme complexity, growth plays a fundamental role in many biological processes and is considered to be the hallmark of life itself. Its description has been one of the fundamental problems of life sciences, but until recently, it has not attracted much attention from mathematicians, physicists, and engineers. The author herein presents the first major technical monograph on the problem of growth since D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson’s 1917 book On Growth and Form. The emphasis of the book is on the proper mathematical formulation of growth kinematics and mechanics. Accordingly, the discussion proceeds in order of complexity and the book is divided into five parts. First, a general introduction on the problem of growth from a historical perspective is given. Then, basic concepts are introduced within the context of growth in filamentary structures. These ideas are then generalized to surfaces and membranes and eventually to the general case of volumetric growth. The book concludes with a discussion of open problems and outstanding challenges. Thoughtfully written and richly illustrated to be accessible to readers of varying interests and background, the text will appeal to life scientists, biophysicists, biomedical engineers, and applied mathematicians alike.",Mathematics,651,N/A,0,en

Models to Code,"Leon Starr, Andrew Mangogna, Stephen Mellor",Apress,2017-06-15,"Learn how to translate an executable model of your application into running code. This is not a book about theory, good intentions or possible future developments. You’ll benefit from translation technology and solid software engineering principles that are demonstrated with concrete examples using an open source tool chain. Models don’t deliver enough value if they are not on a direct path to code production. But to waste time building models that are merely pictures of your code doesn’t add much value either. In this book, you’ll translate detailed, yet platform-independent models that solve real application problems. Using a pragmatic approach, Models to Code quickly dives into two case studies of Executable UML models. The models and code are extensively annotated and illustrate key principles that are emphasized throughout the book. You’ll work with code production using ""C"" as the implementation language and targeting microcomputer class processors. This might not be your particular target language or platform, but you can use you can use what you learn here to engineer or re-evaluate your own code translation system to dramatically increase the value of both your modeling and code generation solution. Written by three leading experts, Models to Code is an exceptional resource for producing software by model translation— add it to your library today. What You'll Learn See how detailed models resolve ambiguity and contradiction common in requirements. Examine how a model can be detailed enough to be executable and testable while remaining platform independent Produce code from a model, leaving the model intact so it can be redeployed on new platforms or adapted to changing software and hardware technology. Implement platform independent model execution rules in platform specific run-time code Who This Book Is For Modelers and systems engineers on active MBSE projects (using Executable UML or not), projects using Simulink, Matlab, Dymola, MatrixX and other math modelling tools.

Scientific Philosophy,Gustavo E. Romero,Springer,2018-11-02,"This textbook presents the basics of philosophy that are necessary for the student and researcher in science in order to better understand scientific work. The approach is not historical but formative: tools for semantical analysis, ontology of science, epistemology, and scientific ethics are presented in a formal and direct way. The book has two parts: one with the general theory and a second part with application to some problems such as the interpretation of quantum mechanics, the nature of mathematics, and the ontology of spacetime. The book addresses questions such as ""What is meaning?"", ""What is truth?"", ""What are truth criteria in science?"", ""What is a theory?"", ""What is a model?"" ""What is a datum?"", ""What is information?"", ""What does it mean to understand something?"", ""What is space?"", ""What is time?"", ""How are these concepts articulated in science?"" ""What are values?"" ""What are the limits of science?"", and many more. The philosophical views presented are ""scientific"" in the sense that they are informed by current science, they are relevant for scientific research, and the method adopted uses the hypothetical-deductive approach that is characteristic of science. The results and conclusions, as any scientific conclusion, are open to revision in the light of future advances. Hence, this philosophical approach opposes to dogmatic philosophy. Supported by end-of-chapter summaries and a list of special symbols used, the material will be of interest for students and researchers in both science and philosophy. The second part will appeal to physicists and mathematicians.",Science,195,N/A,0,en

Automotive Fuels Reference Book,Paul Richards,SAE International,2014-03-05,"The first two editions of this title, published by SAE International in 1990 and 1995, have been best-selling definitive references for those needing technical information about automotive fuels. This long-awaited new edition has been thoroughly revised and updated, yet retains the original fundamental fuels information that readers find so useful. This book is written for those with an interest in or a need to understand automotive fuels. Because automotive fuels can no longer be developed in isolation from the engines that will convert the fuel into the power necessary to drive our automobiles, knowledge of automotive fuels will also be essential to those working with automotive engines. Small quantities of fuel additives increasingly play an important role in bridging the gap that often exists between fuel that can easily be produced and fuel that is needed by the ever-more sophisticated automotive engine. This book pulls together in a single, extensively referenced volume, the three different but related topics of automotive fuels, fuel additives, and engines, and shows how all three areas work together. It includes a brief history of automotive fuels development, followed by chapters on automotive fuels manufacture from crude oil and other fossil sources. One chapter is dedicated to the manufacture of automotive fuels and fuel blending components from renewable sources. The safe handling, transport, and storage of fuels, from all sources, are covered. New combustion systems to achieve reduced emissions and increased efficiency are discussed, and the way in which the fuels’ physical and chemical characteristics affect these combustion processes and the emissions produced are included. There is also discussion on engine fuel system development and how these different systems affect the corresponding fuel requirements. Because the book is for a global market, fuel system technologies that only exist in the legacy fleet in some markets are included. The way in which fuel requirements are developed and specified is discussed.

Fault Diagnosis and Sustainable Control of Wind Turbines,"Silvio Simani, Saverio Farsoni",Butterworth-Heinemann,2018-01-02,"Fault Diagnosis and Sustainable Control of Wind Turbines: Robust Data-Driven and Model-Based Strategies discusses the development of reliable and robust fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant ('sustainable') control schemes by means of data-driven and model-based approaches. These strategies are able to cope with unknown nonlinear systems and noisy measurements. The book also discusses simpler solutions relying on data-driven and model-based methodologies, which are key when on-line implementations are considered for the proposed schemes. The book targets both professional engineers working in industry and researchers in academic and scientific institutions. In order to improve the safety, reliability and efficiency of wind turbine systems, thus avoiding expensive unplanned maintenance, the accommodation of faults in their early occurrence is fundamental. To highlight the potential of the proposed methods in real applications, hardware–in–the–loop test facilities (representing realistic wind turbine systems) are considered to analyze the digital implementation of the designed solutions. The achieved results show that the developed schemes are able to maintain the desired performances, thus validating their reliability and viability in real-time implementations. Different groups of readers—ranging from industrial engineers wishing to gain insight into the applications' potential of new fault diagnosis and sustainable control methods, to the academic control community looking for new problems to tackle—will find much to learn from this work. - Provides wind turbine models with varying complexity, as well as the solutions proposed and developed by the authors - Addresses in detail the design, development and realistic implementation of fault diagnosis and fault tolerant control strategies for wind turbine systems - Addresses the development of sustainable control solutions that, in general, do not require the introduction of further or redundant measurements - Proposes active fault tolerant ('sustainable') solutions that are able to maintain the wind turbine working conditions with gracefully degraded performance before required maintenance can occur - Presents full coverage of the diagnosis and fault tolerant control problem, starting from the modeling and identification and finishing with diagnosis and fault tolerant control approaches - Provides MATLAB and Simulink codes for the solutions proposed",Technology & Engineering,230,N/A,0,en

Automated Biometrics,David D. Zhang,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-11-11,"Biometrics-based authentication and identification are emerging as the most reliable method to authenticate and identify individuals. Biometrics requires that the person to be identified be physically present at the point-of-identification and relies on `something which you are or you do' to provide better security, increased efficiency, and improved accuracy. Automated biometrics deals with physiological or behavioral characteristics such as fingerprints, signature, palmprint, iris, hand, voice and face that can be used to authenticate a person's identity or establish an identity from a database. With rapid progress in electronic and Internet commerce, there is also a growing need to authenticate the identity of a person for secure transaction processing. Designing an automated biometrics system to handle large population identification, accuracy and reliability of authentication are challenging tasks. Currently, there are over ten different biometrics systems that are either widely used or under development. Some automated biometrics, such as fingerprint identification and speaker verification, have received considerable attention over the past 25 years, and some issues like face recognition and iris-based authentication have been studied extensively resulting in successful development of biometrics systems in commercial applications. However, very few books are exclusively devoted to such issues of automated biometrics. Automated Biometrics: Technologies and Systems systematically introduces the technologies and systems, and explores how to design the corresponding systems with in-depth discussion. The issues addressed in this book are highly relevant to many fundamental concerns of both researchers and practitioners of automated biometrics in computer and system security.",Computers,336,N/A,0,en

Now Bob is determined to organize an expedition to learn Bender's fate-whatever the cost. But nothing is ever simple in the Bobiverse. Bob's descendants are out to the 24th generation now, and replicative drift has produced individuals who can barely be considered Bobs anymore. Some of them oppose Bob's plan; others have plans of their own. The out-of-control moots are the least of the Bobiverse's problems. Undaunted, Bob and his allies follow Bender's trail.

Applied Econometrics with R,"Christian Kleiber, Achim Zeileis",Springer Science & Business Media,2008-12-10,"R is a language and environment for data analysis and graphics. It may be considered an implementation of S, an award-winning language initially - veloped at Bell Laboratories since the late 1970s. The R project was initiated by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, in the early 1990s, and has been developed by an international team since mid-1997. Historically, econometricians have favored other computing environments, some of which have fallen by the wayside, and also a variety of packages with canned routines. We believe that R has great potential in econometrics, both for research and for teaching. There are at least three reasons for this: (1) R is mostly platform independent and runs on Microsoft Windows, the Mac family of operating systems, and various ?avors of Unix/Linux, and also on some more exotic platforms. (2) R is free software that can be downloaded and installed at no cost from a family of mirror sites around the globe, the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN); hence students can easily install it on their own machines. (3) R is open-source software, so that the full source code is available and can be inspected to understand what it really does, learn from it, and modify and extend it. We also like to think that platform independence and the open-source philosophy make R an ideal environment for reproducible econometric research.",Business & Economics,229,5,1,en

"Meaning, Truth, and Reference in Historical Representation",Frank R. Ankersmit,Cornell University Press,2012-04-24,"In this book, the noted intellectual historian Frank Ankersmit provides a systematic account of the problems of reference, truth, and meaning in historical writing. He works from the conviction that the historicist account of historical writing, associated primarily with Leopold von Ranke and Wilhelm von Humboldt, is essentially correct but that its original idealist and romanticist idiom needs to be translated into more modern terms. Rehabilitating historicism for the contemporary philosophy of history, he argues, ""reveals the basic truths about the nature of the past itself, how we relate to it, and how we make sense of the past in historical writing."" At the heart of Ankersmit's project is a sharp distinction between interpretation and representation. The historical text, he holds, is first and foremost a representation of some part of the past, not an interpretation. The book's central chapters address the concept of historical representation from the perspectives of reference, truth, and meaning. Ankersmit then goes on to discuss the possible role of experience in the history writing, which leads directly to a consideration of subjectivity and ethics in the historian's practice. Ankersmit concludes with a chapter on political history, which he maintains is the ""basis and condition of all other variants of historical writing."" Ankersmit’s rehabilitation of historicism is a powerfully original and provocative contribution to the debate about the nature of historical writing.",History,279,N/A,0,en

Several People Are Typing,Calvin Kasulke,Anchor,2021-08-31,"A Good Morning America Book Club Pick! • A work-from-home comedy where WFH meets WTF. ""An absurd, hilarious romp through the haunted house of late-stage capitalism.""—Carmen Maria Machado, author of In the Dream House Told entirely through clever and captivating Slack messages, this irresistible, relatable satire of both virtual work and contemporary life is The Office for a new world. Gerald, a mid-level employee of a New York–based public relations firm has been uploaded into the company’s internal Slack channels—at least his consciousness has. His colleagues assume it’s an elaborate gag to exploit the new work-from home policy, but now that Gerald’s productivity is through the roof, his bosses are only too happy to let him work from . . . wherever he says he is. Faced with the looming abyss of a disembodied life online, Gerald enlists his co-worker Pradeep to help him escape, and to find out what happened to his body. But the longer Gerald stays in the void, the more alluring and absurd his reality becomes. Meanwhile, Gerald’s colleagues have PR catastrophes of their own to handle in the real world. Their biggest client, a high-end dog food company, is in the midst of recalling a bad batch of food that’s allegedly poisoning Pomeranians nationwide. And their CEO suspects someone is sabotaging his office furniture. And if Gerald gets to work from home all the time, why can’t everyone? Is true love possible between two people, when one is just a line of text in an app? And what in the hell does the :dusty-stick: emoji mean? In a time when office paranoia and politics have followed us home, Calvin Kasulke is here to capture the surprising, absurd, and fully-relatable factors attacking our collective sanity…and give us hope that we can still find a human connection.",Fiction,286,N/A,0,en

"Using R for Introductory Statistics, Second Edition",John Verzani,CRC Press,2014-06-26,"The second edition of a bestselling textbook, Using R for Introductory Statistics guides students through the basics of R, helping them overcome the sometimes steep learning curve. The author does this by breaking the material down into small, task-oriented steps. The second edition maintains the features that made the first edition so popular, while updating data, examples, and changes to R in line with the current version. See What’s New in the Second Edition: Increased emphasis on more idiomatic R provides a grounding in the functionality of base R. Discussions of the use of RStudio helps new R users avoid as many pitfalls as possible. Use of knitr package makes code easier to read and therefore easier to reason about. Additional information on computer-intensive approaches motivates the traditional approach. Updated examples and data make the information current and topical. The book has an accompanying package, UsingR, available from CRAN, R’s repository of user-contributed packages. The package contains the data sets mentioned in the text (data(package=""UsingR"")), answers to selected problems (answers()), a few demonstrations (demo()), the errata (errata()), and sample code from the text. The topics of this text line up closely with traditional teaching progression; however, the book also highlights computer-intensive approaches to motivate the more traditional approach. The authors emphasize realistic data and examples and rely on visualization techniques to gather insight. They introduce statistics and R seamlessly, giving students the tools they need to use R and the information they need to navigate the sometimes complex world of statistical computing.",Mathematics,522,N/A,0,en
Generalized Additive Models,Simon Wood,CRC Press,2006-02-27,"Now in widespread use, generalized additive models (GAMs) have evolved into a standard statistical methodology of considerable flexibility. While Hastie and Tibshirani's outstanding 1990 research monograph on GAMs is largely responsible for this, there has been a long-standing need for an accessible introductory treatment of the subject that also emphasizes recent penalized regression spline approaches to GAMs and the mixed model extensions of these models. Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R imparts a thorough understanding of the theory and practical applications of GAMs and related advanced models, enabling informed use of these very flexible tools. The author bases his approach on a framework of penalized regression splines, and builds a well-grounded foundation through motivating chapters on linear and generalized linear models. While firmly focused on the practical aspects of GAMs, discussions include fairly full explanations of the theory underlying the methods. Use of the freely available R software helps explain the theory and illustrates the practicalities of linear, generalized linear, and generalized additive models, as well as their mixed effect extensions. The treatment is rich with practical examples, and it includes an entire chapter on the analysis of real data sets using R and the author's add-on package mgcv. Each chapter includes exercises, for which complete solutions are provided in an appendix. Concise, comprehensive, and essentially self-contained, Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R prepares readers with the practical skills and the theoretical background needed to use and understand GAMs and to move on to other GAM-related methods and models, such as SS-ANOVA, P-splines, backfitting and Bayesian approaches to smoothing and additive modelling.",Mathematics,412,N/A,0,en

Constructing Frames of Reference,Lewis R. Binford,University of California Press,2019-05-07,"Many consider Lewis Binford to be the single most influential figure in archaeology in the last half-century. His contributions to the ""New Archaeology"" changed the course of the field, as he argued for the development of a scientifically rigorous framework to guide the excavation and interpretation of the archaeological record. This book, the culmination of Binford's intellectual legacy thus far, presents a detailed description of his methodology and its significance for understanding hunter-gatherer cultures on a global basis. This landmark publication will be an important step in understanding the great process of cultural evolution and will change the way archaeology proceeds as a scientific enterprise. This work provides a major synthesis of an enormous body of cultural and environmental information and offers many original insights into the past. Binford helped pioneer what is now called ""ethnoarchaeology""—the study of living societies to help explain cultural patterns in the archaeological record—and this book is grounded on a detailed analysis of ethnographic data from about 340 historically known hunter-gatherer populations. The methodological framework based on this data will reshape the paradigms through which we understand human culture for years to come.",Social Science,583,N/A,0,en

Power of Position,Robert D. Montoya,MIT Press,2022-05-24,"How biodiversity classification, with its ranking of species, has social and political implications as well as implications for the field of information studies. The idea that species live in nature as pure and clear-cut named individuals is a fiction, as scientists well know. According to Robert D. Montoya, classifications are powerful mechanisms and we must better attend to the machinations of power inherent in them, as well as to how the effects of this power proliferate beyond the boundaries of their original intent. We must acknowledge the many ways our classifications are implicated in environmental, ecological, and social justice work—and information specialists must play a role in updating our notions of what it means to classify. In Power of Position, Montoya shows how classifications are systems that relate one entity with other entities, requiring those who construct a system to value an entity’s relative importance—by way of its position—within a system of other entities. These practices, says Montoya, are important ways of constituting and exerting power. Classification also has very real-world consequences. An animal classified as protected and endangered, for example, is protected by law. Montoya also discusses the Catalogue of Life, a new kind of composite classification that reconciles many local (“traditional”) taxonomies, forming a unified taxonomic backbone structure for organizing biological data. Finally, he shows how the theories of information studies are applicable to realms far beyond those of biological classification.",Science,267,N/A,0,en
"Energy, the Subtle Concept",Jennifer Coopersmith,OUP Oxford,2015-05-14,"Energy is at the heart of physics and of huge importance to society and yet no book exists specifically to explain it, and in simple terms. In tracking the history of energy, this book is filled with the thrill of the chase, the mystery of smoke and mirrors, and presents a fascinating human-interest story. Moreover, following the history provides a crucial aid to understanding: this book explains the intellectual revolutions required to comprehend energy, revolutions as profound as those stemming from Relativity and Quantum Theory. Texts by Descartes, Leibniz, Bernoulli, d'Alembert, Lagrange, Hamilton, Boltzmann, Clausius, Carnot and others are made accessible, and the engines of Watt and Joule are explained. Many fascinating questions are covered, including: - Why just kinetic and potential energies - is one more fundamental than the other? - What are heat, temperature and action? - What is the Hamiltonian? - What have engines to do with physics? - Why did the steam-engine evolve only in England? - Why S=klogW works and why temperature is IT. Using only a minimum of mathematics, this book explains the emergence of the modern concept of energy, in all its forms: Hamilton's mechanics and how it shaped twentieth-century physics, and the meaning of kinetic energy, potential energy, temperature, action, and entropy. It is as much an explanation of fundamental physics as a history of the fascinating discoveries that lie behind our knowledge today.",Science,441,N/A,0,en

Phase-lock Demodulation of a PM Signal Contaminated with Incidental AM,George B. Robinson,N/A,1972,"Signals from phase-modulated satellite transmitters usually exhibit some degree of incidental amplitude modulation. The effects of incidental AM are analyzed when this type of signal is demodulated by a phase-lock receiver which does not employ a limiter preceding the loop phase detector. The presence of incidental AM causes a reduction in the receiver output signal-to-noise ratio. The tolerable level of AM decreases in proportion to the phase modulation index Beta. For a square-wave modulating signal, a 1 db reduction results at the receiver PM channel output when Beta = 1 radian and the percentage of AM = 23, Beta = 1.2 radians and the percentage of AM = 16, or Beta = 1.5 radians and the percentage of AM = 4. Although only the PM channel of the receiver is used ordinarily, utilizing both the AM and PM channel by summing offers an improvement in S/N relative to the S/N ratio of the PM channel if the percentage of incidental AM is greater than fifteen.",Amplitude modulation,68,N/A,0,en

Behave,Robert M. Sapolsky,Penguin,2017-05-02,"Why do we do the things we do? Over a decade in the making, this game-changing book is Robert Sapolsky's genre-shattering attempt to answer that question as fully as perhaps only he could, looking at it from every angle. Sapolsky's storytelling concept is delightful but it also has a powerful intrinsic logic: he starts by looking at the factors that bear on a person's reaction in the precise moment a behavior occurs, and then hops back in time from there, in stages, ultimately ending up at the deep history of our species and its genetic inheritance. And so the first category of explanation is the neurobiological one. What goes on in a person's brain a second before the behavior happens? Then he pulls out to a slightly larger field of vision, a little earlier in time: What sight, sound, or smell triggers the nervous system to produce that behavior? And then, what hormones act hours to days earlier to change how responsive that individual is to the stimuli which trigger the nervous system? By now, he has increased our field of vision so that we are thinking about neurobiology and the sensory world of our environment and endocrinology in trying to explain what happened. Sapolsky keeps going--next to what features of the environment affected that person's brain, and then back to the childhood of the individual, and then to their genetic makeup. Finally, he expands the view to encompass factors larger than that one individual. How culture has shaped that individual's group, what ecological factors helped shape that culture, and on and on, back to evolutionary factors thousands and even millions of years old. The result is one of the most dazzling tours de horizon of the science of human behavior ever attempted, a majestic synthesis that harvests cutting-edge research across a range of disciplines to provide a subtle and nuanced perspective on why we ultimately do the things we do...for good and for ill. Sapolsky builds on this understanding to wrestle with some of our deepest and thorniest questions relating to tribalism and xenophobia, hierarchy and competition, morality and free will, and war and peace. Wise, humane, often very funny, Behave is a towering achievement, powerfully humanizing, and downright heroic in its own right.",Science,802,5,2,en

Geostatistical Simulations,"M. Armstrong, P.A. Dowd",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-06-29,"When this two-day meeting was proposed, it was certainly not conceived as a celebration, much less as a party. However, on reflection, this might have been a wholly appropriate gesture because geostatistical simulation came of age this year: it is now 21 years since it was first proposed and implemented in the form of the turning bands method. The impetus for the original development was the mining industry, principally the problems encountered in mine planning and design based on smoothed estimates which did not reflect the degree of variability and detail present in the real, mined values. The sustained period of development over recent years has been driven by hydrocarbon applications. In addition to the original turning bands method there are now at least six other established methods of geostatistical simulation. Having reached adulthood, it is entirely appropriate that geostatistical simulation should now be subjected to an intense period of reflection and assessment. That we have now entered this period was evident in many of the papers and much of the discussion at the Fontainebleau meeting. Many questions were clearly articulated for the first time and, although many ofthem were not unambiguously answered, their presentation at the meeting and publication in this book will generate confirmatory studies and further research.",Mathematics,258,N/A,0,en

Montaigne & Melancholy,Michael Andrew Screech,Rowman & Littlefield,2000,"Montaigne (1533-1592), the personification of philosophical calm, had to struggle to become the wise Renaissance humanist we know. His balanced temperament, sanguine and melancholic, promised genius but threatened madness. When he started his Essays, Montaigne was upset by an attack of melancholy humor: He became temperamental and unbalanced. Writing about himself restored the balance but broke an age-old taboo--happily so, for he discovered profound truths about himself and about our human condition. His charm and humor have made his writings widely enjoyed and admired.",Literary Collections,222,3,1,en

Dynamic Stochastic Optimization,"Kurt Marti, Yuri Ermoliev, Georg Ch. Pflug",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Uncertainties and changes are pervasive characteristics of modern systems involving interactions between humans, economics, nature and technology. These systems are often too complex to allow for precise evaluations and, as a result, the lack of proper management (control) may create significant risks. In order to develop robust strategies we need approaches which explic itly deal with uncertainties, risks and changing conditions. One rather general approach is to characterize (explicitly or implicitly) uncertainties by objec tive or subjective probabilities (measures of confidence or belief). This leads us to stochastic optimization problems which can rarely be solved by using the standard deterministic optimization and optimal control methods. In the stochastic optimization the accent is on problems with a large number of deci sion and random variables, and consequently the focus ofattention is directed to efficient solution procedures rather than to (analytical) closed-form solu tions. Objective and constraint functions of dynamic stochastic optimization problems have the form of multidimensional integrals of rather involved in that may have a nonsmooth and even discontinuous character - the tegrands typical situation for ""hit-or-miss"" type of decision making problems involving irreversibility ofdecisions or/and abrupt changes ofthe system. In general, the exact evaluation of such functions (as is assumed in the standard optimization and control theory) is practically impossible. Also, the problem does not often possess the separability properties that allow to derive the standard in control theory recursive (Bellman) equations.",Science,337,N/A,0,en

Together with its companion volume, it provides an integrated and coherent account of how to study behavior. Most topics treated in traditional research methods texts are covered in detail, with particular reference to behavior as a subject matter. However, the work is distinctive from other texts in that its topics are organized not around inferential statistical methods, but the needs of a behavioral subject matter and the goal of bringing the researcher's behavior under its control.

A most welcome addition to the Kingsbridge series."" --The Washington Post It is 997 CE, the end of the Dark Ages. England is facing attacks from the Welsh in the west and the Vikings in the east. Those in power bend justice according to their will, regardless of ordinary people and often in conflict with the king. Without a clear rule of law, chaos reigns. In these turbulent times, three characters find their lives intertwined. A young boatbuilder's life is turned upside down when his home is raided by Vikings, forcing him and his family to move and start their lives anew in a small hamlet where he does not fit in. . . . A Norman noblewoman marries for love, following her husband across the sea to a new land, but the customs of her husband's homeland are shockingly different, and it soon becomes clear to her that a single misstep could be catastrophic. . . . A monk dreams of transforming his humble abbey into a center of learning that will be admired throughout Europe. And each in turn comes into dangerous conflict with a clever and ruthless bishop who will do anything to increase his wealth and power. Thirty years ago, Ken Follett published his most popular novel, The Pillars of the Earth.

The Frontiers of Women's Writing,Brigitte Georgi-Findlay,University of Arizona Press,2022-05-10,"Although the myth of the American frontier is largely the product of writings by men, a substantial body of writings by women exists that casts the era of western expansion in a different light. In this study of American women's writings about the West between 1830 and 1930, a European scholar provides a reconstruction and new vision of frontier narrative from a perspective that has frequently been overlooked or taken for granted in discussions of the frontier. Brigitte Georgi-Findlay presents a range of writings that reflects the diversity of the western experience. Beginning with the narratives of Caroline Kirkland and other women of the early frontier, she reviews the diaries of the overland trails; letters and journals of the wives of army officers during the Indian wars; professional writings, focusing largely on travel, by women such as Caroline Leighton from the regional publishing cultures that emerged in the Far West during the last quarter of the century; and late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century accounts of missionaries and teachers on Indian reservations. Most of the writers were white, literate women who asserted their own kind of cultural authority over the lands and people they encountered. Their accounts are not only set in relation to a masculine frontier myth but also investigated for clues about their own involvement with territorial expansion. By exploring the various ways in which women writers actively contributed to and at times rejected the development of a national narrative of territorial expansion based on empire building and colonization, the author shows how their accounts are implicated in expansionist processes at the same time that they formulate positions of innocence and detachment. Georgi-Findlay has drawn on American studies scholarship, feminist criticism, and studies of colonial discourse to examine the strategies of women's representation in writing about the West in ways that most theorists have not. She critiques generally accepted stereotypes and assumptions--both about women's writing and its difference of view in particular, and about frontier discourse and the rhetoric of westward expansion in general--as she offers a significant contribution to literary studies of the West that will challenge scholars across a wide range of disciplines.",Literary Criticism,374,N/A,0,en

Design Patterns Explained,"Alan Shalloway, James R. Trott",Pearson Education,2004-10-12,"""One of the great things about the book is the way the authors explain concepts very simply using analogies rather than programming examples–this has been very inspiring for a product I'm working on: an audio-only introduction to OOP and software development."" –Bruce Eckel ""...I would expect that readers with a basic understanding of object-oriented programming and design would find this book useful, before approaching design patterns completely. Design Patterns Explained complements the existing design patterns texts and may perform a very useful role, fitting between introductory texts such as UML Distilled and the more advanced patterns books."" –James Noble Leverage the quality and productivity benefits of patterns–without the complexity! Design Patterns Explained, Second Edition is the field's simplest, clearest, most practical introduction to patterns. Using dozens of updated Java examples, it shows programmers and architects exactly how to use patterns to design, develop, and deliver software far more effectively. You'll start with a complete overview of the fundamental principles of patterns, and the role of object-oriented analysis and design in contemporary software development. Then, using easy-to-understand sample code, Alan Shalloway and James Trott illuminate dozens of today's most useful patterns: their underlying concepts, advantages, tradeoffs, implementation techniques, and pitfalls to avoid. Many patterns are accompanied by UML diagrams. Building on their best-selling First Edition, Shalloway and Trott have thoroughly updated this book to reflect new software design trends, patterns, and implementation techniques. Reflecting extensive reader feedback, they have deepened and clarified coverage throughout, and reorganized content for even greater ease of understanding. New and revamped coverage in this edition includes Better ways to start ""thinking in patterns"" How design patterns can facilitate agile development using eXtreme Programming and other methods How to use commonality and variability analysis to design application architectures The key role of testing into a patterns-driven development process How to use factories to instantiate and manage objects more effectively The Object-Pool Pattern–a new pattern not identified by the ""Gang of Four"" New study/practice questions at the end of every chapter Gentle yet thorough, this book assumes no patterns experience whatsoever. It's the ideal ""first book"" on patterns, and a perfect complement to Gamma's classic Design Patterns. If you're a programmer or architect who wants the clearest possible understanding of design patterns–or if you've struggled to make them work for you–read this book.",Computers,449,5,1,en

Rethinking Global Health,Rochelle A. Burgess,Taylor & Francis,2023-09-29,"This book reflects and analyses the working of power in the field of global health– and what this goes on to produce. In so doing, Rethinking Global Health asks the pivotal questions of, ‘who is global health for’ and ‘what is it that limits our ability to build responses that meet people where they are?’ Covering a wide range of topics from global mental health to Ebola, this book combines power analyses with interviews and personal reflections spanning the author’s decade-long career in global health. It interrogates how the search for global solutions can often end up far from where we anticipated. It also introduces readers to different frameworks for power analyses in the field, including an adaptation of the ‘matrix of domination’ for global health practice. Through this work, Dr Burgess develops a new model of Transformative Global Health, a framework that calls researchers and practitioners to adopt new orienting principles, placing community interests and voices at the heart of global health planning and solutions at all times. This book will be beneficial to students and academics working in the global and public health landscape.

Strategic Contracting for Health Systems and Services,Jean Perrot,Transaction Publishers,2012,"Until the start of the new century, efforts to strengthen health systems focused solely on the public sector and health programs overseen by public bodies. The private sector was sidelined in certain countries and even banned in others. At the same time, some private-sector stakeholders readily adapted themselves to this special situation so as to avoid becoming part of a structured health system. This volume notes profound changes in health care around the world in two areas. The stakeholders involved in the health sector are increasing in number and diversifying as a result of the development of the private sector. They are also responding to a process of democratization and decentralization. These developments have been paralleled by greater functional differentiation. Various stakeholders are increasingly specializing in particular areas of the health system: service delivery, procurement, management, financing, and regulation. The interdependence of health stakeholders becomes more evident along with the increased complexity of delivery systems as these respond to changing demand. There is a compelling need to forge relationships. Such relationships are in fact emerging in developed countries and, more recently, in developing countries. They may be informal, but are increasingly organized and structured.",Medical,561,N/A,0,en

Space and Time in Languages and Cultures,"Luna Filipovi?, Kasia M. Jaszczolt, Katarzyna M. Jaszczolt",John Benjamins Publishing,2012,"This is an interdisciplinary volume that focuses on the central topic of the representation of events, namely cross-cultural differences in representing time and space, as well as various aspects of the conceptualisation of space and time. It brings together research on space and time from a variety of angles, both theoretical and methodological. Crossing boundaries between and among disciplines such as linguistics, psychology, philosophy, or anthropology forms a creative platform in a bold attempt to reveal the complex interaction of language, culture, and cognition in the context of human communication and interaction. The authors address the nature of spatial and temporal constructs from a number of perspectives, such as cultural specificity in determining time intervals in an Amazonian culture, distinct temporalities in a specific Mongolian hunter community, Russian-specific conceptualisation of temporal relations, Seri and Yucatec frames of spatial reference, memory of events in space and time, and metaphorical meaning stemming from perception and spatial artefacts, to name but a few themes. The topic of space and time in language and culture is also represented, from a different albeit related point of view, in the sister volume Space and Time in Languages and Cultures: Linguistic Diversity (HCP 36) which focuses on the language-specific vis-à-vis universal aspects of linguistic representation of spatial and temporal reference.",Language Arts & Disciplines,378,N/A,0,en

The Logic of Time,Johan van Benthem,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"That philosophical themes could be studied in an exact manner by logical meanS was a delightful discovery to make. Until then, the only outlet for a philosophical interest known to me was the production of poetry or essays. These means of expression remain inconclusive, however, with a tendency towards profuseness. The logical discipline provides so me intellectual backbone, without excluding the literary modes. A master's thesis by Erik Krabbe introduced me to the subject of tense logic. The doctoral dissertation of Paul N eedham awaked me (as so many others) from my dogmatic slumbers concerning the latter's mono poly on the logical study of Time. Finally, a set of lecture notes by Frank Veltman showed me how classical model theory is just as relevant to that study as more exotic intensional techniques. Of the authors whose work inspired me most, I would mention Arthur Prior, for his irresistible blend of logic and philosophy, Krister Segerberg, for his technical opening up of a systematic theory, and Hans Kamp, for his mastery of all these things at once. Many colleagues have made helpful comments on the two previous versions of this text. I would like to thank especially my students Ed Brinksma, Jan van Eyck and Wilfried Meyer-Viol for their logical and cultural criticism. The drawings were contributed by the versatile Bauke Mulder.

The aim of these meetings is to bring together scientists who work in quite different disciplines, but are confronted with related problems and use the same or similar approaches. The topic of the 1983 conference which was held on March 23-25 at the University of Tiibingen came from a typical field of research in which engineers, biologists, and phYSicists share a common interest. We do not want to discuss here in detail the common principles which are used by nature and by engineers to solve the problems associated with localization and orientation, since the reader will find enough examples in this volume. The question, however, whether the participants of such meetings can really profit from each other, deserves some further consid eration. First, there is the difficulty of finding a common language. This still seems to be a problem, although in some fields the language of engineers and biologists has become very similar over the years, an impression we also gained during the conference.

Modeling and Control of Sustainable Power Systems,Lingfeng Wang,Springer Science & Business Media,2011-11-09,"The concept of the smart grid promises the world an efficient and intelligent approach of managing energy production, transportation, and consumption by incorporating intelligence, efficiency, and optimality into the power grid. Both energy providers and consumers can take advantage of the convenience, reliability, and energy savings achieved by real-time and intelligent energy management. To this end, the current power grid is experiencing drastic changes and upgrades. For instance, more significant green energy resources such as wind power and solar power are being integrated into the power grid, and higher energy storage capacity is being installed in order to mitigate the intermittency issues brought about by the variable energy resources. At the same time, novel power electronics technologies and operating strategies are being invented and adopted. For instance, Flexible AC transmission systems and phasor measurement units are two promising technologies for improving the power system reliability and power quality. Demand side management will enable the customers to manage the power loads in an active fashion. As a result, modeling and control of modern power grids pose great challenges due to the adoption of new smart grid technologies.

Partial Differential Equations,"Wolfgang Arendt, Karsten Urban",Springer Nature,2023-01-01,"This textbook introduces the study of partial differential equations using both analytical and numerical methods. By intertwining the two complementary approaches, the authors create an ideal foundation for further study. Motivating examples from the physical sciences, engineering, and economics complete this integrated approach. A showcase of models begins the book, demonstrating how PDEs arise in practical problems that involve heat, vibration, fluid flow, and financial markets. Several important characterizing properties are used to classify mathematical similarities, then elementary methods are used to solve examples of hyperbolic, elliptic, and parabolic equations. From here, an accessible introduction to Hilbert spaces and the spectral theorem lay the foundation for advanced methods. Sobolev spaces are presented first in dimension one, before being extended to arbitrary dimension for the study of elliptic equations. An extensive chapter on numerical methods focuses on finite difference and finite element methods. Computer-aided calculation with MapleTM completes the book. Throughout, three fundamental examples are studied with different tools: Poisson’s equation, the heat equation, and the wave equation on Euclidean domains. The Black–Scholes equation from mathematical finance is one of several opportunities for extension. Partial Differential Equations offers an innovative introduction for students new to the area.

Overcoming Inequalities in Schools and Learning Communities: Innovative Education for a New Century,"Rocio Garcia-Carrion, Roseli Rodrigues De Mello, Arnetha F. Ball",Frontiers Media SA,2020-03-24,"Educational inequalities have strongly impacted disadvantaged and underservedpopulations such us indigenous, Roma, migrant children, students with disabilities,and those affected by poverty. A wide array of research has contributed toexplaining the mechanisms and effects of inequalities in the achievement patterns,dropout rates, disengagement in the school experiences of children and youthtraditionally excluded. Research also suggests the negative consequences for childdevelopment – including cognitive, language, and social–emotional functioning – ofpoverty and lack of quality education in the early years. Consequently, the currentunequal access to optimal learning environments for every single child to succeedin education and to have a better life perpetuates the exclusion and neglects theright to education for those minorities. This Research Topic aims at moving beyondcauses and shed light upon effective solutions by providing successful pathways forintegration and inclusion of the learners most heavily affected. Scholars worldwide are looking for successful actions with children, youth, andcommunities of learners historically underserved to overcome educational andsocial exclusion. These transformative approaches go beyond the deficit thinkingand are grounded in theories, empirical evidence, and multidisciplinary interventionsoriented towards achieving social impact, which refers to the extent to which thoseactions have contributed to improve a societal challenge. The international networkof “Schools as Learning Communities” is advancing knowledge on deepening andexpanding the impact of what has been defined as Successful Educational Actions(SEAs); that is, those interventions that improve students’ achievement and socialcohesion and inclusion in many diverse contexts, regardless the socioeconomic,national, and cultural environment of schools. Drawing on the evidence generated by this network of researchers to address the globalchallenge of inequality by studying educational actions oriented towards achievingsocial impact and potentially transferrable to other contexts, this Research Topic aimsat deepening on this approach. In short, our purpose is that the contributions includedin this Research Topic contribute to reduce educational and social inequalities andespecially benefit those populations most in need.",,127,N/A,0,en

Principles of Lasers,Orazio Svelto,Springer Science & Business Media,2009-09-29,"This book is motivated by the very favorable reception given to the previous editions as well as by the considerable range of new developments in the laser field since the publication of the third edition in 1989. These new developments include, among others, quantum-well and muitiple-quantum-welliasers, diode-pumped solid-state lasers, new concepts for both stable and unstable resonators, femtosecond lasers, ultra-high-brightness lasers, etc. This edition thus represents a radically revised version of the preceding edition, amounting essentially to a new book in its own right. However, the basic aim has remained the same, namely to provide a broad and unified description of laser behavior at the simplest level which is compatible with a correct physical understanding. The book is therefore intended as a textbook for a senior-level or first-year graduate course and/or as a reference book. The most relevant additions or changes to this edition can be summarized as follows: 1. A much-more detailed description of Amplified Spontaneous Emission has been given (Chapter 2) and a novel simplified treatment of this phenomenon, both for homogeneous and inhomogeneous lines, has been introduced (Appendix C). 2. A major fraction of a new chapter (Chapter 3) is dedicated to the interaction of radiation with semiconductor media, either in a bulk form or in a quantum-confined structure (quantum-well, quantum-wire and quantum dot). 3.",Technology & Engineering,636,4,2,en

Qualitative Spatial Reasoning,"M.

However, there is no model to reason with several spatial aspects in a uniform way. Moreover, most of these models simplify spatial objects to points. In this book we present a novel approach for integrating the qualitative concepts of orientation, distance, and cardinal directions, using points as well as extended objects as primitive of reasoning, based on Constraint Logic Programming. The resulting model has been applied to build a qualitative Navigation Simulator on the structured environment of the city of Castellon.",Computers,236,N/A,0,en

Space-Time Computing with Temporal Neural Networks,James E. Smith,Morgan & Claypool Publishers,2017-05-18,"Understanding and implementing the brain's computational paradigm is the one true grand challenge facing computer researchers. Not only are the brain's computational capabilities far beyond those of conventional computers, its energy efficiency is truly remarkable. This book, written from the perspective of a computer designer and targeted at computer researchers, is intended to give both background and lay out a course of action for studying the brain's computational paradigm. It contains a mix of concepts and ideas drawn from computational neuroscience, combined with those of the author. As background, relevant biological features are described in terms of their computational and communication properties. The brain's neocortex is constructed of massively interconnected neurons that compute and communicate via voltage spikes, and a strong argument can be made that precise spike timing is an essential element of the paradigm. Drawing from the biological features, a mathematics-based computational paradigm is constructed. The key feature is spiking neurons that perform communication and processing in space-time, with emphasis on time. In these paradigms, time is used as a freely available resource for both communication and computation. Neuron models are first discussed in general, and one is chosen for detailed development. Using the model, single-neuron computation is first explored. Neuron inputs are encoded as spike patterns, and the neuron is trained to identify input pattern similarities. Individual neurons are building blocks for constructing larger ensembles, referred to as ""columns"". These columns are trained in an unsupervised manner and operate collectively to perform the basic cognitive function of pattern clustering. Similar input patterns are mapped to a much smaller set of similar output patterns, thereby dividing the input patterns into identifiable clusters. Larger cognitive systems are formed by combining columns into a hierarchical architecture. These higher level architectures are the subject of ongoing study, and progress to date is described in detail in later chapters. Simulation plays a major role in model development, and the simulation infrastructure developed by the author is described.",Computers,245,N/A,0,en

University Physics for the Physical and Life Sciences,"Philip R. Kesten, David L. Tauck",Macmillan Higher Education,2012-02-24,"Authors Philip R. Kesten and David L. Tauck take a fresh and innovative approach to the university physics (calculus-based) course. They combine their experience teaching physics (Kesten) and biology (Tauck) to create a text that engages students by using biological and medical applications and examples to illustrate key concepts. University Physics for the Physical and Life Sciences teaches the fundamentals of introductory physics, while weaving in formative physiology, biomedical, and life science topics to help students connect physics to living systems. The authors help life science and pre-med students develop a deeper appreciation for why physics is important to their future work and daily lives. With its thorough coverage of concepts and problem-solving strategies, University Physics for the Physical and Life Sciences can also be used as a novel approach to teaching physics to engineers and scientists or for a more rigorous approach to teaching the college physics (algebra-based) course. University Physics for the Physical and Life Sciences utilizes six key features to help students learn the principle concepts of university physics: • A seamless blend of physics and physiology with interesting examples of physics in students’ lives, • A strong focus on developing problem-solving skills (Set Up, Solve, and Reflect problem-solving strategy), • Conceptual questions (Got the Concept) built into the flow of the text, • ""Estimate It!"" problems that allow students to practice important estimation skills • Special attention to common misconceptions that often plague students, and • Detailed artwork designed to promote visual learning Volume I: 1-4292-0493-1 Volume II: 1-4292-8982-1",Science,774,N/A,0,en

Model T Ford Service,Ford Motor Company,Periscope Film LLC,2013-08,"Henry Ford's Model T forever changed the world. The car made ""for the great multitude"" (as Ford put it) first debuted in 1908 and proved so affordable and so popular that fifteen million were sold through 1927. The ""Tin Lizzie"" was the first automobile to be mass-produced on moving assembly lines, and built using interchangeable parts. It proved tough and reliable in everyday use, and cheap enough to spawn the automobile revolution: the car cost $850 in 1909 but amazingly by the 1920s, the price had dropped to a mere $260 due to the perfection of production techniques and economy of scale. Designed by a team that included Childe Harold Willis, Joseph Galamb and Eugene Farkas, the Model T had a front-mounted four-cylinder engine that produced 20 hp and had a top speed of 45 mph. It was a rear-wheel drive vehicle with wooden wheels, and featured a two-speed transmission plus a reverse gear. Although models varied - and many revisions took place over two decades of production - the original version weighed about 1200 pounds. Created in the 1920s and featuring information about the original Model T and the ""New Model T"" of 1925, this maintenance manual is an invaluable resource. It was originally intended to educate the men tasked with assembling, repairing and maintaining the Model T, and offers a plethora of information about the car, its design and operation. The text includes chapters on how to take apart and put together the car, how to overhaul the engine and transmission, valve grinding and carbon removal, rod bearings, fitting pistons and rings, correcting noisy timing gears, installation of camshaft bearings, cleaning oil lines, oil leaks, transmission band installation, axle overhauls, refurbishing and replacing springs, radiator repair, starting motor overhaul, and more. It also includes troubleshooting and general servicing information. A must have for any Model T owner, this book is also a terrific reference for the docent, historian, or anyone who ever wondered, ""how did that work?""",Transportation,322,N/A,0,en

It gives clear and reliable guidance to all areas of philosophy and to the ideas of all notable philosophers from antiquity to the present day. The scope of the volume is not limited to English-languagephilosophy: it surveys the foremost philosophy from all parts of the world. A distinguished international assembly of more than two hundred contributors provide almost 2,000 alphabetically arranged entries which are not only instructive but also entertaining: they combine learning, lucidity, elegance, and wit. There are more than fifty extended entries of 3,000 words on themain areas of philosophy and the great philosophers: these include essays by Alasdair MacIntyre on the history of moral philosophy, Paul Feyerabend on the history of the philosophy of science, Jaegwon Kim on problems of the philosophy of mind, Richard Swinburne on problems of the philosophy ofreligion, David Charles on Aristotle, Peter Singer on Hegel, Anthony Kenny on Frege, and Anthony Quinton on philosophy itself. Short entries deal with key concepts (for instance, personal identity, time) doctrines (utilitarianism, holism), problems (the mind-body problem, the meaning of life), schools of thought (Marxist philosophy, the Vienna Circle), and practical issues (abortion, vegetarianism). Individual thinkerspast (Pythagoras, Confucius, Galileo, Goethe, Burke, Santayana, de Beauvoir, Radhakrishnan) and present (over 150 contemporary figures, such as Chomsky, Derrida, and Popper) are profiled, and eighty of them are depicted in black-and-white portraits. Interspersed throughout are short explanations ofparticular philosophical terms (qualia, supervenience, iff), puzzles (the Achilles paradox, the prisoner's dilemma), and curiosities (the philosopher's stone, slime). Every entry is accompanied by suggestions for further reading. A chronological chart of the history of philosophy is located at theend of the book, together with fourteen diagrams showing the structure of philosophy and the relations between its subjects and doctrines. This book will be an indispensable guide and a constant source of stimulation and enlightenment for anyone interested in abstract thought, the eternal questions, and the foundations of human understanding.",Biography & Autobiography,1050,5,1,en

Advanced Electrical Drives,"Rik De Doncker, Duco W.J. Pulle, André Veltman",Springer Science & Business Media,2010-11-30,"Electrical drives convert in a controlled manner, electrical energy into mechanical energy. Electrical drives comprise an electrical machine, i.e. an electro-mechanical energy converter, a power electronic converter, i.e. an electrical-to-electrical converter, and a controller/communication unit. Today, electrical drives are used as propulsion systems in high-speed trains, elevators, escalators, electric ships, electric forklift trucks and electric vehicles. Advanced control algorithms (mostly digitally implemented) allow torque control over a high-bandwidth. Hence, precise motion control can be achieved. Examples are drives in robots, pick-and-place machines, factory automation hardware, etc. Most drives can operate in motoring and generating mode. Wind turbines use electrical drives to convert wind energy into electrical energy. More and more, variable speed drives are used to save energy for example, in air-conditioning units, compressors, blowers, pumps and home appliances. Key to ensure stable operation of a drive in the aforementioned applications are torque control algorithms. In Advanced Electrical Drives, a unique approach is followed to derive model based torque controllers for all types of Lorentz force machines, i.e. DC, synchronous and induction machines. The rotating transformer model forms the basis for this generalized modeling approach that ultimately leads to the development of universal field-oriented control algorithms. In case of switched reluctance machines, torque observers are proposed to implement direct torque algorithms. From a didactic viewpoint, tutorials are included at the end of each chapter. The reader is encouraged to execute these tutorials to familiarize him or herself with all aspects of drive technology. Hence, Advanced Electrical Drives encourages “learning by doing”. Furthermore, the experienced drive specialist may find the simulation tools useful to design high-performance controllers for all sorts of electrical drives.",Technology & Engineering,462,N/A,0,en

Modular Multilevel Converters with Interleaved Half-Bridge Submodules,Aleksandr Viatkin,Springer Nature,2023-03-29,"This book reports on a comprehensive study on a novel high-power converter, i.e. a Modular Multilevel Converter with Interleaved Half-bridge Submodules (ISM-MMC). It describes in depth its average model, the operating principles, as well as a new control method and a hybrid modulation strategy that help to exploit the benefits of the interleaving scheme. The new power converter is particularly advantageous for high-current applications that require superb quality of input/output waveforms. Moreover, this book reports on a systematic study of the current balancing problem between parallel-connected units that commutate in non-simultaneous fashion. This is a typical issue in interleaved converters, however here it is analyzed for the first time in relation to MMC-based structures. Two control strategies are proposed to cope with this matter. By using a sensorless regulation scheme, the number of required current transducers has been minimized, reducing complexity, cost, and footprint of the hardware, while providing converter with a fast and accurate current balancing. This book also offers a comprehensive comparison between several practical designs of ISM-MMC and classical MMC for an ultra-fast electrical vehicle charger. All in all, it provides graduate students and researchers, as well as field engineers and professionals with extensive information and essential practical details on the state-of-the-art MMC and ISM-MMC design.",Technology & Engineering,158,N/A,0,en

It is also appropriate for students preparing a capstone project where they need to understand, model, supply, control and specify the grid side power converters. The main goal of the book is developing in students the skills that are required to design, control and use static power converters that serve as an interface between the ac grid and renewable power sources. The same skills can be used to design, control and use the static power converters used within the micro-grids and nano-grids, as the converters that provide the interface between such grids and the external grid. The author’s approach starts with basic functionality and the role of grid connected power converters in their typical applications, and their static and dynamic characteristics. Particular effort is dedicated to developing simple, concise, intuitive and easy-to-use mathematical models that summarize the essence of the grid side converter dynamics.

X-Ray and Neutron Diffraction in Nonideal Crystals,Mikhail A. Krivoglaz,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Mikhail Alexandrovich Krivoglaz died unexpectedly when he was preparing the English edition of his two-volume monograph on diffraction and diffuse scatter ing of X-rays and neutrons in imperfect crystals. His death was a heavy blow to all who knew him, who had worked with him and to the world science community as a whole. The application of the diffraction techniques for the study of imperfections of crystal structures was the major field of Krivoglaz' work throughout his career in science. He started working in the field in the mid-fifties and since then made fundamental contributions to the theory of real crystals. His results have largely determined the current level of knowledge in this field for more than thirty years. Until the very last days of his life, Krivoglaz continued active studies in the physics of diffraction effects in real crystals. His interest in the theory aided in the explanation of the rapidly advancing experimental studies. The milestones marking important stages of his work were the first mono graph on the theory of X-ray and neutron scattering in real crystals which was published in Russian in 1967 (a revised English edition in 1969), and the two volume monograph published in Russian in 1983-84 (this edition is the revised translation of the latter).",Science,483,N/A,0,en

A History of the Second World War in 100 Maps,Jeremy Black,University of Chicago Press,2020-11-18,"The First World War was marked by an exceptional expansion in the use and production of military cartography. But World War II took things even further, employing maps, charts, reconnaissance, and the systematic recording and processing of geographical and topographical information on an unprecedented scale. As Jeremy Black—one of the world’s leading military and cartographic historians—convincingly shows in this lavish full-color book, it is impossible to understand the events and outcomes of the Second World War without deep reference to mapping at all levels. In World War II, maps themselves became the weapons. A History of the Second World War in 100 Maps traces how military cartography developed from simply recording and reflecting history to having a decisive impact on events of a global scale. Drawing on one hundred key maps from the unparalleled collections of the British Library and other sources—many of which have never been published in book form before--Jeremy Black takes us from the prewar mapping programs undertaken by both Germany and the United Kingdom in the mid-1930s through the conflict’s end a decade later. Black shows how the development of maps led directly to the planning of the complex and fluid maneuvers that defined the European theater in World War II: for example, aerial reconnaissance photography allowed for the charting of beach gradients and ocean depths in the runup to the D-Day landings, and the subsequent troop movements at Normandy would have been impossible without the help of situation maps and photos. In the course of the conflict, both in Europe and the Pacific, the realities of climate, terrain, and logistics—recorded on maps—overcame the Axis powers. Maps also became propaganda tools as the pages of Time outlined the directions of the campaigns and the Allies dropped maps from their aircraft. ​ In this thrilling and unique book, Jeremy Black blends his singular cartographic and military expertise into a captivating overview of World War II from the air, sea, and sky, making clear how fundamental maps were to every aspect of this unforgettable global conflict.",History,257,N/A,0,en

The 5th International Workshop on Formal Aspects in Security and Trust (FAST 2008) aimed at continuing the successful e?ort of the previous three FAST workshop editions for fostering the cooperation among researchers in the areas of security and trust. As computing and network infrastructures become increasingly pervasive, and as they carry increasing economic activity, society needs well-matched security and trust mechanisms. These interactions incre- ingly span several enterprises and involve loosely structured communities of - dividuals. Participants in these activities must control interactions with their partners based on trust policies and business logic. Trust-based decisions - fectively determine the security goals for shared information and for access to sensitive or valuable resources. FAST sought for original papers focusing on formal aspects in: security and trust policy models; security protocol design and analysis; formal models of trustand reputation;logicsfor security andtrust;distributed trust management systems;trust-basedreasoning;digitalassetsprotection;dataprotection;privacy and ID issues; information ?ow analysis; language-based security; security and trust aspects in ubiquitous computing; validation/analysis tools; Web service security/trust/privacy; GRID security; security risk assessment; case studies.",Computers,340,N/A,0,en

Baseball Hacks,Joseph Adler,"""O'Reilly Media, Inc.""",2006-01-31,"Baseball Hacks isn't your typical baseball book--it's a book about how to watch, research, and understand baseball. It's an instruction manual for the free baseball databases. It's a cookbook for baseball research. Every part of this book is designed to teach baseball fans how to do something. In short, it's a how-to book--one that will increase your enjoyment and knowledge of the game. So much of the way baseball is played today hinges upon interpreting statistical data. Players are acquired based on their performance in statistical categories that ownership deems most important. Managers make in-game decisions based not on instincts, but on probability - how a particular batter might fare against left-handedpitching, for instance. The goal of this unique book is to show fans all the baseball-related stuff that they can do for free (or close to free). Just as open source projects have made great software freely available, collaborative projects such as Retrosheet and Baseball DataBank have made great data freely available. You can use these data sources to research your favorite players, win your fantasy league, or appreciate the game of baseball even more than you do now. Baseball Hacks shows how easy it is to get data, process it, and use it to truly understand baseball. The book lists a number of sources for current and historical baseball data, and explains how to load it into a database for analysis. It then introduces several powerful statistical tools for understanding data and forecasting results. For the uninitiated baseball fan, author Joseph Adler walks readers through the core statistical categories for hitters (batting average, on-base percentage, etc.), pitchers (earned run average, strikeout-to-walk ratio, etc.), and fielders (putouts, errors, etc.). He then extrapolates upon these numbers to examine more advanced data groups like career averages, team stats, season-by-season comparisons, and more. Whether you're a mathematician, scientist, or season-ticket holder to your favorite team, Baseball Hacks is sure to have something for you. Advance praise for Baseball Hacks: ""Baseball Hacks is the best book ever written for understanding and practicing baseball analytics. A must-read for baseball professionals and enthusiasts alike."" -- Ari Kaplan, database consultant to the Montreal Expos, San Diego Padres, and Baltimore Orioles ""The game was born in the 19th century, but the passion for its analysis continues to grow into the 21st. In Baseball Hacks, Joe Adler not only demonstrates thatthe latest data-mining technologies have useful application to the study of baseball statistics, he also teaches the reader how to do the analysis himself, arming the dedicated baseball fan with tools to take his understanding of the game to a higher level."" -- Mark E.

Action Theory and Social Science,I. Pörn,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This book is intended as a contribution to the foundations of the sciences of man, especially the social sciences. It has been argued with increasing frequency in recent years that the vocabulary of social science is to a large extent an action vocabulary and that any attempt to systematize concepts and establish bases for understanding in the field cannot, therefore, succeed unless it is firmly built on action theory. I think that these claims are sub stantially correct, but at the same time it seems to me that action theory, as it is relevant to social science, still awaits vital contributions from logic and philosophy. For example, it has often been said, rightly I believe, that situa tions in which two or more agents interact constitute the subject-matter of social science. But have we got an action theory which is rich enough or com prehensive enough to allow us to characterize the interaction situation? I think not. Once we have such a theory, however, we should be able to give an accurate account of central social phenomena and to articulate our concep tions about the nature of social reality. The conceptual scheme advanced in this book consists, in the first instance, of solutions to a number of characterization problems, i. e. problems which may be expressed by questions of the form ""What is the nature of . . .",Philosophy,147,N/A,0,en

Novel Motion Anchoring Strategies for Wavelet-based Highly Scalable Video Compression,Dominic Rüfenacht,Springer,2018-04-03,"A key element of any modern video codec is the efficient exploitation of temporal redundancy via motion-compensated prediction. In this book, a novel paradigm of representing and employing motion information in a video compression system is described that has several advantages over existing approaches. Traditionally, motion is estimated, modelled, and coded as a vector field at the target frame it predicts. While this “prediction-centric” approach is convenient, the fact that the motion is “attached” to a specific target frame implies that it cannot easily be re-purposed to predict or synthesize other frames, which severely hampers temporal scalability. In light of this, the present book explores the possibility of anchoring motion at reference frames instead. Key to the success of the proposed “reference-based” anchoring schemes is high quality motion inference, which is enabled by the use of a more “physical” motion representation than the traditionally employed “block” motion fields. The resulting compression system can support computationally efficient, high-quality temporal motion inference, which requires half as many coded motion fields as conventional codecs. Furthermore, “features” beyond compressibility — including high scalability, accessibility, and “intrinsic” framerate upsampling — can be seamlessly supported. These features are becoming ever more relevant as the way video is consumed continues shifting from the traditional broadcast scenario to interactive browsing of video content over heterogeneous networks. This book is of interest to researchers and professionals working in multimedia signal processing, in particular those who are interested in next-generation video compression. Two comprehensive background chapters on scalable video compression and temporal frame interpolation make the book accessible for students and newcomers to the field.",Technology & Engineering,203,N/A,0,en

Ice Accretion and Icing Technology,Robert J Flemming,SAE International,2015-04-16,"The effects of inflight atmospheric icing can be devastating to aircraft. Universities and industry have been hard at work to respond to the challenge of maintaining flight safety in all weather conditions. Proposed changes in the regulations for operation in icing conditions are sure to keep this type of research and development at its highest level. This is especially true for the effects of ice crystals in the atmosphere, and for the threat associated with supercooled large drop (SLD) icing. This collection of ten SAE International technical papers brings together vital contributions to the subject. Icing on aircraft surfaces would not be a problem if a material were discovered that prevented the freezing and accretion of supercooled drops. Many options that appeared to have promising icephobic properties have had serious shortfalls in durability.

"PHP Objects, Patterns, and Practice",MATT ZANDSTRA,Apress,2016-12-19,"Aided by three key elements: object fundamentals, design principles, and best practices, you'll learn how to develop elegant and rock solid systems using PHP. The 5th edition of this popular book has been fully updated for PHP 7, including replacing the PEAR package manager with Composer, and new material on Vagrant and PHP standards. It provides a solid grounding in PHP's support for objects, it builds on this foundation to instill core principles of software design and then covers the tools and practices needed to develop, test and deploy robust code. PHP Objects, Patterns, and Practice begins by covering PHP's object-oriented features. It introduces key topics including class declaration, inheritance, reflection and much more. The next section is devoted to design patterns. It explains the principles that make patterns powerful. The book covers many of the classic design patterns and includes chapters on enterprise and database patterns. The last segment of the book covers the tools and practices that can help turn great code into a successful project. The section shows how to manage multiple developers and releases with git, how to manage builds and dependencies with Composer. It also explores strategies for automated testing and continuous integration. What You'll Learn Work with object fundamentals: writing classes and methods, instantiating objects, creating powerful class hierarchies using inheritance. Master advanced object-oriented features, including static methods and properties, managing error conditions with exceptions, and creating abstract classes and interfaces. Learn about the new object-oriented features introduced by PHP 7 and why they matter for your code. Understand and use design principles to deploy objects and classes effectively in your projects. Discover a set of powerful patterns that you can deploy in your own projects. Guarantee a successful project including unit testing; version control, build, installation and package management; and continuous integration. Who This Book is For This book is suitable for anyone with at least a basic knowledge of PHP who wants to use its object-oriented features in their projects.

Programming Distributed Computing Systems,Carlos A. Varela,MIT Press,2013-05-31,"An introduction to fundamental theories of concurrent computation and associated programming languages for developing distributed and mobile computing systems. Starting from the premise that understanding the foundations of concurrent programming is key to developing distributed computing systems, this book first presents the fundamental theories of concurrent computing and then introduces the programming languages that help develop distributed computing systems at a high level of abstraction. The major theories of concurrent computation—including the π-calculus, the actor model, the join calculus, and mobile ambients—are explained with a focus on how they help design and reason about distributed and mobile computing systems. The book then presents programming languages that follow the theoretical models already described, including Pict, SALSA, and JoCaml. The parallel structure of the chapters in both part one (theory) and part two (practice) enable the reader not only to compare the different theories but also to see clearly how a programming language supports a theoretical model. The book is unique in bridging the gap between the theory and the practice of programming distributed computing systems. It can be used as a textbook for graduate and advanced undergraduate students in computer science or as a reference for researchers in the area of programming technology for distributed computing. By presenting theory first, the book allows readers to focus on the essential components of concurrency, distribution, and mobility without getting bogged down in syntactic details of specific programming languages. Once the theory is understood, the practical part of implementing a system in an actual programming language becomes much easier.",Computers,291,N/A,0,en

Microbial Metal Respiration,"Johannes Gescher, Andreas Kappler",Springer Science & Business Media,2014-02-21,"Microbes can respire on metals. This seemingly simple finding is one of the major discoveries that were made in the field of microbiology in the last few decades. The importance of this observation is evident. Metals are highly abundant on our planet. Iron is even the most abundant element on Earth and the forth most abundant element in the Earth’s crust. Hence, in some environments iron, but also other metals or metalloids, are the dominant respiratory electron acceptors. Their reduction massively drives the carbon cycle in these environments and establishes redox cycles of the metallic electron acceptors themselves. These redox cycles are not only a driving force for other biotic reactions but are furthermore necessary for initiating a number of geochemically relevant abiotic redox conversions. Although widespread and ecologically influential, electron transfer onto metals like ferric iron or manganese is biochemically challenging. The challenge is to transfer respiratory electrons onto metals that occur in nature at neutral pH in the form of metal oxides or oxihydroxides that are effectively insoluble. Obviously, it is necessary that the microbes specially adapt in order to catalyze the electron transfer onto insoluble electron acceptors. The elucidation of these adaptations is an exciting ongoing process. To sum it up, dissimilatory metal reduction has wide-spread implications in the field of microbiology, biochemistry and geochemistry and its discovery was one of the major reasons to establish a novel scientific field called geomicrobiology. Recently, the discovery of potential applications of dissimilatory metal reducers in bioremediation or current production in a microbial fuel cell further increased the interest in studying microbial metal reduction.",Science,237,N/A,0,en
Market as a Weapon,Anton Oleinik,Routledge,2017-09-08,"Power is all-encompassing in Russia, and mediates most interactions among people, including everyday decisions. Even the recent administrative reforms in the country, which began at the end of the 1990s, have tried to reshape the government institutions and modernize the country through the use of power. Changes were initiated and implemented by people vested with power. Power, convention, and trust can all support coordination. However, in the Russian institutional context power tends not only to supplement the alternative coordination mechanisms but also to substitute them. Power can be used to solve problems related to social action by merging two (or several) centers of decision-making into one. The actor vested with power decides exactly how coordination and adjustment can be achieved. This path-breaking volume shows how power turns into a unique coordination mechanism and what are consequences of such transformation for everyday life and businesses. Market as a Weapon focuses on issues of power and domination using the configuration of power relationships in Russia as a ""critical case,"" but goes far beyond a narrowly defined scope of country-specific studies. Particular emphasis is put on domination by virtue of a constellation interests in the market, since this is a relatively underexplored yet broadly used technique for imposing will in all countries that heavily rely on interventionist policies. Instead of being a liberating force, the market becomes an additional instrument facilitating the continuous reproduction of power, which explains the title of the book. Both qualitative and quantitative data, including more than one hundred in-depth interviews with experts, state servants, and businesspeople in Russia, as well as statistics, are used throughout the text of this major book.",Business & Economics,222,N/A,0,en

Functional Assessment of Wetlands,E. Maltby,Elsevier,2009-04-27,"Wetlands perform functions that deliver benefits to society, often referred to as ecosystem services. These ecosystem services include water supply, flood regulation, water purification, climate regulation, biodiversity, agriculture (e.g. grazing land), and amenity. A functional approach to wetland assessment enables a holistic view to be taken of the wide range of services wetlands can provide. The functional assessment procedures (FAPs) in this volume translate best available scientific knowledge into reasonable predictions of how component parts of wetlands function in different landscape contexts. They can be used to indicate the potential and priorities for management options in such areas as flood control, pollution reduction and biodiversity conservation.Functional assessment enables the user to predict the functioning of a wetland area without the need for comprehensive and expensive empirical research The FAPs therefore provide a methodology that can be used by both experts and non-experts to assess wetland functioning relatively rapidly. The volume includes an electronic version of the FAPs on CD which automates aspects of the assessment once the initial recording stage is completed. It is anticipated that the FAPs will be used by a range of individuals or organisations concerned with wetland management who wish to gain a better understanding of the processes, functions, services or benefits and potential of the wetlands for which they have responsibility. - Provides a systematic methodology to evaluate how wetlands function - Allows non-experts to assess wetland functioning rapidly and cost-effectively - Automates aspects of the functional assessment through the accompanying CD-ROM",Nature,707,N/A,0,en
Sustainable Solar Housing,"Robert S Hastings, Maria Wall",Routledge,2012-06-25,"This far-reaching and authoritative two-volume set examines a range of potential solutions for low-energy building design, considering different strategies (energy conservation and renewable energy) and technologies (relating to the building envelope, ventilation, heat delivery, heat production, heat storage, electricity and control). Energy and life-cycle impacts are considered as crucial factors, including passive and active solar use, daylighting and high efficiency conventional heat production. Each volume assesses the potential of these options in a variety of contexts, covering different housing types (apartment, row and detached) in cold, temperate and mild climates. The impressive list of expert authors from 14 countries includes a mix of internationally respected academics and practitioners, working together within the framework of a five-year International Energy Agency (IEA) research project. Volume 1 presents strategies and solutions, offering the reader a solid basis for developing concepts, considering environmental and economic concerns for housing projects in a variety of contexts. Volume 2 offers a detailed analysis of exemplary buildings in different European countries and examines the various technologies employed to achieve their remarkable performance. Aided by clear, full colour illustrations, it offers invaluable insights into the application of these technologies.",Architecture,307,N/A,0,en

Unconventional Optical Imaging for Biology,"Corinne Fournier, Olivier Haeberle",John Wiley & Sons,2024-04-15,"Optical imaging of biological systems has undergone spectacular development in recent years, producing a quantity and a quality of information that, just twenty years ago, could only be dreamed of by physicists, biologists and physicians. Unconventional imaging systems provide access to physical quantities – phase, absorption, optical index, the polarization property of a wave or the chemical composition of an object – not accessible to conventional measurement systems. To achieve this, these systems use special optical setups and specific digital image processing to reconstruct physical quantities. This field is also known as computational imaging. This book presents various non-conventional imaging modalities developed for the biomedical field: wave front analysis imaging, digital holography/tomography, optical nanoscopy, endoscopy and singlesensor imaging. Experimental setups and reconstruction algorithms are presented for each modality.",Medical,308,N/A,0,en

"Tectonics, Climate, and Landscape Evolution",Sean D. Willett,Geological Society of America,2006-01-01,"""The Liwu River runs a short course; its channel head at the water divide in Taiwan's Central Range is a mere 35 km from its outflow into the Pacific Ocean. But in those short 35 km, the Liwu has carved one of the world's geographic wonders: the spectacular Taroko Gorge with marble and granite walls soaring nearly 1000 m above the river channel. Taroko Gorge was a fitting venue for a 2003 Penrose Conference that addressed the coupled processes of tectonics, climate, and landscape evolution. The young mountains, extreme weather, and dramatic landforms provided an appropriate backdrop to wide-ranging discussions of geomorphic processes, climate and meteorology, sediment generation and transport, the effects of erosion on tectonics, and new analytical and modeling tools used to address these processes and problems. This volume's papers extend that discussion, reaching across fields that have experienced rapid advances in the past decade.""--Publisher's website.",Science,464,4,2,en

Steam Surface Condensers,Richard E. Putman,American Society of Mechanical Engineers,2001,"This volume is a comprehensive presentation of analytical theory and real-world practical solutions. It clearly illustrates updated approaches that plant managers and performance engineers can use in judging condenser performance and in making maintenance decisions. The author examines current methods for modeling, diagnosing and improving condenser performance. He describes how to calculate heat transfer coefficients, provides details of the recent ASME Power Test Code PTC 12.2-1998, and explains the significance of heat transfer coefficients in measuring the overall performance of an operating condenser. Further discussion includes condenser cleaning schedules that save money and reduce CO2 emissions, diagnostic methods that help unit operators pinpoint problem areas, monitoring techniques that help predict the onset of tube fouling and deposit accumulation, and proper methods of tube plugging. New topic areas are also explored: assigning a dollar amount and excess carbon emissions to condenser fouling; methods for estimating cooling water flow rate;and performance analysis for multicompartment condensers.",Technology & Engineering,300,N/A,0,en

The first part of the book describes the history of the Asiatic varieties of chess, the Arabic and Persian literature on chess, and the theory and practice of the game of shatranj. The second part is concerned with chess in Europe in the Middle Ages, its role in literature and in the moralities, and with medieval chess problems, leading up to the beginning of modern chess and the history of the modern game through to the 19th century.",Games & Activities,882,N/A,0,en
Structural Novelty and Tradition in the Early Romantic Piano Concerto,Stephan D. Lindeman,Pendragon Press,1999,"Lindeman, a musicologist, traces and defines the historical development of the concerto form as it passed from Mozart to succeeding generations. He then assesses Beethoven's contributions, and examines the classical model of the form in the early 19th century by overviewing several early romantic composers' works. Subsequent chapters analyze and assess the responses of five precursers of Schumann, whose work offers a synthesis of radical experiments and traditional tenets. He concludes by suggesting that concertos of Lizst offer a road into further developments of the genre in the second half of the century.

Functional Programming Languages and Computer Architecture,John Hughes,Springer Science & Business Media,1991-08-07,"This book offers a comprehensive view of the best and the latest work in functional programming. It is the proceedings of a major international conference and contains 30 papers selected from 126 submitted. A number of themes emerge. One is a growing interest in types: powerful type systems or type checkers supporting overloading, coercion, dynamic types, and incremental inference; linear types to optimize storage, and polymorphic types to optimize semantic analysis. The hot topic of partial evaluation is well represented: techniques for higher-order binding-time analysis, assuring termination of partial evaluation, and improving the residual programs a partial evaluator generates. The thorny problem of manipulating state in functional languages is addressed: one paper even argues that parallel programs with side-effects can be ""more declarative"" than purely functional ones. Theoretical work covers a new model of types based on projections, parametricity, a connection between strictness analysis and logic, and a discussion of efficient implementations of the lambda-calculus. The connection with computer architecture and a variety of other topics are also addressed.",Computers,684,N/A,0,en

Sacra Pagina: Romans,Brendan Byrne,Liturgical Press,2023-06-13,"This commentary adopts a literary-rhetorical approach, viewing the letter as an instrument of persuasion designed to transform readers through a celebratory presentation of the Gospel. Reflecting upon the fate of Jews and Gentiles, Paul wins his audience to a vision of a God who always acts inclusively. The God who, in the person of Israel's Messiah (Jesus), has acted faithfully to include the Gentile peoples within the community of salvation, will not fail to see to the eventual inclusion of Israel as well. In the victory of grace displayed already in the risen humanity of Jesus, the original design of the Creator for human communities and for the world begins to come true. The interpretation of Paul's letter to Rome has accompanied and stimulated the path of Christian theology down to today. Romans touches upon virtually all main issues of Christian theology, as well as presenting a rewarding introduction to Paul.

The Second Epistle to the Corinthians,Paul Barnett,Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing,1997-04-17,"This statement reflects the underlying purpose of The New International Commentary on the New Testament. Begun in the late 1940s by an international team of New Testament scholars, the NICNT series has become recognized by pastors, students, and scholars alike as a critical yet orthodox commentary marked by solid biblical scholarship within the evangelical Protestant tradition. While based on a thorough study of the Greek text, the commentary introductions and expositions contain a minimum of Greek references. The NICNT authors evaluate significant textual problems and take into account the most important exegetical literature. More technical aspects — such as grammatical, textual, and historical problems — are dealt with in footnotes, special notes, and appendixes. Under the general editorship of three outstanding New Testament scholars — first Ned Stonehouse (Westminster Theological Seminary, Philadelphia), then F. F. Bruce (University of Manchester, England), and now Gordon D. Fee (Regent College, Vancouver, British Columbia) — the NICNT series has continued to develop over the years. In order to keep the commentary “new” and conversant with contemporary scholarship, the NICNT volumes have been — and will be — revised or replaced as necessary. The newer NICNT volumes in particular take into account the role of recent rhetorical and sociological inquiry in elucidating the meaning of the text, and they also exhibit concern for the theology and application of the text. As the NICNT series is ever brought up to date, it will continue to find ongoing usefulness as an established guide to the New Testament text.",Religion,673,N/A,0,en

Discrete-Time Sliding Mode Control for Networked Control System,"Dipesh H. Shah, Axaykumar Mehta",Springer,2018-03-16,"This book presents novel algorithms for designing Discrete-Time Sliding Mode Controllers (DSMCs) for Networked Control Systems (NCSs) with both types of fractional delays namely deterministic delay and random delay along with different packet loss conditions such as single packet loss and multiple packet loss that occur within the sampling period. Firstly, the switching type and non-switching type algorithms developed for the deterministic type fractional delay where the delay is compensated using Thiran’s approximation technique. A modified discrete-time sliding surface is proposed to derive the discrete-time sliding mode control algorithms. The algorithm is further extended for the random fractional delay with single packet loss and multiple packet loss situations. The random fractional delay is modelled using Poisson’s distribution function and packet loss is modelled by means of Bernoulli’s function. The condition for closed loop stability in all above situations are derived using the Lyapunov function. Lastly, the efficacy of the proposed DSMC algorithms are demonstrated by extensive simulations and also experimentally validated on a servo system.",Technology & Engineering,176,5,1,en

Among the questions considered are the following. How are wills made? What precisely are the rules - as to the signature of the testator, the use of witnesses, the need for a notary public or lawyer, and so on? Is there is a choice of will-type and, if so, which type is used most often and what are the advantages and disadvantages of each? How common is will-making or do most people die intestate? What happens if formalities are not observed? How can requirements of form be explained and justified? How did the law develop historically, what is the state of the law today, and what are the prospects for the future? The focus is on Europe, and on countries which have been influenced by the European experience. Thus in addition to giving a detailed treatment of the law in Austria, Belgium, England and Wales, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain, the book explores legal developments in Australia, New Zealand, the United States of America, and in some of the countries of Latin America with a particular emphasis on Brazil. It also includes chapters on two of the mixed jurisdictions - Scotland and South Africa - and on Islamic Law. The book opens with chapters on Roman law and on the early modern law in Europe, thus setting the historical scene as well as anticipating and complementing the accounts of national history which appear in subsequent chapters; and it concludes with an assessment of the overall development of the law in the countries surveyed, and with some wider reflections on the nature and purpose of testamentary formalities.",Law,523,N/A,0,en

Query Processing in Database Systems,"W. Kim, D.S. Reiner, Don Batory",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This book is an anthology of the results of research and development in database query processing during the past decade. The relational model of data provided tremendous impetus for research into query processing. Since a relational query does not specify access paths to the stored data, the database management system (DBMS) must provide an intelligent query-processing subsystem which will evaluate a number of potentially efficient strategies for processing the query and select the one that optimizes a given performance measure. The degree of sophistication of this subsystem, often called the optimizer, critically affects the performance of the DBMS. Research into query processing thus started has taken off in several directions during the past decade. The emergence of research into distributed databases has enormously complicated the tasks of the optimizer. In a distributed environment, the database may be partitioned into horizontal or vertical fragments of relations. Replicas of the fragments may be stored in different sites of a network and even migrate to other sites. The measure of performance of a query in a distributed system must include the communication cost between sites. To minimize communication costs for-queries involving multiple relations across multiple sites, optimizers may also have to consider semi-join techniques.",Computers,367,N/A,0,en

Monagan, Stephen Watt",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-12-01,"The design and implementation of the Maple system is an on-going project of the Symbolic Com putation Group at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. This manual corresponds with version V (roman numeral five) of the Maple system. The on-line help subsystem can be invoked from within a Maple session to view documentation on specific topics. In particular, the command ?updates points the user to documentation updates for each new version of Maple. The Maple project was first conceived in the autumn of 1980, growing out of discussions on the state of symbolic computation at the University of Waterloo. The authors wish to acknowledge many fruitful discussions with colleagues at the University of Waterloo, particularly Morven Gen tleman, Michael Malcolm, and Frank Tompa. It was recognized in these discussions that none ofthe locaIly-available systems for symbolic computation provided the facilities that should be expected for symbolic computation in modern computing environments. We concluded that since the basic design decisions for the then-current symbolic systems such as ALTRAN, CAMAL, REDUCE, and MACSYMA were based on 1960's computing technology, it would be wise to design a new system ""from scratch"". Thus we could take advantage of the software engineering technology which had become available in recent years, as well as drawing from the lessons of experience.

The human world, they claimed, had begun all over again; we are living now in a 'new creation.' They invited startled listeners to join God's new humanity.Ó --From the Introduction Buttrick's teatment is no romanticizing of early Christianity. The church then was as dismaying as it is now. Instead, this book focuses on the early Christian sense that they had passed from death to new life--a reversal that began with Jesus' resurrection, then explored his passion, and finally his ministry and life.

Model Predictive Control of High Power Converters and Industrial Drives,Tobias Geyer,John Wiley & Sons,2017-02-28,"In this original book on model predictive control (MPC) for power electronics, the focus is put on high-power applications with multilevel converters operating at switching frequencies well below 1 kHz, such as medium-voltage drives and modular multi-level converters. Consisting of two main parts, the first offers a detailed review of three-phase power electronics, electrical machines, carrier-based pulse width modulation, optimized pulse patterns, state-of-the art converter control methods and the principle of MPC. The second part is an in-depth treatment of MPC methods that fully exploit the performance potential of high-power converters. These control methods combine the fast control responses of deadbeat control with the optimal steady-state performance of optimized pulse patterns by resolving the antagonism between the two. MPC is expected to evolve into the control method of choice for power electronic systems operating at low pulse numbers with multiple coupled variables and tight operating constraints it. Model Predictive Control of High Power Converters and Industrial Drives will enable to reader to learn how to increase the power capability of the converter, lower the current distortions, reduce the filter size, achieve very fast transient responses and ensure the reliable operation within safe operating area constraints. Targeted at power electronic practitioners working on control-related aspects as well as control engineers, the material is intuitively accessible, and the mathematical formulations are augmented by illustrations, simple examples and a book companion website featuring animations. Readers benefit from a concise and comprehensive treatment of MPC for industrial power electronics, enabling them to understand, implement and advance the field of high-performance MPC schemes.",Technology & Engineering,740,N/A,0,en

Fuzzy Algorithms for Control,"H. B. Verbruggen, Hans-Jürgen Zimmermann, Robert Babuška",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-03-09,"Fuzzy Algorithms for Control gives an overview of the research results of a number of European research groups that are active and play a leading role in the field of fuzzy modeling and control. It contains 12 chapters divided into three parts. Chapters in the first part address the position of fuzzy systems in control engineering and in the AI community. State-of-the-art surveys on fuzzy modeling and control are presented along with a critical assessment of the role of these methodologists in control engineering. The second part is concerned with several analysis and design issues in fuzzy control systems. The analytical issues addressed include the algebraic representation of fuzzy models of different types, their approximation properties, and stability analysis of fuzzy control systems. Several design aspects are addressed, including performance specification for control systems in a fuzzy decision-making framework and complexity reduction in multivariable fuzzy systems. In the third part of the book, a number of applications of fuzzy control are presented. It is shown that fuzzy control in combination with other techniques such as fuzzy data analysis is an effective approach to the control of modern processes which present many challenges for the design of control systems. One has to cope with problems such as process nonlinearity, time-varying characteristics for incomplete process knowledge. Examples of real-world industrial applications presented in this book are a blast furnace, a lime kiln and a solar plant. Other examples of challenging problems in which fuzzy logic plays an important role and which are included in this book are mobile robotics and aircraft control. The aim of this book is to address both theoretical and practical subjects in a balanced way. It will therefore be useful for readers from the academic world and also from industry who want to apply fuzzy control in practice.",Mathematics,353,N/A,0,en
The Structure and Properties of Color Spaces and the Representation of Color Images,Eric Dubois,Springer Nature,2022-05-31,"This lecture describes the author's approach to the representation of color spaces and their use for color image processing. The lecture starts with a precise formulation of the space of physical stimuli (light). The model includes both continuous spectra and monochromatic spectra in the form of Dirac deltas. The spectral densities are considered to be functions of a continuous wavelength variable. This leads into the formulation of color space as a three-dimensional vector space, with all the associated structure. The approach is to start with the axioms of color matching for normal human viewers, often called Grassmann's laws, and developing the resulting vector space formulation. However, once the essential defining element of this vector space is identified, it can be extended to other color spaces, perhaps for different creatures and devices, and dimensions other than three. The CIE spaces are presented as main examples of color spaces. Many properties of the color space are examined. Once the vector space formulation is established, various useful decompositions of the space can be established. The first such decomposition is based on luminance, a measure of the relative brightness of a color. This leads to a direct-sum decomposition of color space where a two-dimensional subspace identifies the chromatic attribute, and a third coordinate provides the luminance. A different decomposition involving a projective space of chromaticity classes is then presented. Finally, it is shown how the three types of color deficiencies present in some groups of humans leads to a direct-sum decomposition of three one-dimensional subspaces that are associated with the three types of cone photoreceptors in the human retina. Next, a few specific linear and nonlinear color representations are presented. The color spaces of two digital cameras are also described. Then the issue of transformations between different color spaces is addressed. Finally, these ideas are applied to signal and system theory for color images. This is done using a vector signal approach where a general linear system is represented by a three-by-three system matrix. The formulation is applied to both continuous and discrete space images, and specific problems in color filter array sampling and displays are presented for illustration. The book is mainly targeted to researchers and graduate students in fields of signal processing related to any aspect of color imaging.",Technology & Engineering,111,N/A,0,en
Electrical Machines and Drives,Jan A. Melkebeek,Springer,2018-01-20,"This book aims to offer a thorough study and reference textbook on electrical machines and drives. The basic idea is to start from the pure electromagnetic principles to derive the equivalent circuits and steady-state equations of the most common electrical machines (in the first parts). Although the book mainly concentrates on rotating field machines, the first two chapters are devoted to transformers and DC commutator machines. The chapter on transformers is included as an introduction to induction and synchronous machines, their electromagnetics and equivalent circuits. Chapters three and four offer an in-depth study of induction and synchronous machines, respectively. Starting from their electromagnetics, steady-state equations and equivalent circuits are derived, from which their basic properties can be deduced. The second part discusses the main power-electronic supplies for electrical drives, for example rectifiers, choppers, cycloconverters and inverters. Much attention is paid to PWM techniques for inverters and the resulting harmonic content in the output waveform. In the third part, electrical drives are discussed, combining the traditional (rotating field and DC commutator) electrical machines treated in the first part and the power electronics of part two. Field orientation of induction and synchronous machines are discussed in detail, as well as direct torque control. In addition, also switched reluctance machines and stepping motors are discussed in the last chapters. Finally, part 4 is devoted to the dynamics of traditional electrical machines. Also for the dynamics of induction and synchronous machine drives, the electromagnetics are used as the starting point to derive the dynamic models. Throughout part 4, much attention is paid to the derivation of analytical models. But, of course, the basic dynamic properties and probable causes of instability of induction and synchronous machine drives are discussed in detail as well, with the derived models for stability in the small as starting point. In addition to the study of the stability in the small, a chapter is devoted to large-scale dynamics as well (e.g. sudden short-circuit of synchronous machines). The textbook is used as the course text for the Bachelor’s and Master’s programme in electrical and mechanical engineering at the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture of Ghent University. Parts 1 and 2 are taught in the basic course ’Fundamentals of Electric Drives’ in the third bachelor. Part 3 is used for the course ’Controlled Electrical Drives’ in the first master, while Part 4 is used in the specialised master on electrical energy.",Technology & Engineering,740,N/A,0,en

A Rapid Introduction to Adaptive Filtering,"Leonardo Rey Vega, Hernan Rey",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-08-07,"In this book, the authors provide insights into the basics of adaptive filtering, which are particularly useful for students taking their first steps into this field. They start by studying the problem of minimum mean-square-error filtering, i.e., Wiener filtering. Then, they analyze iterative methods for solving the optimization problem, e.g., the Method of Steepest Descent. By proposing stochastic approximations, several basic adaptive algorithms are derived, including Least Mean Squares (LMS), Normalized Least Mean Squares (NLMS) and Sign-error algorithms. The authors provide a general framework to study the stability and steady-state performance of these algorithms. The affine Projection Algorithm (APA) which provides faster convergence at the expense of computational complexity (although fast implementations can be used) is also presented. In addition, the Least Squares (LS) method and its recursive version (RLS), including fast implementations are discussed. The book closes with the discussion of several topics of interest in the adaptive filtering field.",Technology & Engineering,128,N/A,0,en

The intention is to publish a similar book annually, following each Optimization Day. The idea of having an annual Optimization Day was conceived by Barney Glover; the first of these Optimization Days was held in 1994 at the University of Ballarat. Barney hoped that such a yearly event would bring together the many, but widely dispersed, researchers in Australia who were publishing in optimization and related areas such as control. The first Optimization Day event was followed by similar conferences at The University of New South Wales (1995), The University of Melbourne (1996), the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (1997), and The University of Western Australia (1998). The 1999 conference will return to Ballarat University, being organized by Barney's long-time collaborator Alex Rubinov.

Revisiting Grooved Ware,"Mike Copper, Alasdair Whittle, Alison Sheridan",Oxbow Books,2023-11-23,"Following its appearance, arguably in Orkney in the 32nd century cal BC, Grooved Ware soon became widespread across Britain and Ireland, seemingly replacing earlier pottery styles and being deposited in contexts as varied as simple pits, passage tombs, ceremonial timber circles and henge monuments. As a result, Grooved Ware lies at the heart of many ongoing debates concerning social and economic developments at the end of the 4th and during the first half of the 3rd millennia cal BC. Stemming from the 2022 Neolithic Studies Group autumn conference, and following on from Cleal and MacSween’s 1999 NSG volume on Grooved Ware, this book presents a series of papers from researchers specializing in Grooved Ware pottery and the British and Irish Neolithic, offering both regional and thematic perspectives on this important ceramic tradition. Chapters cover the development of Grooved Ware in Orkney as well as the timing and nature of its appearance, development, and subsequent demise in different regions of Britain and Ireland. In addition, thematic papers consider what Grooved Ware can contribute to understandings of inter-regional interactions during the earlier 3rd millennium cal BC, the possible meaning of Grooved Ware’s decorative motifs, and the thorny issue of the validity and significance of the various Grooved Ware sub-styles. The book will be of great value not only to archaeologists and students with a specific interest in Grooved Ware pottery but also to those with a more general interest in the development of the Neolithic of Britain and Ireland.",Social Science,305,N/A,0,en

Model Predictive Vibration Control,"Gergely Takács, Boris Rohaľ-Ilkiv",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-03-05,"Real-time model predictive controller (MPC) implementation in active vibration control (AVC) is often rendered difficult by fast sampling speeds and extensive actuator-deformation asymmetry. If the control of lightly damped mechanical structures is assumed, the region of attraction containing the set of allowable initial conditions requires a large prediction horizon, making the already computationally demanding on-line process even more complex. Model Predictive Vibration Control provides insight into the predictive control of lightly damped vibrating structures by exploring computationally efficient algorithms which are capable of low frequency vibration control with guaranteed stability and constraint feasibility. In addition to a theoretical primer on active vibration damping and model predictive control, Model Predictive Vibration Control provides a guide through the necessary steps in understanding the founding ideas of predictive control applied in AVC such as: · the implementation of computationally efficient algorithms · control strategies in simulation and experiment and · typical hardware requirements for piezoceramics actuated smart structures.

Diary of an Angry Targeted Individual: Mind Invasive Technology (Mind Control Technology Book Series) Book 4 of 7,Renee Pittman,Mother's Love Publishing and Enterprises,2014-03-31,"The key to the success of weaponized beamed technology derived from the Electromagnetic Spectrum depends on several factors. One of the most successful is the strategic effort to discredit victims by applying the mental illness tag and hoping it will stick. For success, the use of anyone around victims, especially family members become crucial. Renee Pittman continues her mission of exposing the hidden evil today by pulling back the shroud of secrecy. This is not only done through the testimony of professionals and compiled open literature evidence but through her personal experiences and the testimony of victims both men, women, and even children, confirming legalized, ongoing human experimentation on steroids. In a diary-like setting, the author gives explicit details of her continued, day-to-day battle, to combat covert technological terrorism. She details the continued hope of many for justice system intervention and coping with the roadblocks faced as an inability to effectively litigate against a Goliath, in these cases, high-powered government agencies of the United States of America. Sadly, many attorneys will not touch these difficult to prove cases, due to the invisible beamed weapons being used. As a result, thousands of lives are being destroyed without recourse. However, to the dismay of those seeking to keep the widespread use of advanced psychotronic technology under wraps and its capabilities, Pittman details, not only its machination but also provides excellent examples of precise, heinous, manipulative techniques, for example, the creation of sexual deviance as well, as a means of controlling targets and even blackmailing into submission.

Superior-Order Curvature-Correction Techniques for Voltage References,Cosmin Radu Popa,Springer Science & Business Media,2009-09-01,"Voltage references represent important VLSI structures, having multiple appli- tions in analog and mixed-signal circuits: measurement equipment, voltage re- lators, temperature sensors, data acquisition systems, memories, or AD and DA converters. Operating as a subcircuit in a complex system, an important requi- ment for this class of circuits is represented by the possibility of implementation in the existing technology, using the available active and passive devices. The most important performances of a voltage reference circuit are represented by temperature behavior, power supply rejection ratio, transient response and, for the latest designs, by low-power low-voltage operation. Depending on the load - quirements, the output of the circuit can be regulated or unregulated. In order to reduce the sensitivity of the reference voltage with respect to the supply voltage variations, modi?ed cascode structures can be implemented, a trade-off between line regulation and low-voltage operation being necessary in this case. A large bandwidth of the voltage reference improves the transient behavior of the circuit, implying also a good noise rejection. Referringtothe possibilities ofimplementinga voltagereferencecircuit,two d- ferent approaches could be identi?ed: voltage-mode and current-mode topologies, being also possible to design a mixed-mode voltage reference.",Technology & Engineering,192,N/A,0,en

Fuzzy Decision Making in Modeling and Control,Joao M. C. Sousa,World Scientific,2002,"Decision making and control are two fields with distinct methods for solving problems, and yet they are closely related. This book bridges the gap between decision making and control in the field of fuzzy decisions and fuzzy control, and discusses various ways in which fuzzy decision making methods can be applied to systems modeling and control.Fuzzy decision making is a powerful paradigm for dealing with human expert knowledge when one is designing fuzzy model-based controllers. The combination of fuzzy decision making and fuzzy control in this book can lead to novel control schemes that improve the existing controllers in various ways. The following applications of fuzzy decision making methods for designing control systems are considered: OCo Fuzzy decision making for enhancing fuzzy modeling. The values of important parameters in fuzzy modeling algorithms are selected by using fuzzy decision making.OCo Fuzzy decision making for designing signal-based fuzzy controllers. The controller mappings and the defuzzification steps can be obtained by decision making methods.OCo Fuzzy design and performance specifications in model-based control. Fuzzy constraints and fuzzy goals are used.OCo Design of model-based controllers combined with fuzzy decision modules. Human operator experience is incorporated for the performance specification in model-based control.The advantages of bringing together fuzzy control and fuzzy decision making are shown with multiple examples from real and simulated control systems.""",Computers,356,N/A,0,en

The first PCM was held in Sydney, Australia, in 2000. Since then, it has been hosted successfully by Beijing, China, in 2001, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2002, Singapore in 2003, and Tokyo, Japan, in 2004, and finally Jeju, one of the most beautiful and fantastic islands in Korea. This year, we accepted 181 papers out of 570 submissions including regular and special session papers. The acceptance rate of 32% indicates our commitment to ensuring a very high-quality conference. This would not be possible without the full support of the excellent Technical Committee and anonymous reviewers that provided timely and insightful reviews. We would therefore like to thank the Program Committee and all reviewers. The program of this year reflects the current interests of the PCM’s. The accepted papers cover a range of topics, including, all aspects of multimedia, both technical and artistic perspectives and both theoretical and practical issues. The PCM 2005 program covers tutorial sessions and plenary lectures as well as regular presentations in three tracks of oral sessions and a poster session in a single track.

Properties and Propositions,Robert Trueman,Cambridge University Press,2021-01-07,"This book articulates and defends Fregean realism, a theory of properties based on Frege's insight that properties are not objects, but rather the satisfaction conditions of predicates. Robert Trueman argues that this approach is the key not only to dissolving a host of longstanding metaphysical puzzles, such as Bradley's Regress and the Problem of Universals, but also to understanding the relationship between states of affairs, propositions, and the truth conditions of sentences. Fregean realism, Trueman suggests, ultimately leads to a version of the identity theory of truth, the theory that true propositions are identical to obtaining states of affairs. In other words, the identity theory collapses the gap between mind and world. This book will be of interest to anyone working in logic, metaphysics, the philosophy of language or the philosophy of mind.",Philosophy,241,N/A,0,en
Propositional Content,Peter Hanks,OUP Oxford,2015-06-04,"Peter Hanks defends a new theory about the nature of propositional content. According to this theory, the basic bearers of representational properties are particular mental or spoken actions. Propositions are types of these actions, which we use to classify and individuate our attitudes and speech acts. Hanks abandons several key features of the traditional Fregean conception of propositional content, including the idea that propositions are the primary bearers of truth-conditions, the distinction between content and force, and the concept of entertainment. The main difficulty for this traditional conception is the problem of the unity of the proposition, the problem of explaining how propositions have truth conditions and other representational properties. The new theory developed here, in its place,explains the unity of propositions and provides new solutions to a long list of puzzles and problems in philosophy of language.",Philosophy,238,N/A,0,en
Multimedia Software Engineering,Shi-Kuo Chang,Springer Science & Business Media,2000-01-31,"Multimedia has two fundamental characteristics that can be expressed by the following formula: Multimedia = Multiple Media + Hypermedia.

These are some of the issues to be explored in this book. The first two chapters will be of interest to managers, software engineers, programmers, and people interested in gaining an overall understanding of multimedia software engineering. The next six chapters present multimedia software engineering according to the conceptual framework introduced in Chapter One. This is of particular use to practitioners, system developers, multimedia application designers, programmers, and people interested in prototyping multimedia applications. The next three chapters are more research-oriented and are mainly intended for researchers working on the specification, modeling, and analysis of distributed multimedia systems, but will also be relevant to scientists, researchers, and software engineers interested in the systems and theoretical aspects of multimedia software engineering.

AFM-Based Observation and Robotic Nano-manipulation,"Shuai Yuan, Lianqing Liu, Zhidong Wang, Ning Xi",Springer Nature,2020-02-15,"This book highlights the latest advances in AFM nano-manipulation research in the field of nanotechnology. There are numerous uncertainties in the AFM nano-manipulation environment, such as thermal drift, tip broadening effect, tip positioning errors and manipulation instability. This book proposes a method for estimating tip morphology using a blind modeling algorithm, which is the basis of the analysis of the influence of thermal drift on AFM scanning images, and also explains how the scanning image of AFM is reconstructed with better accuracy. Further, the book describes how the tip positioning errors caused by thermal drift and system nonlinearity can be corrected using the proposed landmark observation method, and also explores the tip path planning method in a complex environment. Lastly, it presents an AFM-based nano-manipulation platform to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using theoretical research, such as tip positioning and virtual nano-hand.",Technology & Engineering,189,N/A,0,en

The Elements of Continuum Biomechanics,Marcelo Epstein,John Wiley & Sons,2012-07-13,"An appealing and engaging introduction to Continuum Mechanics in Biosciences This book presents the elements of Continuum Mechanics to people interested in applications to biological systems. It is divided into two parts, the first of which introduces the basic concepts within a strictly one-dimensional spatial context. This policy has been adopted so as to allow the newcomer to Continuum Mechanics to appreciate how the theory can be applied to important issues in Biomechanics from the very beginning. These include mechanical and thermodynamical balance, materials with fading memory and chemically reacting mixtures. In the second part of the book, the fully fledged three-dimensional theory is presented and applied to hyperelasticity of soft tissue, and to theories of remodeling, aging and growth. The book closes with a chapter devoted to Finite Element analysis.

"Space, Time, and Stuff",Frank Arntzenius,Oxford University Press,2012-01-19,"Frank Arntzenius presents a series of radical new ideas about the structure of space and time. Space, Time, and Stuff is an attempt to show that physics is geometry: that the fundamental structure of the physical world is purely geometrical structure. Along the way, he examines some non-standard views about the structure of spacetime and its inhabitants, including the idea that space and time are pointless, the idea that quantum mechanics is a completely local theory, the idea that antiparticles are just particles travelling back in time, and the idea that time has no structure whatsoever. The main thrust of the book, however, is that there are good reasons to believe that spaces other than spacetime exist, and that it is the existence of these additional spaces that allows one to reduce all of physics to geometry. Philosophy, and metaphysics in particular, plays an important role here: the assumption that the fundamental laws of physics are simple in terms of the fundamental physical properties and relations is pivotal. Without this assumption one gets nowhere. That is to say, when trying to extract the fundamental structure of the world from theories of physics one ignores philosophy at one's peril!",Philosophy,297,N/A,0,en

Iterative Learning Control for Systems with Iteration-Varying Trial Lengths,"Dong Shen, Xuefang Li",Springer,2019-01-29,"This book presents a comprehensive and detailed study on iterative learning control (ILC) for systems with iteration-varying trial lengths. Instead of traditional ILC, which requires systems to repeat on a fixed time interval, this book focuses on a more practical case where the trial length might randomly vary from iteration to iteration. The iteration-varying trial lengths may be different from the desired trial length, which can cause redundancy or dropouts of control information in ILC, making ILC design a challenging problem. The book focuses on the synthesis and analysis of ILC for both linear and nonlinear systems with iteration-varying trial lengths, and proposes various novel techniques to deal with the precise tracking problem under non-repeatable trial lengths, such as moving window, switching system, and searching-based moving average operator. It not only discusses recent advances in ILC for systems with iteration-varying trial lengths, but also includes numerous intuitive figures to allow readers to develop an in-depth understanding of the intrinsic relationship between the incomplete information environment and the essential tracking performance. This book is intended for academic scholars and engineers who are interested in learning about control, data-driven control, networked control systems, and related fields.

Wave Propagation in Materials and Structures,Srinivasan Gopalakrishnan,CRC Press,2016-11-03,"This book focuses on basic and advanced concepts of wave propagation in diverse material systems and structures. Topics are organized in increasing order of complexity for better appreciation of the subject. Additionally, the book provides basic guidelines to design many of the futuristic materials and devices for varied applications. The material in the book also can be used for designing safer and more lightweight structures such as aircraft, bridges, and mechanical and structural components. The main objective of this book is to bring both the introductory and the advanced topics of wave propagation into one text. Such a text is necessary considering the multi-disciplinary nature of the subject. This book is written in a step-by step modular approach wherein the chapters are organized so that the complexity in the subject is slowly introduced with increasing chapter numbers. Text starts by introducing all the fundamental aspects of wave propagations and then moves on to advanced topics on the subject. Every chapter is provided with a number of numerical examples of increasing complexity to bring out the concepts clearly The solution of wave propagation is computationally very intensive and hence two different approaches, namely, the Finite Element method and the Spectral Finite method are introduced and have a strong focus on wave propagation.

Spanish in New York,"Ricardo Otheguy, Ana Celia Zentella",Oxford University Press,2011-11-02,"Spanish in New York is a groundbreaking sociolinguistic analysis of immigrant bilingualism in a U.S. setting. Drawing on one of the largest corpora of spoken Spanish ever assembled for a single city, Otheguy and Zentella demonstrate the extent to which the language of Latinos in New York City represents a continuation of structural variation as it is found in Latin America, as well as the extent to which Spanish has evolved in New York City. Their study, which focuses on language contact, dialectal leveling, and structural continuity, carefully distinguishes between the influence of English and the mutual influences of forms of Spanish with roots in different parts of Latin America. Taking variationist sociolinguistics as its guiding paradigm, the book compares the Spanish of New Yorkers born in Latin America with that of those born in New York City. Findings are grounded in a comparative analysis of 140 sociolinguistic interviews of speakers with origins in Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico and Puerto Rico. Quantitative analysis (correlations, anovas, variable hierarchies, constraint hierarchies) reveals the effect on the use of subject personal pronouns of the speaker's gender, immigrant generation, years spent in New York, and amount of exposure to English and to varieties of Spanish. In addition to these speaker factors, structural and communicative variables, including the person and tense of the verb and its referential status, have a significant impact on pronominal usage in New York City.",Language Arts & Disciplines,320,N/A,0,en

Engineering Theories of Software Intensive Systems,"Manfred Broy, Johannes Gruenbauer, David Harel, Tony Hoare",Springer Science & Business Media,2005-07-15,"Software engineering has over the years been applied in many different fields, ranging from telecommunications to embedded systems in car and aircraft industry as well as in production engineering and computer networks. Foundations in software technology lie in models allowing to capture application domains, detailed requirements, but also to understand the structure and working of software systems like software architectures and programs. These models have to be expressed in techniques based on discrete mathematics, algebra and logics. However, according to the very specific needs in applications of software technology, formal methods have to serve the needs and the quality of advanced software engineering methods, especially taking into account security aspects in Information Technology.

Principles of Protocol Design,Robin Sharp,Springer Science & Business Media,2008-02-13,"This book introduces the reader to the principles used in the construction of a large range of modern data communication protocols. The approach we take is rather a formal one, primarily based on descriptions of protocols in the notation of CSP. This not only enables us to describe protocols in a concise manner, but also to reason about many of their interesting properties and formally to prove certain aspects of their correctness with respect to appropriate speci?cations. Only after considering the main principles do we go on to consider actual protocols where these principles are exploited. This is a completely new edition of a book which was ?rst published in 1994, where the main focus of many international efforts to develop data communication systems was on OSI – Open Systems Interconnection – the standardised archit- ture for communication systems developed within the International Organisation for Standardization, ISO. In the intervening 13 years, many of the speci?c protocols - veloped as part of the OSI initiative have fallen into disuse. However, the terms and concepts introduced in the OSI Reference Model are still essential for a systematic and consistent analysis of data communication systems, and OSI terms are therefore used throughout.

Mechanics of Fibrous Composites,M.H. Datoo,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP) composite materials are basically of two types. The first type is short fibres reinforced in a plastic matrix, and the other type continuous (long) fibres reinforced in a plastic matrix. The exact distinction between a short and a continuous fibre is discussed in Chapter 1. Continuous fibre-reinforced composite materials are referred to by many labels: FRP composites, advanced composites, fibrous composites, composite materials or simply composites. These terms are now generally accepted to mean the same type of material, namely, continuous fibre reinforced in plastic. In this book, the term fibrous composites is used to define a continuous fibre reinforced in plastic. Fibrous composites are presently in use for a variety of structural applica tions, and may offer an alternative to conventional metallic materials. The behaviour of fibrous composites subjected to a loading condition is very different from that of a metallic isotropic material. Therefore, 'new' analytical and testing methods are required to analyse a structural element and sections made from layered fibrous composites. There are a number of books written on the subject of composite materials. All of these are excellent in their content and achieve the authors' objectives.",Technology & Engineering,646,N/A,0,en

Variational Analysis and Set Optimization,"Akhtar A. Khan, Elisabeth Köbis, Christiane Tammer",CRC Press,2019-06-07,"This book contains the latest advances in variational analysis and set / vector optimization, including uncertain optimization, optimal control and bilevel optimization. Recent developments concerning scalarization techniques, necessary and sufficient optimality conditions and duality statements are given. New numerical methods for efficiently solving set optimization problems are provided. Moreover, applications in economics, finance and risk theory are discussed. Summary The objective of this book is to present advances in different areas of variational analysis and set optimization, especially uncertain optimization, optimal control and bilevel optimization. Uncertain optimization problems will be approached from both a stochastic as well as a robust point of view. This leads to different interpretations of the solutions, which widens the choices for a decision-maker given his preferences. Recent developments regarding linear and nonlinear scalarization techniques with solid and nonsolid ordering cones for solving set optimization problems are discussed in this book. These results are useful for deriving optimality conditions for set and vector optimization problems. Consequently, necessary and sufficient optimality conditions are presented within this book, both in terms of scalarization as well as generalized derivatives. Moreover, an overview of existing duality statements and new duality assertions is given. The book also addresses the field of variable domination structures in vector and set optimization. Including variable ordering cones is especially important in applications such as medical image registration with uncertainties. This book covers a wide range of applications of set optimization. These range from finance, investment, insurance, control theory, economics to risk theory. As uncertain multi-objective optimization, especially robust approaches, lead to set optimization, one main focus of this book is uncertain optimization. Important recent developments concerning numerical methods for solving set optimization problems sufficiently fast are main features of this book. These are illustrated by various examples as well as easy-to-follow-steps in order to facilitate the decision process for users. Simple techniques aimed at practitioners working in the fields of mathematical programming, finance and portfolio selection are presented. These will help in the decision-making process, as well as give an overview of nondominated solutions to choose from.",Business & Economics,244,N/A,0,en

New Directions in Research with Third-Generation Soft X-Ray Synchrotron Radiation Sources,"A.S. Schlachter, F.J. Wuilleumier",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Soft X-rays are a powerful probe of matter. They interact selectively with electrons in atoms and molecules and can be used to study atomic physics, chemical reactions, surfaces and solids, and biological entities. Over the past 20 years, synchrotrons have emerged as powerful sources of soft X-rays for experimental use. A new, third generation of synchrotron light sources is scheduled to start operation over the next few years, beginning in 1993. These facilities are distinguished by their ultra-low emittance electron beams and by their undulators -- precisely engineered magnetic devices that cause the electrons passing through them to produce highly coherent X-rays and ultraviolet light of unprecedented spectral brightness. This volume emphasizes third-generation sources that produce light in the 10 eV--10 KeV energy range. It describes potential applications ranging from the purely scientific to the commercially viable and includes chapters on the practical aspects of designing undulators and beam line optics. Unique in its coverage, the book is a vital addition to the library of any scientist who needs information on the world's most advanced imaging and spectroscopic techniques. (ABSTRACT) This volume emphasizes the applications of new third generation synchrotron radiation sources that produce light in the ultraviolet and soft X-ray range of the spectrum. The unprecedented brightness of this light enables experiments to be conducted with greatly increased spatial and spectral resolution. Scientists can exploit these properties for imaging and spectroscopic applications that until now were impossible or impractical. Prominent researchers in the field describe these applications and others made possible by the light's pulsed time structure and polarization. The volume also includes chapters on the practical aspects of designing undulators and beam line optics.",Science,400,N/A,0,en

Clinical Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy,E.B. Cady,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Nobody can know everything. For the successful application of techniques based on nuclear magnetic resonance to clinical problems, it is a vital necessity that individuals with widely different skills should learn a little of each others' trades by co-operation and communication. Ernest Cady has long proved himself a master of these arts to his colleagues at University College London, and by writing this excellent book he extends his experience to a wide circle of readers. Although the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) phenomenon had been predicted theoretically (and to some degree demonstrated experimentally) appreciably earlier, it required the advances in electronics that took place during World War II to turn NMR into a practical technique, as demonstrated independently in 1946 by Bloch and Purcell. Since then, NMR has been used extensively and increasingly by chemists and physicists. In the 1970s the first applications of NMR to animal organs yielded important advances in our knowledge of the biochemical and physiological processes as they occur in genuinely intact tissues. They showed incidentally that some conventional techniques introduce significant artifacts.",Science,286,N/A,0,en
The Thermodynamics of Linear Fluids and Fluid Mixtures,"Miloslav Pekař, Ivan Samohýl",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-11-19,"In this book, Samohýl and Pekař offer a consistent and general non-equilibrium thermodynamic description for a model of chemically reacting mixtures. This type of model is frequently encountered in practice and up until now, chemically reacting systems (out of equilibrium) have rarely been described in books on non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Readers of this book benefit from the systematic development of the theory; this starts with general principles, going through the applications to single component fluid systems, and finishing with the theory of mixtures, including chemical reactions. The authors describe the simplest mixture model – the linear fluid – and highlight many practical and thermodynamically consistent equations for describing transport properties and reaction kinetics for this model. Further on in the book, the authors also describe more complex models.

Airport Passenger Screening Using Backscatter X-Ray Machines,"National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, Division on Earth and Life Studies, Nuclear and Radiation Studies Board, Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences, National Materials and Manufacturing Board, Committee on Airport Passenger Screening: Backscatter X-Ray Machines",National Academies Press,2016-01-10,"Passenger screening at commercial airports in the United States has gone through significant changes since the events of September 11, 2001. In response to increased concern over terrorist attacks on aircrafts, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has deployed security systems of advanced imaging technology (AIT) to screen passengers at airports. To date (December 2014), TSA has deployed AITs in U.S. airports of two different technologies that use different types of radiation to detect threats: millimeter wave and X-ray backscatter AIT systems. X-ray backscatter AITs were deployed in U.S. airports in 2008 and subsequently removed from all airports by June 2013 due to privacy concerns. TSA is looking to deploy a second-generation X-ray backscatter AIT equipped with privacy software to eliminate production of an image of the person being screened in order to alleviate these concerns. This report reviews previous studies as well as current processes used by the Department of Homeland Security and equipment manufacturers to estimate radiation exposures resulting from backscatter X-ray advanced imaging technology system use in screening air travelers. Airport Passenger Screening Using Backscatter X-Ray Machines examines whether exposures comply with applicable health and safety standards for public and occupational exposures to ionizing radiation and whether system design, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures are appropriate to prevent over exposures of travelers and operators to ionizing radiation. This study aims to address concerns about exposure to radiation from X-ray backscatter AITs raised by Congress, individuals within the scientific community, and others.",Technology & Engineering,203,N/A,0,en

Lensless Holography Methods for Soft X-ray Resonant Coherent Imaging,Diling Zhu,Stanford University,2010,"The ability to interpret and inverse x-ray diffraction patterns from crystals has largely shaped our understanding of the structure of matter. However, structure determination of noncrystalline objects from their diffraction patterns is a much more difficult task. The dramatic increase in available coherent x-ray photon flux over the past decade has made possible a technique known as lensless coherent diffractive imaging (CDI), that addresses exactly this problem. The central question around CDI is the so-called phase problem: upon detection of the diffraction intensity, the phase information of the diffracted wave is inevitably lost. Generally, the phase problem is approached using iterative phase retrieval algorithms. Holographic methods, through interference with reference diffractions, encode the phase information directly inside the measured x-ray holograms, and are therefore able to avoid the stagnation and uniqueness problems commonly encountered by the iterative algorithms. This dissertation discusses two novel holographic methods for coherent lensless imaging using resonant soft x-rays. The first part focuses on generalizing the multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction technique, a highly successful method for solving the crystal structures of biomacromolecules, into a multiple-wavelength holography technique for nanoscale resonant x-ray imaging. Using this method I show element specific reconstructions of nanoparticles and magnetization distribution in magnetic thin films with sub 50 nm resolution. The second part discusses progress in X-ray Fourier holography, an ultrafast lensless imaging platform that can be used with the upcoming x-ray free electron lasers. In particular, I will present experiments using two novel types of extended reference structures that bring the resolution beyond the precision of reference fabrication, previously regarded as the resolution limit for x-ray Fourier transform holography. Finally, future applications of holographic methods, especially experimental considerations for time-resolved studies of nanostructures using X-FELs, will be discussed.",,124,N/A,0,en

Advances in X-Ray Analysis,Camden R. Hubbard,Springer,1983-06,"At the Denver X-Ray Conference, the topic for the plenary lectures alternates annually between x-ray diffraction and x-ray fluorescence. This year is a ""diffraction"" year, and the theme is accuracy in powder diffraction. Instead of comprehensive cover age, such as was attempted at the Accuracy in Powder Diffraction Meeting held at the National Bureau of Standards in 1978, this meeting focuses on recent developments in measurement accuracy of two-theta and intensity. The focus on accuracy, from the practical point of view, is important in a wide range of x-ray diffraction measurements. Accu rate data improve our ability to identify phases in a mixture using the Powder Diffraction File. Improved accuracy is essential for better characterization of the lattice, crystallite size, strain and structure. Finally, the accuracy of quantitative analysis is of great concern in many laboratories. The five invited papers of the plenary session give a broad perspective of recent activity throughout the world on uses of more accurate data, on methods to achieve greater accuracy, and on fundamental factors affecting the accuracy. The scope of the conference, however, is much broader than that of the plenary session. The workshops lead off with many practical aspects of x-ray analysis. Many of the contributed papers expand on the theme of accuracy in x-ray powder diffraction. In particular, the s.ession on XRD quantitative phase analysis provides an exception al coverage of the limitations in quantitative analysis and of the techniques being employed to improve the results.",Science,504,N/A,0,en

Bulldog,John Rolfe Ellis,MIT Press (MA),1986,"This thesis explores the problem of exploiting the parallelism available in emerging multiprocessor architectures. Ellis contends that high-quality compilers can be written for VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) computers. These machines drive multiple parallel RISCs (Reduced Instruction Set Computers) with a single instruction stream. Each instruction is long enough to command all of the RISCs at once. Exploiting the parallelism in VLIW machines can be difficult, so Ellis developed a compiler--Bulldog--that incorporates a number of optimizations. It uses trace scheduling to find more parallelism, memory reference and memory bank disambiguation to increase memory bandwidth, and a new code-generation algorithms.",Computers,344,N/A,0,en

The Semantics of Prepositions,Michel Aurnague & Laure Vieu,Walter de Gruyter,1993,"A reconsideration of the semantics of a lexical category--prepositions--that has recently witnessed a plethora of investigations. The volume approaches the issue first from a more general perspective, namely the extent to which insights into the meaning of prepositions give clues to the semantic structure of lexical units and its processing in general. It goes on to deal with the meaning of prepositions from the perspective of how natural language processing can benefit from the insights of theoretical linguistics, especially with respect to machine translation and image understanding. Most of the papers were originally presented at a workshop held in February 1990 at the Institut fur Angewandte Informationsforschung.

Sliding Mode Control Using Novel Sliding Surfaces,"B. Bandyopadhyay, Fulwani Deepak, Kyung-Soo Kim",Springer,2009-10-14,"AfterasurveypaperbyUtkininthelate1970s,slidingmodecontrolmeth- ologies emerged as an e?ective tool to tackle uncertainty and disturbances which are inevitable in most of the practical systems. Sliding mode control is a particular class of variable structure control which was introduced by Emel’yanov and his colleagues. The design paradigms of sliding mode c- trol has now become a mature design technique for the design of robust c- troller of uncertain system. In sliding mode technique, the state trajectory of the system is constrained on a chosen manifold (or within some neighb- hood thereof) by an appropriatecontrolaction. This manifold is also called a switching surface or a sliding surface. During sliding mode, system dynamics is governed by the chosen manifold which results in a well celebrated inva- ance property towards certain classes of disturbance and model mismatches. The purpose of this monograph is to give a di?erent dimension to sl- ing surface design to achieve high performance of the system. Design of the switching surface is vital because the closed loop dynamics is governed by the parameters of the sliding surface. Therefore sliding surface should be - signed to meet the closed loop speci?cations. Many systems demand high performance with robustness. To address this issue of achieving high perf- mance with robustness, we propose nonlinear surfaces for di?erent classes of systems. The nonlinear surface is designed such that it changes the system’s closed-loop damping ratio from its initial low value to a ?nal high value.",Technology & Engineering,147,N/A,0,en

Field and Service Robotics,"Kazuya Yoshida, Satoshi Tadokoro",Springer,2013-12-30,"FSR, the International Conference on Field and Service Robotics, is the leading single track conference of robotics for field and service applications. This book presents the results of FSR2012, the eighth conference of Field and Service Robotics, which was originally planned for 2011 with the venue of Matsushima in Tohoku region of Japan. However, on March 11, 2011, a magnitude M9.0 earthquake occurred off the Pacific coast of Tohoku, and a large-scale disaster was caused by the Tsunami which resulted, therefore the conference was postponed by one year to July, 2012. In fact, this earthquake raised issues concerning the contribution of field and service robotics technology to emergency scenarios. A number of precious lessons were learned from operation of robots in the resulting, very real and challenging, disaster environments. Up-to-date study on disaster response, relief and recovery was then featured in the conference. This book offers 43 papers on a broad range of topics including: Disaster Response, Service/Entertainment Robots, Inspection/Maintenance Robots, Mobile Robot Navigation, Agricultural Robots, Robots for Excavation, Planetary Exploration, Large Area Mapping, SLAM for Outdoor Robots, and Elemental Technology for Mobile Robots.",Technology & Engineering,648,N/A,0,en

Biologically Inspired Control of Humanoid Robot Arms,"Adam Spiers, Said Ghani Khan, Guido Herrmann",Springer,2016-05-19,"This book investigates a biologically inspired method of robot arm control, developed with the objective of synthesising human-like motion dynamically, using nonlinear, robust and adaptive control techniques in practical robot systems. The control method caters to a rising interest in humanoid robots and the need for appropriate control schemes to match these systems. Unlike the classic kinematic schemes used in industrial manipulators, the dynamic approaches proposed here promote human-like motion with better exploitation of the robot’s physical structure. This also benefits human-robot interaction. The control schemes proposed in this book are inspired by a wealth of human-motion literature that indicates the drivers of motion to be dynamic, model-based and optimal. Such considerations lend themselves nicely to achievement via nonlinear control techniques without the necessity for extensive and complex biological models. The operational-space method of robot control forms the basis of many of the techniques investigated in this book. The method includes attractive features such as the decoupling of motion into task and posture components. Various developments are made in each of these elements. Simple cost functions inspired by biomechanical “effort” and “discomfort” generate realistic posture motion. Sliding-mode techniques overcome robustness shortcomings for practical implementation. Arm compliance is achieved via a method of model-free adaptive control that also deals with actuator saturation via anti-windup compensation. A neural-network-centered learning-by-observation scheme generates new task motions, based on motion-capture data recorded from human volunteers. In other parts of the book, motion capture is used to test theories of human movement. All developed controllers are applied to the reaching motion of a humanoid robot arm and are demonstrated to be practically realisable. This book is designed to be of interest to those wishing to achieve dynamics-based human-like robot-arm motion in academic research, advanced study or certain industrial environments. The book provides motivations, extensive reviews, research results and detailed explanations. It is not only suited to practising control engineers, but also applicable for general roboticists who wish to develop control systems expertise in this area.",Technology & Engineering,286,N/A,0,en

Fault-tolerant Control and Diagnosis for Integer and Fractional-order Systems,"Rafael Martínez-Guerra, Fidel Meléndez-Vázquez, Iván Trejo-Zúñiga",Springer Nature,2020-12-14,"This book is about algebraic and differential methods, as well as fractional calculus, applied to diagnose and reject faults in nonlinear systems, which are of integer or fractional order. This represents an extension of a very important and widely studied problem in control theory, namely fault diagnosis and rejection (using differential algebraic approaches), to systems presenting fractional dynamics, i.e. systems whose dynamics are represented by derivatives and integrals of non-integer order. The authors offer a thorough overview devoted to fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control applied to fractional-order and integer-order dynamical systems, and they introduce new methodologies for control and observation described by fractional and integer models, together with successful simulations and real-time applications. The basic concepts and tools of mathematics required to understand the methodologies proposed are all clearly introduced and explained. Consequently, the book is useful as supplementary reading in courses of applied mathematics and nonlinear control theory. This book is meant for engineers, mathematicians, physicists and, in general, to researchers and postgraduate students in diverse areas who have a minimum knowledge of calculus.

Deep Learning Approaches to Text Production,"Shashi Narayan, Claire Gardent",Morgan & Claypool Publishers,2020-03-20,"Text production has many applications. It is used, for instance, to generate dialogue turns from dialogue moves, verbalise the content of knowledge bases, or generate English sentences from rich linguistic representations, such as dependency trees or abstract meaning representations. Text production is also at work in text-to-text transformations such as sentence compression, sentence fusion, paraphrasing, sentence (or text) simplification, and text summarisation. This book offers an overview of the fundamentals of neural models for text production. In particular, we elaborate on three main aspects of neural approaches to text production: how sequential decoders learn to generate adequate text, how encoders learn to produce better input representations, and how neural generators account for task-specific objectives. Indeed, each text-production task raises a slightly different challenge (e.g, how to take the dialogue context into account when producing a dialogue turn, how to detect and merge relevant information when summarising a text, or how to produce a well-formed text that correctly captures the information contained in some input data in the case of data-to-text generation). We outline the constraints specific to some of these tasks and examine how existing neural models account for them. More generally, this book considers text-to-text, meaning-to-text, and data-to-text transformations. It aims to provide the audience with a basic knowledge of neural approaches to text production and a roadmap to get them started with the related work. The book is mainly targeted at researchers, graduate students, and industrials interested in text production from different forms of inputs.",Computers,201,N/A,0,en

Web Database Applications with PHP and MySQL,"Hugh E. Williams, David Lane","""O'Reilly Media, Inc.""",2004-05-13,"There are many reasons for serving up dynamic content from a web site: to offer an online shopping site, create customized information pages for users, or just manage a large volume of content through a database. Anyone with a modest knowledge of HTML and web site management can learn to create dynamic content through the PHP programming language and the MySQL database. This book gives you the background and tools to do the job safely and reliably.Web Database Applications with PHP and MySQL, Second Edition thoroughly reflects the needs of real-world applications. It goes into detail on such practical issues as validating input (do you know what a proper credit card number looks like?), logging in users, and using templatesto give your dynamic web pages a standard look.But this book goes even further. It shows how JavaScript and PHP can be used in tandem to make a user's experience faster and more pleasant. It shows the correct way to handle errors in user input so that a site looks professional. It introduces the vast collection of powerful tools available in the PEAR repository and shows how to use some of the most popular tools.Even while it serves as an introduction to new programmers, the book does not omit critical tasks that web sites require. For instance, every site that allows updates must handle the possibility of multiple users accessing data at the same time. This book explains how to solve the problem in detail with locking.Through a sophisticated sample application--Hugh and Dave's Wine Store--all the important techniques of dynamic content are introduced. Good design is emphasized, such as dividing logic from presentation. The book introduces PHP 5 and MySQL 4.1 features, while providing techniques that can be used on older versions of the software that are still in widespread use.This new edition has been redesigned around the rich offerings of PEAR. Several of these, including the Template package and the database-independent query API, are fully integrated into examples and thoroughly described in the text. Topics include: Installation and configuration of Apache, MySQL, and PHP on Unix®, Windows®, and Mac OS® X systems Introductions to PHP, SQL, and MySQL administration Session management, including the use of a custom database for improved efficiency User input validation, security, and authentication The PEAR repository, plus details on the use of PEAR DB and Template classes Production of PDF reports",Computers,818,3.5,7,en

Medical Image Reconstruction,Gengsheng Lawrence Zeng,Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG,2023-07-04,"This textbook introduces the essential concepts of tomography in the field of medical imaging. The medical imaging modalities include x-ray CT (computed tomography), PET (positron emission tomography), SPECT (single photon emission tomography) and MRI. In these modalities, the measurements are not in the image domain and the conversion from the measurements to the images is referred to as the image reconstruction. The work covers various image reconstruction methods, ranging from the classic analytical inversion methods to the optimization-based iterative image reconstruction methods. As machine learning methods have lately exhibited astonishing potentials in various areas including medical imaging the author devotes one chapter to applications of machine learning in image reconstruction. Based on college level in mathematics, physics, and engineering the textbook supports students in understanding the concepts.

SDL 2005: Model Driven,"Andreas Prinz, Rick Reed, Jeanne Reed",Springer,2005-06-02,"This volume contains the papers presented at the 12th SDL Forum, Grimstad, Norway. The SDL Forum was ?rst held in 1982, and then every two years from 1985. Initially the Forum was concerned only with the Speci?cation and Description Language that was ?rst standardized in the 1976 Orange Book of the Inter- tional Telecommunication Union (ITU). Since then, many developments took place and the language has undergone several changes. However, the main underlying paradigm has survived, and it is the reason for the success of the Speci?cation and Description Language in many projects. This paradigm is based on the following important principles of distributed - plications: Communication: large systems tend to be described using smaller parts that communicate with each other; State: the systems are described on the basis of an explicit notion of state; State change: the behavior of the system is described in terms of (local) changes of the state. The original language is not the only representative for this kind of paradigm, so the scope of the SDL Forum was extended quite soon after the ?rst few events to also include other ITU standardized languages of the same family, such as MSC, ASN.1 and TTCN. This led to the current scope of System Design Languages coveringallstagesofthedevelopmentprocessincludinginparticularSDL,MSC, UML, ASN.1, eODL, TTCN, and URN. The focus is clearly on the advantages to users, and how to get from these languages the same advantage given by the ITU Speci?cation and Description Language: code generation from high-level speci?cations.",Computers,371,N/A,0,en

Marine Algae of the Northern Gulf of California II,James N. Norris,N/A,2014,"The present treatment constitutes a taxonomic study of the benthic marine red algae known in the northern Gulf of California. In all, 380 species of Rhodophyta belonging to two subphyla were found: the Rhodophytina represented by 2 classes, 2 orders, 2 families, 7 genera, and 14 species; and, the Eurhodophytina represented by 2 classes, 5 subclasses, 19 orders, 45 families, 132 genera, and 366 species. Of the red algae 67 are endemic species. Along with the 133 species of Chlorophyta and Phaeophyceae in the northern Gulf (Norris 2010) there are now 512 benthic marine macroalgal species known in the northern Gulf. The systematic account includes the accepted taxon name, descriptions of the subphyla, classes, orders, families, genera, and species of red algae presently known in the northern Gulf, with Keys to serve as a guide to their identification. Along with the current name for each species are its basionym, synonyms, type locality, relevant taxonomic studies, description, habitat, and distribution in the Gulf of California, and if applicable (i.e., not endemic) in the Eastern Pacific, Central Pacific, and/or Western Pacific. In addition to reviewing the taxonomic phycological literature pertinent to the Gulf of California and Pacific Mexico, several distribution extensions and new records are given. One new genus, one new subgeneric section, and eight new species are described. One new species name is given to replace an illegitimate name. Twenty-seven new combinations are made.",Marine algae,586,N/A,0,en

Automatic Control Systems in Biomedical Engineering,"J. Fernández de Cañete, C. Galindo, J. Barbancho, A. Luque",Springer,2018-03-12,"This book presents the fundamental principles and challenges encountered in the control of biomedical systems, providing practical solutions and suggesting alternatives. The perspective of the text is based on the system behaviour in the time domain both linear and non-linear, continuous and discrete, helping the reader to be able to interpret the physical significance of mathematical results during control system analysis and design focusing on biomedical engineering applications. Interactive learning is promoted, endowing students with the ability to change parameters and conditions during the simulation and see the effects of these changes, by using interactive MATLAB and SIMULINK software tools, also presenting realistic problems in order to analyse, design and develop automatic control systems. The text is also complemented with MATLAB and SIMULINK exercise files solved to aid students to focus on the fundamental concepts treated throughout the book, following a new pedagogical approach distinct from the classical one whereby fundamental control concepts are introduced together with adequate software tools in order to gain insight on the biomedical engineering control problems. The book is suitable for second or third-year undergraduate students who will find the illustrative examples particularly useful to their studies of control system design and implementation. Lecturers in the control field will find the computer aided design approach as an alternative to teaching the fundamental concepts of feedback analogic and digital control.",Technology & Engineering,373,N/A,0,en
Einstein from 'B' to 'Z',John Stachel,Springer Science & Business Media,2001-12-10,"John Stachel, the author of this collection of 37 published and unpublished articles on Albert Einstein, has written about Einstein and his work for over 40 years. Trained as a theoretical physicist specializing in the theory of relativity, he was chosen as the founding editor of The Collected papers of Albert Einstein 25 years ago, and is currently Director of the Boston University Center for Einstein Studies. Based on a detailed study of documentary evidence, much of which was newly discovered in the course of his work, Stachel debunks many of the old (and some new) myths about Einstein and offers novel insight into his life and work. Throughout the volume, a new, more human picture of Einstein is offered to replace the plaster saint of popular legend. In particular, a youthful Einstein emerges from the obscurity that previously shrouded his early years, and much new light is shed on the origins of the special and general theories of relativity. Also discussed in some detail are Einstein's troubled relationship with his first wife, his friendships with other physicists such as Eddington, Bose, and Pauli, and his Jewish identity. The essays are grouped thematically into the following areas: * The Human Side * Editing the Einstein Papers * Surveys of Einstein's Work * Special Relativity * General Relativity * Quantum Theory * Einstein and Other Scientists * Book Reviews Because the essays are independent of one another, readers will be able to dip into this collection to satisfy varying interests. It will be of particular interest to historians of 20th century science, working physicists, and students, as well as to the many members of the general reading public who continue to be fascinated by aspects of Einstein's life and work.",Science,572,N/A,0,en

DB2 9 for z/OS Performance Topics,"Paolo Bruni, Kevin Harrison, Garth Oldham, Leif Pedersen, Giuseppe Tino, IBM Redbooks",IBM Redbooks,2012-09-28,"DB2 9 for z/OS is an exciting new version, with many improvements in performance and little regression. DB2 V9 improves availability and security, as well as adds greatly to SQL and XML functions. Optimization improvements include more SQL functions to optimize, improved statistics for the optimizer, better optimization techniques, and a new approach to providing information for tuning. V8 SQL procedures were not eligible to run on the IBM System z9 Integrated Information Processor (zIIP), but changing to use the native SQL procedures on DB2 V9 makes the work eligible for zIIP processing. The performance of varying length data can improve substantially if there are large numbers of varying length columns. Several improvements in disk access can reduce the time for sequential disk access and improve data rates. The key DB2 9 for z/OS performance improvements include reduced CPU time in many utilities, deep synergy with IBM System z hardware and z/OS software, improved performance and scalability for inserts and LOBs, improved SQL optimization, zIIP processing for remote native SQL procedures, index compression, reduced CPU time for data with varying lengths, and better sequential access. Virtual storage use below the 2 GB bar is also improved. This IBM Redbooks publication provides an overview of the performance impact of DB2 9 for z/OS, especially performance scalability for transactions, CPU, and elapsed time for queries and utilities. We discuss the overall performance and possible impacts when moving from version to version. We include performance measurements that were made in the laboratory and provide some estimates. Keep in mind that your results are likely to vary, as the conditions and work will differ. In this book, we assume that you are familiar with DB2 V9.

It provides students of information systems technology with the background knowledge and skills necessary to begin using the basic facilities of a mainframe computer. For optimal learning, students are assumed to have successfully completed an introductory course in computer system concepts, such as computer organization and architecture, operating systems, data management, or data communications. They should also have successfully completed courses in one or more programming languages, and be PC literate. This textbook can also be used as a prerequisite for courses in advanced topics, or for internships and special studies. It is not intended to be a complete text covering all aspects of mainframe operation. It is also not a reference book that discusses every feature and option of the mainframe facilities. Others who can benefit from this course include experienced data processing professionals who have worked with non-mainframe platforms, or who are familiar with some aspects of the mainframe but want to become knowledgeable with other facilities and benefits of the mainframe environment. As we go through this course, we suggest that the instructor alternate between text, lecture, discussions, and hands-on exercises. Many of the exercises are cumulative, and are designed to show the student how to design and implement the topic presented. The instructor-led discussions and hands-on exercises are an integral part of the course, and can include topics not covered in this textbook. In this course, we use simplified examples and focus mainly on basic system functions. Hands-on exercises are provided throughout the course to help students explore the mainframe style of computing.

Evaluation of Mineral Reserves,"Andre G. Journel, Phaedon C.

Such prediction is absolutely critical for mine planning and investment decisions, yet it cannot be made on maps directly interpolated from present data. Various dilution factors need to be introduced to account for · the support effect: mining unit volumes are vastly different from composite data unit volumes · the information effect: future selection of ore/waste will be based on vastly different data than that presently available. Geostatistical simulations allow a rigorous evaluation of these effects on reserves recovery.

An Introduction to Data-Driven Control Systems,Ali Khaki-Sedigh,John Wiley & Sons,2023-11-10,"An Introduction to Data-Driven Control Systems An introduction to the emerging dominant paradigm in control design Model-based approaches to control systems design have long dominated the control systems design methodologies. However, most models require substantial prior or assumed information regarding the plant’s structure and internal dynamics. The data-driven paradigm in control systems design, which has proliferated rapidly in recent decades, requires only observed input-output data from plants, making it more flexible and broadly applicable. An Introduction to Data-Driven Control Systems provides a foundational overview of data-driven control systems methodologies. It presents key concepts and theories in an accessible way, without the need for the complex mathematics typically associated with technical publications in the field, and raises the important issues involved in applying these approaches. The result is a highly readable introduction to what promises to become the dominant control systems design paradigm. Readers will also find: An overview of philosophical-historical issues accompanying the emergence of data-driven control systems Design analysis of several conventional data-driven control systems design methodologies Algorithms and simulation results, with numerous examples, to facilitate the implementation of methods An Introduction to Data-Driven Control Systems is ideal for students and researchers in control theory or any other research area related to plant design and production.",Science,389,N/A,0,en

Propositional Content,Peter Hanks,Context & Content,2015,"Peter Hanks defends a new theory about the nature of propositional content. According to this theory, the basic bearers of representational properties are particular mental or spoken actions. Propositions are types of these actions, which we use to classify and individuate our attitudes and speech acts. Hanks abandons several key features of the traditional Fregean conception of propositional content, including the idea that propositions are the primary bearers of truth-conditions, the distinction between content and force, and the concept of entertainment. The main difficulty for this traditional conception is the problem of the unity of the proposition, the problem of explaining how propositions have truth conditions and other representational properties. The new theory developed here, in its place, explains the unity of propositions and provides new solutions to a long list of puzzles and problems in philosophy of language.",Language Arts & Disciplines,238,N/A,0,en

Robust Synchronization of Chaotic Systems via Feedback,"Ricardo Femat, Gualberto Solis-Perales",Springer,2009-01-23,"This pages include the results derived during last ten years about both suppression and synchronization of chaotic -continuous time- systems. Along this time, our concept was to study how the intrinsic properties of dynamical systems can be exploited to suppress and to synchronize the chaotic behavior and what synchronization phen- ena can be found under feedback interconnection. Our findings have caused surprise to us and have stimulated our astonishing capability. Perhaps, reader can imagine our faces with opens eyes like children seeing around objects; which are possibly obvious for others and novel for us. A compilation of our surprises about these findings is being described along this book. Book contains both objectives to share our ama- ment and to show our perspective on synchronization of chaotic systems. Thus, while we were writing the preface, we discussed its scope. Thinking as a book readers, we found that a preface should answer, in few words, the following question: What can the reader find in this book?, reader can find our steps toward understanding of c- otic behavior and the possibility of suppressing and synchronizing it. We firstly show the chaos suppression form experimental domain to potential implementation in high tech system as a levitation system based on High Temperature Superconductors (HTS). This chapter is used as departing point towards a more complicated problem the chaotic synchronization.

Another paper presents a method in computer simulation of a wide range of stable plants to achieve an alternative approach in designing an adaptive control system. The book also compares the stability and the sensitivity approach involving the design of model-reference adaptive systems. The authors involved explain that the sensitivity concept determines the ""dynamic speed of adaptation,"" while the stability concept focuses on finding a linear compensator for any deviant signal. One paper proposes an indirect adaptive control algorithm for MIMO square full rank minimum phase systems, while another paper discusses the application of the discrete time multivariable adaptive control system, to non-minimum phase plants with an unknown dead time.

This technology is important, because it offers clients an attractive alternative to vertical growth by adding new z/VM systems. In the past, this capability required duplicate efforts to install, maintain, and manage each system. With SSI, these duplicate efforts are reduced or eliminated. Support for live guest relocation (LGR) allows you to move Linux virtual servers without disruption to the business, helping you to avoid planned outages. The z/VM systems are aware of each other and can take advantage of their combined resources. LGR enables clients to avoid loss of service due to planned outages by relocating guests from a system requiring maintenance to a system that remains active during the maintenance period. Together, the SSI and LGR technologies offer substantial client value, and they are a major departure from past z/VM practices. This IBM Redbooks® publication gives you a broad understanding of the new SSI architecture and an overview of LGR. We show an LGR example that shows a typical SAP user environment.

Exploiting the IBM Health Checker for z/OS Infrastructure,"Mario Bezzi, Neil O'Connor, Sharon Phillips, Ulrich Thiemann, Helen Tsang, IBM Redbooks",IBM Redbooks,2010-12-22,"The IBM® Health Checker for z/OS® (also identified in this book as IBM Health Checker) is a key component of the z/OS operating system, whose objective is to identify potential problems before they impact the system's availability. To do this it continuously checks many current, active z/OS and sysplex settings and compares them with those suggested by IBM or defined by you. The IBM Health Checker for z/OS is made of two parts: - A framework that provides check management and execution services. It supports check development by IBM, independent software vendors (ISVs), and users. - Individual checks that look for specific z/OS settings and definitions, checking for potential problems. Customers can use the IBM Health Checker for z/OS infrastructure to run their own checks, extending the reach of IBM Health Checker for z/OS to environment-specific settings. This IBM RedpaperTM publication introduces the IBM Health Checker and describes how to activate and use it.

The Virtualization Cookbook for IBM Z Volume 1: IBM z/VM 7.2,"Lydia Parziale, Edi Lopes Alves, Vic Cross, Paul Novak, Mauro Cesar de Souza, IBM Redbooks",IBM Redbooks,2021-07-15,"This IBM® Redbooks® publication is volume one of five in a series of books entitled The Virtualization Cookbook for IBM Z. The series includes the following volumes: The Virtualization Cookbook for IBM z Systems® Volume 1: IBM z/VM® 7.2, SG24-8147 The Virtualization Cookbook for IBM Z Volume 2: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Servers, SG24-8303 The Virtualization Cookbook for IBM z Systems Volume 3: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12, SG24-8890 The Virtualization Cookbook for IBM z Systems Volume 4: Ubuntu Server 16.04, SG24-8354 Virtualization Cookbook for IBM Z Volume 5: KVM, SG24-8463 It is recommended that you start with Volume 1 of this series because the IBM z/VM hypervisor is the foundation (or base ""layer"") for installing Linux on IBM Z®. This book series assumes that you are generally familiar with IBM Z technology and terminology. It does not assume an in-depth understanding of z/VM or Linux. It is written for individuals who want to start quickly with z/VM and Linux, and get virtual servers up and running in a short time (days, not weeks or months). Volume 1 starts with a solution orientation, discusses planning and security, and then, describes z/VM installation methods, configuration, hardening, automation, servicing, networking, optional features, and more. It adopts a ""cookbook-style"" format that provides a concise, repeatable set of procedures for installing, configuring, administering, and maintaining z/VM. This volume also includes a chapter on monitoring z/VM and the Linux virtual servers that are hosted. Volumes 2, 3, and 4 assume that you completed all of the steps that are described in Volume 1. From that common foundation, these volumes describe how to create your own Linux virtual servers on IBM Z hardware under IBM z/VM. The cookbook format continues with installing and customizing Linux. Volume 5 provides an explanation of the kernel-based virtual machine (KVM) on IBM Z and how it can use the z/Architecture®. It focuses on the planning of the environment and provides installation and configuration definitions that are necessary to build, manage, and monitor a KVM on Z environment. This publication applies to the supported Linux on Z distributions (Red Hat, SUSE, and Ubuntu).",Computers,546,N/A,0,en

Z User Workshop,,N/A,1990,"The mathematical concepts and notational conventions we know of as Z were first proposed around 1981. Its origins were in line with the objectives of the PRG - to establish a mathematical basis for program ming concepts and to verify the work by case studies with industry. Hence among early Z users some were from academic circles, with interests in the mathematical basis of programming; others came from industry and were involved with pilot projects and case studies linked with the Programming Research Group. Four years ago we had the first Z User Meeting, a fairly modest affair with representatives more or less equally divided between academia and industry. At the first meeting there were, as in this meeting, a variety of technical papers, reports of work in progress and discussions. A number of people from industry came along, either because they had begun to use Z or were curious about the new direction. In the discussion sessions at the end of the meeting, there were calls from attendees for the establishment of a more stable base for the notation, including work on its documentation and standards. Many of these requests have now been satisfied and the notation is now being proposed for standards development.",Z (Computer program language),292,N/A,0,en

Improving Productivity with IBM ISPF Productivity Tool V7.1 for z/OS,"Michael Rotter, Eugenie Alexander, Rodney Almodovar, Balachandran Chandrasekaran, Pearlson Christopher, Steve Coalbran, Mark Leung, Jean Mothersele, Chaitra Narayanaswamy, Kevin Neubert, Richard Pace, Walter Zakorchemny, IBM Redbooks",IBM Redbooks,2013-04-24,"This IBM® Redbooks® publication introduces the IBM Interactive System Productivity Facility (ISPF) Productivity Tool (IPT) Version 7, Release 1 for IBM z/OS®. IPT operates as a seamlessly integrated front end to ISPF. Note the following points: IPT functionality is available from any panel, without a need to modify any ISPF Primary Options Menu. All IPT functions are totally integrated. IPT can perform almost any activity within ISPF, or internally invoke the function that can perform the task. IPT combines separately provided ISPF utility functions and new ISPF Productivity Tool features into the Object List (OLIST) and Member Selection List (MSL). The resulting members, datasets, and Object Lists become powerful platforms where you can perform many tasks without navigating to other utilities. IPT relates objects to applications in a similar manner to the way that a PC performs Object Linking and Embedding (OLE). By extending the dataset objects that are used by ISPF to other object classes, IPT lets you specify the object to be processed and the action that is performed (such as EDIT or BROWSE). The facility that is appropriate to the object class for the action that you have requested is invoked automatically. IPT provides extensive search capabilities that are both rapid and intuitive. You can easily search for volumes, datasets, members, and text within members. ISPF Productivity Tool also furnishes automatic drill-down system navigation to examine volumes, datasets, and members. IPT provides a menu-driven facility to display and recover all of the deleted members of a partitioned dataset (PDS) library. IPT extends the ISPF action bar with options that provide access to new functionality so that you do not have to learn new commands or syntax. In addition to the ISPF Point-and-Shoot capabilities, IPT provides new concepts, such as hotbars (user-defined fields that execute commands), field-sensitive areas in MSLs and OLISTs, automatic recognition of a dataset name on any ISPF panel as a parameter to BROWSE, EDIT, or VIEW, or parameters within any Time Sharing Option (TSO) command. IPT provides integrated and enhanced IBM Software Configuration and Library Manager (SCLM) support within the standard member and dataset lists. SCLM is a source library management component of ISPF that provides change control, multiple source versions, auditing, a built-in make facility, and automatic check-in/sign-out using standard libraries (PDS and partitioned dataset extended (PDSE)). IPT includes built-in interfaces to various IBM and ISV products. IPT includes a new batch utility that provides a seamlessly integrated front end to the IBM IEBCOPY utility. In addition to supporting all IEBCOPY standard functionality, it includes additional major enhancements. This book is intended as a supplement to existing product manuals. It opens with an overview of the main IPT concepts and facilities, and follows with detailed chapters which are each dedicated to a major IPT function. Practical scenarios, accompanied by window captures and coding examples, demonstrate how both experienced ISPF users and those new to the IBM z/OS environment can benefit from the IPT enhanced functionality in each case.",Computers,630,N/A,0,en

"Gen Z, Explained","Roberta Katz, Sarah Ogilvie, Jane Shaw, Linda Woodhead",University of Chicago Press,2022-10-26,"An optimistic and nuanced portrait of a generation that has much to teach us about how to live and collaborate in our digital world. Born since the mid-1990s, members of Generation Z comprise the first generation never to know the world without the internet, and the most diverse generation yet. As Gen Z starts to emerge into adulthood and enter the workforce, what do we really know about them? And what can we learn from them? Gen Z, Explained is the authoritative portrait of this significant generation. It draws on extensive interviews that display this generation’s candor, surveys that explore their views and attitudes, and a vast database of their astonishingly inventive lexicon to build a comprehensive picture of their values, daily lives, and outlook. Gen Z emerges here as an extraordinarily thoughtful, promising, and perceptive generation that is sounding a warning to their elders about the world around them—a warning of a complexity and depth the “OK Boomer” phenomenon can only suggest. ​ Much of the existing literature about Gen Z has been highly judgmental. In contrast, this book provides a deep and nuanced understanding of a generation facing a future of enormous challenges, from climate change to civil unrest. What’s more, they are facing this future head-on, relying on themselves and their peers to work collaboratively to solve these problems. As Gen Z, Explained shows, this group of young people is as compassionate and imaginative as any that has come before, and understanding the way they tackle problems may enable us to envision new kinds of solutions. This portrait of Gen Z is ultimately an optimistic one, suggesting they have something to teach all of us about how to live and thrive in this digital world.",History,275,N/A,0,en

The Virtualization Cookbook for IBM Z Volume 2: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2,"Lydia Parziale, Murthy Garimella, Eric Marins, Filipe Miranda, Paul Novak, Vinodkumar Ramalingam, IBM Redbooks",IBM Redbooks,2021-10-19,"This IBM® Redbooks® publication is Volume 2 of a five-volume series of books entitled The Virtualization Cookbook for IBM Z®. This volume includes the following chapters: Chapter 1, ""Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux on LNXADMIN"" on page 3, describes how to install and configure Red Hat Enterprise Linux onto the Linux Administration server, which performs the cloning and other tasks. Chapter 2, ""Automated Red Hat Enterprise Linux installations by using Kickstart"" on page 37, describes how to use Red Hat's kickstart tool to create Linux systems. This tool is fundamentally different from cloning in that an automated installation is implemented. You can try kickstart and cloning. Understand that these applications attempt to accomplish the same goal of quickly getting Linux systems up and running, and that you do not need to use both. Chapter 3, ""Working with subscription-manager, yum, and DaNdiFied"" on page 47, describes how the Red Hat Network works. It provides centralized management and provisioning for multiple Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems. Kickstart is an easy and fast way to provision your Linux guests in any supported Linux platform. It re-creates the operating system from the beginning by using the kickstart profile configuration file that installs the new operating system unattended. It also sets up the new guest according to the definition that was set up in the kickstart file. Usually, Linux is administered by the same team that manages Linux on all platforms. By using kickstart, you can create a basic profile that can be used in all supported platforms and customize Linux profiles, as needed. Cloning requires a better understanding of the z/VM environment and z/VM skills. It is a fast process if you enable the IBM FlashCopy® feature in advance. It clones the disks from a golden image to new disks that are used by the new Linux guest. The process can be automated by using the cloning scripts that are supplied with this book. It is recommended that you start with The Virtualization Cookbook for IBM Z Volume 1: IBM z/VM 7.2, SG24-8147 of this series because the IBM® z/VM hypervisor is the foundation (or base ""layer"") for installing Linux on IBM Z.",Computers,282,N/A,0,en

Virginia Woolf A to Z,Mark Hussey,"Oxford University Press, USA",1996,"Her revolutionary novels and essays have inspired generations of feminists, and her life has aroused both interest and speculation. In Virginia Woolf A-Z, the author's works and autobiographical writings are set in the context of her infamous social milieu. Eight ""family"" trees map out the complicated relationships and living arrangements of the Bloomsbury Group, and a chronology gives a quick overview of the major events of Woolf's life.

Mechanical Properties and Testing of Polymers,G.M. Swallowe,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-04-17,"This volume represents a continuation of the Polymer Science and Technology series edited by Dr. D. M. Brewis and Professor D. Briggs. The theme of the series is the production of a number of stand alone volumes on various areas of polymer science and technology. Each volume contains short articles by a variety of expert contributors outlining a particular topic and these articles are extensively cross referenced. References to related topics included in the volume are indicated by bold text in the articles, the bold text being the title of the relevant article. At the end of each article there is a list of bibliographic references where interested readers can obtain further detailed information on the subject of the article. This volume was produced at the invitation of Derek Brewis who asked me to edit a text which concentrated on the mechanical properties of polymers. There are already many excellent books on the mechanical properties of polymers, and a somewhat lesser number of volumes dealing with methods of carrying out mechanical tests on polymers. Some of these books are listed in Appendix 1. In this volume I have attempted to cover basic mechanical properties and test methods as well as the theory of polymer mechanical deformation and hope that the reader will find the approach useful.",Science,313,N/A,0,en

Linear Optimal Control Systems,"Huibert Kwakernaak, Raphel Sivan",Wiley-Interscience,1972-11-10,"""This book attempts to reconcile modern linear control theory with classical control theory. One of the major concerns of this text is to present design methods, employing modern techniques, for obtaining control systems that stand up to the requirements that have been so well developed in the classical expositions of control theory. Therefore, among other things, an entire chapter is devoted to a description of the analysis of control systems, mostly following the classical lines of thought. In the later chapters of the book, in which modern synthesis methods are developed, the chapter on analysis is recurrently referred to. Furthermore, special attention is paid to subjects that are standard in classical control theory but are frequently overlooked in modern treatments, such as nonzero set point control systems, tracking systems, and control systems that have to cope with constant disturbances. Also, heavy emphasis is placed upon the stochastic nature of control problems because the stochastic aspects are so essential."" --Preface.",Science,630,N/A,0,en

Cultural Sociology of Mental Illness,Andrew Scull,SAGE Publications,2013-12-20,"Cultural Sociology of Mental Illness: An A to Z Guide looks at recent reports that suggest an astonishing rise in mental illness and considers such questions as: Are there truly more mentally ill people now or are there just more people being diagnosed and treated? What are the roles of economics and the pharmacological industry in this controversy? At the core of what is going on with mental illness in America and around the world, the editors suggest, is cultural sociology: How differing cultures treat mental illness and, in turn, how mental health patients are affected by the culture. In this illuminating multidisciplinary reference, expert scholars explore the culture of mental illness from the non-clinical perspectives of sociology, history, psychology, epidemiology, economics, public health policy, and finally, the mental health patients themselves. Key themes include Cultural Comparisons of Mental Health Disorders; Cultural Sociology of Mental Illness Around the World; Economics; Epidemiology; Mental Health Practitioners; Non-Drug Treatments; Patient, the Psychiatry, and Psychology; Psychiatry and Space; Psychopharmacology; Public Policy; Social History; and Sociology. Key Features: This two-volume A-Z work, available in both print and electronic formats, includes close to 400 articles by renowned experts in their respective fields. An Introduction, a thematic Reader’s Guide, a Glossary, and a Resource Guide to Key Books, Journals, and Associations and their web sites enhance this invaluable reference. A chronology places the cultural sociology of mental illness in historical context. 150 photos bring concepts to life. The range and scope of this Encyclopedia is vivid testimony to the intellectual vitality of the field and will make a useful contribution to the next generation of sociological research on the cultural sociology of mental illness.

The A to Z of Jainism,Kristi L. Wiley,Scarecrow Press,2009-06-17,"Jain is the term used for a person who has faith in the teachings of the Jinas ('Spiritual Victors'). Jinas are human beings who have overcome all passions (kasayas) and have attained enlightenment or omniscience (kevala-jnana), who teach the truths they realized to others, and who attain liberation (moksa) from the cycle of rebirth (samsara). At the core of these teachings is nonviolence (ahimsa), which has remained the guiding principle of Jain ethics and practices to this day. In comparison with other religious traditions of South Asia, Jains are few in number, comprising less than one percent of India's population. The lay and mendicant communities of the Jain, however, have maintained an unbroken presence in India for more than 2,500 years and have influenced its culture throughout this time. The A to Z of Jainism covers the history of Jainism that spans a period of more than 2,500 years. The history, values, concepts, and scriptures; eminent mendicant, lay leaders, and scholars; and places, institutions, social, and cultural factors are covered in over 450 dictionary entries. This comprehensive reference work also includes an introductory essay, explanation of the Jain scriptures, chronology, appendixes, and bibliography. This book provides an excellent introduction and overview to Jainism for scholars, students, and general readers.",Religion,340,N/A,0,en

Building a Geodatabase,Andrew MacDonald,Esri Press,2001,"The ESRI ArcGIS Desktop products -- ArcView, ArcEditor, and ArcInfo -- enable users to create and manage a geodatabase, the world's most advanced spatial object-oriented data model. ArcView enables users to create and manage simple features (points, lines, and polygons) in a personal geodatabase. ArcEditor and ArcInfo support full read-and-write access to any geodatabase. The key advantage of this data model is that it allows you to easily build intelligent models of spatial systems. You can assign behaviors to individual features, define relationships between classes of features, create business rules, and apply high-level topological models without any programming. You are also free to extend the geodatabase model and object behaviors without limits by using any Component Object Model (COM)-compliant programming language. Building a Geodatabase introduces you to geodatabase concepts and shows you how to implement geographic database designs. Whether you are importing existing data or building a new geodatabase from scratch, this book makes it easy to find a task and work through the steps to get it done. Begin by following the quick-start tutorial to get an overview of how to create and edit a geodatabase, and then actually create your first geodatabase. If you prefer, jump right in and experiment with geodatabases on your own. When you have questions, you'll find concise, step-by-step answers inside, fully illustrated to help you complete a task.
