MANAGING CONFLICT IN MARRIAGE AND RELATIONSHIPS A Guide To Managing Relationship And Marriage,Philip Sodje,Philip Sodje,2024-04-26,"CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION: Conflict is an inevitable aspect of any relationship, and in the context of marriage and intimate partnerships, it can often feel overwhelming. However, it's essential to recognize that conflict, when handled constructively, can actually strengthen and deepen the bond between partners. ""Navigating Conflict: A Guide to Managing Conflict in Marriage and Relationships"" sets out to provide practical strategies and insights for couples to navigate conflict in a healthy and productive manner. In this book, we delve into the nature of conflict within relationships, emphasizing that it's a natural and inevitable part of being human. Drawing from psychology and relationship research, we explore the various triggers and dynamics that contribute to conflict, including differing expectations, communication styles, and unresolved issues from the past. By normalizing conflict, we aim to alleviate the stigma and fear often associated with it, empowering couples to approach disagreements with greater resilience and understanding. The Importance of Effectively Managing Conflict: Here, we highlight the significance of addressing conflict proactively for the overall health and longevity of a relationship. Unresolved conflicts can fester and lead to resentment, erosion of trust, and ultimately, relationship breakdown. Conversely, couples who learn to manage conflict constructively not only strengthen their connection but also cultivate greater intimacy, empathy, and mutual respect. We underscore that conflict resolution skills are essential for maintaining a thriving and fulfilling partnership, regardless of the stage or duration of the relationship. Overview of the Book Structure: This section provides a roadmap for the eBook, outlining the key themes, chapters, and exercises designed to support couples in navigating conflict more effectively. Each chapter will address specific aspects of conflict management, from understanding triggers and communication patterns to practicing active listening and negotiating compromises. Throughout the eBook, readers will find practical tips, case studies, and reflective prompts to apply the concepts to their own relationship dynamics.

Towards a Theology of Relationship,Michael Berra,James Clarke & Company,2024-01-25,"With the theme of relationship receiving renewed attention in a variety of areas, theological expressions of the subject are also being brought back into the spotlight. Although the concept of a personal relationship with God is a common Christian expression, it is often poorly defined. Here, Michael Berra draws on the Swiss theologian Emil Brunner to redefine and rehabilitate the analogy of relationship. Basing his study primarily on Brunner's seminal work Truth as Encounter, Berra proposes that relationship ought to be the central motif for the whole of theology. He investigates the theme in light of modern relationship science, arguing that God-human interaction categorically meets the definition of a relationship, and that it is existentially intended to be intimate. Scholars and church leaders will find in Berra's approach a refreshing voice in this dynamic field.",Religion,271,N/A,0,en

Close Relationship Loss,Terri L. Orbuch,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Social scientists from various disciplines have been increasingly concerned with the nature, structure, and function of close relationships. Although most of the early work on the topic of close relationships drew attention to the development of close relationships, since the mid-1970s researchers have begun to investigate the many different aspects connected to the loss of close relationships. Despite the change to a more comprehensive conceptual framework, close relationship research is often criticized for being atheoretical; the research is criticized for being purely descriptive in nature and thus lacking a more theoretical framework. Contrary to this belief, I wish to argue that researchers in the area of close relationship loss employ several critical and prominent theoretical perspectives to describe, explain, and understand the endings of relationships-thus, the fruition of this book. The major aim of this edited book is to present and illuminate, within one volume, some of these major theoretical perspectives. The volume as a whole has several unique qualities. First, within each chapter, the authors provide a general overview of the theoretical per spective or approach within which they examine close relationship loss.",Psychology,315,N/A,0,en

Faith with Benefits,Jason King,Oxford University Press,2017-01-02,"Hookup culture has become widespread on college campuses, and Catholic colleges are no exception. Indeed, despite the fact that most students on Catholic campuses report being unhappy with casual sexual encounters, most studies have found no difference between Catholic colleges and their secular counterparts when it comes to hooking up. Drawing on a survey of over 1000 students from 26 institutions, as well as in-depth interviews, Jason King argues that religious culture on Catholic campuses can, in fact, have an impact on the school's hookup culture, but when it comes to how that relationship works: it's complicated. In Faith with Benefits, King shows the complex way these dynamics play out at Catholic colleges and universities. There is no straightforward relationship between orthodoxy and hookup culture--some of the schools with the weakest Catholic identities also have weaker hookup cultures. And not all students define the culture in the same way. Some see a hookup as just a casual encounter, where others see it as a gateway to a relationship. Faith with Benefits gives voice to students, revealing how their faith, the faith of their friends, and the institutional structures of their campus give rise to different hookup cultures. In doing so, King addresses the questions of students who don't know where to turn for practical guidance on how to navigate ever-shifting campus cultures, reconciling their faith with their relationships. Students, parents, faculty, administrators-indeed, anyone who cares about Catholic teenagers and young adults-will find much of value in this book.",Religion,241,N/A,0,en

The Ways We Love,Sheila A. Sharpe,Guilford Press,2004-01-28,"This volume delineates a developmental theory of love relationships that provides a comprehensive approach to treating couples. Drawing on her 30 years of clinical experience, Sheila A. Sharpe conceptualizes marriage and other committed partnerships as comprising multiple patterns of relating that develop over time in a parallel, though interconnected, fashion. Seven universal patterns of intimate relating are identified: nurturing, merging, idealizing, devaluing, controlling, competing for superiority, and competing in love triangles. Sharpe demonstrates how these patterns originate in a person's early experience, are reworked in different ways throughout life, and express everyone's basic needs for both connection and separateness. Supplying vital insights and tools for therapeutic work, the volume offers the clinician a multifaceted perspective on how couple relationships grow and what happens when their growth becomes derailed.",Psychology,372,N/A,0,en
Love in Contemporary British Drama,Korbinian Stöckl,Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG,2021-01-18,"Despite the recent turn to affects and emotions in the humanities and despite the unceasing popularity of romantic and erotic love as a motif in fictional works of all genres, the subject has received surprisingly little attention in academic studies of contemporary drama. Love in Contemporary British Drama reflects the appeal of love as a topic and driving force in dramatic works with in-depth analyses of eight pivotal plays from the past three decades. Following an interdisciplinary and historical approach, the study collects and condenses theories of love from philosophy and sociology to derive persisting discourses and to examine their reoccurrence and transformation in contemporary plays. Special emphasis is put on narratives of love’s compensatory function and precariousness and on how modifications of these narratives epitomise the peculiarities of emotional life in the social and cultural context of the present. Based on the assumption that drama is especially inclined to draw on shared narratives for representations of love, the book demonstrates that love is both a window to remnants of the past in the present and a proper subject matter for drama in times in which the suitability of the dramatic form has been questioned.",Literary Criticism,204,N/A,0,en
Handbook of Interpersonal Communication,"Gerd Antos, Eija Ventola",Walter de Gruyter,2008-12-10,"Interpersonal communication (IC) is a continuous game between the interacting interactants. It is a give and take - a continuous, dynamic flow that is linguistically realized as discourse as an on-going sequence of interactants' moves. Interpersonal communication is produced and interpreted by acting linguistically, and this makes it a fascinating research area. The handbook, Interpersonal Communication , examines how interactants manage to exchange facts, ideas, views, opinions, beliefs, emotion, etc. by using the linguistic systems and the resources they offer. In interpersonal communication, the fine-tuning of individuals' use of the linguistic resources is continuously probed. The language used in interpersonal communication enhances social relations between interactants and keeps the interaction on the normal track. When interaction gets off the track, linguistic miscommunication may also destroy social relationships. This volume is essentially concerned with this fine-tuning in discourse, and how it is achieved among various interactant groups. The volume departs from the following fundamental questions: How do interpersonal relations manifest themselves in language? What is the role of language in developing and maintaining relationships in interpersonal communication? What types of problems occur in interpersonal communication and what kind of strategies and means are used to solve them? How does linguistically realized interpersonal communication interact with other semiotic modes? Interpersonal communication is seen and researched from the perspective of what is being said or written, and how it is realized in various generic forms. The current research also gives attention to other semiotic modes which interact with the linguistic modes. It is not just the social roles of interactants in groups, the possible media available, the non-verbal behaviors, the varying contextual frames for communication, but primarily the actual linguistic manifestations that we need to focus upon when we want to have a full picture of what is going on in human interpersonal communication. It is this linguistic perspective that the volume aims to present to all researchers interested in IC. The volume offers an overview of the theories, methods, tools, and resources of linguistically-oriented approaches, e.g. from the fields of linguistics, social psychology, sociology, and semiotics, for the purpose of integration and further development of the interests in IC., Topics e.g.: Orientation to interaction as primarily linguistically realized processes Expertise on theorizing and analyzing cultural and situational contexts where linguistic processes are realized Expertise on handling language corpora Expertise on theorizing and analyzing interaction types as genres Orientation to an integrated view of linguistic and non-linguistic participant activities and of how interactants generate meanings and interact with space Expertise on researching the management of the linguistic flow in interaction and its successfulness.",Language Arts & Disciplines,660,N/A,0,en

Relationship-Rich Education,"Peter Felten, Leo M. Lambert",Johns Hopkins University Press,2020-11-03,"A mentor, advisor, or even a friend? Making connections in college makes all the difference. What single factor makes for an excellent college education? As it turns out, it's pretty simple: human relationships. Decades of research demonstrate the transformative potential and the lasting legacies of a relationship-rich college experience. Critics suggest that to build connections with peers, faculty, staff, and other mentors is expensive and only an option at elite institutions where instructors have the luxury of time with students. But in this revelatory book brimming with the voices of students, faculty, and staff from across the country, Peter Felten and Leo M. Lambert argue that relationship-rich environments can and should exist for all students at all types of institutions. In Relationship-Rich Education, Felten and Lambert demonstrate that for relationships to be central in undergraduate education, colleges and universities do not require immense resources, privileged students, or specially qualified faculty and staff. All students learn best in an environment characterized by high expectation and high support, and all faculty and staff can learn to teach and work in ways that enable relationship-based education. Emphasizing the centrality of the classroom experience to fostering quality relationships, Felten and Lambert focus on students' influence in shaping the learning environment for their peers, as well as the key difference a single, well-timed conversation can make in a student's life. They also stress that relationship-rich education is particularly important for first-generation college students, who bring significant capacities to college but often face long-standing inequities and barriers to attaining their educational aspirations. Drawing on nearly 400 interviews with students, faculty, and staff at 29 higher education institutions across the country, Relationship-Rich Education provides readers with practical advice on how they can develop and sustain powerful relationship-based learning in their own contexts. Ultimately, the book is an invitation—and a challenge—for faculty, administrators, and student life staff to move relationships from the periphery to the center of undergraduate education.",Education,207,N/A,0,en

The scope of coverage across and within chapters is striking. The developmentalist, the methodologist, the feminist, the contextualist, and the cross culturalist alike will find satisfaction in reading the chapters."" -Catherine A. Surra, The University of Texas at Austin The science of close relationships is relatively new and complex. Close Relationships: A Sourcebook represents the growing maturity of this multidisciplinary enterprise. The volume offers 26 chapters organized into four thematic areas: relationship methods, forms, processes, and threats, as well as a foreword and an epilogue. The volume provides a panoramic view of close relationship research as it enters the 21st century, offering highlights from current literature, original research, practical applications, and projections for future research. Relationship Methods includes both qualitative and quantitative chapters. Relationship Forms includes many of the stages, types, and roles that characterize intimate relationships. In a developmental fashion, chapters address social networks, children′s friendships, adolescent relationships, adult friendships, and friendships in later life. Chapters on multicultural and multiracial relationships and gay, lesbian, and bisexual relationships illustrate the variety of relationship forms that the science of close relationships must consider. The alignments and realignments of traditional family structure are considered in terms of contemporary marriage, divorce and single parenting, and remarried families. Relationship Processes includes chapters on emotion, attachment, romantic love, sexuality, intimacy, communication, conflict, social support, and relational maintenance. The important topic of gender concludes the section. The shadow side of human nature is explored in the Relationship Threats section, with chapters on infidelity and jealousy, physical and sexual aggression, depression, and loss and bereavement. A foreword by Ellen Berscheid sets the stage for this broad-ranging collection of chapters.

Love in the Time of Contagion,Laura Kipnis,Pantheon,2022-02-08,"In this timely, insightful, and darkly funny investigation, the acclaimed author of Against Love asks: what does living in dystopic times do to our ability to love each other and the world? COVID-19 has produced new taxonomies of love, intimacy, and vulnerability. Will its cultural afterlife be as lasting as that of HIV, which reshaped consciousness about sex and love even after AIDS itself had been beaten back by medical science? Will COVID end up making us more relationally conservative, as some think HIV did within gay culture? Will it send us fleeing into emotional silos or coupled cocoons, despite the fact that, pre-COVID, domestic coupledom had been steadily losing fans? Just as COVID revealed our nation to itself, so did it hold a mirror up to our relationships. In Love in the Time of Contagion, Laura Kipnis weaves (often hilariously) her own (ambivalent) coupled lockdown experiences together with those of others and sets them against a larger backdrop: the politics of the virus, economic disparities, changing gender relations, and the ongoing institutional crack-ups prompted by #MeToo and Black Lives Matter, mapping their effects on the everyday routines and occasional solaces of love and sex.",Psychology,225,N/A,0,en

The Highly Sensitive Person in Love,"Elaine N. Aron, Ph.D.",Harmony,2009-11-04,"Do you fall in love hard, but fear intimacy? Are you sick of being told that you are “too sensitive”? Do you struggle to respect a less-sensitive partner? Or have you given up on love, afraid of being too sensitive or shy to endure its wounds? Statistics show that 50 percent of what determines divorce is genetic temperament. And, if you are one of the 20 percent of people who are born highly sensitive, the risk of an unhappy relationship is especially high. Your finely tuned nervous system, which picks up on subtleties and reflects deeply, would be a romantic asset if both you and your partner understood you better. But without that understanding, your sensitivity is likely to be making your close relationships painful and complicated. Based on Elaine N. Aron’s groundbreaking research on temperament and intimacy, The Highly Sensitive Person in Love offers practical help for highly sensitive people seeking happier, healthier romantic relationships. From low-stress fighting to sensitive sexuality, the book offers a wealth of practical advice on making the most of all personality combinations.

Have you ever looked around and wondered, ""Why has everyone found love except me?"" You're not the only one. Great relationships don't just appear in our lives - they're the culmination of a series of decisions, including who to date, how to end it with the wrong person, and when to commit to the right one. But our brains often get in the way. We make poor decisions, which thwart us on our quest to find lasting love. Drawing from years of research, behavioral scientist turned dating coach Logan Ury reveals the hidden forces that cause those mistakes. But awareness on its own doesn't lead to results. You have to actually change your behavior. Ury shows you how. This book focuses on a different decision in each chapter, incorporating insights from behavioral science, original research, and real-life stories. You'll learn: - What's holding you back in dating (and how to break the pattern) - What really matters in a long-term partner (and what really doesn't) - How to overcome the perils of online dating (and make the apps work for you) - How to meet more people in real life (while doing activities you love) - How to make dates fun again (so they stop feeling like job interviews) - Why ""the spark"" is a myth (but you'll find love anyway) This data-driven, step-by-step guide to relationships, complete with hands-on exercises, is designed to transform your life.

Cognition in Close Relationships,"Garth J.O. Fletcher, Frank D. Fincham",Psychology Press,2013-05-13,"The past decade has witnessed an explosion of interest and research on close relationships and social cognition. In both areas, numerous handbooks, textbooks, and journal articles have been published. However, it is the editors' impression that although cognitive theories and concepts have filtered through to research dealing with close relationships, much of this research reflects a relatively untutored understanding of the theoretical and empirical work in social cognition. Conversely, the research literature that provides a more sophisticated perspective on the role of cognition in close relationships typically reveals a relatively limited knowledge of the literature on close relationships. As researchers who have worked in both social cognitive processes and close relationships, Fletcher and Fincham are convinced that each field has much to offer the other. In fact, their book is based on two important postulates: first, that a social cognitive framework offers a valuable resource for developing our understanding of close relationships; and, second, that studying cognition within close relationships has the potential to inform our understanding of basic social cognitive processes.",Psychology,403,N/A,0,en

That is, until he met the woman who forced him to ask the questions that men and women are asking themselves every day: - Is it natural to be faithful to one person for life? - Do alternatives to monogamy lead to better relationships and greater happiness? - Can you keep passion and romance from fading over time? Strauss set out on a quest for answers. It took him from Viagra-laden free-love orgies to sex addiction clinics, from cutting-edge science labs to modern-day harems, and, most terrifying of all, to his own mother and his family's secrets.

The Couple and Family Technology Framework,"Katherine M. Hertlein, Markie L. C. Blumer",Routledge,2013-07-18,"Couples and families worldwide have a constant electronic connection to others, a fact that is influencing the concerns and issues they bring to therapy. The authors of this resource help mental health practitioners to better deal with concerns such as online infidelity, online dating, internet addictions, cyber bulling, and many more by introducing the Couple and Family Technology (CFT) framework, a multi-theoretical approach that doesn’t require clinicians to change their preferred clinical approach. The CFT framework acknowledges the ways in which couples navigate their relationship with technology and a partner simultaneously, and it attends to, and in some cases incorporates the role of technology in therapeutic ways. Included in the authors’ discussion of how different technologies affect relationships is • a survey of what individuals’ motivations of usage are • an examination of the specific issues that emerge in treatment • a study of the risks particularly relevant to intimate relationships, and • an introduction of the first-ever technology-based genogram. They also examine technological usage across different developmental points in a couple’s lifespan, with attention given throughout to people from various cultural backgrounds. Along with the CFT framework, the authors also introduce a new discipline of family research: Couple and Family Technology. This discipline integrates three broad perspectives in family science and helps therapists maintain a systemic focus in assessing and treating couples where issues of the Internet and new media are problematic.

Attraction Explained,Viren Swami,Routledge,2021-02-10,"When it comes to relationships, there’s no shortage of advice from self-help ‘experts’, pick-up artists, and glossy magazines. But modern-day myths of attraction often have no basis in fact or – worse – are rooted in little more than misogyny. Based on science rather than self-help clichés, psychologist Viren Swami debunks these myths and draws on cutting-edge research to provide a ground-breaking and evidence-based account of relationship formation. At the core of this book is a very simple idea: there are no ‘laws of attraction’, no fool-proof methods or strategies for getting someone to date you.

Careless Love,Peter Robinson,HarperCollins,2019-02-12,"His fans include Stephen King, Michael Connelly, Tess Gerritsen, Ian Rankin, and Louise Penney. He has won acclaim and numerous international prizes and awards, including the Edgar. Now celebrated New York Times bestselling author Peter Robinson, one of the greatest suspense writers of our time, demonstrates his mastery once again in this powerful mystery in which legendary detective superintendent Alan Banks is confronted with a pair of perplexing crimes. Two suspicious deaths challenge DS Alan Banks and his crack investigative team. The body of an attractive young woman dressed in evening attire is found in an abandoned car on a country road. The death looks like suicide, but there are too many open questions for Banks and his team to rule out foul play. The car didn’t belong to her—it was badly damaged in an accident involving the vehicle’s owner a week earlier in the same spot. So how did the dead girl get inside the car? Did someone place her there, and if so, why? Where—and when—did she die? While Banks attends the postmortem, DI Annie Cabot is at the scene of another death. A well-dressed man in his sixties has been found in a gully high up on the wild moorland. His injuries were fatal and consistent with those sustained in a fall. Was it an accident—did the man get too close to the edge and slip? Was he pushed? The man was wearing an expensive suit. What was he doing in a rocky spot popular with hikers? There are no signs of a vehicle near where he fell. How did he get there? Banks’s and Cabot’s cases share a few curious similarities. Both of the dead were found in the same area of the moorlands. Both were elegantly dressed. The timing of their deaths coincided. And neither carried identification. As the police uncover who these people were and begin to look into their lives, inconsistencies multiply and the mysteries surrounding the two cases proliferate. Then a source close to Annie reveals a piece of information that rocks the Eastvale detectives working both investigations. An old enemy has returned in a new guise—a nefarious foe who will stop at nothing, not even murder, to get what he wants. With the stakes raised, the hunt is on. But will Banks and his crack squad be able to find the evidence to stop him in time?",Fiction,392,N/A,0,en

Social Exchange in Developing Relationships,"Robert L. Burgess, Ted L. Huston",Elsevier,2013-09-11,"Social Exchange in Developing Relationships is a collection of papers that deals with the systematic study of the development of relationships. The papers discuss several theoretical perspectives, such as evolutionary theory, personality theory, cognitive developmental theory, equity theory, role theory, and attribution theory. One paper discusses romantic relationships—the evolution of first acquaintance to close or intimate commitment. Another paper presents the hypothesis that the factors causing a relationship to begin will also probably steer intermediate cognitive processes, eventually influencing the nature of the relationship. Commitment requires specific concepts such as input levels contributed to the relationship, duration of these inputs, and their consistency of occurrence. The equity theory suggests that equity principles determine the selection of one's mate and how they (the partners) will get along in the future. One paper analyzes the dynamic theories of social relationships and the resulting research strategies: that the conceptualization of a parameter of a social relationship can affect the choice of data collection techniques and other matters. Sociologists, psychologists, historians, students, and academicians doing sociological research, can benefit greatly from this collection.",Social Science,447,N/A,0,en

Freedom from Toxic Relationships,Avril Carruthers,Penguin,2013-12-26,"A guide to leaving painful, destructive relationships behind—both at home and at work Toxic relationships often come disguised as seemingly normal ones. These subtly destructive relationships are characterized by the slow erosion of self-esteem, a loss of personal identity, or a growing desire to please friends, partners, and family members who are impossible to please. In this uplifting and informative book, transpersonal psychotherapist Avril Carruthers will take a close look at adult relationships to show why we get involved in toxic relationships in the first place, and instruct the reader on how to recognize if they’re involved in one. Once the toxic relationship is identified, the author shows the reader how to begin their journey toward healing and how to meet the world with a new kind of confidence, so that the cycle of toxic relationships can be broken once and for all. What Carruthers teaches is just how possible it can be to learn how to recognize the manipulative or sweetly corrosive partner, the family dynamics that make Christmas and other get-togethers seem like hell, or the nightmare boss who causes daily torment—and that we can learn to leave these painful, destructive patterns behind forever.",Self-Help,290,N/A,0,en

Love and Intimacy in Online Cross-Cultural Relationships,Wilasinee Pananakhonsab,Springer,2016-11-16,"This book challenges assumptions about the motivations that drive women from relatively poor, developing countries to use intermarriage dating sites to find partners from relatively wealthy, developed countries. It is generally assumed that economic deprivation or economic opportunities are the main factors, but this book instead focuses on the work of women’s imagination in online cross-cultural relationships, including the role of desire, love and intimacy. The experiences of Thai women are used to explore how they initiate, develop and maintain love and intimacy with Western men across distance and time. The book shows that, in the absence of opportunities to search and meet partners from geographically distant parts of the world, the technology of the internet offers new ways of searching for and managing relationships and has significant consequences for local experiences and expectations of love and partnering. The book will be of interest to scholars and students with an interest in family and intimate life, gender and sexualities, Asian and Thai studies, globalization and nationalism, culture and media, sociology and anthropology.",Social Science,190,N/A,0,en

Voicing Relationships,Leslie A.

""This is an excellent book and moves one of the major theories in the social sciences forward in very innovative ways. Indeed, this book extends beyond RDT by addressing limitations in the family, interpersonal, and personal relationships literature. I believe this book will prompt many discussions among theorists and researchers in those areas and has the potential to provide exciting new directions in the study of relationships."" —Glen H. Stamp, Ball State University ""Leslie A. Baxter is offering up something here that is desperately needed and fills a big hole for those who adopt RDT as their theoretical framework. . . . I found the conceptual content of the book to be clear, compelling, and provoking. . . . The chapter on contrapuntal analysis is the only one of its kind."" —Melissa Wood Alemán, James Madison University Voicing Relationships presents a dialogic perspective on relating, inspired by the dialogism work of the Russian theorist of literature and culture, Mikhail Bakhtin. Written by Leslie A. Baxter, one of the theory′s originators, this groundbreaking book presents the next iteration of the theory, along with a methodological primer for contrapuntal analysis that includes guiding readers through a sample analysis. Developing a rich palette of dialogic concepts useful in the study of interpersonal communication, the book′s central argument is that meaning making emerges from the clash of competing systems of meaning, or discourses. Relationship communication is embedded in culture, history, difference, and conceptions of the ideal. In addition, the book gives us a method by which to study communication dialogically—contrapuntal analysis. Key Features Centers communication at the heart of relationships with an interdisciplinary focus on communication from fields such as psychology, social work, and sociology Offers an up-to-date distillation of two decades of relevant research to organize major findings and issues Moves scholars and students beyond simplistic uses of relational dialectics or using the dialectical pairs in overly-simplistic ""cookie cutter"" ways Provides scholars and students with guidance in using RDT to guide their own research Intended Audience Voicing Relationships is ideal for use in a wide range of courses, such as Interpersonal Communication; Family Studies; Couples, Marriage, and Family; and Counseling.",Language Arts & Disciplines,225,N/A,0,en

Children and Young People’s Relationships,"Samantha Punch, Kay Tisdall",Routledge,2016-04-08,"This book challenges the current state of childhood studies by exploring children and young people’s agency and relationships. It considers how recent theorisations of relationships and relational processes can move childhood studies forward, particularly in relation to re-thinking claims of children and young people’s agency and uncritical assertions around children and young people’s participation and voice. It does this by bringing together case studies of children’s inter-generational and intra-generational relationships from both the Majority and Minority Worlds. The main themes include negotiated power, agency across contexts and negotiations of identity. The chapters show both the heritage of childhood studies, particularly within the UK, and where it may be going. One of the key aims of the book is to add to the limited but growing cross-world dialogue that encourages cross-cultural learning from research and practice in both Majority and Minority World contexts leading towards a more integrated global approach to childhood studies.

Protocol to Manage Relationships Today,"Jean Paul Wijers, Isabel Amaral, William Hanson, Bengt-Arne Hulleman, Diana Mather",N/A,2020-11-05,"Protocol to Manage Relationships Today explains the contemporary value of protocol, not only for monarchies or diplomatic institutes, but for any non-profit or for-profit organisation. This book presents modern protocol as a tool to build strong, authentic networks of reciprocal relationships. When used effectively protocol can: - Increase the effect of the networking activities of an organisation. Protocol gives a professional structure to relationship management, to achieve access to the 'right' networks and a reciprocal relationship with the most valued stakeholders. - Deepen relationships. In our world there is so much focus on pragmatism in building relationships - protocol focuses on the common ground to gain value. - Be used as a valuable tool in a post COVID-19 era, where the need for space and time to build real and authentic relationships is well understood. The book defines how tested values perfectly fit in today's society, where modern organisations want to build effective relationships and communities. This book is focused on developing an increasingly vital expertise for professionals who deal with complex relationship management issues on a strategic and tactical operational level. They come from different fields, such as government institutions, non-profit organisations and commercial environments. This book also gives protocol officers a contemporary approach towards the application of protocol. It is not designed as a complete guide to all the rules of protocol, but it describes how to translate the context into a tailor-made protocol for each meeting or event. The book explains protocol as a flexible method to handle unique situations. Protocol is presented on four levels: the 'why' of protocol; the strategic and tactical level; the practical implementation; and the execution of protocol. Protocol to Manage Relationships Today is written by Europe's foremost protocol experts with collective years of experience with the management of networking meetings and events at the highest level.",,320,N/A,0,en

Relational Coaching,Erik de Haan,John Wiley & Sons,2011-03-03,"Manfred Kets de Vries, Professor of Leadership Development, INSEAD: “The author takes us on an exciting journey to explain what coaching is all about, providing us with a roadmap that is second to none. Anyone interested in better understanding what coaching is all about, would do well to have a serious look at this book.” David Megginson, Professor of Human Resources Development, Sheffield Hallam University: “From a vivid personal story just before the first chapter to the fascinating mass of data in the appendices, this book is a captivating read about the concrete particulars of coaching and the theoretical perspectives we can use to make sense of them. Erik de Haan makes a case for relational coaching and prescribes clearly what his research and the tradition within which it is embedded can tell practitioners in the field.” Bruce E. Wampold, Professor of Counseling Psychology, University of Wisconsin: “I am thrilled that there is a coaching book that emphasizes the coachee and the relationship. In Relational Coaching, Erik de Haan places the emerging profession on a strong foundation that emphasizes the interpersonal aspects of the endeavour.” Relational Coaching is a radically different way of looking at coaching that puts the relationship, from the perspective of the coachee, at the centre. Exploring both age-old tradition and reliable studies in recent decades, Relational Coaching gives the modern executive coach ten commandments to help improve his or her practice. The book demonstrates how each of these commandments is underpinned by sound quantitative research. The book begins by giving a complete overview of the profession and the latest developments in coaching. The second part of the book presents new quantitative and qualitative research into effects and experiences of coaching. Part three contains an introduction to the activities that make a good coach and the mechanisms used to verify coaches’ understanding of their profession.

These relationship laws are ever-present. When you align with them, the results are dramatic. Your network will grow rapidly. You’ll be seen by clients as a trusted partner rather than an expense to be managed. And you’ll find the people around you eager to help you succeed.

As a third-year Ph.D. candidate, Olive Smith doesn't believe in lasting romantic relationships—but her best friend does, and that's what got her into this situation. Convincing Anh that Olive is dating and well on her way to a happily ever after was always going to take more than hand-wavy Jedi mind tricks: Scientists require proof. So, like any self-respecting biologist, Olive panics and kisses the first man she sees. That man is none other than Adam Carlsen, a young hotshot professor—and well-known ass. Which is why Olive is positively floored when Stanford's reigning lab tyrant agrees to keep her charade a secret and be her fake boyfriend. But when a big science conference goes haywire, putting Olive's career on the Bunsen burner, Adam surprises her again with his unyielding support and even more unyielding...six-pack abs. Suddenly their little experiment feels dangerously close to combustion.

Designer Relationships,"Mark A. Michaels, Patricia Johnson",Cleis Press,2015-09-08,"Contemporary relationships are in a state of rapid evolution. These changes can and should empower people with the opportunity to develop partnerships based on their own sexualities, understandings, and agreements. This makes it possible to create what Kenneth Haslam, founder of the Kinsey Institute's Polyamory Archive, has called ""designer relationships."" Designer relationships may encompass: people who bond emotionally but not sexually; people who agree to be non-exclusive; single people who have occasional lovers or friends with benefits; multiple partner configurations where long-term bonds exist among all or some; partnerships in which people are kinky and that make room to explore kink. The possibilities are limitless, and thinking about a partnership as something people can craft allows for flexibility and change. Relationships can open and close or have varying degrees and kinds of openness as circumstances demand. In the context of a designer relationship, decisions are made mutually, consciously, and deliberately. Best-selling authors and nationally known relationship experts Patricia Johnson and Mark A. Michaels are exemplars of this life choice, and have studied polyamory for over 20 years.

Love is the Drug,"Brian D. Earp, Julian Savulescu",Manchester University Press,2020-01-30,"What if there were a pill for love? Or an anti-love drug, designed to help us break up? This controversial and timely new book argues that recent medical advances have brought chemical control of our romantic lives well within our grasp. Substances affecting love and relationships, whether prescribed by doctors or even illicitly administered, are not some far-off speculation – indeed our most intimate connections are already being influenced by pills we take for other purposes, such as antidepressants. Treatments involving certain psychoactive substances, including MDMA—the active ingredient in Ecstasy—might soon exist to encourage feelings of love and help ordinary couples work through relationship difficulties. Others may ease a breakup or soothe feelings of rejection. Such substances could have transformative implications for how we think about and experience love. This brilliant intervention into the debate builds a case for conducting further research into ""love drugs"" and ""anti-love drugs"" and explores their ethical implications for individuals and society. Rich in anecdotal evidence and case-studies, the book offers a highly readable insight into a cutting-edge field of medical research that could have profound effects on us all. Will relationships be the same in the future? Will we still marry? It may be up to you to decide whether you want a chemical romance.",Science,327,1,1,en

Disrupted Economic Relationships,"Tibor Besedes, Volker Nitsch",MIT Press,2019-05-07,"Empirical studies and theoretical analyses examine the causes and consequences of disruptions in cross-border economic relationships, including political conflict, economic sanctions, and institutional collapse. Cross-border economic relationships gradually strengthened in the decades after World War II; for most of the postwar period, international trade and investment have grown faster than output, a process often termed “globalization.” In recent years, however, economic relationships have grown more fragile, subject to disruption by such factors as political conflict, economic sanctions, and the dissolution of institutional arrangements. This timely CESifo volume offers empirical studies and theoretical analyses that examine the causes and consequences of these disrupted economic relationships. Contributors propose a new theoretical framework for understanding the economic impact of intergroup conflict and develop a predictive model to analyze the contagion of regional wars. They offer empirical studies of the economic effect of targeted sanctions and boycotts, including those imposed upon Iran, Russia, and Myanmar; argue provocatively that natural disasters are associated with increased international trade; analyze trade duration, finding previously identified explanatory factors to be insufficient for explaining variations in trade survival over time; and critically review the hypothesis that oil was a crucial factor in the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Emotion & Relationships (2 Books in 1),Sadhguru,Jaico Publishing House,2018-01-01,"Emotion “One can make any emotion into a creative force in one’s life.” – Sadhguru It’s not just poetic license that allows us to refer to emotions as “juicy”. In a literal sense also, emotions are a chemical cocktail that course through our bodies. But while we have no problems with pleasant emotions, unpleasant emotions are the source of much angst in our lives. In Emotion: The Juice of Life, Sadhguru looks at the gamut of human emotions and how to turn them into stepping stones rather than stumbling blocks. Relationships “If you enhance yourself into a very beautiful state, everyone will want to hold a relationship with you.” – Sadhguru Human beings constantly make and break relationships. Unfortunately, relationships can make and break human beings too. Why are relationships such a circus for most of us? What is this primal urge within us that demands a bond – physical, mental, or emotional – with another? And how do we keep this bond from turning into bondage? These are the fundamental questions that Relationships: Bond or Bondage looks at as Sadhguru shares with us the keys to forming lasting and joyful relationships, whether they are with husband or wife, family and friends, at work, or with the very existence itself. Sadhguru is a yogi and profound mystic of our times. An absolute clarity of perception places him in a unique space in not only matters spiritual but in business, environmental and international affairs, and opens a new door on all that he touches.","Body, Mind & Spirit",337,N/A,0,en

Tell Me More,Kelly Corrigan,Random House,2018-01-09,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A story-driven collection of essays on the twelve powerful phrases we use to sustain our relationships, from the bestselling author of Glitter and Glue and The Middle Place “Kelly Corrigan takes on all the big, difficult questions here, with great warmth and courage.”—Glennon Doyle NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY REAL SIMPLE AND BUSTLE It’s a crazy idea: trying to name the phrases that make love and connection possible. But that’s just what Kelly Corrigan has set out to do here. In her New York Times bestselling memoirs, Corrigan distilled our core relationships to their essences, showcasing a warm, easy storytelling style. Now, in Tell Me More, she’s back with a deeply personal, unfailingly honest, and often hilarious examination of the essential phrases that turn the wheel of life. In “I Don’t Know,” Corrigan wrestles to make peace with uncertainty, whether it’s over invitations that never came or a friend’s agonizing infertility. In “No,” she admires her mother’s ability to set boundaries and her liberating willingness to be unpopular. In “Tell Me More,” a facialist named Tish teaches her something important about listening. And in “I Was Wrong,” she comes clean about her disastrous role in a family fight—and explains why saying sorry may not be enough. With refreshing candor, a deep well of empathy, and her signature desire to understand “the thing behind the thing,” Corrigan swings between meditations on life with a preoccupied husband and two mercurial teenage daughters to profound observations on love and loss. With the streetwise, ever-relatable voice that defines Corrigan’s work, Tell Me More is a moving and meaningful take on the power of the right words at the right moment to change everything. Praise for Tell Me More “It is such a comfort just knowing that Kelly Corrigan exists: she is somehow both wise and self-deprecating; funny but unafraid of pain; frank but gentle. She is the sister/mother/best friend we all wish we could have—and because of this big-hearted book, we all get to.”—Ariel Levy, author of The Rules Do Not Apply “With full-bodied humor and radical sensitivity, Kelly Corrigan transforms the mundane pain of life into a necessary spiritual text of sorts, one that reminds us that we have the right to grieve but the obligation to be grateful.

At first they are innocuous enough, but as tensions from the 2016 election spread from the media into his own family, they become much, much more complicated.

Dare to Lead,Brené Brown,Random House,2018-10-11,"In her #1 NYT bestsellers, Brené Brown taught us what it means to dare greatly, rise strong and brave the wilderness. Now, based on new research conducted with leaders, change makers and culture shifters, she’s showing us how to put those ideas into practice so we can step up and lead. Leadership is not about titles, status and power over people. Leaders are people who hold themselves accountable for recognising the potential in people and ideas, and developing that potential. This is a book for everyone who is ready to choose courage over comfort, make a difference and lead. When we dare to lead, we don't pretend to have the right answers; we stay curious and ask the right questions. We don't see power as finite and hoard it; we know that power becomes infinite when we share it and work to align authority and accountability. We don't avoid difficult conversations and situations; we lean into the vulnerability that’s necessary to do good work. But daring leadership in a culture that's defined by scarcity, fear and uncertainty requires building courage skills, which are uniquely human. The irony is that we're choosing not to invest in developing the hearts and minds of leaders at the same time we're scrambling to figure out what we have to offer that machines can't do better and faster. What can we do better? Empathy, connection and courage to start. Brené Brown spent the past two decades researching the emotions that give meaning to our lives. Over the past seven years, she found that leaders in organisations ranging from small entrepreneurial start-ups and family-owned businesses to non-profits, civic organisations and Fortune 50 companies, are asking the same questions: How do you cultivate braver, more daring leaders? And, how do you embed the value of courage in your culture? Dare to Lead answers these questions and gives us actionable strategies and real examples from her new research-based, courage-building programme. Brené writes, ‘One of the most important findings of my career is that courage can be taught, developed and measured. Courage is a collection of four skill sets supported by twenty-eight behaviours. All it requires is a commitment to doing bold work, having tough conversations and showing up with our whole hearts. Easy? No. Choosing courage over comfort is not easy. Worth it? Always. We want to be brave with our lives and work. It's why we're here.’",Business & Economics,310,N/A,0,en

How to Be an Adult in Love,David Richo,Shambhala Publications,2014-01-07,"We were made to love and be loved. Loving ourselves and others is in our genetic code. It’s nothing other than the purpose of our lives—but knowing that doesn’t make it easy to do. We may find it a challenge to love ourselves. We may have a hard time letting love in from others. We’re often afraid of getting hurt. It is also sometimes scary for us to share love with those around us—and love that isn't shared leaves us feeling flat and unfulfilled. David Richo provides the tools here for learning how to love in evolved adult ways—beginning with getting past the barriers that keep us from loving ourselves, then showing how we can learn to open to love others. He provides wisdom from Buddhism, psychology, and a range of spiritual traditions, along with a wealth of practices both for avoiding the pitfalls that can occur in love relationships and for enhancing the way love shows up in our lives.

Lane and Paul David Tripp explain the biblical pattern for change in a clear, practical way you can apply to the challenges of daily life. But change involves much more than just a biblical formula: you will see how God is at work to make you the person you were created to be. That powerful, loving, redemptive relationship is at the heart of all positive change you experience. A changed heart is the bright promise of the gospel, but many of us wonder if we'll ever see lasting change take root in our lives. When the Bible talks about the gift of a new heart, it doesn't mean a heart that is immediately perfected, but a heart that is capable of being changed. Jesus's work on the cross targets our hearts, our core desires and motivations, and when our hearts change, our behavior changes. How People Change targets the root of a person: the heart. When our core desires and motivations change, only then will behavior follow. Using a biblical model of Heat, Thorns, Cross, and Fruit, Paul David Tripp and Timothy S. Lane reveal how lasting change is possible. You don't need to be stuck anymore. In Christ, you are a new creation. The old has gone and the new has come. Includes a foreword by David Powlison.",Religion,344,N/A,0,en

Getting to Zero,Jayson Gaddis,Hachette Go,2021-10-05,"The relationship teacher, coach, and founder of The Relationship School reveals the origins of conflict styles, how to stop avoiding difficult conversations, and how to resolve conflict in our most important relationships. Conflicts in our closest relationships are scary because so much is at stake. If the conflict doesn't go well, we could lose our marriage, our family or our job, all connected to our security and survival. So we do just about anything not to lose those relationships, including avoid conflict, betraying ourselves or becoming dishonest. Unresolved conflict affects every single aspect of our lives, from self-confidence to physical and mental health. Jayson Gaddis is a personal trainer for relationships and one of the world’s leading authorities on interpersonal conflict. For almost two decades, Gaddis has helped individuals, couples, and teams get to the bottom of their deepest conflicts. He helps people see the wisdom in conflict and how to get to zero—which means we have successfully worked through our conflict and have nothing in the way of a good connection. In Getting to Zero, Gaddis shows the reader how to stop running away from uncomfortable conversations and instead learn how to work through them. Through funny personal stories, uncomfortable examples, and effective tools and skills, he shows the reader how to move from disconnection to connection, acceptance, and understanding. This method upgrades the old tired and static conflict resolution approaches and offers a fresh, street-level, user-friendly road map on exactly how to work through conflict with the people you care most about.",Family & Relationships,304,N/A,0,en

Personal Relationships During Adolescence,"Raymond Montemayor, Gerald R. Adams, Thomas P.

It offers insights for program and curriculum planning and suggests numerous topics for stimulating discussions with teens. It also raises provocative issues about how the developmental needs of youth can be served more effectively by families, communities, and educators. The book holds the potential to define personal relations as an integrated line of study that serves to develop theory and research beyond contextual boundaries. The contributors analyze the ways in which critical interpersonal bonds are forged and maintained. The relationships discussed are: The parent-teen connection; the impact of cultural diversity on teens' social development; same-sex friends as well as opposite-sex friends during adolescence; heterosexual, bisexual, gay and lesbian romantic relationships; adolescent crowds (or cliques); and relationships involving non-kin adults. The authors also explore conceptual issues that cut across relationships and the problem of integrating the views of both individuals in a relationship.",Medical,270,N/A,0,en

With insight and honesty, he explores a range of difficult, sometimes uncomfortable topics including strength and vulnerability, relationships and marriage, body image, sex and sexuality, racial justice, gender equality, and fatherhood.

God and the Gay Christian,Matthew Vines,Convergent Books,2014-04-22,"“God and the Gay Christian is a game changer. Winsome, accessible, and carefully researched, every page is brought to life by the author’s clear love for Scripture and deep, persistent faith. With this book, Matthew Vines emerges as one of my generation’s most important Christian leaders, not only on matters of sexuality but also on what it means to follow Jesus with wisdom, humility, and grace. Prepare to be challenged and enlightened, provoked and inspired. Read with an open heart and mind, and you are bound to be changed.” — Rachel Held Evans, author of A Year of Biblical Womanhood and Faith Unraveled As a young Christian man, Matthew Vines harbored the same basic hopes of most young people: to someday share his life with someone, to build a family of his own, to give and receive love. But when he realized he was gay, those hopes were called into question. The Bible, he’d been taught, condemned gay relationships. Feeling the tension between his understanding of the Bible and the reality of his same-sex orientation, Vines devoted years of intensive research into what the Bible says about homosexuality. With care and precision, Vines asked questions such as: • Do biblical teachings on the marriage covenant preclude same-sex marriage or not? • How should we apply the teachings of Jesus to the gay debate? • What does the story of Sodom and Gomorrah really say about human relationships? • Can celibacy be a calling when it is mandated, not chosen? • What did Paul have in mind when he warned against same-sex relations? Unique in its affirmation of both an orthodox faith and sexual diversity, God and the Gay Christian is likely to spark heated debate, sincere soul search­ing, even widespread cultural change. Not only is it a compelling interpretation of key biblical texts about same-sex relations, it is also the story of a young man navigating relationships with his family, his hometown church, and the Christian church at large as he expresses what it means to be a faithful gay Christian.",Religion,226,4.5,3,en

Courtney Sullivan). “[A] novel that demands to be read compulsively, in one sitting.”—The Washington Post ONE OF ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY’S TEN BEST NOVELS OF THE DECADE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: People, Slate, The New York Public Library, Harvard Crimson Connell and Marianne grew up in the same small town, but the similarities end there. At school, Connell is popular and well liked, while Marianne is a loner. But when the two strike up a conversation—awkward but electrifying—something life changing begins. A year later, they’re both studying at Trinity College in Dublin. Marianne has found her feet in a new social world while Connell hangs at the sidelines, shy and uncertain. Throughout their years at university, Marianne and Connell circle one another, straying toward other people and possibilities but always magnetically, irresistibly drawn back together. And as she veers into self-destruction and he begins to search for meaning elsewhere, each must confront how far they are willing to go to save the other. Normal People is the story of mutual fascination, friendship, and love. It takes us from that first conversation to the years beyond, in the company of two people who try to stay apart but find that they can’t.

Here, expert systems have been defined rather broadly: any system which embodies expert knowledge explicitly and utilises reasoning processes as its computational process.

Romantic Relationships in Emerging Adulthood,"Frank D. Fincham, Ming Cui",Cambridge University Press,2014-01-02,"Emerging adulthood - the period between the late teens and mid-twenties - is a unique and important developmental period during which people gain relationship experience before settling on someone to partner with. Romantic Relationships in Emerging Adulthood presents a synthesis of cutting-edge research and theory on this topic. Leading scholars from demography, sociology, family studies, and psychology provide original data and theoretical analyses that address the formation, nature, and significance of romantic relationships in emerging adults. Until recently, it was assumed that romantic relationships in emerging adults were not particularly important or formative. The material presented allows this assumption to be thoroughly evaluated. This volume is intended to be a resource for anyone interested in understanding romantic relationships in emerging adulthood. It is especially appropriate for classroom use in upper-level undergraduate and graduate courses in the fields of family sociology, human development and family studies, clinical and developmental psychology, and social work.",Psychology,0,N/A,0,en

Profiling Your Date,Caroline Presno,St. Martin's Griffin,2007-09-04,"The smart woman's guide to dating and relating To get into a man's heart, you have to get into his head. With this insider's guide to evaluating a man, Caroline Presno, Ed.D., P.C.C. teaches women how to apply psychotherapists' tricks of the trade to finding Mr. Right. Caroline Presno has developed systematic ways to ‘profile' a man for his degree of commitment readiness, his aptitude for love and intimacy, his chance of lying, or being unfaithful, his tendency toward big, bad personality problems like narcissism and paranoia, and his ability to fulfill his potential. Profiling Your Date answers the pressing questions every woman has: 'What type of man should I be looking for? Who should I steer clear from? Is this a healthy relationship for me to be in right now? Is there a better relationship out there for me?' Profiling Your Date helps you to dissect his behavior and probe his thinking to reveal red flags that indicate it is time to move on. For example: * He is quick to acknowledge everyone else's flaws, but not his own. * He needs constant excitement and gets bored easily - he will eventually get bored with you. *He puts your relationship on fast-forward and isolates you from your family and friends. *He calls you at the last minute, spends a lot of time out with the boys, and lets you pursue him more than he pursues you. Whether you are in love or looking for love, you can learn who to ‘profile' into your life, and who to ‘profile' out. Caroline Presno will show you how. CAROLINE PRESNO, Ed.D., P.C.C. is a psychotherapist as well as a doctor of education. She has honed her profiling techniques through academic research, clinical experience, and her own always-exciting dates – which led her to her ""one.""

The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck,Mark Manson,HarperCollins,2016-09-13,"#1 New York Times Bestseller Over 10 million copies sold In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be ""positive"" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people. For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. ""F**k positivity,"" Mark Manson says. ""Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it."" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—""not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault."" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.",Self-Help,197,4,17,en

Friendship and Love in the Middle English Metrical Romances,Anna Hubertine Reuters,"Peter Lang Gmbh, Internationaler Verlag Der Wissenschaften",1991,"«Friendship and Love in the Middle English Metrical Romances» groups together a representative cross-section of the genre, according to variants of love relationships, and to ideas of friendship. The horizontal and the vertical structure of the relatonship are tripartite. The horizontal stages are attraction, separation-testing-trial, and reunion, the vertical spheres are the personal, social/political, and religious. All relationships fail into two types, the restorative-concordant and the innovative-discordant. These are defined by the relative position of the partners in the social-political sphere of their relationship. The groups of relationship are defined by the initially more active partner: forward heroine, fairy mistress, forward hero, mutual love, married love; friendship, lords and retainers.

Same-Sex Relationships and Beyond (3rd Edition),"Katharina Boele-Woelki, Angelika Fuchs",Intersentia,2017-03-31,"The legal status of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people has undergone significant changes in several countries, but remains highly complex and difficult for those affected. Although same-sex partners may have the right to marry or enter into a registered partnership in one Member State, this right may be denied when they exercise their right to freedom of movement. The same is true for certain parent-child relationships, which may be recognized as such in one Member State but not another. This book explores the challenges and controversies concerning the recognition of non-heterosexual relationships throughout the EU through the lens of EU legislation, the case law of the CJEU and ECtHR, and recent national developments. Following the Irish referendum and the recent ECtHR judgment in Oliari v. Italy, more changes are expected in the near future. The opening part of this book describes the current state of play in all EU Member States (and beyond) when formalizing a same-sex relationship, 'steady progress' being the key term in describing the developments in many countries (with the exception of six Eastern European States that object to legislation in this field). The second part concentrates on parenthood and children's rights, notably adoption, surrogacy, multiple parenting, and the range of parenting rights for same-sex couples, and transsexual and transgender people. The third section on gender identity and human rights, discusses the legal aftermath of the European Court of Human Rights' judgment in Oliari, condemning Italy for failing to protect homosexuals' right to family life. Furthermore, it explains European Union legislation against discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, and the challenges lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender applicants are confronted with when reaching Europe as refugees. The book ends with a lively debate on the right to change one's legal gender, and it raises the fundamental question of whether we still need gender as a legal category or whether laws concerning partnership and parenting could feasibly be de-gendered. Does gender matter in the EU? This book is written for both the academic and professional readership.

The All-or-Nothing Marriage,Eli J. Finkel,Penguin,2017-09-19,"“After years of debate and inquiry, the key to a great marriage remained shrouded in mystery. Until now...”—Carol Dweck, author of Mindset: The New Psychology of Success Eli J. Finkel's insightful and ground-breaking investigation of marriage clearly shows that the best marriages today are better than the best marriages of earlier eras. Indeed, they are the best marriages the world has ever known. He presents his findings here for the first time in this lucid, inspiring guide to modern marital bliss. The All-or-Nothing Marriage reverse engineers fulfilling marriages—from the “traditional” to the utterly nontraditional—and shows how any marriage can be better. The primary function of marriage from 1620 to 1850 was food, shelter, and protection from violence; from 1850 to 1965, the purpose revolved around love and companionship. But today, a new kind of marriage has emerged, one oriented toward self-discover, self-esteem, and personal growth. Finkel combines cutting-edge scientific research with practical advice; he considers paths to better communication and responsiveness; he offers guidance on when to recalibrate our expectations; and he even introduces a set of must-try “lovehacks.” This is a book for the newlywed to the empty nester, for those thinking about getting married or remarried, and for anyone looking for illuminating advice that will make a real difference to getting the most out of marriage today.",Family & Relationships,354,N/A,0,en

In order to attract a life partner and build a healthy intimate relationship, you must first become a good partner to yourself. This book offers twenty invaluable lessons that will help you explore and commit to your own emotional and psychological well-being so you can be ready, resilient, and confident in love. Many of us enter into romantic relationships full of expectation and hope, only to be sorely disappointed by the realization that the partner we’ve selected is a flawed human being with their own neuroses, history, and desires. Most relationships end because one or both people haven’t done the internal work necessary to develop self-awareness and take responsibility for their own experiences. We’ve all heard “You can’t love anyone unless you love yourself,” but amid life’s distractions and the myth of perfect, romantic love, how exactly do you do that? In Loving Bravely, psychologist, professor and relationship expert Alexandra H. Solomon introduces the idea of relational self-awareness, encouraging you to explore your personal history to gain an understanding of your own relational patterns, as well as your strengths and weaknesses in relationships. By doing so, you’ll learn what relationships actually require, beyond the fairytale notions of romance. And by maintaining a steady but gentle focus on yourself, you’ll build the best possible foundation for making a loving connection. By understanding your past relationship experiences, cultivating a strong sense of self-awareness, and determining what it is you really want in a romantic partner—you’ll be ready to find the healthy, lasting love your heart desires.",Family & Relationships,204,N/A,0,en

In this lucid and graceful meditation on the deeper meanings of intimacy, John Armstrong explores the ideas that have shaped how we view affairs of the heart.

The Beta Male Revolution,Alan Roger Currie,Alan Roger Currie,2016-06-01,"""The Beta Male Revolution is for men in the 21st Century what Feminism was for women in the 1960s and 1970s"" says Author and Professional Dating Coach Alan Roger Currie in his latest book. Most men don't want to remain 'just friends' with women. Men want either sex only from women, or a combination of sexual companionship and non-sexual companionship. Unlike men, women have as many as FOUR types of men they want to spend time with: - Men who women only want to spend time with for sexual enjoyment and satisfaction: These are 'Total Alpha males' - Men who women only want to spend time with for a combination of sexual companionship and non-sexual companionship. These are 'Alpha males with a few Beta traits and tendencies' - Men who women want to spend time with primarily for the benefit of entertaining conversation, enjoyable social companionship, and financial assistance and support. These are 'Beta males with a few Alpha traits and tendencies' - Men who women only want to spend time with for strictly platonic friendship, flattery, and to have men provide them with an 'empathetic listening ear' when they are feeling bored, frustrated, or depressed. These are 'Total Beta males' Many women socially interact exclusively with Alpha male types between the ages of 18 and 29, and then begin looking for a nice, sweet, polite, monogamy-oriented Beta male type for marriage once they reach the age of 30. Well, the Beta male types are tired of this routine, and they are now avoiding proposing to marriage to women who they perceive as ""Alpha male leftovers."" Beta males are now well aware that the vast majority of women want to spend time with Alpha males for sexual enjoyment and satisfaction. They are also well aware that most women want to spend time with Beta males for platonic friendship, financial favors, and entertaining conversation. The Beta Male Revolution is a brutally honest assessment of where we as a society have been, where we are now, and where we are headed regarding the state of dating, long-term romantic relationships, marriage, and monogamy vs. promiscuity vs. polyamory. Women can also learn from this book because Currie explains just why men pursue some women for short-term non-monogamous 'casual' sex only, while they pursue other totally different women for long-term romantic relationships and marriage. Purchase this book right now and be educated and enlightened. You are guaranteed to have a better understanding of the manner in which the mind of the opposite sex works, and why men and women gravitate toward the type of romantic companions and sexual companions that they do after reading this book. This book will be talked about for years to come.",Social Science,90,5,1,en

The Secret Lives of Introverts,Jenn Granneman,Simon and Schuster,2017-08-01,"An introvert guide and manifesto for all the quiet ones—and the people who love them. Is there a hidden part of you that no one else sees? Do you have a vivid inner world of thoughts and emotions that your peers and loved ones can’t seem to access? Have you ever been told you’re too “quiet,” “shy,” “boring,” or “awkward”? Are your habits and comfort zones questioned by a society that doesn’t seem to get the real you? If so, you might be an introvert. On behalf of those who have long been misunderstood, rejected, or ignored, fellow introvert Jenn Granneman writes a compassionate vindication—exploring, discovering, and celebrating the secret inner world of introverts that, only until recently, has begun to peek out and emerge into the larger social narrative. Drawing from scientific research, in-depth interviews with experts and other introverts, and her personal story, Granneman reveals the clockwork behind the introvert’s mind—and why so many people get it wrong initially. Whether you are a bona fide introvert, an extrovert anxious to learn how we tick, or a curious ambivert, these revelations will answer the questions you’ve always had: What’s going on when introverts go quiet? What do introvert lovers need to flourish in a relationship? How can introverts find their own brand of fulfillment in the workplace? Do introverts really have a lot to say—and how do we draw it out? How can introverts mine their rich inner worlds of creativity and insight? Why might introverts party on a Friday night but stay home alone all Saturday? How can introverts speak out to defend their needs? With other myths debunked and truths revealed, The Secret Lives of Introverts is an empowering manifesto that guides you toward owning your introversion by working with your nature, rather than against it, in a world where you deserve to be heard.",Self-Help,291,N/A,0,en

Handbook of Interpersonal Commitment and Relationship Stability,"Jeffrey M. Adams, Warren H. Jones",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"A fundamental assumption underlying the formation of our most important relationships is that they will persist indefinitely into the future. As an acquaintanceship turns into a friend ship, for example, both members of this newly formed interpersonal bond are likely to expect that their interactions will become increasingly frequent, diverse, and intimate over time. This expectation is perhaps most apparent in romantically involved couples who, through a variety of verbal and symbolic means, make explicit pledges to a long-lasting relationship. In either case, it is clear that these relationships represent something valuable to the individuals in volved and are pursued with great enthusiasm. Virtually all close relationships are formed within the context of mutually rewarding in teractions and/or strong physical attraction between partners. Friends and romantically in volved couples alike are drawn to one another because of similarity of attitudes, interests, and personality and, quite simply, because they enjoy one another's company. This enjoyment, cou pled with the novelty that characterizes new relationships, almost makes the continuation of the relationship a foregone conclusion. As relationships progress, however, their novelty fades, conflicts may arise between partners, negative life events may occur, and the satisfaction that previously characterized the relationships may diminish.",Psychology,560,N/A,0,en

The Rationality of Love,Hichem Naar,Oxford University Press,2022-10-03,"Love has been the subject of much fascination. It is indeed one of those things which elude us in many ways. The long-lasting disagreement over love's nature is unsurprising. In light of this, a piecemeal approach to love is in order. Instead of asking what love is down the line, we might need to investigate its various features and its connection to other things. The Rationality of Love addresses the question whether love belongs, paradoxically enough, to the realm of reason, whether love belongs to the class of responses, such as belief and action, that admit of norms of justification and rationality. Are there normative reasons to love someone? Can it be an appropriate or fitting response to an individual? Can it be rational? Or is love, like perceptual experiences, sensations and urges, the sort of thing we just have and for which we cannot be rationally criticizable? Hichem Naar provides a sustained defense of the rationality of love. There are reasons to love others, reasons provided by the unique value of each individual. This will in turn rule out popular accounts of love which deny love's rationality and vindicate those accounts that make room for it. Drawing on various domains of philosophical inquiry such as the philosophy of mind, the philosophy of normativity, and epistemology, Naar provides a careful assessment of the various positions in the debate over reasons for love and develops his own answer to the normative question about love.",Philosophy,183,N/A,0,en

The Origins of Self,Martin P. J. Edwardes,UCL Press,2019-07-22,"The Origins of Self explores the role that selfhood plays in defining human society, and each human individual in that society. It considers the genetic and cultural origins of self, the role that self plays in socialisation and language, and the types of self we generate in our individual journeys to and through adulthood. Edwardes argues that other awareness is a relatively early evolutionary development, present throughout the primate clade and perhaps beyond, but self-awareness is a product of the sharing of social models, something only humans appear to do. The self of which we are aware is not something innate within us, it is a model of our self produced as a response to the models of us offered to us by other people. Edwardes proposes that human construction of selfhood involves seven different types of self. All but one of them are internally generated models, and the only non-model, the actual self, is completely hidden from conscious awareness. We rely on others to tell us about our self, and even to let us know we are a self.",Psychology,249,N/A,0,en
Indiana Real Estate License Exam Prep,"Stephen Mettling, David Cusic, Ryan Mettling, Jane Somers",Performance Programs Company,2024-03-05,"Features of Indiana Real Estate License Exam Prep (IN-RELEP): National Principles & Law Key Point Review (60 pages) Real Estate Math Key Formula Review & Practice (17 pages) Indiana-Specific Laws and Practices (33 pages) National Practice Tests (500 questions) Indiana Practice Tests (125 questions) Indiana Sample Exam (100 questions) We know the real estate licensing exam can be tough, and very nerve-wracking to prepare for. That’s why we created the Indiana Real Estate License Exam Prep (IN-RELEP) the way we did. Since we have been managing real estate schools and developing curriculum for forty years, we know how all this works – or fails to work. IN-RELEP is comprehensive in that it contains both key content review and testing practice. And the text review is Indiana-specific – not just simplistic national content, but terse, relevant and accurate Indiana laws and regulations presented as a well-organized set of state ‘key point reviews’ ideal for pre-test memorization. But let’s not dismiss the importance of the national content either. IN-RELEP’s national key point reviews are a succinct compression of tested national principles and practices that comprise the national portion of state license exams from coast to coast. Our content is drawn from our own national textbook, Principles of Real Estate Practice – one of the most widely used principles textbooks in the country. Finally, our national content, as well as our question selection, is further tailored to the state testing outline promulgated by PSI for Indiana. Thus the breadth and depth of the law reviews and test questions reflect the topic emphasis of your Indiana PSI license exam. A word about the test questions… IN-RELEP’s testing practice section consists of ten national practice tests, nine state practice tests, and one state exam sample test. The practice tests are roughly 50 questions in length and the sample test is 100 questions. The test questions are designed to cover the content covered by the law reviews – which reinforces your learning of the total body of information tested by your Indiana exam. The questions are direct, to the point, and designed to test your understanding. When you have completed a given test, you can check your answers against the answer key in the appendix. You may also note that each question’s answer is accompanied by a brief explanation, or “rationale” to further reinforce your understanding. In the end, as you know, it’s all up to you. Unlike other publications, we are not going to tell you that using this book will guarantee that you pass your state exam. It still takes hard work and study to pass. But we have done our best here to get you ready. Following that, the most we can do is wish you the best of success in taking and passing your Indiana real estate exam. So good luck!! For students looking for an Indiana prelicense textbook to complement Indiana Real Estate License Exam Prep, we have Principles of Real Estate Practice in Indiana.",Law,304,N/A,0,en

Exploring Mormon Thought,Blake T. Ostler,Greg Kofford Books,2006-03-01,"In volume 2 of the series, Exploring Mormon Thought: The Problems of Theism and the Love of God, Blake Ostler explores issues related to soteriology, or the theory of salvation. He argues that the commitment that God loves us and respects our dignity as persons entails that God must leave us free to choose whether to have a saving relationship with him. He explores the “logic of love” and argues that the LDS doctrine of a ""war in heaven"" embodies the commitment that God leaves us free to choose whether to enter into relationship with God. He explores the nature of inter-personal prayer and the contributions of LDS beliefs to a robust prayer dialogue. He offers a view consistent with LDS commitments that makes sense out of asking God to assist others, to alter the natural environment and to grow in relationship with God. He then turns to the concept of grace and argues that the traditional views lead to insurmountable problems. He argues that though God does not owe any obligation to us to give us grace, God does so out of love. However, because divinity arises from loving relationships, he argues that God could not fail to give sufficient grace to all persons and remain a loving God.",Religion,514,N/A,0,en

Towards a Theology of Relationship,Michael Berra,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2022-08-11,"We live in an era in which relations are considered to be of the utmost importance in almost every field of science and society. For theology, however, this is nothing new. Having a personal relationship with God is a common Christian expression, and while this notion of relationship with God usually lacks a clear definition and its explication is often deeply flawed, this book argues nevertheless for the centrality of a theology of relationship. By reintroducing Emil Brunner as a relational theologian, based on his seminal work Truth as Encounter, it is boldly proposed that relationship must be the prime leitmotif for the whole of theology. Furthermore, the relationship analogy is investigated in light of contemporary relationship science: is it accurate to speak of a relationship with God? Berra argues that God-human interaction is indeed categorically a relationship and existentially intended to be intimate. Consequently, this relationship needs to be the theological leitmotif leading to a theology of relationship.",Religion,247,N/A,0,en

Sibling Relationships,"M. E. Lamb, B. Sutton-Smith, Brian Sutton-Smith, Michael E. Lamb",Psychology Press,2014-01-14,"First published in 1982. Since the emergence of developmental psychology early this century, theorists and researchers have emphasized the family’s role in shaping the child’s emergent social style, personality, and cognitive competence. In so doing, however, psychologists have implicitly adopted a fairly idiosyncratic definition of the family— one that focuses almost exclusively on parents and mostly on mothers. The realization that most families contain two parents and at least two children has occurred slowly, and has brought with it recognition that children develop in the context of a diverse network of social relationships within which each person may affect every other both directly (through their interactions) and indirectly (i.e., through A ’s effect on B, who in turn influences C). The family is such a social network, itself embedded in a broader network of relations with neighbors, relatives, and social institutions.

Fundamentals of Object Databases,"Suzanne Dietrich, Susan Urban",Morgan & Claypool Publishers,2010-10-10,"Object-oriented databases were originally developed as an alternative to relational database technology for the representation, storage, and access of non-traditional data forms that were increasingly found in advanced applications of database technology. After much debate regarding object-oriented versus relational database technology, object-oriented extensions were eventually incorporated into relational technology to create object-relational databases. Both object-oriented databases and object-relational databases, collectively known as object databases, provide inherent support for object features, such as object identity, classes, inheritance hierarchies, and associations between classes using object references. This monograph presents the fundamentals of object databases, with a specific focus on conceptual modeling of object database designs. After an introduction to the fundamental concepts of object-oriented data, the monograph provides a review of object-oriented conceptual modeling techniques using side-by-side Enhanced Entity Relationship diagrams and Unified Modeling Language conceptual class diagrams that feature class hierarchies with specialization constraints and object associations. These object-oriented conceptual models provide the basis for introducing case studies that illustrate the use of object features within the design of object-oriented and object-relational databases. For the object-oriented database perspective, the Object Data Management Group data definition language provides a portable, language-independent specification of an object schema, together with an SQL-like object query language. LINQ (Language INtegrated Query) is presented as a case study of an object query language together with its use in the db4o open-source object-oriented database. For the object-relational perspective, the object-relational features of the SQL standard are presented together with an accompanying case study of the object-relational features of Oracle. For completeness of coverage, an appendix provides a mapping of object-oriented conceptual designs to the relational model and its associated constraints.

Jacob's Younger Brother,Karma Ben-Johanan,Harvard University Press,2022-01-01,"A revealing account of contemporary tensions between Jews and Christians, playing out beneath the surface of conciliatory interfaith dialogue. A new chapter in Jewish-Christian relations opened in the second half of the twentieth century when the Second Vatican Council exonerated Jews from the accusation of deicide and declared that the Jewish people had never been rejected by God. In a few carefully phrased statements, two millennia of deep hostility were swept into the trash heap of history. But old animosities die hard. While Catholic and Jewish leaders publicly promoted interfaith dialogue, doubts remained behind closed doors. Catholic officials and theologians soon found that changing their attitude toward Jews could threaten the foundations of Christian tradition. For their part, many Jews perceived the new Catholic line as a Church effort to shore up support amid atheist and secular advances. Drawing on extensive research in contemporary rabbinical literature, Karma Ben-Johanan shows that Jewish leaders welcomed the Catholic condemnation of antisemitism but were less enthusiastic about the Church's sudden urge to claim their friendship. Catholic theologians hoped Vatican II would turn the page on an embarrassing history, hence the assertion that the Church had not reformed but rather had always loved Jews, or at least should have. Orthodox rabbis, in contrast, believed they were finally free to say what they thought of Christianity. Jacob's Younger Brother pulls back the veil of interfaith dialogue to reveal how Orthodox rabbis and Catholic leaders spoke about each other when outsiders were not in the room. There Ben-Johanan finds Jews reluctant to accept the latest whims of a Church that had unilaterally dictated the terms of Jewish-Christian relations for centuries.",Religion,369,N/A,0,en

Value-Based Management of Supplier,Zhanping Cheng,BoD – Books on Demand,2009,"Supplier relationship managers often find it difficult to evaluate and optimize supplier relationships, which are crucial to the success of their business yet complex and multifaceted, characterized by long-term orientation, uncertainty, temporal evolution, idiosyncratic investment, improvement potential, and adaptation flexibility. How to design optimal supply contracts to govern supplier relationships has been a common problem in business practice for many years.

In addition, decision models for managing a supplier relationship life cycle as well as configuring and planning supplier relationship portfolios are presented. At the tactical level, the author deals with supply contract management. A general, compound supply contract model is proposed and how to design optimal supply contracts under demand risk and price risk is explored.

Reconceptualising Strict Liability for the Tort of Another,Christine Beuermann,Bloomsbury Publishing,2019-11-28,"This book adopts a novel approach to resolving the present difficulties experienced by the courts in imposing strict liability for the tort of another. It looks beyond the traditional classifications of 'vicarious liability' and 'liability for breach of a non-delegable duty of care' and, for the first time, seeks to explain all instances of strict liability for the tort of another in terms of the various relationships in which the courts impose such liability. The book shows that, despite appearances, there is a unifying feature to the various relationships in which the courts currently impose strict liability for the tort of another. That feature is authority. Whenever the courts impose strict liability for the tort of another, the defendant is either vested with authority over the person who committed a tort against the claimant or has vested or conferred a form of authority upon that person in respect of the claimant. This book uses this feature of authority to construct a new expositive framework within which strict liability for the tort of another can be understood.",Law,255,N/A,0,en

Çatalhöyük Excavations,Ian Hodder,British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara,2023-02-22,"This volume discusses the main excavations at Neolithic Çatalhöyük East undertaken from 2009 to 2017. The site is well known because of its large size, elaborate symbolism and wall paintings, and long history of excavation. This volume covers the last period of excavation directed by Ian Hodder in the North and South Areas of the site. It also describes the work conducted in the GDN Area on the later phases of occupation. The main aim of these excavations was to understand the layout and social geography of the settlement (both houses and open areas) and to situate the elaborate art and symbolism within a secure architectural and depositional context. Excavation and conservation methods are described and the campaign of geophysical prospection is described. Considerable focus is placed on detailed dating using Bayesian modeling that alters significantly our understanding of the organization of the settlement. New light is thrown on the degree of contemporaneity of buildings and on the continuities and breaks in house occupation and in the site as a whole. A fuller understanding has also been reached of the variability of houses and burials and of how these variations relate to social differentiation. The descriptions of excavated units, features and buildings incorporates results from the analyses of animal bone, chipped stone, groundstone, shell, ceramics, phytoliths, micromorphology. The integration of different types of data and of different voices within the excavation team mimics the process of collaborative interpretation that took place during the excavation and post-excavation process.",Social Science,752,N/A,0,en

Systematic Transformation Method from UML to Event-B,"Zou Sheng-Rong, Geng Xue, Yao Ju-Yi, Liu Xiao-Ying, Zhi Yu-Hua","Scientific Research Publishing, Inc. USA",2024-06-05,"Since the emergence of software engineering in the late 1960s, require-ments analysis has always been an important theme of software development. In the process of software development, many people are needed to coop-erate to ensure the stability and reliability of the software. According to the degree of formalization in the software development process, software en-gineering methods can be divided into three types: non-formal, semi-formal and formal. In object- oriented software development, UML has become a de facto modeling standard. However, although UML is intuitive and easy to understand and apply, it has inaccurate semantics, and UML is a semi-formal modeling language that cannot be formally verified. Event-B is a formal method based on a large number of mathematical predicate logic, which is accurate but difficult to understand and apply. Therefore, how to combine the advantages of UML diagrams and Event- B methods is the focus of re-search.",Antiques & Collectibles,101,N/A,0,en

Multimedia Database Systems,"V.S. Subrahmanian, Sushil Jajodia",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"With the rapid growth in the use of computers to manipulate, process, and reason about multimedia data, the problem of how to store and retrieve such data is becoming increasingly important. Thus, although the field of multimedia database systems is only about 5 years old, it is rapidly becoming a focus for much excitement and research effort. Multimedia database systems are intended to provide unified frameworks for requesting and integrating information in a wide variety of formats, such as audio and video data, document data, and image data. Such data often have special storage requirements that are closely coupled to the various kinds of devices that are used for recording and presenting the data, and for each form of data there are often multiple representations and multiple standards - all of which make the database integration task quite complex. Some of the problems include: - what a multimedia database query means - what kinds of languages to use for posing queries - how to develop compilers for such languages - how to develop indexing structures for storing media on ancillary devices - data compression techniques - how to present and author presentations based on user queries. Although approaches are being developed for a number of these problems, they have often been ad hoc in nature, and there is a need to provide a princi pled theoretical foundation.",Computers,333,N/A,0,en

The Relationship Factor in Safety Leadership,Rosa Antonia Carrillo,Routledge,2019-07-11,"At the core of The Relationship Factor in Safety Leadership are eight beliefs about human nature that are common to leaders who successfully communicate that safety is important while meeting business results. Using stories and business language the book explains how to create and recover important stakeholder relationships by setting priorities and taking action based on these beliefs. The beliefs are based on the author’s 25 years of experience supporting operational and safety leaders with successful and unsuccessful change efforts in pharmaceutical, nuclear, mining, manufacturing and power generation. The author also offers compelling evidence from many social and scientific disciplines that support the conclusion that satisfying our need for relationship is a major motivator. The Five Orientations Model offers a perspective on solving complex problems when confronted with multiple demands. The book provides managers and supervisors with the motivation to build relationships and points to the conditions needed for success. It also describes a process to take united action but retain the flexibility to change course as necessary.

Conceptual Modeling – ER 2010,"Jeffrey Parsons, Motoshi Saeki, Peretz Shoval, Carson Woo, Yair Wand",Springer,2010-10-27,"th This publication comprises the proceedings of the 29 International Conference on Conceptual Modeling (ER 2010), which was held this year in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Conceptual modeling can be considered as lying at the confluence of the three main aspects of information technology applications –– the world of the stakeholders and users, the world of the developers, and the technologies available to them. C- ceptual models provide abstractions of various aspects related to the development of systems, such as the application domain, user needs, database design, and software specifications. These models are used to analyze and define user needs and system requirements, to support communications between stakeholders and developers, to provide the basis for systems design, and to document the requirements for and the design rationale of developed systems. Because of their role at the junction of usage, development, and technology, c- ceptual models can be very important to the successful development and deployment of IT applications. Therefore, the research and development of methods, techniques, tools and languages that can be used in the process of creating, maintaining, and using conceptual models is of great practical and theoretical importance. Such work is c- ducted in academia, research institutions, and industry. Conceptual modeling is now applied in virtually all areas of IT applications, and spans varied domains such as organizational information systems, systems that include specialized data for spatial, temporal, and multimedia applications, and biomedical applications.",Computers,504,N/A,0,en

Relationships in the Organization of Knowledge,"A. Bean, R. Green",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-04-17,"Relationships abound in the library and information science (LIS) world. Those relationships may be social in nature, as, for instance, when we deal with human relationships among library personnel or relationships (i. e. , ""public relations"") between an information center and its clientele. The relationships may be educational, as, for example, when we examine the relationship between the curriculum of an accredited school and the needs of the work force it is preparing students to join. Or the relationships may be economic, as when we investigate the relationship between the cost of journals and the frequency with which they are cited. Many of the relationships of concern to us reflect phenomena entirely internal to the field: the relationship between manuscript collections, archives, and special collections; the relationship between end user search behavior and the effectiveness of searches; the relationship between access to and use of information resources; the relationship between recall and precision; the relationship between various bibliometric laws; etc. The list of such relationships could go on and on.

How there is no affection, no love towards each other. It is all about lust and sex nowadays. All we do is get it done, in and out so to speak. This is how it is with these relationships today. There are points that are made that could enable you to have a better relationship if you choose to accept them. Trust me, when you are in a good relationship you tend to think, feel, love, hug, kiss, rest, relax, trust, communicate, and be happier with life.

Customer-Supplier Relationships in B2B,Antonella La Rocca,Springer Nature,2020-03-14,"This book explores customer-supplier relationships in B2B markets focusing on interaction between parties. Drawing on three fields of research – studies of relationships in marketing, social interactionism in sociology, and sense-making in social psychology – the author explores the concepts and roles of actors in business relationships and how the behaviour of actors within an interaction affects the development of those relationships. Based on a review of prior research and an original empirical study, the author argues that the presence of continuous close relationships between the customer and supplier organisations bestows features of a business network on B2B markets, with distinct interdependencies and ubiquitous interactions. Exploring buyer-seller interactions, the author contends that actors’ mutually perceived identities – continuously emergent and relationship-specific – are the main factor in the development of business relationships and discusses the implications for management practice and research.",Business & Economics,214,N/A,0,en

The Impact of Technology on Relationships in Educational Settings,"Angela Costabile, Barbara A Spears",Routledge,2013-02-28,"As the linguistic, cognitive and social elements of our lives are transformed by new and emerging technologies, educational settings are also challenged to respond to the issues that have arisen as a consequence. This book focuses on that challenge: using psychological theory as a lens to highlight the positive uses of new technologies in relationships and educational settings, and to advocate technological learning opportunities and social support where the misuse and abuse of ICT occurs. The Impact of Technology on Relationships in Educational Settings sets out to explore the role of ICTs in relationship forming, social networking and social relationships within our schools and has grown out of the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST); Action on cyberbullying, involving 28 participating countries, and two non-COST countries, of which Australia is one. This cutting edge international text offers cross-cultural, psychological perspectives on the positive uses of new and emerging technologies to improve social relationships and examples of best practice to prevent virtual bullying. This comes at a time when much of the focus in current writings has been on the more negative aspects which have emerged as new technologies evolved: cyberbullying, cyber-aggression and cybersafety concerns. This text is ideally suited to researchers and practiitioners in the fields of Educational and developmental psychology, as well as those specialising in educational technology and the sociology of education.",Education,275,N/A,0,en

Accounting for Corporate Reputation,"Ahmed Riahi-Belkaoui, Ellen Pavlik",Praeger,1992-08-21,"This unique book examines conceptual, empirical, and practical issues associated with corporate reputation. Emphasizing the importance of the roles of corporate social disclosure and organizational effectiveness, the authors emphasize the need for an integrative framework in explaining the nature of corporate reputation. Utilizing valuable data provided by Fortune magazine, the book provides both a historical evaluation of reputational rankings of Fortune 500 firms for the period 1987-1991 and insights as to the market reaction to disclosure of these rankings. These can be utilized by firms in building reputation, investors in evaluating their strategies, and public policy officials in dealing with corporations. Following an extensive review of the conceptual foundations of corporate reputation, namely corporate social performance and disclosure and organizational effectiveness, the authors present explanatory and predictive models of corporate reputation. They then examine the potential relationship between corporate reputation and shareholders' wealth--the market reaction to reputation signals. Their findings suggest that a firm's benefit from the disclosure of reputation signals will depend on size and expectations, and that such disclosure appears to lead to a significant, lagged market reaction. Based on a detailed analysis of the 1987-1991 performance of U.S. firms on eight key attributes of reputation, the authors conclude with insights that can be utilized by corporations and investors alike.",Business & Economics,280,N/A,0,en

Constructing Authentic Relationships in Clinical Practice,"Jade Logan, Brad van Eeden-Moorefield, Scott Browning",Routledge,2021-11-11,"This essential text explores the intersectionality of the self in therapeutic practice, bringing together theoretical foundations and practical implications to provide clear guidance for students and practitioners. Bringing together a collection of insightful and experienced clinicians, this book examines the ways in which intersectionality influences all phases of clinical and supervisory work, from outreach, assessment, and through to termination. Integrating research with clinical practice, chapters not only examine the theoretical, intersectional location of the self for the therapist, client, or supervisee, but they also consider how this social identity effects the therapeutic process and, crucially, work with clients. The book includes first-hand accounts, case studies, and reflections to demonstrate how interactions are influenced by gender, race, and sexuality, offering practical ideas about how to work intentionally and ethically with clients. Engaging, informative, and practical, this book is essential reading for students, supervisors, family, marriage, and couple therapists, and clinical social workers who want to work confidently with a range of clients, as well as clinical professionals interested in the role of intersectionality in their work.",Psychology,132,N/A,0,en

Oracle 11G: SQL,Joan Casteel,Cengage Learning,2009-06-25,"ORACLE 11G: SQL is an introduction to the fundamental SQL language used in all relational databases today. This textbook is not simply a study guide; it is written for those who have just a basic knowledge of databases and can be used in a course on this latest implementation of SQL from Oracle. Learning these concepts and techniques prepares students for the first exam in both the Oracle Database Administrator and Oracle Developer Certification Exam paths and offers a solid understanding of using Oracle 11g SQL effectively. The first part of ORACLE 11G: SQL focuses on creating database objects, including tables, constraints, indexes, sequences, synonyms, and users, and manipulating data. The second part explores data query techniques, such as row filtering, joins, single-row functions, aggregate functions, subqueries, and views. Several advanced query topics, such as ROLLUP, CUBE, and TOP-N analysis, are also introduced. To help students bridge these SQL topics to further studies, appendixes introduce SQL tuning, compare Oracle’s SQL syntax with other databases (MS SQL Server and MySQL), and explain how to embed SQL in applications (ASP.NET). An overview of the two Oracle connection interface tools, SQL Developer and SQL Plus, is also provided.

Interpersonal Relationships in Education: From Theory to Practice,"David Zandvliet, Perry den Brok, Tim Mainhard",Springer,2014-08-07,"This book brings together recent research on interpersonal relationships in education from a variety of perspectives including research from Europe, North America and Australia. The work clearly demonstrates that positive teacher-student relationships can contribute to student learning in classrooms of various types. Productive learning environments are characterized by supportive and warm interactions throughout the class: teacher-student and student-student. Similarly, at the school level, teacher learning thrives when there are positive and mentoring interrelationships among professional colleagues. Work on this book began with a series of formative presentations at the second International Conference on Interpersonal Relationships in Education (ICIRE 2012) held in Vancouver, Canada, an event that included among others, keynote addresses by David Berliner, Andrew Martin and Mieke Brekelmans. Further collaboration and peer review by the editorial team resulted in the collection of original research that this book comprises. The volume (while eclectic) demonstrates how constructive learning environment relationships can be developed and sustained in a variety of settings. Chapter contributions come from a range of fields including educational and social psychology, teacher and school effectiveness research, communication and language studies, and a variety of related fields. Together, they cover the important influence of the relationships of teachers with individual students, relationships among peers, and the relationships between teachers and their professional colleagues.",Education,250,N/A,0,en

"Molecular Descriptors for Chemoinformatics, 2 Volume Set","Roberto Todeschini, Viviana Consonni",Wiley-VCH,2009-08-17,"Molecular Descriptors for Chemoinformatics As every chemist knows, there is a direct (if complex) relationship between the molecular structure of a compound and its chemical behavior. Predicting such behavior is possible by an abstract representation of its structure in terms of chemical similarity parameters, socalled ‘descriptors’. These are most useful in predicting the pharmacological properties of drug candidates, but are also used in predicting reactivity, toxicity and other important chemical characteristics. The number-one reference on the topic now contains a wealth of new data: The entire relevant literature over the past eight years has been pain-stakingly surveyed, resulting in hundreds of new descriptors being added to the list, and some 3,000 new references in the bibliography section. Volume 1 contains an alphabetical listing of around 3300 terms for the chemoinformatic analysis of chemical compound properties, while the second volume contains 6343 references selected from 450 journals with about 7000 authors quoted covering the period from the beginning of molecular descriptor research until the year 2008. In this second edition, several sections have been completely rewritten and organized in a more effective way. The greatly expanded introductory section now contains several “walk-through” reading lists of selected keywords to make the data even more accessible for novice users.",Science,304,N/A,0,en

Relationships as Developmental Contexts,"W. Andrew Collins, Brett Laursen",Psychology Press,1999-03-01,"The volume's topic was chosen in part because of the rapidly growing salience of dyadic research perspectives in developmental psychology, but also in social psychology and in fields such as communication and family studies. It provides the most complete representation now available on current theory and research on the significance of personal relationships in child and adolescent development. This volume addresses the ways in which the study of social development has been altered by an emphasis on research questions and techniques for studying children and adolescents in the context of their significant dyadic relationships. Leading scholars--many of them pioneers in the concepts and methods of dyadic research--have contributed chapters in which they both report findings from recent research and reflect on the implications for developmental psychology. Their work encompasses studies of relationships with parents, siblings, friends, and romantic partners. Opening chapters set the stage by describing the key characteristics of social-development research from a dyadic perspective and outlining key themes and contemporary issues in the field. It concludes with commentaries from distinguished senior scholars identifying important directions for future research.",Psychology,426,N/A,0,en

Time-parallel Methods for Accelerating the Solution of Structural Dynamics Problems,Julien Remi Cortial,Stanford University,2011,"The classical approach for solving evolution Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using a parallel computer consists in first partitioning the spatial domain and assigning each subdomain to a processor to achieve space-parallelism, then advancing the solution sequentially. However, enabling parallelism along the time dimension, despite its intrinsic difficulty, can be of paramount importance to fast computations when space-parallelism is unfeasible, cannot fully exploit a massively parallel machine or when near-real-time prediction is desired. The aforementioned objective can be achieved by applying classical domain decomposition principles to the time axis. The latter is first partitioned into time-slices to be processed independently. Starting with approximate seed information that provides a set of initial conditions, the response is then advanced in parallel in each time-slice using a standard time-stepping integrator. This decomposed solution exhibits discontinuities or jumps at the time-slice boundaries if the initial guess is not accurate. Applying a Newton-like approach to the time-dependent system, a correction function is then computed to improve the accuracy of the seed values and the process is repeated until convergence is reached. Methods based on the above concept have been successfully applied to various problems but none was found to be competitive for even for the simplest of second-order hyperbolic PDEs, a class of equations that covers the field of structural dynamics among others. To overcome this difficulty, a key idea is to improve the sequential propagator used for correcting the seed values, observing that the original evolution problem and the derived corrective one are closely related. The present work first demonstrates how this insight can be brought to fruition in the context of linear oscillators, with numerical examples featuring structural models ranging from academic to more challenging large-scale ones. An extension of this method to nonlinear equations is then developed and its concrete application to geometrically nonlinear transient dynamics is presented. Finally, it is shown how the time-reversibility property that characterizes some of the above problems can be exploited to develop a new framework that provides an increased speed-up factor.",,188,N/A,0,en

In particular, silvicultural prescriptions developed for SRWCs have been refined to include woody crop production systems for environmental benefits such as carbon sequestration, water quality and quantity, and soil health. In addition, current systems have been expanded beyond traditional fiber production to other environmental technologies that incorporate SRWCs as vital components for phytotechnologies, urban afforestation, ecological restoration, and mine reclamation.

Love and Organization,Michael Pirson,Taylor & Francis,2022-06-30,"Organizations are not human, but they are made up of people. Examining the organization, functioning, growing and developing and moving together as one unit, the well-being and success of that organization depends on the well-being of people that make it up. Love, in its various forms, is the energy that motivates and fuels creativity, care, innovation, progress and well-being. Traditionally, organizational structures have been set up to support compliance and command and control, which often discourages love and creates policies against love at the workplace. The result has been reduced growth, productivity and retention of businesses as well as reduced well-being for employees. This reduced connectivity between individuals has also, at a higher level, adversely affected society. Without love, people are working and performing with reduced energy, and at reduced capacity. While prior research has been focused on love at the workplace from the viewpoint of psychologists, this book explores the impact of love within organizational contexts from various viewpoints including management, psychology, and philosophy. It explores love in the organizational context by looking at how it affects meaning, purpose, well-being, motivation, faith, care, spiritual development and how the identity and well-being of each person in the organization positively affects retention and the growth and success of that organization. It will be of interest to researchers, academics, and advanced students in the fields of organizational studies, leadership, and management.",Business & Economics,313,N/A,0,en

The Culture of Child Care,"Kay E. Sanders, Alison Wishard Guerra",Oxford University Press,2016-03-09,"As societies are experiencing increasing levels of immigration from contexts outside of the Western, industrialized world, child care programs are experiencing, simultaneously, increasing diversity in enrollment. A question that has been raised by early childhood advocates and practitioners is whether the former articulations regarding definitions of quality, models of relationships, and peer relations in the child care context are accurate and relevant within the increasing racial, linguistic, and ethnic diversity of the United States. The Culture of Child Care provides a much-needed integration of research pertaining to crucial aspects of early childhood development-- attachment in non-familial contexts, peer relations among ethnically and linguistically diverse children, and the developmental importance of child care contexts during early childhood. This volume highlights the interconnections between these three distinct bodies of research and crosses disciplinary boundaries by linking psychological and educational theories to the improvement of young children's development and experiences within child care. The importance of cultural diversity in early childhood is widely acknowledged and discussed, but up until now, there has been little substantive work with a cultural focus on today's educational and early child care settings. This innovative volume will be a unique resource for a wide range of early childhood professionals including basic and applied developmental researchers, early childhood educators and advocates, and policymakers.",Psychology,321,N/A,0,en

Peacock Bass,"Kirk O. Winemiller, Leslie C. Kelso Winemiller, Carmen G. Montana",Academic Press,2021-03-15,"Peacock Bass: Diversity, Ecology, and Conservation is a unique scientific reference that describes not only the diversity and natural history of the various peacock bass species (fish in the genus Cichla) but also their geographic distributions, evolutionary relationships, ecology, and economic importance. Peacock bass are the most popular sport fish pursued by recreational anglers in tropical freshwaters, and they support important fisheries in rivers and lakes in their native South America as well as other regions of the world where they have been introduced. The book is written in clear prose that allows any reader to appreciate key features of the morphology, population genetics, and reproductive biology of these colorful tropical freshwater fish. Each chapter begins with a vignette introducing an aspect of peacock bass taxonomy, ecology, or conservation based on a personal account from one of the authors. Also included are color photographs of peacock bass, their habitats, other tropical fishes, and the diverse wildlife encountered in rivers and forests of the Neotropics. Photographic guides and detailed descriptions of coloration patterns are provided for species identification, along with distribution maps and essential information related to fisheries management and the economic importance of peacock bass. Biologists interested in zoogeography and the ecological role peacock bass play as major predators in biodiverse rivers and lakes will find summaries of the latest information. Peacock bass have grown in popularity among aquarists, and the book provides basic information about captive care and environmental conditions in their natural habitats. This book is essential reading for biologists, fisheries managers, anglers, naturalists, and aquarists interested in these remarkable fish and the diverse tropical rivers they inhabit. - Includes beautiful color photographs taken during field research - Presents research vignettes to engage both scientists and laypersons - Discusses feeding, cannibalism and effects on food webs - Provides field maps and diagrams",Technology & Engineering,316,N/A,0,en

Romantic Love in Cultural Contexts,Victor Karandashev,Springer,2016-12-24,"This volume presents a conceptual, historical, anthropological, and sociological review of how culture affects our experience and expression of romantic love. What is romantic love and how is it different from and similar to other kinds of love? How is romantic love related to sex and marriage in human history and across contemporary cultures? What cultural factors mediate attraction in love? These are some of the questions the volume explores through its interdisciplinary yet focused lens. Much of the current research evidence suggests that love is a universal emotion experienced by a majority of people, in various historical eras, and in all the world’s cultures. Yet, love displays in different ways because culture has an impact on people’s conceptions of love and the ways they feel, think, and behave in romantic relationships. This volume summarizes classical knowledge on love and culture while at the same time focusing sharply on recent studies and cutting-edge research that has advanced the field. Divided into three parts, the volume begins by defining and analyzing the concept of romantic love and interdisciplinary approach to its study in cultural context. Part II traces the origin and evolution of romantic love both in various places throughout the world and various time periods throughout history. Part III presents the revolutionary expansion of romantic love ideas and practices in the late 20th and early 21st centuries in various parts of the world, focusing particularly on the development of romantic love as a cultural ideal of the modern cultures. Finally, the book concludes by summarizing the major achievements in this field of study and predicts future development. A timely and thoughtful addition to the literature, Romantic Love in Cultural Contexts delivers thought-provoking insights to researchers in relationship scholarship, sociology, anthropology, and cultural studies, and all those interested in the universal human concept of love. Overall I find Dr. Victor Karandashev is an excellent and fine scholar who has a firm grasp of both the fundamental principles of cross-cultural research and of anthropology. In our increasingly connected world Romantic Love in Cultural Contexts updates and adds to the descriptions and explanations of similarities and differences in romantic love across generations and cultures. Romantic love encompasses the life span, rather than being a phenomenon largely confined to youthful years. The topic of this project concerns the deepest of our sentiments and pervades life from birth to death. This book contributes to better knowledge of this phenomenon across generations.

Human Factors Testing and Evaluation,D. Meister,Elsevier,2014-06-28,"Human factors measurement has characteristics that set it apart from psychological or engineering measurement and for that reason, human factors testing and evaluation deserves special treatment. The many excellent texts available in the behavioral area do not give an adequate picture of this topic, and this is particularly unfortunate because testing and evaluation (T&E) is an integral part of human-machine system design and operation. The emphasis in this book is on why and how to conduct such testing. One of its outstanding features is its pragmatism; based on his past experience in system testing, the author recognizes the difficulties that occur in testing and indicates how these may be overcome or minimized. Special attention has been paid to the context in which T&E is conducted. Although the book contains detailed procedures for performing T&E, the logic and the conceptual foundation of testing have not been overlooked. Comparisons are made with laboratory-centered experimentation. For those with research interests, the author points out the many research questions that can be answered by system testing. An illustrative case history of a T&E program for a fictional system has been included to provide ``real life'' context. Special problem areas in T&E are emphasized, in particular human error data collection, the evaluation of computerized systems and software, the measurement of maintenance technician and team performance; workload and training effectiveness testing. Special attention is also paid to environmental testing (e.g. temperature, lighting, noise, vibration, etc.). One chapter reviews all the relevant T&E literature including government documents that may not be readily available to the general reader. As part of the preparation for writing this text a survey was made of 45 distinguished T&E specialists in order to determine their characteristic T&E practices.The book will be useful not only to the human factors professional who specializes in T&E, but to all students and practitioners interested in human factors and work measurement.",Business & Economics,437,N/A,0,en

It can take place in public, private and virtual settings, and within the context of intimate, familial, community and institutional relationships.

Russian-English Dictionary of Proverbs and Sayings,"Alexander Margulis, Asya Kholodnaya",McFarland,2015-08-13,"This dictionary contains 2,375 Russian sayings and proverbs and their English counterparts. Variants of each saying are included, and careful attention is given to the differences in British and American versions. For example, the Russian saying that is interpreted as ""Children behave in a childish way, and they cannot be expected to act like grown-up people,"" is first given in Russian (in the Cyrillic alphabet) and then in English, and is then followed by the nearest English-language equivalent sayings in Britain and the United States: ""Young colts will canter"" (British) and ""Boys will be boys"" (American). The proverbs and sayings are arranged alphabetically by the first Russian word (in the Cyrillic alphabet) and are cross-referenced so the reader can find analogous Russian versions of English sayings. There is a keyword index for each language (one in English, one in Russian in the Cyrillic alphabet), which allows the reader to find a proverb or a saying without knowing the first word. Proverbs and sayings are current and include those popular in both spoken Russian and literature. The prefatory matter is in both English and Russian, for readers who have a command of either language.",Literary Criticism,497,N/A,0,en

External Embeddedness of Subsidiaries,Swantje Hartmann,BoD – Books on Demand,2011,"In the research fields of International Business and International Management it is stated that product innovations are not only developed by headquarters (HQs) but also by foreign subsidiaries. Subsidiaries thereby apply the knowledge they obtain in inter-organizational business relationships with stakeholders like customers, suppliers, competitors, research institutions or governmental organizations. After being finished, product innovations are either exclusively employed by the creative subsidiaries or they are also transferred in intra-organizational business relationships to other units of the MNC, i. e. HQs or other subsidiaries. This book deals with both the product innovation process in foreign subsidiaries and the innovation transfer process to other units of the MNC. Using the example of the pharmaceutical industry it demonstrates which stakeholders affect the development of a product innovation. For the first time, stakeholders, business relationships and knowledge flows are analyzed at each stage of the product innovation process. The study proves that during the innovation process different stakeholders - other than the often analyzed customers and suppliers - play a crucial role for the foreign subsidiary. Above that, the book depicts the sophisticated structures and processes that MNCs in the pharmaceutical industry have established to transfer the newly created product innovations within their companies. The book addresses researchers and students in the fields of International, Strategic or Innovation Management that are interested in inter-organizational and intra-organizational embeddedness and knowledge flows of MNCs. It is also helpful for managers to control product innovation and transfer processes and the related business relationships and knowledge flows.",Business & Economics,394,N/A,0,en

The book draws on sociological perspectives, cultural sociology and gender theory perspectives. It looks at how love and intimacy is experienced differently and intersected by gender, ethnicity, race and sexuality. This book aims to encourage people to understand theories of intimacy, emotions and desire by examining these concepts contemporaneously and cross-culturally. It also explores how love and intimacy is experienced by young people and how it is impacted by age. It looks at its representation in the media and film and focuses on how gender, ethnicity and sexuality offer different perspectives on love and intimacy. The book shows how relationships are impacted by social networking and new technologies and the opportunities and challenges posed by these new platforms for building relationships. Finally, the book examines how intimacy has become commercialised in late capitalism and how that acts to change relationships. The book is written in an accessible way and explores a range of theoretical debates and contemporary research around emotions, which can be useful for undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral study.",Social Science,245,N/A,0,en

"I Love You, But I Hate Your Politics",Jeanne Safer,Biteback Publishing,2019-07-04,"We've all been there – the family dinners turned full-fledged political debates, the awkward chat in the kitchen at work, the difficulty of discussing politics on a first date or even at dinner with a long-time partner. Today's divisive climate – and the seemingly neverending circus of Brexit – has made discussion of current events uncomfortable and often uncivil. So, how exactly do we find ways to reach across the aisle to those whose views we find unpalatable? Psychotherapist and lifetime liberal Jeanne Safer hopes to shed some light on the situation. Combining her professional expertise with personal experience gleaned from over forty years of happy marriage to her stalwart conservative husband Richard Brookhiser, as well as a wealth of interviews with politically mixed couples, Safer offers frank advice for salvaging and strengthening relationships strained by political differences. Part relationship guide, part anthropological study, I Love You, But I Hate Your Politics is a helpful and entertaining how-to for anyone who has felt they are walking on eggshells in these increasingly uncertain times.",Political Science,124,N/A,0,en

Why do we get trapped in negative emotions when it's clear that life is so much fuller and richer when we are free of them?

This highly cited, widely adopted classic is now presented in two volumes: Evidence-based Therapist Contributions, edited by John C. Norcross and Michael J. Lambert; and Evidence-based Therapist Responsiveness, edited by John C. Norcross and Bruce E. Wampold. Each chapter in the two volumes features a specific therapist behavior that improves treatment outcome, or a transdiagnostic patient characteristic by which clinicians can effectively tailor psychotherapy. In addition to updates to existing chapters, the third edition features new chapters on the real relationship, emotional expression, immediacy, therapist self-disclosure, promoting treatment credibility, and adapting therapy to the patient's gender identity and sexual orientation. All chapters provide original meta-analyses, clinical examples, landmark studies, diversity considerations, training implications, and most importantly, research-infused therapeutic practices by distinguished contributors.

We Want to Do More Than Survive,Bettina L. Love,Beacon Press,2019-02-19,"Winner of the 2020 Society of Professors of Education Outstanding Book Award Drawing on personal stories, research, and historical events, an esteemed educator offers a vision of educational justice inspired by the rebellious spirit and methods of abolitionists. Drawing on her life’s work of teaching and researching in urban schools, Bettina Love persuasively argues that educators must teach students about racial violence, oppression, and how to make sustainable change in their communities through radical civic initiatives and movements. She argues that the US educational system is maintained by and profits from the suffering of children of color. Instead of trying to repair a flawed system, educational reformers offer survival tactics in the forms of test-taking skills, acronyms, grit labs, and character education, which Love calls the educational survival complex. To dismantle the educational survival complex and to achieve educational freedom—not merely reform—teachers, parents, and community leaders must approach education with the imagination, determination, boldness, and urgency of an abolitionist. Following in the tradition of activists like Ella Baker, Bayard Rustin, and Fannie Lou Hamer, We Want to Do More Than Survive introduces an alternative to traditional modes of educational reform and expands our ideas of civic engagement and intersectional justice.",Education,202,N/A,0,en

Love in C Minor,Mindy Michele,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2018-05-11,"From the co-writing duo of Mindy Michele comes a tale of small-town charm and backroads trouble. Seventeen-year-old Reagan seems like the perfect small-town girl. Dubbed a saint by her older brother, Lincoln, she serves the community, makes straight A's, attends church, spends her summers working with special needs children, and is a piano playing prodigy. When you're the daughter of the mayor and the police chief in a sleepy Kansas town, toeing the line is easier than the alternative. That is, until her brother's best friend changes the rules. Reagan's been subject to Ridley's antics her entire life. Growing up, he tormented and teased her, but he kept his distance-until now. When Ridley breaks a promise, late night phone calls and secret rendezvous in the haystacks quickly transform into a reckless, all-consuming love. Some promises are meant to be broken. Some secrets will not be contained, and sometimes the consequences we render are more than we can bear.",,376,N/A,0,en

The Art of Dealing With People,Les Giblin,Les Giblin Books,2001-01-01,"What is the one quality that all successful people have in common? They have mastered the art of dealing with people! Let this book show you how to: Achieve your goals Handle the human ego Become a master conversationalist Make others feel good about themselves And much more! Skill with people is the one essential ingredient for success and happiness at home and in business. ""The Art of Dealing With People"" gives you the skills to take your people skills to a level that you never thought possible! Skill in human relations is similar to skill in any other field, in that success depends on understanding and mastering certain basic general principles. You must not only know what to do, but why you're doing it. As far as basic principles are concerned, people are all the same. Yet each individual person you meet is different. If you attempted to learn some gimmick to deal successfully with each separate individual you met, you would be face with a hopeless task. Influencing people is an art, not a gimmick. When you apply gimmicks in a superficial, mechanical manner, you go through the same motions as the person who ""has a way,"" but it doesn't work for you. The purpose of this book is to give you knowledge based upon an understanding of human nature: why people act the way they do. The methods presented in this book have been tested on thousands of people who have attended my human relations seminars. They are not just my pet ideas of how you should deal with people, but ideas that have stood the test of how you must deal with people. That is, if you want to get along with them and get what you want at the same time. Yes, we all want success and happiness. And the day is long past, if it ever existed, when you could achieve these goals by forcing people to give you what you want. And begging is no better, for no one has respect for, or any desire to help, the person who constantly kowtows and literally goes around with his hand out, begging other people to like him. The one successful way to get the things you want from life is to acquire skill in dealing with people. Download now and you will learn how.",Business & Economics,54,N/A,0,en

Clients for Life,"Andrew Sobel, Jagdish Sheth",Simon and Schuster,2001-02-21,"Finally, the book that all professionals frustrated with fleeting client loyalty and relentless price pressure have waited for—the first in-depth, guide to developing lasting client relationships. Millions of people in this country earn their livings by serving clients, and their numbers are growing every day. Unfortunately, far too few develop the skills and strategies needed to rise to the top in a world where clients have almost unlimited access to information and expertise. Clients for Life sets forth a comprehensive framework for how professionals in all fields can develop breakthrough relationships with their clients and enjoy enduring client loyalty. Supported by more than 100 case studies and wisdom gleaned from interviews with dozens of leading CEOs and prominent business advisors, Clients for Life identifies what clients really want and lays out the core qualities that distinguish the client advisor—an irreplaceable resource—from the expert for hire, a tradable commodity. Readers will learn, for example, to develop selfless independence, which tempers complete emotional, intellectual, and financial independence with a powerful commitment to client needs; to become deep generalists and overcome the narrow perspective caused by specialization; to systematically build lifelong trust; and to cultivate the power of synthesis—big-picture thinking—that is so highly valued by clients. Portraits of history's most famously successful advisors, including Machiavelli, Sir Thomas More, and J. P. Morgan, underscore these timeless qualities that modern professionals need to develop to excel in today's competitive environment.",Business & Economics,269,4,1,en

Political Emotions,Martha C. Nussbaum,Harvard University Press,2013-10-01,"How can we achieve and sustain a ""decent"" liberal society, one that aspires to justice and equal opportunity for all and inspires individuals to sacrifice for the common good? In this book, a continuation of her explorations of emotions and the nature of social justice, Martha Nussbaum makes the case for love. Amid the fears, resentments, and competitive concerns that are endemic even to good societies, public emotions rooted in love—in intense attachments to things outside our control—can foster commitment to shared goals and keep at bay the forces of disgust and envy. Great democratic leaders, including Abraham Lincoln, Mohandas Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr., have understood the importance of cultivating emotions. But people attached to liberalism sometimes assume that a theory of public sentiments would run afoul of commitments to freedom and autonomy. Calling into question this perspective, Nussbaum investigates historical proposals for a public ""civil religion"" or ""religion of humanity"" by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Auguste Comte, John Stuart Mill, and Rabindranath Tagore. She offers an account of how a decent society can use resources inherent in human psychology, while limiting the damage done by the darker side of our personalities. And finally she explores the cultivation of emotions that support justice in examples drawn from literature, song, political rhetoric, festivals, memorials, and even the design of public parks. ""Love is what gives respect for humanity its life,"" Nussbaum writes, ""making it more than a shell."" Political Emotionsis a challenging and ambitious contribution to political philosophy.",Philosophy,461,N/A,0,en

Positive Approaches to Optimal Relationship Development,"C. Raymond Knee, Harry T. Reis",N/A,2016,"""How can we get the most out of our close relationships? Research in the area of personal relationships continues to grow, but most prior work has emphasized how to overcome negative aspects. This volume demonstrates that a good relationship is more than simply the absence of a bad relationship, and that establishing and maintaining optimal relationships entails enacting a set of processes that are distinct from merely avoiding negative or harmful behaviors. Drawing on recent relationship science to explore issues such as intimacy, attachment, passion, sacrifice, and compassionate goals, the essays in this volume emphasize the positive features that allow relationships to flourish. In doing so, they integrate several theoretical perspectives, concepts, and mechanisms that produce optimal relationships. The volume also includes a section on intensive and abbreviated interventions that have been empirically validated to be effective in promoting the positive features of close relationships""--",PSYCHOLOGY,0,N/A,0,en

Love creates life, sustains life and transforms life and one has to experience all this, without which life has no meaning. The protogonist of this story, Sanjay, is the only son of a middle-class family in Chennai. He is studious and intelligent and is living a dream life, topping in his board examinations, studying at IIT and getting to the magical paradise of America for a bright future. The only thing that has eluded him in this journey is true love, for which he craves and when he thinks he has met the woman of his dreams and he has everything in life, his world collapses, as he is condemned as an introvert, predictable and a boring guy and his partner leaves him. That changes his life forever and he becomes depressed. He heads back to his hometown, a decision that makes him understand the tough realities of life. Now having returned from America, Sanjay finds himself mercilessly condemned and ridiculed by his own fellowmen. The mentality of the people pushes him into further depression and he becomes a recluse. That's when an angel walks into his life, transforms him and leads him to all the good things in life.

How to Be Love(d),Humble the Poet,"Hay House, Inc",2023-12-26,"""We all want love. Everything we do is in pursuit of it. But as we count likes on social media and measure our worth by the numbers in our bank accounts, we are programmed to see love as something to earn or win.

With short chapters filled with insight, advice, and personal anecdotes from Humble's own journey, this book is a guide to self-love that helps clarify your path inward toward the inherent love and value that is within each of us.

The 5 Love Languages/Things I Wish I'd Known Before We Got Married Set,Gary Chapman,Moody Publishers,2014-12-11,"This set includes The Five Love Languages and Things I Wish I'd Known Before We Got Married. In The Five Love Languages, #1 New York Times bestselling author Dr. Gary Chapman guides couples in identifying, understanding, and speaking their spouse’s primary love language—quality time, words of affirmation, gifts, acts of service, or physical touch. By learning the five love languages, you and your spouse will discover your unique love languages and learn practical steps in truly loving each other. Chapters are categorized by love language for easy reference, and each one ends with simple steps to express a specific language to your spouse and guide your marriage in the right direction. A newly designed love languages assessment will help you understand and strengthen your relationship. You can build a lasting, loving marriage together. In Things I Wish I'd Known Before We Got Married, the author writes, “Most people spend far more time in preparation for their vocation than they do in preparation for marriage.” No wonder the divorce rate hovers around fifty percent. Bestselling author and marriage counselor Gary Chapman hopes to change that with his newest book. Gary, with more than 35 years of experience counseling couples, believes that divorce is the lack of preparation for marriage and the failure to learn the skills of working together as intimate teammates. So he put together this practical little book, packed with wisdom and tips that will help many develop the loving, supportive and mutually beneficial marriage men and women long for. It’s the type of information Gary himself wished he had before he got married. The material lends itself to heart-felt discussions by dating or engaged couples. To jump-start the exchanges, each short chapter includes insightful “Talking it Over” questions and suggestions. And, the book includes information on interactivewebsites as well as books that will enhance the couples experience. Dr. Chapman even includes a thought-provoking appendix. By understanding and balancing the five key aspects of life, dating couples can experience a healthy relationship. A revealing learning exercise is included at the end.",Religion,219,N/A,0,en
How to Fall in Love with Anyone,Mandy Len Catron,Simon and Schuster,2017-06-27,"“A beautifully written and well-researched cultural criticism as well as an honest memoir” (Los Angeles Review of Books) from the author of the popular New York Times essay, “To Fall in Love with Anyone, Do This,” explores the romantic myths we create and explains how they limit our ability to achieve and sustain intimacy. What really makes love last? Does love ever work the way we say it does in movies and books and Facebook posts? Or does obsessing over those love stories hurt our real-life relationships? When her parents divorced after a twenty-eight year marriage and her own ten-year relationship ended, those were the questions that Mandy Len Catron wanted to answer. In a series of candid, vulnerable, and wise essays that takes a closer look at what it means to love someone, be loved, and how we present our love to the world, “Catron melds science and emotion beautifully into a thoughtful and thought-provoking meditation” (Bookpage). She delves back to 1944, when her grandparents met in a coal mining town in Appalachia, to her own dating life as a professor in Vancouver. She uses biologists’ research into dopamine triggers to ask whether the need to love is an innate human drive. She uses literary theory to show why we prefer certain kinds of love stories. She urges us to question the unwritten scripts we follow in relationships and looks into where those scripts come from. And she tells the story of how she decided to test an experiment that she’d read about—where the goal was to create intimacy between strangers using a list of thirty-six questions—and ended up in the surreal situation of having millions of people following her brand-new relationship. “Perfect fodder for the romantic and the cynic in all of us” (Booklist), How to Fall in Love with Anyone flips the script on love. “Clear-eyed and full of heart, it is mandatory reading for anyone coping with—or curious about—the challenges of contemporary courtship” (The Toronto Star).",Family & Relationships,211,N/A,0,en
Family-Peer Relationships,"Ross D. Parke, Gary W.

Considerable work in the past had focused on family issues or peer relationships, but these systems had typically been considered separately. This volume bridges the gap across these two important socialization contexts and provides insights into the processes that account for the links across the systems – the ways in which the relationships between these systems shift across development. In addition, the variations in the links between family and peers are illustrated by cross-cultural work, studies of abused children, and research on the impact of maternal depression. In short, the volume provides not only a convenient overview of recent progress at the time but lays out an agenda for future research.",Psychology,508,N/A,0,en

Conflict and Decision Making in Close Relationships,"Erich Kirchler, Christa Rodler, Erik Holzl, Katja Meier",Psychology Press,2013-01-11,"Love and money are important aspects of the everyday lives of couples. This book focuses on the daily routines of disagreement, conflict and joint decisions on these, and other issues such as work, leisure and children, create in the household. Central to the authors' research is a unique diary study of forty couples, who kept a daily record of their joint decisions over the course of a year. The diaries show how challenging, varied and complex the conflicts and decision making of normal everyday life can be and reveal that goals frequently change during the decision-making process with the result that the final outcome often achieves a goal distinct from the original intention. Furthermore, the dynamics of decision making differ according to the problem at stake, the decision-making history of the couple, and the quality of the partnership. The results of the diary study are discussed within the overall context of current research in the field as a whole, including discussion of joint decision-making case studies, close relationships, decision-making research in general and special research methods. Numerous results of psychological, sociological, economic and consumer behaviour studies are summarised and integrated into a model of household decision-making. This book will be primarily of interest to students and researchers in social psychology and economic psychology, but its interdisciplinary and applied nature will also make it of relevance to professionals working in the fields of family therapy and consumer behaviour.",Psychology,274,N/A,0,en

Building on the principles that he first introduced in Feeling Good (over 4 million copies sold), Burns offers innovative techniques designed to improve communication skills and shows us how to cope with different personality types, such as the big ego, the jealous type, the stubborn mule and the critic, and reveals the five secrets of effective communication.

"What Shamu Taught Me About Life, Love, and Marriage",Amy Sutherland,Random House,2008-02-12,"While observing exotic animal trainers for her acclaimed book Kicked, Bitten, and Scratched, journalist Amy Sutherland had an epiphany: What if she used these training techniques with the human animals in her own life–namely her dear husband, Scott? In this lively and perceptive book, Sutherland tells how she took the trainers’ lessons home. The next time her forgetful husband stomped through the house in search of his mislaid car keys, she asked herself, “What would a dolphin trainer do?” The answer was: nothing. Trainers reward the behavior they want and, just as important, ignore the behavior they don’t. Rather than appease her mate’s rising temper by joining in the search, or fuel his temper by nagging him to keep better track of his things in the first place, Sutherland kept her mouth shut and her eyes on the dishes she was washing. In short order, Scott found his keys and regained his cool. “I felt like I should throw him a mackerel,” she writes. In time, as she put more training principles into action, she noticed that she became more optimistic and less judgmental, and their twelve-year marriage was better than ever. What started as a goofy experiment had such good results that Sutherland began using the training techniques with all the people in her life, including her mother, her friends, her students, even the clerk at the post office. In the end, the biggest lesson she learned is that the only animal you can truly change is yourself. Full of fun facts, fascinating insights, hilarious anecdotes, and practical tips, What Shamu Taught Me About Life, Love, and Marriage describes Sutherland’s Alice-in-Wonderland experience of stumbling into a world where cheetahs walk nicely on leashes and elephants paint with watercolors, and of leaving a new, improved Homo sapiens.",Self-Help,194,4,3,en

The Nature of Love and Relationships,"Tom Omidi, Ph.d., Tom Omidi Ph D",CreateSpace,2012-01-12,"Description: The Nature of Love and Relationships studies the fast-deteriorating situation of relationships in modern societies with the objective of finding practical solutions. It is a comprehensive book about man/women relationships that is developed based on scientific facts, but written in a simple language for the general public. Contrary to the present approach to address the symptoms of relationship conflicts, this book explores the deep-rooted problems of relationships as a pandemic. It is written for the understanding of the general public, although the discussions are based on scientific methodologies and analyses. The table of content and preliminary pages of this book show the main theme and the structure of the book. Every chapter contains many innovative and educational ideas about relationships while couples' limitations to relate are explained in great detail. In a nutshell, the book studies the main issues of relationships in an easy-to-understand scientific structure. To reverse the frightening trends in relationships, radical changes are needed in terms of both people's mindset and social mechanisms. This book is the product of the author's research, expertise, and efforts to save his own marriage during the last fifteen years. The book contains around 135,000 words and over thirty-five simple diagrams and tables. Synopsis: Over the last few decades, we have developed wrong perceptions about the nature of love and the purpose of relationships. With drastic changes in social values and lifestyles, our expectations from relationships have skyrocketed in line with our escalating personal aspirations. But all these idealistic needs have only led to more distress for everybody. The rising divorce rate and endless family conflicts reflect the hectic environment of relationships. These facts also reveal that our present methods of dealing with relationship hurdles have failed. While focusing on the symptoms of relationship failures, we have ignored the roots of the problems as a social pandemic. So, it is time now to analyse the real sources of problems and face up to the high complexity of relationships in new societies. It appears that we need radical solutions compatible with our new social values and expanding personal needs. A main goal of this book is to help couples review their mentality about the capacity and purpose of relationships. Another objective is to suggest a framework that can assist couples assess their relationships more realistically. Too many relationships are ruined nowadays due to partners' biased judgments and hasty decisions. The ultimate goal of this book is to bring objectivity back into relationships. At the very least, it is time to appreciate the need for viewing relationships in a new light consistent with the characteristics of new lifestyles. Instead of searching all our lives for a soul mate and an ideal relationship, we must find a way to relate more effectively, while strengthening our identity and individualism too.",Family & Relationships,562,N/A,0,en

Special Relationships in World Politics,Kristin Haugevik,Routledge,2018-09-03,"Claims of inter-state ‘specialness’ are commonplace in international politics. But how do some relationships between states come to be seen and categorized as ‘special’ in the first place? And what impact, if any, do recurring public representations of specialness have on states’ political and diplomatic interaction? While much scholarly work exists on alleged instances of special relationships, and on inter-state cooperation and alliances more generally, little systematic and theory informed research has been conducted on how special relationships evolve and unfold in practice. This book offers such a comprehensive study. Theorizing inter-state relations as ongoing social processes, it makes the case for approaching special relationships as constituted and upheld through linguistic representations and bilateral interaction practices. Haugevik explores this claim through an in-depth study of how the bilateral relationship most frequently referred to as ‘special’ – the US-British – has unfolded over the last seventy years. This analysis is complemented with a study of Britain’s relationship with a more junior partner, Norway, during the same period. The book offers an original take on inter-state relations and diplomacy during the Cold War and after, and develops an analytical framework for understanding why some state relationships maintain their status as ‘special’, while others end up as ‘benignly neglected’ ones.",Political Science,233,N/A,0,en

Partnering with the Frenemy,Sandy Jap,FT Press,2015-11-28,"Selected as a finalist for the 2018 Leonard L. Berry Marketing Book Award! Why do crucial business partnerships and alliances fail so often and how can you keep it from happening to you? Partnering with the Frenemy answers these questions, helping you anticipate, prevent, and solve the problems that lead close business relationships to implode. Drawing on cutting-edge research, Sandy Jap illuminates the widespread “frenemy” phenomenon in organizational partnerships, where partners who start as non-competitive “friends” become “enemies” over time. She identifies key economical and structural causes of “frenemization,” in which success creates imbalances in power dynamics, leading partners to generate resentment, contempt, and often direct competition. She also illuminates crucial social causes for partnership failure, where seemingly innocuous acts of interpersonal opportunism and “sins of omission” gradually poison collaboration. To support her insights, she offers numerous case studies, both ongoing and historical, including Samsung/Google, Martha Stewart/Macy’s, Oracle/Sun Microsystems, Best Buy/Apple, Calvin Klein/Warnaco, and Nike/Footlocker. Most important, she offers specific recommendations for avoiding problems, revitalizing weakening partnerships, and recognizing when a partnership can’t be saved.

Incorporation of Environmental Features in Flood Control Channel Projects,"Nelson R. Nunnally, F.

Environmental features are defined as any structures or actions employed in the planning, design, construction, or maintenance of flood control channels that produce environmental benefits. Environmental features may include modifications of standard techniques, such as selective clearing and snagging or single bank construction; modified channel designs, such as low flow channels, pools and riffles, and meandering alignments; structures for erosion and sediment control, water level management, and instream habitat; inclusion of recreational features in project design; and special designs and treatments for aesthetic purposes. Procedures are presented for the design of environmental features. These procedures are based largely on prior experience with the use of environmental features on modified channels and on fluvial processes and natural stream geometry. Tables are provided to help select the best environmental features based on environmental objectives and stream and watershed conditions.",Aquatic ecology,288,N/A,0,en
Exploring Family Relationships With Other Social Contexts,"Ross D. Parke, Sheppard G. Kellam",Routledge,2013-07-04,"In the 1990s it is no longer ""news"" that families do not operate independently from other social organizations and institutions. Instead, it is generally recognized that families are embedded in a complex set of relationships with other institutions and contexts outside the family. In spite of this recognition, a great deal remains to be discovered about the ways in which families are influenced by these outside agencies or how families influence the functioning of children and adults in these extra-familial settings--school, work, day-care, or peer group contexts. Moreover, little is known about the nature of the processes that account for this mutual influence between families and other societal institutions and settings. The goal of this volume is to present examples from a series of ongoing research programs that are beginning to provide some tentative answers to these questions. The result of a summer workshop characterized by lively exchanges not only between speakers and the audience, but among participants in small group discussions as well, this volume attempts to communicate some of the dynamism and excitement that was evident at the conference. In the final analysis, this book should stimulate further theoretical and empirical advances in understanding how families relate to other contexts.",Psychology,290,N/A,0,en

The Art of Love,"Bud Harris, Massimilla Harris",Fisher King Press,2010-05,"Are you:-- seeking to renew a relationship? -- considering a new relationship? -- troubled with establishing a long-term relationship? -- divorced and trying to understand why your marriage failed? -- experiencing problems in love, romance, sex, intimacy or marriage? -- a therapist or counselor who would like to provide an accessible resource for your clients? -- Millions of books on relationships have been printed over the years. Why do we need another? We need The Art of Love: The Craft of Relationship for the same reasons that over four and a half million readers wanted Spencer Johnson's Who Moved My Cheese. Following Johnson's methods of teaching to a broad, modern audience, The Art of Love: The Craft of Relationship presents the profound principles that form a loving relationship in an easily accessible manner. Using a very simple approach, it will help people shift their attitudes and provide them with the skills to create loving, long-lasting partnerships. There are so many titles in print on change because it is an ongoing challenge for most of us. So are relationships. With more than six decades of experience working with couples, we knew we had vital information, lessons, and insights to share, but we insisted that the book be short, engaging, and easy to read. A helpful book does not have to be dense to be packed with wisdom, skills, and ideas that can open the door to a new era of fulfilling relationships. We have brought complex material and common sense into a format that is carefully constructed to achieve results by being communicative and consistent, enjoyable and hopeful. Unlike the textbook appearance of most self-help books that include psychological jargon, case examples and exercises, The Art of Love: The Craft of Relationship uses stories and dialogue to teach profound insights and valuable skills. It sticks to people talking in a way the reader can identify with and understand. It brings hope because the reader who is experiencing stress in a relationship can see that other people, like them, are, too. And, that learning a few basic skills can bring lasting change and renew love. The best news is that our book will be useful to many people because it will give them a new way to look at their relationship and the skills to handle problem after problem in a way that builds love and trust. Our mission is to appeal strongly to those who are considering a relationship, seeking to renew one, or are looking for a way to understand a partner and a process for dealing with problems in love, romance, sex, intimacy and living together.",Self-Help,152,N/A,0,en

Why not use science to help us improve our relationships? In this revolutionary book, psychiatrist and neuroscientist Dr. Amir Levine and Rachel Heller scientifically explain why some people seem to navigate relationships effortlessly, while others struggle. Discover how an understanding of adult attachment—the most advanced relationship science in existence today—can help us find and sustain love. Pioneered by psychologist John Bowlby in the 1950s, the field of attachment posits that each of us behaves in relationships in one of three distinct ways: • Anxious people are often preoccupied with their relationships and tend to worry about their partner's ability to love them back. • Avoidant people equate intimacy with a loss of independence and constantly try to minimize closeness. • Secure people feel comfortable with intimacy and are usually warm and loving. Attached guides readers in determining what attachment style they and their mate (or potential mate) follow, offering a road map for building stronger, more fulfilling connections with the people they love.",Family & Relationships,305,N/A,0,en
Socrates in Love,Armand D’Angour,Bloomsbury Publishing,2019-03-07,"An innovative and insightful exploration of the passionate early life of Socrates and the influences that led him to become the first and greatest of philosophers Socrates: the philosopher whose questioning gave birth to the ideas of Western thought, and whose execution marked the end of the Athenian Golden Age. Yet despite his pre-eminence among the great thinkers of history, little of his life story is known. What we know tends to begin in his middle age and end with his trial and death. Our conception of Socrates has relied upon Plato and Xenophon – men who met him when he was in his fifties and a well-known figure in war-torn Athens. There is mystery at the heart of Socrates' story: what turned the young Socrates into a philosopher? What drove him to pursue with such persistence, at the cost of social acceptance and ultimately of his life, a whole new way of thinking about the meaning of existence? In this revisionist biography, Armand D'Angour draws on neglected sources to explore the passions and motivations of young Socrates, showing how love transformed him into the philosopher he was to become. What emerges is the figure of Socrates as never previously portrayed: a heroic warrior, an athletic wrestler and dancer – and a passionate lover. Socrates in Love sheds new light on the formative journey of the philosopher, finally revealing the identity of the woman who Socrates claimed inspired him to develop ideas that have captivated thinkers for 2,500 years.",History,273,N/A,0,en

Lesbian Love Addiction,Lauren D. Costine,Rowman & Littlefield,2015-11-05,"Everyone makes mistakes in relationships at one time or another. Sometimes they learn from those mistakes. Other times, they return to those behaviors and cycle through failed relationship after failed relationship. Sometimes those behaviors become an addiction to love that may leave a person feeling unhappy, unfulfilled, lonely, or worse. Lesbian Love Addiction: Understanding the Urge to Merge and How to Heal When Things go Wrong makes visible the elements of love addiction that many lesbians suffer from. Love addiction for lesbians comes in many forms. Some struggle by sexually acting out and others are serial relationship junkies, jumping from one relationship into the next. Some are addicted to the high of falling in love and once that wears off don’t know how to handle the day-to-day realities of a committed relationship. Some are even addicted to fantasy and intrigue, while others are love avoidants and sexual anorexics. Love avoidants may be able to get into a relationship but once they are fully committed, struggle with feeling smothered. Others may avoid intimate or sexual relationships all together, becoming sexually anorexic. Some may even vacillate between all of these. The underlying component and common denominator in all of these scenarios is the “Urge to Merge.” Lesbian Love Addiction is designed to help ameliorate at least part of this problem. Lauren D. Costine offers insight for lesbians, bisexual women in relationships with women, queer women, and more specifically, any woman who loves women, as well as their family and friends, and health care professionals, into the psychology of lesbian love addiction. It will give those who struggle with and suffer from love addiction ways to understand, cope, and heal from this debilitating addiction. It will give those who work with this population new tools to use to do this more effectively. Mostly, it will help lesbians understand their relationship failures and how to heal from problems associated with them, so they may grow and cultivate happier, more fulfilling connections in the future.",Psychology,185,N/A,0,en

Walters,Jones & Bartlett Publishers,2014,"Surveys administered to high school students, studies carried out on jail and prison inmates, and interviews conducted with substance abusers undergoing treatment all point to the same conclusion: drugs and crime are strongly connected. Why they are connected is less well understood, however. Written for middle to upper-level undergraduate courses on drugs and crime or substance abuse and crime, this book examines the drug-crime connection in a systematic and comprehensive way. This book covers the entire drug-crime spectrum, starting with a review of drug and crime terminology, classification and theory, and ending with policy implications for prevention, harm reduction, and macro-level management of the drug-crime problem. The opening chapters discuss drugs and crime separately for the purpose of setting the stage for later discussions on drug-crime relationships. As the book proceeds, the boundaries between drugs and crime blur, thus revealing the complex and intimate relationship that links these two behaviors.",Crime prevention,500,N/A,0,en

These Are Love(D) Letters,Ames Hawkins,Wayne State University Press,2019-10-15,"Intimate and unwavering exploration of love, loss, and the queer possibilities inherent in artistic aspiration. Ames Hawkins's These are Love(d) Letters is a genre-bending visual memoir and work of literary nonfiction that explores the questions: What inspires a person to write a love letter? What inspires a person to save a love letter even when the love has shifted or left? And what does it mean when a person uses someone else's love letters as a place from which to create their own sense of self? Beginning with the ""simple act"" of the author receiving twenty letters written by her father to her mother over a six-week period in 1966, These are Love(d) Letters provides a complex pictorial and textual exploration of the work of the love letter. Through intimate and incisive prose—the letters were, after all, always intended to be a private dialogue between her parents—Hawkins weaves her own struggles with gender, sexuality, and artistic awakening in relation to the story of her parents' marriage that ended in divorce. Her father's HIV diagnosis and death by complications related to AIDS provide the context for an unflinchingly honest look at bodily disease and mortality. Hawkins delicately and relentlessly explores the tensions in a father-daughter relationship that stem from a differently situated connection to queer identity and a shared struggle with artistic desire. In communion with queer and lesbian writers from Emily Dickinson and Virginia Woolf to Alison Bechdel and Maggie Nelson, Hawkins pushes exploration of the self with the same intellectual rigor that she critiques the limits of epistolarity by continually relocating all the generative and arresting creative powers of this found art with scholarly rhetorical strategies. Exquisitely designed by Jessica Jacobs, These are Love(d) Letters presents an affective experience that reinforces Hawkins's meditations on the ephemeral beauty of love letters. As poetic as it is visually enticing, the book offers both an unconventional and queer(ed) understanding of the documentarian form, which will excite both readers and artists across and beyond genres.",Literary Collections,297,N/A,0,en

Semiprecious,D. Anne Love,Simon and Schuster,2009-10-20,"It's the middle of summer in Mirabeau, Texas, but already Garnet Hubbard looks forward to fall -- to entering seventh grade and becoming a teenager at last. With Opal, her beautiful and popular fourteen-year-old sister, as her guide, Garnet is sure to have a great year. But everything changes when their mother, Melanie, packs them up and heads for Nashville, determined to fulfill her lifelong dream of becoming a country singer. Almost before they know it, Melanie drops the girls at her sister's house in Oklahoma, assuring them she'll be back just as soon as she's settled in Tennessee. But when a few days turn into a few weeks and beyond, with no Melanie in sight, the girls begin to realize what has happened. While Opal soon becomes one of the most popular girls in school, her younger sister struggles. For Garnet, getting used to her new life means trying to figure out how to have pride in herself when it seems she has little to offer the world and the odds are stacked against her. With only each other to lean on, Melanie's ""precious gems"" must learn to live with the hand they've been dealt and to accept the changing face of their family.

This book offers straightforward tools for developing deeper intimacy in our relationships."" -Lesley Ann Warren, Academy-Award nominated actress We are not born knowing how to do relationships - we have to learn. We have to learn about ourselves and our own reactions so we can translate that self-knowledge into positive action in a relationship. The ""issues"" that arise in every relationship are not ""problems"" that must be avoided. They alert us that we have the opportunity to increase our understanding of ourselves and others. Never having been schooled in the world of emotions, it is easy to feel frightened and overwhelmed when we run into an experience we do not understand and do not know how to handle. We mistakenly think these learning opportunities are ""problems."" We think something is wrong, either with our own Self or with the Other. Relationships are the school for our adult developmental task to deepen our knowledge about ourselves and about emotions. Without this knowledge, we feel desperate and hopeless, misinterpreting ignorance as failure. The information in Love Now! is so powerful that readers can immediately begin to step away from the caustic snare of angry accusations and raging arguments. Love Now! gets to the root of the issues in relationships. Real change requires that we not only know something, but that we become it. Love Now! guides the reader to deep internalization of concepts that can lead to transformation, not just behavioral change and adaptation",,0,N/A,0,en

Dialogue on the Infinity of Love,Tullia d'Aragona,University of Chicago Press,2007-11-01,"Celebrated as a courtesan and poet, and as a woman of great intelligence and wit, Tullia d'Aragona (1510–56) entered the debate about the morality of love that engaged the best and most famous male intellects of sixteenth-century Italy. First published in Venice in 1547, but never before published in English, Dialogue on the Infinity of Love casts a woman rather than a man as the main disputant on the ethics of love. Sexually liberated and financially independent, Tullia d'Aragona dared to argue that the only moral form of love between woman and man is one that recognizes both the sensual and the spiritual needs of humankind. Declaring sexual drives to be fundamentally irrepressible and blameless, she challenged the Platonic and religious orthodoxy of her time, which condemned all forms of sensual experience, denied the rationality of women, and relegated femininity to the realm of physicality and sin. Human beings, she argued, consist of body and soul, sense and intellect, and honorable love must be based on this real nature. By exposing the intrinsic misogyny of prevailing theories of love, Aragona vindicates all women, proposing a morality of love that restores them to intellectual and sexual parity with men. Through Aragona's sharp reasoning, her sense of irony and humor, and her renowned linguistic skill, a rare picture unfolds of an intelligent and thoughtful woman fighting sixteenth-century stereotypes of women and sexuality.",Social Science,120,N/A,0,en

The Relationship Handbook,"George S. Pransky, Dr George Pransky Ph D",Wiley-Blackwell,2014-03,"When couples go to a marriage counselor there are three possible outcomes: (1) they get a fresh start, (2) they stay together and ""cope with"" a tense or sour marriage, or (3) they separate. Every couple wants the first outcome. They want to have a fresh start and be happy together. If they can't get a fresh start, they will jump to the third choice-separation-because they don't want the second. They have already been coping and are tired of it. Problems and adversity are not the crux of marital discord. All couples face adversity, but it doesn't cause problems for harmonious couples. Couples with satisfying marriages don't ""cope"" with their lives and with each other. They don't work on their marriages. The strength of their marriages lies not in their ability to cope with their problems, but in their ability to keep their bearings and to stay close.

Talk to Me Like I'm Someone You Love,"Nancy Dreyfus, Psy.D.",Penguin,2009-12-24,"“The most crucial relationship advice book since Men Are from Mars.”—Erin Meanley, Glamour.com A groundbreaking, interactive relationship tool that literally places in the hands of couples the power to transform chronically frustrating relationship dynamics. We've all been there. A conversation with a loved one escalates into conflict. Voices rise to a fever pitch and angry, accusative words fly through the air. At times like these, it seems impossible to find the magic words that will lead to healing. Enter Talk to Me Like I'm Someone You Love. A psychotherapist with decades of experience in counseling couples, Nancy Dreyfus hit upon the revolutionary practice outlined in this book during a couples-therapy session in which a wife’s unrelenting criticism of her husband was causing him to become emotionally withdrawn. In the midst of this, Dreyfus found herself scribbling on a scrap of paper, “Talk to me like I'm someone you love,” and gestured to the husband that he should hold it up. He did and within seconds the familiar power differential between the two shifted, and a gentler, more genuine connection emerged. Dreyfus was startled, then intrigued, and then motivated to create a tool that could help others. This book features more than one hundred of Dreyfus's ""flash cards for real life,"" written statements that express what we wish we could communicate to the person we love, but either can't find the right words or the right tone in which to say it. The statements include: • Taking responsibility: ""I realize I'm overreacting. Can you give me a minute to get sane again?"" • Apologizing: ""I know I've really hurt you. What can I do to help you trust me again?"" • Loving: ""You are precious, and I get that I haven't been treating you like you are.""

Resonance,Hartmut Rosa,John Wiley & Sons,2019-07-26,"The pace of modern life is undoubtedly speeding up, yet this acceleration does not seem to have made us any happier or more content. If acceleration is the problem, then the solution, argues Hartmut Rosa in this major new work, lies in “resonance.” The quality of a human life cannot be measured simply in terms of resources, options, and moments of happiness; instead, we must consider our relationship to, or resonance with, the world. Applying his theory of resonance to many domains of human activity, Rosa describes the full spectrum of ways in which we establish our relationship to the world, from the act of breathing to the adoption of culturally distinct worldviews. He then turns to the realms of concrete experience and action – family and politics, work and sports, religion and art – in which we as late modern subjects seek out resonance. This task is proving ever more difficult as modernity’s logic of escalation is both cause and consequence of a distorted relationship to the world, at individual and collective levels. As Rosa shows, all the great crises of modern society – the environmental crisis, the crisis of democracy, the psychological crisis – can also be understood and analyzed in terms of resonance and our broken relationship to the world around us. Building on his now classic work on acceleration, Rosa’s new book is a major new contribution to the theory of modernity, showing how our problematic relation to the world is at the crux of some of the most pressing issues we face today. This bold renewal of critical theory for our times will be of great interest to students and scholars across the social sciences and humanities.",Social Science,551,N/A,0,en

Why Love Hurts,Eva Illouz,John Wiley & Sons,2013-05-20,"Few of us have been spared the agonies of intimate relationships. They come in many shapes: loving a man or a woman who will not commit to us, being heartbroken when we're abandoned by a lover, engaging in Sisyphean internet searches, coming back lonely from bars, parties, or blind dates, feeling bored in a relationship that is so much less than we had envisaged - these are only some of the ways in which the search for love is a difficult and often painful experience. Despite the widespread and almost collective character of these experiences, our culture insists they are the result of faulty or insufficiently mature psyches. For many, the Freudian idea that the family designs the pattern of an individual's erotic career has been the main explanation for why and how we fail to find or sustain love. Psychoanalysis and popular psychology have succeeded spectacularly in convincing us that individuals bear responsibility for the misery of their romantic and erotic lives. The purpose of this book is to change our way of thinking about what is wrong in modern relationships. The problem is not dysfunctional childhoods or insufficiently self-aware psyches, but rather the institutional forces shaping how we love. The argument of this book is that the modern romantic experience is shaped by a fundamental transformation in the ecology and architecture of romantic choice. The samples from which men and women choose a partner, the modes of evaluating prospective partners, the very importance of choice and autonomy and what people imagine to be the spectrum of their choices: all these aspects of choice have transformed the very core of the will, how we want a partner, the sense of worth bestowed by relationships, and the organization of desire. This book does to love what Marx did to commodities: it shows that it is shaped by social relations and institutions and that it circulates in a marketplace of unequal actors.",Social Science,191,5,1,en

Why Siblings Matter,"Naomi White, Claire Hughes",Routledge,2017-10-02,"Many people grow up with at least one sibling. These siblings are often ‘fellow travellers’ through adversity or significant life events; they can act as a source of support for some children while a source of conflict for others. For these reasons, siblings are a potentially powerful influence on development and this book is one of the first of its kind to provide an overview of cutting-edge psychological research on this important relationship. Why Siblings Matter is a cornerstone text on siblinghood. Integrating findings from a 10 year longitudinal study alongside wider research, it provides a lifespan perspective examining the impact of sibling relationships on children’s development and well-being. This text situates siblings in their historical, developmental and family context, considers the influence of siblings on children’s development and adjustment, and provides an introduction to new research on siblings in diverse contexts. The authors discuss sibling relationships in varied populations such as siblings with disabilities, siblings in different cultures and siblings in non-traditional families, while also considering the practical implications of research. Covering both classical studies and new results this book offers take-home messages for promoting positive sibling interactions.

"""I Love Learning; I Hate School""",Susan D. Blum,Cornell University Press,2016-01-13,"Frustrated by her students’ performance, her relationships with them, and her own daughter’s problems in school, Susan D. Blum, a professor of anthropology, set out to understand why her students found their educational experience at a top-tier institution so profoundly difficult and unsatisfying. Through her research and in conversations with her students, she discovered a troubling mismatch between the goals of the university and the needs of students. In ""I Love Learning; I Hate School,"" Blum tells two intertwined but inseparable stories: the results of her research into how students learn contrasted with the way conventional education works, and the personal narrative of how she herself was transformed by this understanding. Blum concludes that the dominant forms of higher education do not match the myriad forms of learning that help students—people in general—master meaningful and worthwhile skills and knowledge. Students are capable of learning huge amounts, but the ways higher education is structured often leads them to fail to learn. More than that, it leads to ill effects. In this critique of higher education, infused with anthropological insights, Blum explains why so much is going wrong and offers suggestions for how to bring classroom learning more in line with appropriate forms of engagement. She challenges our system of education and argues for a ""reintegration of learning with life.""",Education,356,N/A,0,en

Receiving Love,"Harville Hendrix, Helen LaKelly Hunt",Simon and Schuster,2004-10-05,"From the New York Times bestselling author of Getting the Love You Want and Keeping the Love You Find comes illuminating and inspiring advice on one of the most complicated issues facing couples today: receiving love. Many people know how to give love, but many more undermine their relationships by never having learned how to accept it. We don't always realize the ways in which we reject appreciation, affection, help, and guidance from our romantic partners. According to Hendrix and Hunt, until we are able to understand the meaning behind our behavior, our relationships stand to suffer. Receiving Love prompts questions such as: -Are you reluctant to tell your partner what you really want or need? -When you do get what you've asked for, do you still feel dissatisfied? -Is it difficult for you to accept kind gestures, gifts, or compliments from your partner? With Receiving Love, you can learn how to break the shackles of self-rejection and embrace real intimacy. Drawing on their renowned expertise, the wide clinical experience of Imago therapists, and their own personal experience as a married couple, the authors offer detailed, sensitive advice on how to turn a relationship between two well-meaning yet misunderstood individuals into a true, everlasting partnership.",Psychology,321,4,2,en

With essays based on new findings from this original research and written by renowned positive psychologists and public figures, this important book delves deeply into the neuroscience and psychology of gratitude, and explores how thankfulness can be developed and applied, both personally and in communities large and small, for the benefit of all.

Competence in Interpersonal Conflict,"William R. Cupach, Daniel J. Canary, Brian H. Spitzberg",Waveland Press,2009-11-06,"Extensively updated with expanded and newly added chapters, the second edition of Competence in Interpersonal Conflict continues to present a conceptual framework for why communication competence is central to conflict management. Although no checklist of communication behaviors can guarantee success, the authors offer constructive guidelines that provide a basis for grappling with future conflicts in five unique settings: intercultural, organizational, familial, mediation, and violence in intimate relationships. Within any conflict interaction adept communicators embrace the notion that adopting an ethical stance is both desirable and practical. Conflict between people is a natural feature of the human condition; when people interact and form relationships, conflicts inevitably emerge. How individuals manage conflict, and how they perceive both the opportunities and challenges it provides, will define their interpersonal relationships in more ways than any other kind of interaction behavior. Collaboration and adaptation are the hallmarks of a competent communicator, therefore how partners communicate during conflict can be more important than the frequency of their disagreements.",Language Arts & Disciplines,360,N/A,0,en

Our generation has lost its way. In the fast-paced, instant-gratification world we live in, we've lost our direction. Values provide us direction, leading us to bold new opportunities and life-changing relationships. Values like confidence, faith, courage and hard work are key to living life on your terms. Know this my friend-it's not only about the end goal. It's the journey you take to get there. Because it is the journey that defines us in the end. The Value of You is a journey into the core values that give light to our human experience. Values lead us to interior freedom, peace of mind, happiness and success. Every chapter contains a value that is filled with creative stories of famous people like J.K. Rowling, Simone Biles, Captain Charles ""Sully"" Sullenberger and Amy Schumer, as well as lesser known, yet remarkable heroes such as Dr. Liviu Librescu, Chris Singleton and Welles Crowther. Each value has a description of its core features, as well as obstacles to living the value, results of living the value and a personal game plan with practical guidance to help you make the value your own. We live in an ever-changing world with adversity and challenges. Values are the constant that position us for happiness and success. Values are a way of life.

Life As She Knows It,Ali D Jensen,Independently Published,2021-09-04,"And just like that I decided I was done; done with the ugliness of the world and done existing amongst people who only pretended to love me the way I deserve to be loved. No longer held down by the weight of my life, I find freedom from the monsters that plague my own mind. No longer held down by the abuse of my spouse, I find freedom from the monster in my bed. Finding inner strength I didn't know I had, to break free from the shackles that have kept me prisoner to my own life, I made the decision to get away and let go of the toxicity drowning me day to day. Doing my best to navigate through life as a newly single mom, I keep my head down and work hard to keep my daughter safe as we start our new life tucked away in a small town. I would have never expected to find happiness in three men who love my daughter like their own, but I should have known that I could never truly find contentment in life as long as my ex is still alive and breathing. He finds us and now none of us are safe. WARNING: Life as She Knows it is a reverse harem romance. Meaning the FMC is in a relationship with three or more men. This is the first book of the Learning to Love Again series and does result in a cliffhanger.

Building Long-Term Relationships,"John W. Loeff, Ph.D.",Trafford Publishing,2007-06-22,"The craft of team-building in long-term relationships requires many building blocks and this book details at least ten major blocks. Your troubles could be related to very high and perhaps unrealistic expectations or a lack in communication and listening skills. Should you pay attention to your own personality or the way we talk to each other? Which components need some fine-tuning in your relationship? Relationship building is an arduous task, filled with many detours and roadblocks. The analogy I would like to use is a bricklayer laying the bricks for the outside wall of your house. If these bricks are not laid straight and with the right amount of mortar, leaks or cracks will appear. And, unfortunately, relationships are no different. Work on each brick successfully and the relationship will blossom. Ignoring issues over time, result in arguments, fights and perhaps a divorce. Take your pick.

A More Beautiful Question,Warren Berger,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2014-03-04,"To get the best answer-in business, in life-you have to ask the best possible question. Innovation expert Warren Berger shows that ability is both an art and a science. It may be the most underappreciated tool at our disposal, one we learn to use well in infancy-and then abandon as we grow older. Critical to learning, innovation, success, even to happiness-yet often discouraged in our schools and workplaces-it can unlock new business opportunities and reinvent industries, spark creative insights at many levels, and provide a transformative new outlook on life. It is the ability to question-and to do so deeply, imaginatively, and “beautifully.” In this fascinating exploration of the surprising power of questioning, innovation expert Warren Berger reveals that powerhouse businesses like Google, Nike, and Netflix, as well as hot Silicon Valley startups like Pandora and Airbnb, are fueled by the ability to ask fundamental, game-changing questions. But Berger also shares human stories of people using questioning to solve everyday problems-from “How can I adapt my career in a time of constant change?” to “How can I step back from the daily rush and figure out what really makes me happy?” By showing how to approach questioning with an open, curious mind and a willingness to work through a series of “Why,” “What if,” and “How” queries, Berger offers an inspiring framework of how we can all arrive at better solutions, fresh possibilities, and greater success in business and life.",Business & Economics,273,N/A,0,en

After decades of silence, Robyn Crawford, close friend, collaborator, and confidante of Whitney Houston, shares her story. Whitney Houston is as big a superstar as the music business has ever known. She exploded on the scene in 1985 with her debut album and spent the next two decades dominating the charts and capturing the hearts of fans around the world. One person was there by her side through it all—her best friend, Robyn Crawford. Since Whitney’s death in 2012, Robyn has stayed out of the limelight and held the great joys, wild adventures, and hard truths of her life with Whitney close to her heart. Now, for the first time ever, Crawford opens up in her memoir, A Song for You. With warmth, candor, and an impressive recall of detail, Robyn describes the two meeting as teenagers in the 1980s, and how their lives and friendship evolved as Whitney recorded her first album and Robyn pursued her promising Division I basketball career. Together during countless sold-out world tours, behind the scenes as hit after hit was recorded, through Whitney’s marriage and the birth of her daughter, the two navigated often challenging families, great loves, and painful losses, always supporting each other with laughter and friendship. Deeply personal and heartfelt, A Song for You is the vital, honest, and previously untold story that provides an understanding of the complex life of Whitney Houston.

Teaching Chinese by Culture and TV Drama,Lingfen Zhang,Routledge,2022-04-28,"This book integrates culture and authenticity into Chinese classroom practice through exploring the potential of contemporary TV drama as teaching and learning materials for intercultural Chinese language teaching and learning. In addressing the four main challenges in culture teaching in Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language (TCFL), this book focuses on precisely this area of pedagogical practice in Chinese as foreign language education and draws on a wide interdisciplinary base, including foreign language education, cultural studies, and intercultural communication to explore the potential of authentic TV drama as language and culture materials for revitalising TCFL and foreign language teaching more generally. It examines in detail the culturally shaped beliefs, values, and practices that give meaning to the action and language of the selected clips in a modern, award-winning Chinese TV drama. This book shows a potential experiential pathway into (pedagogical) practices to bring contemporary culture into classrooms, to engage learners with contemporary and authentic texts, and to encourage inquiry-focused teaching practices, which – in being intercultural – allow for learners’ own interpretations of cultural messages in interaction and to recognise learners as learning to understand their own values and beliefs as they learn to explore those of other cultures.",Education,194,N/A,0,en

Perspectives on Philosophy of Management and Business Ethics,Jacob Dahl Rendtorff,Springer,2017-01-05,"This book presents a selection of articles with focus on the theoretical foundations of business ethics, and in particular on the philosophy of management and on human rights and business. This implies identifying and discussing conflicts as well as agreement with regard to the philosophical and other foundations of business and management. Despite the general interest in corporate social responsibility and business ethics, the contemporary discussion rarely touches upon the normative core and philosophical foundations of business. There is a need to discuss the theoretical basis of business ethics and of business and human rights. Even though the actions and activities of business may be discussed from a moral perspective, not least in the media, the judgments and opinions relating to business and management often lack deeper moral reflection and consistency. Partly for this reason, business ethicists are constantly challenged to provide such moral and philosophical foundations for business ethics and for business and human rights, and to communicate them in an understandable manner. Such a challenge is also of scientific kind. Positions and opinions in the academic field need to be substantiated by thorough moral and theoretical reflection to underpin normative approaches. Far too often, business ethicists may agree on matters, which they approach from different and sometimes irreconcilable philosophical standpoints, resulting in superficial agreement but deeper-lying disagreement. In other cases, it may be of high relevance to identify philosophical standpoints that despite conflicting fundamentals may arrive at conclusions acceptable to everyone.",Business & Economics,359,N/A,0,en

Integrated Cost and Schedule Control for Construction Projects,Frederick W. Mueller,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Management and administrative processes within the construction industry have been undergoing major changes in the last several decades. These changes have involved significant adjustments in management science and manage ment techniques, brought about by the need for contemporary valid informa tion with which to manage the construction process. In short, management in the construction industry is changing significantly; change will continue at an accelerated pace at least through the next decade. The responses required of construction industry management are now resulting in a movement away from an entrepreneurial management style to professional management tech niques and procedures. THE COMPELLING ECONOMIC ISSUES The issues forcing these changes are economic. The rising costs of construction and of money are forcing the buyers of construction services to be more demanding. Their demands are for more construction economies, more pro duction, and more productivity than at any time in the past. Nowhere has this been more evident than in the Business Roundtable on construction and in the response of the construction industry to it.· To be successfully responsive, management in the construction industry will be required to use the best project management methods available for cost control, schedule control, and for financial and accounting controls. But responsive professional management can survive and will flourish within this more demanding eco nomic environment.",Science,517,N/A,0,en

Sexual Coercion in Dating Relationships,"E Sandra Byers, Lucia F O'Sullivan",Routledge,2013-12-16,"Sexual Coercion in Dating Relationships represents the next generation of research in the area of sexual coercion. This collection of critical analyses of current research and possible directions for future research benefits all researchers, counselors, and educators who need to thoroughly understand research efforts in this field. The clear analyses allow readers to evaluate critical issues and progress in the field to date.Outside of research and feminist communities, sexual coercion is frequently minimized and too often stereotyped. The words “sexual coercion” (synonyms with “sexual aggression” and “sexual assault”) conjure in the minds of many the image of a deranged man attacking a woman stranger in a dark place where she should know better than to be walking alone. This and other stereotypes are challenged by the authors of Sexual Coercion in the Dating Relationship.The chapters examine other important issues that have yet received little research attention. For example, one author tests the empirical assumptions inherent in a prominent theory about the causes of sexual coercion. Some of the authors challenge the assumption that only women are pressured or forced to engage in unwanted or nonconsensual sex. Other authors address issues related to the prevention of sexual coercion of women and challenge current conceptions of women's sexuality. Still others identify methodological problems related to research on sexual coercion, such as current methods of identifying attitudes supportive of the use of sexual coercion. All of the chapters challenge current beliefs related to the issue of sexual coercion and are designed to spur researchers and educators forward into new ground.With the publication of this book, readers are forced to re-think their assumptions on sexual coercion with the new statistics and research on these topics: evaluates of a prominent theory of the causes of sexual coercion (the traditional script) examines men's and women's use of sexual influence in their dating relationships, the types of behavior men and women use to influence their partners to engage in unwanted sex, and the associated consequences for the individuals and the relationship compares men's and women's reactions to sexual coercion presents a model to predict women's resistance and evaluates effective, practical measures of prevention for women evaluates attitudes-toward-rape literature and the predictive ability of assessing attitudes critical reviews of current conceptions of women's sexuality and the need to restructure culturally endorsed attitudes in our prevention efforts reviews methodological problems plaguing many current research investigations and the political ramifications of many investigations in this areaBecause this book presents information related to the prevention and experience of sexual coercion, Sexual Coercion in Dating Relationships is helpful in developing long-term research and preventive programs. This sourcebook also helps researchers, expert witnesses, counselors (especially college support staff), and college and university educators provide information to students and others about sexual coercion.",Family & Relationships,204,N/A,0,en

Social Relationships,"Joseph P.

From the moment of birth, humans crave love and intimacy and we devote much energy to creating and maintaining successful personal relationships throughout our personal and our working lives. However, modern industrialized societies present a particularly challenging environment for sustaining rewarding personal relationships. Understanding how people initiate, develop, maintain, and terminate relationships is one of the core issues in psychology, and the subject matter of this book. Contributors to this volume are all leading researchers in relationship science, and they seek here to explore and integrate the subtle influence that evolutionary, socio-cultural, and intra-psychic (cognitive, affective and motivational) variables play in relationship processes. In addition to discussing the latest advances in areas of relationship research, they also advocate an expanded theoretical approach that incorporates many of the insights gained from evolutionary psychology, social cognition, and research on affect and motivation. The contributions should be highly relevant to researchers, teachers, students, laypersons and to everyone who is interested in the subtleties of human relationships.

Reliability-Based Design in Geotechnical Engineering,Kok-Kwang Phoon,CRC Press,2008-04-25,"Reliability-based design is the only engineering methodology currently available which can ensure self-consistency in both physical and probabilistic terms. It is also uniquely compatible with the theoretical basis underlying other disciplines such as structural design. It is especially relevant as geotechnical design becomes subject to increasing codification and to code harmonization across national boundaries and material types. Already some codes of practice describe the principles and requirements for safety, serviceability, and durability of structures in reliability terms. This book presents practical computational methods in concrete steps that can be followed by practitioners and students. It also provides geotechnical examples illustrating reliability analysis and design. It aims to encourage geotechnical engineers to apply reliability-based design in a realistic context that recognises the complex variabilities in geomaterials and model uncertainties arising from a profession steeped in empiricism. By focusing on learning through computations and examples, this book serves as a valuable reference for engineers and a resource for students.",Technology & Engineering,545,N/A,0,en

The Brain and the Spirit,Gena St. David,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2021-10-29,"The Brain and the Spirit invites readers to embark on a practice of listening to the Christ story through the earpiece of neuroscience. After many years steeped in brain science, the author had an unexpected encounter with a theologian, James Alison, whose trust in God and forgiveness toward others appeared to defy neurobiological explanation. How did his encounter with the Christ story produce in him the Christlike responses that it did? This question launched the author on a thrilling quest to listen to the scriptures and take up questions of creation, humanity, sin, Jesus, salvation, the Spirit, and the body of Christ, to hear what might get amplified by our ever-expanding understanding of the human brain. Readers are invited to eavesdrop on the twists and turns of the author's story and take up their own practice of listening to the Spirit, scripture and theology through the earpiece of neuroscience, and to become curious how the Christ story may spark trust which unlocks our brain's capacity to engage reality with relationality, kindness, creativity, and access to joy.",Religion,212,N/A,0,en
Keigo in Modern Japan,Patricia J. Wetzel,University of Hawaii Press,2004-01-31,"Patricia Wetzel offers in this volume a comprehensive examination of a frequently discussed yet much misunderstood aspect of the Japanese language. Keigo, or “polite language,” is often viewed as a quaint accessory to Japanese grammar and a relic of Japan’s feudal past. Nothing, Wetzel contends, could be further from the truth. It is true that Japan has a long history of differentiating linguistic form on the basis of social status, psychological detachment, emotional reserve, and a host of other context-dependent factors. But, as is made clear in this unique and broadly framed study, modern keigo consciousness and keigo grammar emerged out of Japan’s encounter with Western intellectual trends in the mid- to late nineteenth century. Keigo in Modern Japan presents a finely nuanced linguistic and political review of keigo available nowhere else in English. The first chapter outlines the ways in which keigo has been problematized in Western linguistics through the application of structuralist analysis and its offshoots. But keigo’s presence in the English-language literature does not begin to compare with the place it occupies in the Japanese linguistic canon. Wetzel describes the historical roots and growth of keigo and the popularity of how-to manuals, which, she contends, are less about overt instruction than reinforcing what people already believe.",Juvenile Fiction,216,N/A,0,en

This book is the first attempt by a historian to study the material as a whole. The analysis reveals significant regional variations that reflect different stages in the process of conversion, and thegrowth of royal power. Many monuments were declarations of faith or manifestations of status; but virtually all reflect inheritance claims, and cast unexpected light on the prehistory of the inheritance customs found in later Scandinavian law codes. The results of this analysis make a significantcontribution to understanding developments in other parts of the Germanic world, as well as Scandinavia.

How can we explore the deeper meaning of freedom and liberation? This book begins with a reflection on the ""failure"" of social movements and revolutions and a review of the methodologies of liberation theologies. Offering a brand-new micro-political theology, it attempts to demonstrate how Michel Foucault can help us recognize the limitations of our standard definitions of liberation. Continuing Foucault's critical engagement with desire, sexuality, and the body, this book opens a fresh dialogue between Althaus-Reid's indecent theology, Latin American liberation theology, and radical orthodoxy, leading to an exploration of how that dialogue can remind us that spirituality and the transformative practice of the self can themselves be fully political. It also urges prayer as both the radical root of political resistance and its action.",Religion,195,N/A,0,en

A Methodology for Developing Multimodal User Interfaces of Information Systems,Adrian Stanciulescu,Presses univ. de Louvain,2008,"The Graphical User Interface (GUI), as the most prevailing type of User Interface (UI) in today's interactive applications, restricts the interaction with a computer to the visual modality and is therefore not suited for some users (e.g., with limited literacy or typing skills), in some circumstances (e.g., while moving around, with their hands or eyes busy) or when the environment is constrained (e.g., the keyboard and the mouse are not available). In order to go beyond the GUI constraints, the Multimodal (MM) UIs apear as paradigm that provide users with great expressive power, naturalness and flexibility. In this thesis we argue that developing MM UIs combining graphical and vocal modalities is an activity that could benefit from the application of a methodology which is composed of: a set of models, a method manipulating these models and the tools implementing the method. Therefore, we define a design space-based method that is supported by model-to-model colored transformations in order to obtain MM UIs of information systems. The design space is composed of explicitly defined design options that clarify the development process in a structured way in order to require less design effort. The feasability of the methodology is demonstrated through three case studies with different levels of complexity and coverage. In addition, an empirical study is conducted with end-users in order to measure the relative usability level provided by different design decisions.",Business & Economics,323,N/A,0,en

In doing so, the book contributes to theories associated with the marketing management, by assessing opportunities and challenges associated with the implementation of technology and marketing management during and post Covid-19. Although there is increasing research in consumer or business management acceptance of new technologies and digital marketing, the impact of these on marketing management during the Covid-19 are not adequately investigated, leading to overstated hypothetical predictions of its future potential. Chapters in the book therefore focus on new economic models such as sharing economy and business structures such as omnichannel, where advancements have enabled firms to build a one-on-one relationship with customers by collecting, storing, aggregating and analysing customer information across various touchpoints. Contributions in the book also focus on new technologies such as blockchain, automation solution, information technology management, and customer relationship management (CRM) in highlighting connections between these new technologies and marketing management. The book will be useful for anyone aiming to gain a better understanding of the current and future technologies that may play a role or have a robust impact on marketing management during Covid-19.",Business & Economics,169,N/A,0,en

Total Relationship Marketing,Evert Gummesson,Routledge,2011-01-05,"This third edition of Total Relationship Marketing confirms it as a classic text on the subject of relationship marketing and CRM, areas which have become accepted – and debated – parts of marketing but are currently undergoing dramatic change. A major contribution to marketing thought internationally, this seminal title presents a powerful in-depth analysis of relational approaches to marketing where the three words relationships, networks and interaction are king. The book effects a dramatic shift in the fundamentals of marketing thought, with the author’s refined model of thirty relationships, the 30Rs, presenting a sophisticated and cogent challenge to the traditional 4Ps schema. Previous editions were widely praised as breakthrough texts in the field, combining incisive and searching analysis with an accessible and pragmatic approach to putting the theory to work. This third edition is the first book on relationship marketing and CRM to integrate the ongoing evolution in marketing through the service-dominant logic, lean consumption and the customer’s value chain, the augmented role of the customer in value creation, the increasing importance of customer-to-customer (C2C) interaction, network-based many-to-many marketing, and marketing accountability and metrics. It addresses both the high tech, information technology aspects of marketing and the high touch, human aspects. Further, customer-centricity is suggested to be broadened to balanced centricity, a trade-off between the needs of all stakeholders of a network of relationships. Examples, cases, concepts and references have been updated. Highly informative, practical in style and packed with illustrations from real companies, Total Relationship Marketing is an essential resource for all serious marketing practitioners as well as undergraduate and postgraduate students.",Business & Economics,377,N/A,0,en
"Sex, Love, and Fidelity: A Study of Contemporary Romantic Relationships",Kassia Wosick,Cambria Press,2012-12-28,"Romantic relationships hold enormous significance within contemporary society, and monogamous marriage continues to serve as the “master template,” informing the structure, personal and legal parameters of intimacy. Although social changes have indeed impacted traditional notions of marriage and coupledom, monogamy continues to serve as the ultimate embodiment of commitment, love, and devotion to one’s partner and operates as the fundamental framework of sexual and emotional exclusivity. Relationship rules serve as a key indicator of what individuals expect and value within their intimate lives. For example, the rules of marriage (and therefore monogamy) emphasize loyalty, exclusivity, and faithfulness between two partners, which is generally operationalized as fidelity. Further, rule violations are often characterized as “infidelity,” and represent a breach to the commitment established between partners. The rules of monogamy, as well as the consequences for violating them, have been normalized and institutionalized in both paradigm and practice; American culture is decidedly mononormative, and fidelity is central to monogamous relationships. While the master monogamous template continues to be institutionally and individually reinforced, some actively choose to “break the rules” of monogamy in favor of multiple sexual and/or romantic relations. Consensual nonmonogamists, in contexts like open relationships, swinging, and polyamory, challenge the master monogamous template through not only engaging with multiple sexual and/or romantic partners, but also being consensual and usually overt about them. If monogamists have rules about other partners that ensure fidelity, do nonmonogamists have rules? If so, what are they, and what purpose do they serve in a relationship structure that has already broken the cardinal rule of exclusivity? Is commitment important in nonmonogamous relationships, and does fidelity exist between partners who are having sex with and/or falling in love with other partners? This study draws on over 2,000 surveys and 70 in-depth interviews with monogamists, nonmonogamists, and polyamorists to examine the meaning, significance, and practice of fidelity within their intimate relationships. Results indicate that fidelity exists in some variation in all relationship types. The book presents a “Fidelity Typology” based on differentiations between sexual and emotional exclusivity, as well as whether behavior aligns with ideology. The author argues that while exclusivity may not be a necessity in today’s romantic relationships, “feeling special” is key regardless of whether a relationship is monogamous, nonmonogamous, or polyamorous. However, how an individual experiences and ensures specialness is tempered by definitions of love and sex, differentiating between sexual and emotional exclusivity, and engaging individual agency in creating rules between partners. The book highlights that gender and sexual orientation are most salient in conceptualizations of monogamy, sex, and love, rates of nonmonogamy, and even relationship agreements and rules. The author offers a nuanced framework for understanding commitment in today’s romantic relationships, invoking a more agentic approach to achieving specialness called “personal fidelity.” The author argues that while personal fidelity is ultimately socially informed through the master template, it is also largely based on one’s sexual and emotional self-awareness, accountability, and perceived responsibility to other partner(s). Personal fidelity may well be the catalyst for ensuring specialness between partners and preserving the significance of one’s intimate relationship(s). This is an important book for sexualities studies, as well as scholars and students interested in gender, family and intimate relationships.",Family & Relationships,240,N/A,0,en

Compatible and Incompatible Relationships,W. Ickes,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Several years ago, two of my colleagues and I had the opportunity to interview Fritz Heider-perhaps the most influential theorist in the field of social psychology (Harvey, Ickes, & Kidd, 1976). During our interview, Heider affirmed a belief that had guided his career since the 1920s, the belief that the study of human relationships is the most important task in which social scientists can engage. Although many social scientists would profess to share this belief, it is nonetheless true that the study of human relationships has been one of the most neglected tasks in the history of the social sciences-including psychology. What Heider found in the 1920s-that most psychologists acknowledged the importance of studying human relationships but at the same time tended to focus their own research on more ""tractable"" topics such as memory and cognition-is still very much evident in the 1980s. Even within the more specific domain of social psychology, a majority of researchers still choose to address those hybrid topics (""social cognition,"" ""social categorization and stereotyping,"" ""person memory,"" etc. ) that relate most directly to traditional areas of psychological research. Still other researchers, while choosing to study such important interpersonal phenomena as altruism, aggression, conflict, and interpersonal attraction, tend to focus so exclusively on these isolated and abstracted phenomena that they fail to provide a more inclusive view of the relationships in which these phenomena occur.",Psychology,388,N/A,0,en

Sixteen-year-old Ana is a poet and a lover of language. Except that since she moved to New Jersey from Argentina, she can barely find the words to express how she feels. At first Ana just wants to return home. Then she meets Harrison, the very cute, very American boy in her math class, and discovers the universal language of racing hearts. But when she begins to spend time with Neo, the Greek Cypriot boy from ESL, Ana wonders how figuring out what her heart wants can be even more confusing than the grammar they’re both trying to master. After all, the rules of English may be confounding, but there are no rules when it comes to love.

This text takes a different view - that the marketer and the customer build the ongoing brand value together. Rather than the marketer trying to 'sell', the role of the marketer is to help customer buy. To do that, a customer view is vital and customer insight is essential. Customer insights allow the marketer to understand which audiences are important for a product, what delivery forms are appropriate, and what type of content is beneficial. ""Building Customer-Brand Relationships"" is themed around the four key elements marketing communicators use in developing programs - audiences, brands, delivery, and content - but provides an innovative approach to marketing communications in the 'push-pull' marketplace that combines traditional outbound communications (advertising, sales promotion, direct marketing, and PR) with the inbound or 'pull' media of Internet, mobile communications, social networks, and more. Its 'customer-centric' media planning approach covers media decision before dealing with creative development, and emphasizes measurement and accountability.

Left to Our Own Devices,Margaret E. Morris,MIT Press,2018-12-25,"Unexpected ways that individuals adapt technology to reclaim what matters to them, from working through conflict with smart lights to celebrating gender transition with selfies. We have been warned about the psychological perils of technology: distraction, difficulty empathizing, and loss of the ability (or desire) to carry on a conversation. But our devices and data are woven into our lives. We can't simply reject them. Instead, Margaret Morris argues, we need to adapt technology creatively to our needs and values. In Left to Our Own Devices, Morris offers examples of individuals applying technologies in unexpected ways—uses that go beyond those intended by developers and designers. Morris examines these kinds of personalized life hacks, chronicling the ways that people have adapted technology to strengthen social connection, enhance well-being, and affirm identity. Morris, a clinical psychologist and app creator, shows how people really use technology, drawing on interviews she has conducted as well as computer science and psychology research. She describes how a couple used smart lights to work through conflict; how a woman persuaded herself to eat healthier foods when her photographs of salads garnered “likes” on social media; how a trans woman celebrated her transition with selfies; and how, through augmented reality, a woman changed the way she saw her cancer and herself. These and the many other “off-label” adaptations described by Morris cast technology not just as a temptation that we struggle to resist but as a potential ally as we try to take care of ourselves and others. The stories Morris tells invite us to be more intentional and creative when left to our own devices.",Technology & Engineering,187,N/A,0,en

The Mathematics of Love,Hannah Fry,Simon and Schuster,2015-02-03,"In this must-have for anyone who wants to better understand their love life, a mathematician pulls back the curtain and reveals the hidden patterns—from dating sites to divorce, sex to marriage—behind the rituals of love. The roller coaster of romance is hard to quantify; defining how lovers might feel from a set of simple equations is impossible. But that doesn’t mean that mathematics isn’t a crucial tool for understanding love. Love, like most things in life, is full of patterns. And mathematics is ultimately the study of patterns—from predicting the weather to the fluctuations of the stock market, the movement of planets or the growth of cities. These patterns twist and turn and warp and evolve just as the rituals of love do. In The Mathematics of Love, Dr. Hannah Fry takes the reader on a fascinating journey through the patterns that define our love lives, applying mathematical formulas to the most common yet complex questions pertaining to love: What’s the chance of finding love? What’s the probability that it will last? How do online dating algorithms work, exactly? Can game theory help us decide who to approach in a bar? At what point in your dating life should you settle down? From evaluating the best strategies for online dating to defining the nebulous concept of beauty, Dr. Fry proves—with great insight, wit, and fun—that math is a surprisingly useful tool to negotiate the complicated, often baffling, sometimes infuriating, always interesting, mysteries of love.",Family & Relationships,128,N/A,0,en

The Tending Instinct,Shelley E. Taylor,Times Books,2014-05-20,"A groundbreaking work that reveals how the instinct to ""tend and befriend"" is vital for human society. In times of crisis and upheaval, our responses to stress become especially important. We have long heard about the ""fight or flight"" response, but renowned psychologist Shelley E. Taylor points out that hardwired in females -- both humans and those of other species -- is an instinct that can transcend ""fight or flight."" Their ""tend and befriend"" response is not only demonstrable but, as Taylor deftly explains in this eye-opening work, a key ingredient in human social life. With great skill and insight, Taylor examines stress, relationships, and human society through the special lens of women's biology. She draws on genetics, evolutionary psychology, physiology, and neuroscience to show how this tending process begins virtually at the moment of conception and literally crafts the biology of offspring through genes that rely on caregiving for their expression. Taylor also examines what drives women to seek each other's company, and to tend to the young and the infirm -- acts that greatly benefit the group but often at great cost to the individual. The Tending Instinct will forever change the way we view ourselves, and will revolutionize our understanding of the role of women and nurturing in maintaining a stable society.",Psychology,364,N/A,0,en

Grossmann, Karin Grossmann, Everett Waters",Guilford Press,2006-06-23,"This volume provides unique and valuable firsthand accounts of the most important longitudinal studies of attachment. Presented are a range of research programs that have broadened our understanding of early close relationships and their role in individual adaptation throughout life. In addition to discussing the findings that emerged from each study, leading investigators offer rare reflections on the process of scientific discovery. Themes addressed include the complexities of designing studies that span years or even decades; challenges in translating theoretical constructs into age-appropriate assessments; how Bowlby's original models have been refined and expanded; and how attachment interacts with other key influences on development.",Psychology,350,N/A,0,en

Religion and Relationships in Ragged Schools,Laura M. Mair,Routledge,2019-03-22,"Focusing on the interaction between teachers and scholars, this book provides an intimate account of ""ragged schools"" that challenges existing scholarship on evangelical child-saving movements and Victorian philanthropy. With Lord Shaftesbury as their figurehead, these institutions provided a free education to impoverished children. The primary purpose of the schools, however, was the salvation of children’s souls. Using promotional literature and local school documents, this book contrasts the public portrayal of children and teachers with that found in practice. It draws upon evidence from schools in Scotland and England, giving insight into the achievements and challenges of individual institutions. An intimate account is constructed using the journals maintained by Martin Ware, the superintendent of a North London school, alongside a cache of letters that children sent him. This combination of personal and national perspectives adds nuance to the narratives often imposed upon historic philanthropic movements. Investigating how children responded to the evangelistic messages and educational opportunities ragged schools offered, this book will be of keen interest to historians of education, emigration, religion, as well as of the nineteenth century more broadly.",Religion,260,N/A,0,en

Modern Romance,"Aziz Ansari, Eric Klinenberg",Penguin,2015-06-16,"The #1 New York Times Bestseller “An engaging look at the often head-scratching, frequently infuriating mating behaviors that shape our love lives.” —Refinery 29 A hilarious, thoughtful, and in-depth exploration of the pleasures and perils of modern romance from Aziz Ansari, the star of Master of None and one of this generation’s sharpest comedic voices At some point, every one of us embarks on a journey to find love. We meet people, date, get into and out of relationships, all with the hope of finding someone with whom we share a deep connection. This seems standard now, but it’s wildly different from what people did even just decades ago. Single people today have more romantic options than at any point in human history. With technology, our abilities to connect with and sort through these options are staggering. So why are so many people frustrated? Some of our problems are unique to our time. “Why did this guy just text me an emoji of a pizza?” “Should I go out with this girl even though she listed Combos as one of her favorite snack foods? Combos?!” “My girlfriend just got a message from some dude named Nathan. Who’s Nathan? Did he just send her a photo of his penis? Should I check just to be sure?” But the transformation of our romantic lives can’t be explained by technology alone. In a short period of time, the whole culture of finding love has changed dramatically. A few decades ago, people would find a decent person who lived in their neighborhood. Their families would meet and, after deciding neither party seemed like a murderer, they would get married and soon have a kid, all by the time they were twenty-four. Today, people marry later than ever and spend years of their lives on a quest to find the perfect person, a soul mate. For years, Aziz Ansari has been aiming his comic insight at modern romance, but for Modern Romance, the book, he decided he needed to take things to another level. He teamed up with NYU sociologist Eric Klinenberg and designed a massive research project, including hundreds of interviews and focus groups conducted everywhere from Tokyo to Buenos Aires to Wichita. They analyzed behavioral data and surveys and created their own online research forum on Reddit, which drew thousands of messages. They enlisted the world’s leading social scientists, including Andrew Cherlin, Eli Finkel, Helen Fisher, Sheena Iyengar, Barry Schwartz, Sherry Turkle, and Robb Willer. The result is unlike any social science or humor book we’ve seen before. In Modern Romance, Ansari combines his irreverent humor with cutting-edge social science to give us an unforgettable tour of our new romantic world.",Humor,369,4,5,en

Why do people cheat? Can an affair ever help a marriage? Infidelity is the ultimate betrayal. But does it have to be? Relationship therapist Esther Perel examines why people cheat, and unpacks why affairs are so traumatic; because they threaten our emotional security. In infidelity, she sees something unexpected - an expression of longing and loss. A must-read for anyone who has ever cheated or been cheated on, or who simply wants a new framework for understanding relationships.

Structure—Property Relationships in Polymers,"Charles E. Carraher Jr., R.B. Seymour",Springer,2012-03-22,"The first concern of scientists who are interested in synthetic polymers has always been, and still is: How are they synthesized? But right after this comes the question: What have I made, and for what is it good? This leads to the important topic of the structure-property relations to which this book is devoted. Polymers are very large and very complicated systems; their character ization has to begin with the chemical composition, configuration, and con formation of the individual molecule. The first chapter is devoted to this broad objective. The immediate physical consequences, discussed in the second chapter, form the basis for the physical nature of polymers: the supermolecular interactions and arrangements of the individual macromolecules. The third chapter deals with the important question: How are these chemical and physical structures experimentally determined? The existing methods for polymer characterization are enumerated and discussed in this chapter. The following chapters go into more detail. For most applications-textiles, films, molded or extruded objects of all kinds-the mechanical and the thermal behaviors of polymers are of pre ponderant importance, followed by optical and electric properties. Chapters 4 through 9 describe how such properties are rooted in and dependent on the chemical structure. More-detailed considerations are given to certain particularly important and critical properties such as the solubility and permeability of polymeric systems. Macromolecules are not always the final goal of the chemist-they may act as intermediates, reactants, or catalysts. This topic is presented in Chapters 10 and 11.",Science,246,N/A,0,en

When Milwaukee-area wife and mother MJ Boudreaux notices her husband Chris seems more interested in the casino than her, she’s more bothered that she isn’t upset than by her husband’s absence. She picks up poker as a way for them to spend more time together—and reignite their marital flame. Although the game doesn’t give her the quality time with Chris that she’d hoped, MJ finds she has a knack for it. Increasingly unhappy at home, she turns to the felt top of the poker table for comfort.

In reality, it's hard to want what you already have. Our quest for secure love conflicts with our pursuit of passion. And often, the very thing that got us to into our relationships - lust - is the one thing that goes missing from them. Determined to reconcile the erotic and the domestic, Perel explains why democracy is a passion killer in the bedroom. Argues for playfulness, distance, and uncertainty.

Corruption in Public Administration,Davide Torsello,Edward Elgar Publishing,2016,"Despite the growth in literature on political corruption, contributions from field research are still exiguous. This book provides a timely and much needed addition to current research, bridging the gap and providing an innovative approach to the study of corruption and integrity in public administration. The volume contributors provide insights from nine different countries, all drawing on extensive fieldwork data and following ethnographic methodologies. The topics discussed in this book include: the role of anti-corruption legislation; organizational change and morality; party corruption; socio-cultural dimensions of corruption; clientelism and patronage. Analyzing these topics comparatively, the volume concludes that in countries where public perception of corruption is high, citizens are well aware of the generalized damage of these practices and the loss of trust they cause for public administrations. On the other hand, corruption in public administration takes place following patterns that mirror some of the fundamental social and cultural features that characterize interactions among citizens and institutions. Scholars and students of the fields including public policy, public administration, sociology and anthropology will find this book to be of use to their research and studies. It will also be of interest to policy-makers internationally and public sector practitioners. Contributors include: M. Acar, C. Baez Camargo, E. Denisova-Schmidt, Z.T. Lofranco, N. Luci, R.M.

The New Monogamy,Tammy Nelson,New Harbinger  Publications,2013-01-02,"Everyone has their own concept of what “monogamy” means—and most people assume their partners and spouses are on the same page. Couples may assume that they are monogamous, but never discuss exactly what the monogamy agreement means to them. What happens when this implicit agreement is broken? After infidelity, relationships can become strained as both partners lose trust and faith in each other. The New Monogamy offers a way out of these difficulties for couples struggling to stay together after infidelity. Couples make these implicit assumptions and agreements explicit so that each partner knows exactly what is expected of them in the future and what they can expect from their partner. Author Tammy Nelson helps couples regain trust, romance, and intimacy after infidelity by redefining the monogamy contract. The new monogamy contract is an explicit relationship agreement created after the affair that allows each partner to openly, honestly, and safely share their desires, expectations, and limitations. This agreement does not create an open marriage, but rather, an open conversation wherein each partner can have a say in setting the ground rules for their relationship. The book first helps couples rebuild trust after the affair, then engages in a series of Imago dialogues based on questions about what each partner really wants in the relationship, not what you think you should want or what a partner wants you to want. The New Monogamy includes questionnaires, checklists, and candid questions for partners to ask that help welcome complete honesty and trust back into the relationship. Then, the book helps couples make an erotic recovery from infidelity by addressing erotic problems that may surface and offers advice for helping couples return to desiring and trusting one another. After an affair, it’s impossible to go back to the way the relationship was before, but this book offers the chance for a new beginning.",Family & Relationships,156,N/A,0,en

When we've fulfilled our needs--such as the need to be cherished, the need to be heard, and the need for harmony--we are naturally attractive to potential love interests. “Like attracts like.” When we are fully living our core values, we effortlessly attract others with similar values.

The Meanings of Love,Robert E. Wagoner,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,1997-05-21,"This introductory text offers a clear, concise look at the philosophy of love. The author's presentation assumes no previous knowledge of philosophy, providing the humanities student with an insightful introduction to some of the most prominent writers and philosophers, both ancient and modern. From the dialogues of Plato to the writings of feminist philosopher Luce Irigaray, Wagoner presents six major ideas of love: erotic love, Christian love, romantic love, moral love, love as power, and mutual love. This study asserts that even though we have only one word for love, six fundamentally different meanings can be distinguished: erotic love, Christian love, romantic love, moral love, love as power, and mutual love. Wagoner identifies each of these ideas of love in terms of the special meaning it brings to experience. No one meaning is comprehensive. Each is shown to have a logic and legitimacy of its own. Why each view seems real and compelling is the focus of separate discussions, as well as the price that may be exacted by each idea. The extent to which these ideas throw light on actual experience is striking, but the book is not an empirical or psychological inquiry. How one self finds itself in another is first defined and then explored further to see how this shapes the rational and sexual aspects of life.",Philosophy,160,N/A,0,en

This is one debut you don’t want to miss!” —Kate Bromley, author of Talk Bookish to Me They say living well is the best revenge. But sometimes, spreading the misery seems a whole lot more satisfying. That’s interior designer Dani Porter’s justification for buying the vacant lot next to her ex-fiancé’s house…the house they were supposed to live in together, before he cheated on her with their Realtor. Dani plans to build a vacation rental that will a) mess with his view and his peace of mind and b) prove that Dani is not someone to be stepped on. Welcome to project Spite House. That plan quickly becomes complicated when Dani is forced to team up with Wyatt Montego, the handsome, haughty architect at her firm, and the only person available to draw up blueprints. Wyatt is terse and stern, the kind of man who eats his sandwich with a knife and fork. But as they spend time together on- and off-site, Dani glimpses something deeper beneath that hard veneer, something surprising, vulnerable, and real. And the closer she gets to her goal, the more she wonders if winning revenge could mean losing something infinitely sweeter… “Rollickingly, fast-paced… Fans of Emily Henry’s tales will enjoy Collins’ imaginative rom-com.” —Booklist “Wyatt is the perfect grumpy romance hero with a heart of gold.

Not Drinking Tonight,Amanda E. White,Hachette UK,2022-01-04,"In this honest discussion of mental health, the founder of Therapy for Women explores our reasons for drinking alcohol—and the benefits of taking a break. When “retired party girl” and popular therapist Amanda White admitted she was an alcoholic, it wasn’t because she’d done something outrageous while under the influence, like land herself in jail or get married in Vegas. It was because she realized three things: 1. Alcohol was making her life worse. 2. Moderation wasn’t helping. 3. She could not be a therapist if she continued to use alcohol to numb her life. Something needed to change—not just her relationship with alcohol, but her relationship with herself. Choosing not to drink can be daunting. It’s everywhere in our culture, our socializing, and our destressing. And it can seem black or white: you drink, or you don’t (and if you don’t, people ask why). That’s where Not Drinking Tonight comes in. Judgement-free and relatable, Amanda helps you unpack your relationship with alcohol by showing you how to: Find out why you drink. Whether it’s a glass of wine after work or a weekly bar crawl, your drinking habits can be the result of everything from biology to trauma. Heal your relationship with alcohol. Understand how your relationships have been affecting your life, and learn how to set boundaries and create true self care. Build the sober life you love. Learn what comes next—how to maintain your social life, navigate sex and relationships, and love yourself. Not Drinking Tonight isn’t a program to stop drinking. It’s the first book to help you address the root issues that cause you to reach for a drink, and create a life you love—one that is not perfect, but is messy and real and one you are fully present for.",Self-Help,217,N/A,0,en

Annabel Lee,Edgar Allan Poe,HarperCollins,2014-09-02,"After the death of the beautiful Annabel Lee, a young man contemplates their love story—the passionate love in their youth, and the love that continues even after her passing. Despite the fact that his first published works were books of poetry, during his lifetime Edgar Allan Poe was recognized more for his literary criticism and prose than his poetry. However, Poe’s poetic works have since become as well-known as his famous stories, and reflect similar themes of mystery and the macabre. “Annabel Lee” was the last complete poem composed by Poe, and was most likely inspired by his wife, Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe.

Transitioning to Concept-Based Curriculum and Instruction,"H. Lynn Erickson, Lois A. Lanning",Corwin Press,2013-12-10,"A cutting-edge model for 21st century curriculum and instruction How can you spot a thinking child? Look at the eyes: they’ll light up, signaling that transformative moment when your student has finally grasped that big idea behind critical academic content. If experiences like this are all too rare in your school, then you need a curriculum and instruction model that’s more inquiry-driven and idea-centered. Now. H. Lynn Erickson and Lois Lanning demonstrate how, through concept-based curriculum, you can move beyond superficial coverage and lower-level skills practice to effect intellectually engaging pedagogy, where students engage in problem finding and problem solving. New insights include: How to design and implement concept-based curriculum and instruction across all subjects and grade levels. Why content and process are two different (but equally important) aspects of any effective concept-based curriculum. How to ensure students develop the all-important skill of synergistic thinking. We’re all looking for the best curriculum and instruction model to meet the changing demands of the 21st century. This is it. ""With the onset of the Common Core and new national content standards, concept-based learning is now more crucial than ever. Erickson and Lanning are ′ahead of the curve′ in providing teachers and curriculum leaders with rich instructional strategies to meet these challenging standards. This is an essential book for planning tomorrow’s curricula today."" Douglas Llewellyn, Educational Consultant and Author of Inquire Within, Third Edition ""Powerful teaching engages minds with powerful ideas. At its core, such transformative teaching is neither transmission of information nor practice with inert skills. Rather it is a careful choreography between a mind and an idea such that the mind comes to own the idea in a form that is true to the discipline and expansive for the learner. Erickson and Lanning teach teachers to be choreographers of learning—understanding both what makes content worth knowing and how to engage young minds with that content in ways that extend their capacities to understand it at a deeper level, use it, transfer it, and ultimately create with it.""

Software Requirement Patterns,Stephen Withall,Pearson Education,2007-06-13,"Learn proven, real-world techniques for specifying software requirements with this practical reference. It details 30 requirement “patterns” offering realistic examples for situation-specific guidance for building effective software requirements. Each pattern explains what a requirement needs to convey, offers potential questions to ask, points out potential pitfalls, suggests extra requirements, and other advice. This book also provides guidance on how to write other kinds of information that belong in a requirements specification, such as assumptions, a glossary, and document history and references, and how to structure a requirements specification. A disturbing proportion of computer systems are judged to be inadequate; many are not even delivered; more are late or over budget. Studies consistently show one of the single biggest causes is poorly defined requirements: not properly defining what a system is for and what it’s supposed to do. Even a modest contribution to improving requirements offers the prospect of saving businesses part of a large sum of wasted investment. This guide emphasizes this important requirement need—determining what a software system needs to do before spending time on development.

"Seen That, Now What?",Andrea Shaw,Simon and Schuster,1996-04-09,"You've never used a video guide like this before. You loved Chariots of Fire and you want to see something like it. Where do you start? Look up Chariots of Fire in the index, and find it in Drama. There you'll see it listed under White Flannel Films: Welcome to the glory days of the British empire when the ruling class rode horses on large country estates, servants were in plentiful supply, and only an adulterous lover questioned the status quo. As in other costume dramas, the period details are celebrations of all that was brilliant and luxurious, with the camera sweeping over British, Indian, or African countryscapes and exquisite turn-of-the-century interiors. But all this lush upholstery doesn't cover up the intelligent, thoughtful stories -- usually based on Lawrence, Forster, and Waugh novels -- played by stellar British actors. In White Flannel Films there are concise, witty reviews of select movies like A Room with a View A Passage to India Heat and Dust The Shooting Party Out of Africa White Mischief and more There is also a unique ratings system that helps you distinguish the bombs from the sleepers. But the key is that all these films offer the same kind of viewing experience -- if you like one, chances are good you'll like the others, too. Seen That, Now What? is your own personal video genius, who knows everything about movies and exactly what you like to watch.",Performing Arts,652,5,1,en

Database and Expert Systems Applications,"Vladimír Mařík, Jiří Lažanský, Roland R. Wagner",Springer,1993,"""This volume constitutes the proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA), held in Prague, Czech Republic, in September 1993. Traditionally the objective of the DEXA conferences is to serve as an international forum for the discussion and exchange of research results and practical experinece among theoreticians and professionals working in the field of database and artificial intelligence technologies. Despite the fact that in the conference title the applications aspect is mentioned explicitly, the theoretical and the practical points of view in the field are well-balanced in the program of DEXA'93. The growing importance of the conference series is outlined by the remarkably high number of 269 submissions and by the support given by renown organizations. DEXA'93 is held for the first time outside the former GDR in an East-European country, and is essentially contributing to the advancement of the East-West scientific cooperation in the field of database and AI systems. This proceedings contains the 78 contributed papers carefully selected by an international program committee with thesupport of a high number of subreferees. The volume is organized in sectionson data models, distributed databases, advanced database aspects, database optimization and performance evaluation, spatial and geographic databases, expert systems and knowledge engineering, legal systems, other database and artificial intelligence applications, software engineering, and hypertext/hypermedia and user interfaces.""--PUBLISHER'S WEBSITE",Computers,792,N/A,0,en

Truly effective companies (and marketers) create content experiences, drawing the customer into an immersive infinite scroll that mirrors the consumer experience of Netflix, Spotify, and other billion-dollar brands.Randy Frisch will push you to rethink how you approach content for complex buyer journeys. The current mindset is all about volume-the more content created, the better. But the reality is that almost 70 percent of content created within an organization is never used, and there's little point investing in content marketing if you're not leveraging the assets you create.In this book, Frisch unpacks the Content Experience Framework, arming your organization to deliver personalized experiences that leverage your content to engage your audiences at scale-as well as identify and ramp up the key players in your organization who need to own this process.",Business & Economics,250,N/A,0,en

Magnetic Partners,Stephen Betchen,Simon and Schuster,2010-05-18,"Do you and your partner argue about the same things over and over again? Are you often confused about why your partner is so angry with you? Are things getting worse and worse even though you’ve tried everything you can think of to make them better? In this breakthrough guide to repairing romantic relationships, therapist and marriage researcher Dr. Stephen Betchen presents a powerful new explanation of what leads to this kind of escalating conflict in couples and how you can repair your relationship and find a whole new level of happiness. Based on his extensive experience as a couples’ therapist, Dr. Betchen has discovered that the prevailing idea that opposites attract is wrong. Instead, one of the strongest forces that attracts people to one another is that they share a hidden, inner conflict in their lives—an unconscious struggle within themselves that each of them developed growing up—which he calls a ""master conflict."" The fact that a couple shares a master conflict acts as an almost magnetic force of attraction, but, over time, master conflicts often begin to push a pair apart—many of the very things you most appreciated about each other start to grate on you, producing increasing hostility. The good news is that by identifying the master conflict that you share, you and your partner can take the steps to break the cycle of fighting and come to a new place of understanding and happiness in your relationship. Often, just the realization that you have this hidden conflict acts as a powerful cure, allowing you to appreciate each other once again and to be empathetic about the things that have been irritating you both. From his years of work with couples, Betchen has identified the nineteen most common master conflicts—such as getting your needs met vs. caretaking; giving vs. withholding; commitment vs. freedom; power vs. passivity—and for each he provides vivid stories of couples who have struggled with them, as well as simple tests that help you to: • Identify the core master conflict that is causing your relationship problems • Understand the origins of your conflict and how it drew you to your partner • Diagnose how the conflict is now pushing you apart • Come to new terms with the conflict to save your relationship As Dr. Betchen writes, knowledge of a master conflict is power, and Magnetic Partners is an empowering guide that will help you not only to identify and control your master conflict, but also to bring your relationship to a new level based on deeper understanding, ultimately leading to greater fulfillment and long-term resilience.

Strohmer, Alenka Triplat, AT Kearney",Apress,2014-06-14,"There’s a new buzz phrase in the air: Supplier Relationship Management (SRM). Corporate executives know it’s necessary, but there’s only one problem. Nobody yet knows how to do it. Or they think it’s all about bashing your vendors over the head until they reduce the price another 4%. Supplier Relationship Management: How to Maximize Vendor Value and Opportunity changes all that. Containing the best and most innovative advice from the operations and procurement experts at consultant AT Kearney, this book shows that SRM is at root a strategic discussion requiring cross-functional interaction and internal alignment at the highest levels. It requires an honest appraisal of the value that suppliers now bring to your firm, as well as their potential value. It then requires a frank and constructive business-to-business dialogue about how to improve the relationship. When this happens, a company reaps myriad benefits, ranging from new opportunity to added value to competitive advantage—and, quite likely, to overall (and sometimes substantial) cost reductions. This book shows the most concrete methods you can use today to: Identify value-adding opportunities in the supply chain Work closely with suppliers to maximize the benefits Work the ""Critical Cluster"" of suppliers, where the greatest opportunity for advantage lies Review suppliers to encourage constant gains in quality and cost Turn your SRM strategy into a major competitive advantage Supplier Relationship Management introduces and explains the Supplier Interaction Model, a key tool that will help you get the most from your supplier relationships. It segments the supplier universe into nine categories, from those you want to run away from fast to those so good and so useful to your organization that it can make sense to invest in them directly. Numerous case studies show how to apply the principles to your situation. Supplier Relationship Management burns off the fog that has surrounded the procurement process for far too long. It is the definitive guide for business executives who want to get the maximum benefits from suppliers and gain very real advantages over competitors.",Business & Economics,183,N/A,0,en

Pretty Face,Lucy Parker,Carina Press,2017-02-20,"Highly acclaimed award-winning author of Act Like It Lucy Parker returns readers to the London stage with laugh-out-loud wit and plenty of drama “To say I loved this book is an understatement—I adored it. The romance is beautifully written and developed and the chemistry between Luc and Lily is explosive.” —All About Romance The play’s the fling It’s not actress Lily Lamprey’s fault that she’s all curves and has the kind of voice that can fog up a camera lens. She wants to prove where her real talents lie—and that’s not on a casting couch, thank you. When she hears esteemed director Luc Savage is renovating a legendary West End theater for a lofty new production, she knows it could be her chance—if only Luc wasn’t so dictatorial, so bad-tempered and so incredibly sexy. Luc Savage has respect, integrity and experience. He also has it bad for Lily. He’d be willing to dismiss it as a midlife crisis, but this exasperating, irresistible woman is actually a very talented actress. Unfortunately, their romance is not only raising questions about Lily’s suddenly rising career, it’s threatening Luc’s professional reputation. The course of true love never did run smooth. But if they’re not careful, it could bring down the curtain on both their careers… London Celebrities Book 1: Act Like It Book 2: Pretty Face Book 3: Making Up Book 4: The Austen Playbook Book 5: Headliners",Fiction,228,5,1,en

But that’s about to change… When Martin Krause arrives at Rose Owens’s high school, she’s determined to remain chilly with her new colleague. Unfriendly? Maybe. Understandable? Yes, since a loathsome administrator gave Rose’s beloved world history classes to Martin, knowing it would hurt her. But keeping her distance from a man as warm and kind as Martin will prove challenging, even for a stubborn, guarded ice queen. Especially when she begins to see him for what he truly is: a man who’s never been taught his own value. Martin could use a good teacher—and luckily, Rose is the best. Rose has her own lessons—about trust, about vulnerability, about her past—to learn. And over the course of a single school year, the two of them will find out just how hot it can get when an ice queen melts.",Fiction,258,N/A,0,en

Illusive,Emily Lloyd-Jones,Hachette UK,2014-07-15,"The X-Men meets Ocean's Eleven in this edge-of-your-seat sci-fi adventure about a band of ""super"" criminals. When the deadly MK virus swept across the planet, a vaccine was created to stop the epidemic, but it came with some unexpected side effects. A small percentage of the population developed superhero-like powers, and Americans suffering from these so-called adverse effects were given an ultimatum: Serve the country or be declared a traitor. Some people chose a third option: live a life of crime. Seventeen-year-old Ciere Giba has the handy ability to change her appearance at will. She's what's known as an illusionist. She's also a thief. After crossing a gang of mobsters, Ciere must team up with a group of fellow super powered criminals on a job that most would have considered impossible: a hunt for the formula that gave them their abilities. It was supposedly destroyed years ago--but what if it wasn't? Government agents are hot on their trail, and the lines between good and bad, us and them, and freedom and entrapment are blurred as Ciere and the rest of her crew become embroiled in a deadly race that could cost them their lives.",Young Adult Fiction,297,N/A,0,en

Positive School Leadership,"Joseph F. Murphy, Karen Seashore Louis",Teachers College Press,2018,"This landmark book translates positive and asset-based understandings of organizations to develop a powerful model of school leadership that is grounded in both existing research and the complexities of life in schools. The authors—both senior scholars in educational leadership—apply insights from positive psychology to the role and function of educational leaders. The Positive School Leadership (PSL) model draws on the strengths of relationships among staff and the broader school community to communicate and instill shared values and a common mission. This book builds a compelling case for creating a more inclusive, less “mechanistic” approach to leadership. Designed to engage both the hearts and minds of readers, the text is organized around reflective questioning of educational practice and current assumptions about the purposes and goals of leadership in schools. “This integrated theory of leadership is compelling, useable, and grounded in research . . . an essential and inspiring read.” —Michelle D. Young, University Council for Educational Administration “Murphy and Louis offer a hopeful vision of leadership for those facing the enormous challenges of school improvement.” —Daniel L. Duke, University of Virginia “Let the renewal of leadership and organizations begin, and let it be guided by this fine body of work.” —Alan J. Daly, University of California, San Diego “In a world of education reforms that have fallen short of expectations, Murphy and Louis make a strong case that positive leadership can create the foundation for sustainable change.” —Philip Hallinger, Mahidol University",Education,217,N/A,0,en

Theoretical Frameworks for Personal Relationships,"Ralph Erber, Robin Gilmour",Psychology Press,2013-06-17,"The past two decades have seen a tremendous increase in research and scholarship devoted to personal relationships. From rather scattered beginnings a recognizable and recognized field has emerged, whose strength and health is reflected in a wide array of indicators. The editors contend that while the vigor of the field is often shown in the diversity and innovation of its research, it is in the theoretical domain that they find evidence of a real coming of age. This volume provides grounds for arguing that the diversity of theorizing is particularly healthy at this point. The reader will notice that there is some diversity in terms of how much theory and research is contained in each chapter -- some are purely theoretical; others are complemented by original pieces of empirical research. The editors and contributors are from different countries -- another way in which the diversity of this book manifests itself. The variety of the frameworks presented are seen as a strength, as building on established strengths elsewhere to feed into relationship research and enhance its vitality. Each chapter makes its own contribution to thinking and research about personal relationships. As a group they add to an exciting collection that not only reflects a richness of conceptual backing, but also a wide range of usable theoretical structures.",Psychology,289,N/A,0,en

In the Shadow of Marriage,Anne M. O. Griffiths,University of Chicago Press,1997,"Anne Griffiths originally went to Botswana to establish a university course in family law. But independent fieldwork in Botswana convinced her of the central role of the traditional customary legal system that stands alongside the colonial common law of courts and magistrates she was examining in her course. In the first comparative work on these two systems, Griffiths shows how the structure of both legal institutions is based on power and gender relations that heavily favor males. Griffiths's analysis is based on careful observation of how people actually experience the law as well as the more standard tools of statutes and cases familiar to Western legal scholars. She explains how women's access to law is determined by social relations over which they have little control. In this powerful feminist critique of law and anthropology, Griffiths shows how law and custom are inseparable for Kwena women. Both colonial common law and customary law pose comparable and constant challenges to Kwena women's attempts to improve their positions in society.",History,354,5,1,en

Biology and Conservation of North American Tortoises,"David C. Rostal, Earl D. McCoy, Henry R. Mushinsky",JHU Press,2014-08-01,"The most comprehensive book ever published on North America's native tortoises. Tortoises, those unmistakable turtles, evolved from a lineage that split off from the familiar pond turtles roughly 100 million years ago. Over time, these plant-eating land turtles spread around the world, growing to an enormous size (depending on the species) and living so long that they have become the stuff of legends. By most accounts, they are indeed the longest-lived of the turtles, with good records suggesting individuals may live as long as 180 years (anecdotal records suggest that some reach ages of 200 years or more). Providing the first comprehensive treatment of North America’s tortoises, Biology and Conservation of North American Tortoises brings together leading experts to give an overview of tortoise morphology, taxonomy, systematics, paleontology, physiology, ecology, behavior, reproduction, diet, growth, health, and conservation. The contributors carefully combine their own expertise and observations with results from studies conducted by hundreds of other researchers.

Missional: Impossible!,Francis Rothery,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2014-01-07,"Mainline Christianity in the West is dying. Addiction to hierarchical and bureaucratic power is killing it. A management-god and a mission-god have usurped the Way of Christ. In the midst of decline the missional movement is attempting to reboot the church. Its goal is to remake a New Christian West through mission, leadership, mapping, and planning. Yet it is trapped in the language and methods of modernity. Its final solution is a polarizing vision of cultural domination by one social group, the Christians. The Way of Life and Truth has been forgotten. Christ is not a conquering King, a written Word, or an absolute Idea, but a divine Human Being. Social wholeness can only be realized through a rediscovery of Conversation, Reconciliation, and Empowerment. These reflect Christ's practices of eternal dialogue and reciprocal giving in small communities.

Fishes Out of Water,"Zeehan Jaafar, Edward O. Murdy",CRC Press,2017-07-12,"Mudskippers are amphibious fishes native to the Indo-West Pacific and tropical western Africa. Unlike most fishes, mudskippers emerse to forage, find mates, and defend territories. Adaptations to their morphology, physiology and behavior enable mudskippers to accommodate both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. For these traits, mudskippers have long captured the fascination of scientists, naturalists, and fish hobbyists. Some mudskipper taxa (e.g. Periophthalmodon spp., Periophthalmus spp., Boleophthalmus spp.) are readily observed on mudflats and mangrove forests during the ebb tide. Correspondingly, these conspicuous and widespread taxa are relatively well-studied. The autecology and basic biology for the remaing taxa (e.g. Apocryptodon spp. and Oxuderces spp.) are still poorly understood. Fishes Out of Water: Biology and Ecology of Mudskippers is the first comprehensive book to synthesize published scientific information and observation on these fishes. Two dozen subject experts present thorough overviews in fifteen distinct chapters. Contents span mudskipper anatomy, distribution, systematics, physiology, ecology, and conservation. Unique adaptations to terrestriality are discussed within the context of each chapter foci. This authoritative reference equips the reader with the basic foundation to understand mudskipper biology and ecology, while providing a framework in which emerging data are discussed.

Friendship as a Social Institution,Michal McCall,Routledge,2017-07-12,"What is the social organization of love, friendship, rivalry, marriage, admiration, collegiality, parenthood, acquaintance, and clientage? How are these types of relationships similar and how do they differ? Few sociological works exist on relationships between friends, business partners, customers and clerks, mailmen and homeowners, and employers and employees, as social rather than role relationships. This classic book remains of interest because it focuses on voluntary personal relationships relationships that people need not enter, whose content is up to the participants, whose rules are what the participants agree they will be. The authors create an analytic framework within which to describe and compare the enormous range of relationships between two persons. They detail the shape and structure of such relationships, consider their organizational dynamics, their range and the nature of deviance in them, and point out analytical variables and dimensions upon which relationships can be located for comparative purposes. Organizational change in terms of how relationships are formed, developed, and transformed is covered, as is their function and dysfunction for the individual and society. By regarding social relationships consistently from the viewpoint of social organization theory, the book assimilates them to sociological concepts in general, but with an eye to the social psychological and organizational features that render them distinctive as a type. Friendship as a Social Institution sustains the study of friendship by making distinctions and outlining the problems connected with the study of social relationships.",Psychology,250,N/A,0,en

Comprehensive in breath and textbook in depth, the Encyclopedia of Adolescence – with entries presented in easy-to-access A to Z format – serves as a reference repository of knowledge in the field as well as a frequently updated conduit of new knowledge long before such information trickles down from research to standard textbooks. By making full use of Springer’s print and online flexibility, the Encyclopedia is at the forefront of efforts to advance the field by pushing and creating new boundaries and areas of study that further our understanding of adolescents and their place in society. Substantively, the Encyclopedia draws from four major areas of research relating to adolescence. The first broad area includes research relating to ""Self, Identity and Development in Adolescence"". This area covers research relating to identity, from early adolescence through emerging adulthood; basic aspects of development (e.g., biological, cognitive, social); and foundational developmental theories. In addition, this area focuses on various types of identity: gender, sexual, civic, moral, political, racial, spiritual, religious, and so forth. The second broad area centers on ""Adolescents’ Social and Personal Relationships"". This area of research examines the nature and influence of a variety of important relationships, including family, peer, friends, sexual and romantic as well as significant nonparental adults. The third area examines ""Adolescents in Social Institutions"". This area of research centers on the influence and nature of important institutions that serve as the socializing contexts for adolescents. These major institutions include schools, religious groups, justice systems, medical fields, cultural contexts, media, legal systems, economic structures, and youth organizations. ""Adolescent Mental Health"" constitutes the last major area of research.

In many ways, this book is a literature review of 1,800-plus works that defends freedom of conscience in prison while exposing the unconstitutionality of the seminary program that “buys faith with favor” from prisoners. The state veritably ordains the prisoner a “Field Minister” that represents the offices of the Governor, TDCJ Director, and wardens throughout the prison. Therein, TDCJ lies about neutrality in a program all about Christian missions and lies again in falsely certifying elementary Bible students as counselors. Why is the director sponsoring psychopaths counseling psychopaths? In fact, TDCJ pays $314 million a year to UTMB for psychiatric care and receives not a single report of the care given, and worse, for UTMB generates no reports itself. The underbelly TDCJ’s executive culture of cover up is exposed. TDCJ has hired the lowest qualified of the applicant pool many times in the last 25 years and regularly destroys statistics on violence. TDCJ Dir. Collier led the prison to model Louisiana Warden Burl Cain, the most scandal-ridden in penal history according to a host of published news stories for 20 years. Therein, Collier led TDCJ to favor the smallest segment of religious society within Evangelical Dominionism. Texas has no business endorsing the truth of any religion over another. We close with a proposal that utilizes the 400,000,000 hours of officer contact over ten years as a definitive influence in contrast to a commissioner that spends less than 10 minutes on each decision. Maness has been lobbying Austin for 15 years to definitively access staff for his “100,000 Mothers’ 1% Certainty Parole Texas Constitutional Amendment,” which would revolutionize prison culture and save Texans millions of the dollars.",Social Science,683,N/A,0,en
Ecology and Evolution of Darwin's Finches (Princeton Science Library Edition),Peter R. Grant,Princeton University Press,2017-03-14,"After his famous visit to the Galápagos Islands, Darwin speculated that ""one might fancy that, from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends."" This book is the classic account of how much we have since learned about the evolution of these remarkable birds. Based upon over a decade's research, Grant shows how interspecific competition and natural selection act strongly enough on contemporary populations to produce observable and measurable evolutionary change. In this new edition, Grant outlines new discoveries made in the thirteen years since the book's publication. Ecology and Evolution of Darwin's Finches is an extraordinary account of evolution in action. Originally published in 1986. The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions.

"Current Issues in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Health",Jay Harcourt,Routledge,2013-04-11,"Learn what resources are needed for lesser-recognized LGBT health issues Most literature that explores LGBT health issues concentrates on HIV/AIDS while leaving research studies on other vital issues lacking. Current Issues in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Health addresses this inadequacy by presenting a broad range of LGBT health issues from an interdisciplinary and mixed-method perspective. Leading experts present both quantitative and qualitative descriptions of health issues among various population groups, focusing on those topics poorly represented in present-day literature. This book is a strong start to fill in the blanks about unrealized health issues of LGBT individuals and offers insights into the resources needed to address them. Methods to assess sexual orientation and gender identity are not normally found in most population-based research. Because of the diversity within the relatively small LGBT population, research has been forced to generalize, making it less likely to effectively contribute to quality health issue data for these individuals. The research presented in Current Issues in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Health takes particular care to specify how the orientation and sexual identity of study participants was measured. This book carefully mines previously unrevealed health disparities among LGBT populations across a broad spectrum of diseases—beyond the standard focus on HIV/AIDS. The most current and important studies are presented, including rare research on transgender health issues. The chapters are extensively referenced, and several include figures and tables to clarify and enhance understanding of the information. The wide range of topics in Current Issues in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Health include: the inclusion of sexual orientation questions in research studies comparison of mental health issues between women of different sexual orientations mental health issues among men of different sexual orientations and HIV status in Australia the impact of sexual identity distress and social support in GLBT youth issues transgender youth health issues female-to-male (FTM) transexuals’ experiences accessing health care research on LBT domestic violence survivors health needs of male-to-female (MTF) transgenders of color Current Issues in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Health is crucial, thought-provoking reading for researchers working in LGBT health, public health professionals working in community health and LGBT health, policymakers, advocates, public health and community health faculty, and students interested in LGBT health issues.",Social Science,203,N/A,0,en

Charney & Nestler's Neurobiology of Mental Illness,"Dennis S. Charney MD, Eric J. Nestler MD, PhD, Pamela Sklar MD, PhD, Joseph D. Buxbaum PhD",Oxford University Press,2017-11-29,"In the years following publication of the DSM-5®, the field of psychiatry has seen vigorous debate between the DSM's more traditional, diagnosis-oriented approach and the NIMH's more biological, dimension-based RDoC (research domain criteria) approach. Charney & Nestler's Neurobiology of Mental Illness is an authoritative foundation for translating information from the laboratory to clinical treatment, and its fifth edition extends beyond this reference function to acknowledge and examine the controversies, different camps, and thoughts on the future of psychiatric diagnosis. In this wider context, this book provides information from numerous levels of analysis, including molecular biology and genetics, cellular physiology, neuroanatomy, neuropharmacology, epidemiology, and behavior. Sections and chapters are edited and authored by experts at the top of their fields. No other book distills the basic science and underpinnings of mental disorders-and highlights practical clinical significance-to the scope and breadth of this classic text. In this edition, Section 1, which reviews the methods used to examine the biological basis of mental illness in animal and cell models and in humans, has been expanded to reflect critically important technical advances in complex genetics (including powerful sequencing technologies and related bioinformatics), epigenetics, stem cell biology, optogenetics, neural circuit functioning, cognitive neuroscience, and brain imaging. This range of established and emerging methodologies offer groundbreaking advances in our ability to study the brain as well as unique opportunities for the translation of preclinical and clinical research into badly needed breakthroughs in our therapeutic toolkit. Sections 2 through 7 cover the neurobiology and genetics of major psychiatric disorders: psychoses (including bipolar disorder), mood disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, dementias, and disorders of childhood onset. Also covered within these sections is a summary of current therapeutic approaches for these illnesses as well as the ways in which research advances are now guiding the search for new treatments. Each of these parts has been augmented in several different areas as a reflection of research progress. The last section, Section 8, reconfigured in this new edition, now focuses on diagnostic schemes for mental illness. This includes an overview of the unique challenges that remain in diagnosing these disorders given our still limited knowledge of disease etiology and pathophysiology. The section then provides reviews of DSM-5®, which forms the basis of psychiatric diagnosis in the United States for all clinical work, and of RDoC, which provides an alternative perspective on diagnosis in heavy use in the research community. Also included are chapters on future efforts toward precision and computational psychiatry, which promise to someday align diagnosis with underlying biological abnormalities.",Medical,1025,N/A,0,en

Social and Economic Networks,Matthew O. Jackson,Princeton University Press,2010-11-01,"Networks of relationships help determine the careers that people choose, the jobs they obtain, the products they buy, and how they vote. The many aspects of our lives that are governed by social networks make it critical to understand how they impact behavior, which network structures are likely to emerge in a society, and why we organize ourselves as we do. In Social and Economic Networks, Matthew Jackson offers a comprehensive introduction to social and economic networks, drawing on the latest findings in economics, sociology, computer science, physics, and mathematics. He provides empirical background on networks and the regularities that they exhibit, and discusses random graph-based models and strategic models of network formation. He helps readers to understand behavior in networked societies, with a detailed analysis of learning and diffusion in networks, decision making by individuals who are influenced by their social neighbors, game theory and markets on networks, and a host of related subjects. Jackson also describes the varied statistical and modeling techniques used to analyze social networks. Each chapter includes exercises to aid students in their analysis of how networks function.

Sibling Relationships Across the Life Span,Victor Cicirelli,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-03-14,"When one begins to examine the existing literature dealing with siblings, one soon becomes aware that many separate domains of sibling research exist and that there is little connection between them; for example, sibling relationships in early childhood, genetic and environmental influences on individual differences between siblings, dysfunctional sibling relation ships, adult sibling helping relationships, sibling violence and abuse, and so on. The author's aim in writing this book was to attempt to bring together for the first time studies from diverse areas of sibling research into a single volume. The book is a summary and integration of the various domains of sibling studies, extending across the life span where studies exist to make this possible. Although many gaps in the sibling research literature within and between domains of study and over the life span still exist, it is hoped that this book will motivate others to help fill in the gaps by suggesting direc tions where further research is needed.",Psychology,320,N/A,0,en
Dynamics of the Tropical Atmosphere and Oceans,Peter J. Webster,John Wiley & Sons,2020-06-08,"This book presents a unique and comprehensive view of the fundamental dynamical and thermodynamic principles underlying the large circulations of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system Dynamics of The Tropical Atmosphere and Oceans provides a detailed description of macroscale tropical circulation systems such as the monsoon, the Hadley and Walker Circulations, El Niño, and the tropical ocean warm pool. These macroscale circulations interact with a myriad of higher frequency systems, ranging from convective cloud systems to migrating equatorial waves that attend the low-frequency background flow. Towards understanding and predicting these circulation systems. A comprehensive overview of the dynamics and thermodynamics of large-scale tropical atmosphere and oceans is presented using both a “reductionist” and “holistic” perspectives of the coupled tropical system. The reductionist perspective provides a detailed description of the individual elements of the ocean and atmospheric circulations. The physical nature of each component of the tropical circulation such as the Hadley and Walker circulations, the monsoon, the incursion of extratropical phenomena into the tropics, precipitation distributions, equatorial waves and disturbances described in detail. The holistic perspective provides a physical description of how the collection of the individual components produces the observed tropical weather and climate. How the collective tropical processes determine the tropical circulation and their role in global weather and climate is provided in a series of overlapping theoretical and modelling constructs. The structure of the book follows a graduated framework. Following a detailed description of tropical phenomenology, the reader is introduced to dynamical and thermodynamical constraints that guide the planetary climate and establish a critical role for the tropics. Equatorial wave theory is developed for simple and complex background flows, including the critical role played by moist processes. The manner in which the tropics and the extratropics interact is then described, followed by a discussion of the physics behind the subtropical and near-equatorial precipitation including arid regions. The El Niño phenomena and the monsoon circulations are discussed, including their covariance and predictability. Finally, the changing structure of the tropics is discussed in terms of the extent of the tropical ocean warm pool and its relationship to the intensity of global convection and climate change. Dynamics of the Tropical Atmosphere and Oceans is aimed at advanced undergraduate and early career graduate students. It also serves as an excellent general reference book for scientists interested in tropical circulations and their relationship with the broader climate system.",Science,529,1,1,en

This multidisciplinary text highlights the development of romantic relationships, from initiation to commitment or demise, by highlighting the historical context, current research and theory, and diversity of patterns. Engagingly written with colorful examples, the authors examine the joy, stress, power-struggles, intimacy, and aggression that characterize these relationships. Readers gain a better understanding as to why, even after the pain and suffering associated with a breakup, most of us go right back out and start again. Relationships are examined through an interdisciplinary lens –psychological, sociological, environmental and communicative perspectives are all considered.

Elevations,Richard A. Cohen,University of Chicago Press,1994-10-26,"Elevations is a series of closely related essays on the ground-breaking philosophical and theological work of Emmanuel Levinas and Franz Rosenzweig, two of the twentieth century's most important Jewish philosophers. Focusing on the concept of transcendence, Richard A. Cohen shows that Rosenzweig and Levinas join the wisdom of revealed religions to the work of traditional philosophers to create a philosophy charged with the tasks of ethics and justice. He describes how they articulated a responsible humanism and a new enlightenment which would place moral obligation to the other above all other human concerns. This elevating pull of an ethics that can account for the relation of self and other without reducing either term is the central theme of these essays. Cohen also explores the ethical philosophy of these two thinkers in relation to Nietzsche, Husserl, Heidegger, Buber, Sartre, and Derrida. The result is one of the most wide-ranging and lucid studies yet written on these crucial figures in philosophy and Jewish thought.",Philosophy,376,N/A,0,en

Beyond Empathy,"Richard G. Erskine, Janet P. Moursund, Rebecca L. Trautmann",Taylor & Francis,2022-09-30,"Written by leaders in the field of relational integrative psychotherapy, this book offers trainees and experienced therapists a methodology for assisting people in rediscovering their ability to maintain genuine relationships and, thus, better psychological health. This classic edition includes a new preface by Richard G. Erskine that reflects on changes in the field since the book’s first publication. Drawing from Rogers' client-centered therapy, Berne's transactional analysis, Perls' Gestalt therapy, Kohut's self-psychology, and the work of British object-relations theorists, this book accessibly introduces the authors’ Keyhole theory while using real life interchanges between therapists and clients to illustrate key concepts. The second part of the book details the application of this method in therapy work and provides transcripts from seven therapy sessions. These include examples of relational psychotherapy, psychotherapeutic regression, working with a parental introject, couple psychotherapy, as well as detailed explanations of the therapeutic methods. An undoubtable classic, the book’s conversational style makes the theory and methods of a relationally based integrative psychotherapy come alive. This versatile approach to therapy promises to be effective across a wide range of therapeutic situations, making this a valuable book for both students and practicing clinicians throughout the spectrum of mental healthcare providers.",Psychology,379,N/A,0,en

The Secret Language of Intimacy,Robert G.

In the first part of the book, Robert Lee presents the ""Secret Language of Intimacy Workshop,"" developed and presented for the first time at the 1998 Annual Conference of the Association for the Advancement of Gestalt Therapy. Lee not only describes how the hidden forces of shame and belonging regulate couple dynamics, but also how the workshop itself has facilitated the acceptance of these forces and promoted therapeutic resolution, utilizing clinical vignettes. The second half of the book is comprised of internationally contributed essays from leading names in the Gestalt perspective, each adding to and redefining the role of shame and belonging in the theory and practice of Gestalt couples therapy.

Supermarkets and Agri-food Supply Chains,"David Burch, Geoffrey Lawrence",Edward Elgar Publishing,2007,"This book analyses the gradual shift in the distribution of power in agri-food supply chains, away from the manufacturers of branded food products to the global supermarket chains such as Wal-Mart and Tesco. This transformation has had a profound effect on the food we eat, together with the ways in which food is produced, processed and marketed. The authors assess the causes and consequences of this transformation, and evaluate the impacts along the whole supply chain. The book considers a variety of theoretical and cultural approaches to the analysis of change in the organization and management of the agri-food supply chain, and presents a series of studies focusing upon the effects of changes in Europe, North America and less developed countries. The impacts on farmers and workers, and implications for the environment, are also considered. The contested nature of these changes suggests a number of possible future scenarios for the global agri-food system, which are also analysed and evaluated. This book will be of great interest to postgraduate and undergraduate students in business studies, sociology, politics, geography, and cultural studies. Academic researchers and teachers, and policy makers and researchers in business, government and industry will also find much of interest.",Business & Economics,360,N/A,0,en

Mechanisms of the Relationship Between Childhood Attachment and Adult Anxiety and Depression,Christine Diane Scher,N/A,2000,"Childhood insecure attachment has been linked to almost every category of DSM-IV psychopathology in adulthood. Nonetheless, few studies have examined the mechanisms that lead from childhood attachment to later psychopathology, and few explanations have been offered to explain how attachment is linked to such varied phenomena. Thus, to better understand the role of early attachment in the development of adult psychological disturbance, the current study examined a causal model of relationships between childhood attachment and later anxiety and depression suggested by schema and attachment theories. Specifically, current attachment schemas were expected to mediate relationships between childhood attachment experiences and adult psychological distress. Four hypotheses were examined: (1) anxious attachment schemas mediate relationships between parental threatening behavior and anxious symptomatology, (2) anxious attachment schemas mediate relationships between parental threatening behavior and anxious affect, (3) dependable attachment schemas mediate relationships between parental hostility and rejection and depressive symptomatology, and (4) dependable attachment schemas mediate relationships between parental hostility and rejection and depressive affect. To test these hypotheses, 68 introductory psychology students with nonclinical levels of psychological distress participated in 4 longitudinal study. Students completed self-report measures of anxious and depressive symptomatology and affect, adult attachment schemas, and childhood attachment experiences during an initial research session. Eight weeks later, after completion of their fourth introductory psychology midterm, students again completed measures of anxious and depressive symptomatology and affect, as well as an interview assessing the stressful impact of the midterm. Regression analyses did not support the four mediational hypotheses. Nonetheless, two findings provide support for the idea that childhood attachment experiences differentially predict adult attachment schemas: (1) parental threatening behaviors predicted anxious attachment schemas, F(1,66) = 8.24, p",Anxiety,196,N/A,0,en

Unfuck Your Boundaries,"Faith G. Harper, PhD, LPC-S, ACS, ACN",Microcosm Publishing,2020-01-14,"Boundaries are the ways we communicate our needs.

Human Motivation and Interpersonal Relationships,Netta Weinstein,Springer Science & Business Media,2014-07-08,"This volume summarizes and organizes a growing body of research supporting the role of motivation in adaptive and rewarding interpersonal interactions with others. The field of human motivation is rapidly growing but most studies have focused on the effects of motivation on individuals' personal happiness and task engagement. Only recently have theorists and empiricists begun to recognize that dispositional and state motivations impact the ways individuals approach interpersonal interactions. In addition, researchers are now recognizing that the quality of interpersonal interactions influences consequent happiness and task engagement, thus helping to explain previous findings to this end. Similarly social psychology and relationships researchers have focused on the impact of cognitions, emotions, and behaviors on people's relationships. In their work, relationships researchers demonstrate that both contextual characteristics and individual differences influence the quality of interactions. Many of these studies seek to understand which characteristics strengthen the bonds between people, encourage empathy and trust and create a sense of well-being after a close interaction. This work seeks to integrate the field of human motivation and interpersonal relationships. Both fields have seen extensive growth in the past decade and each can contribute to the other. However, no single compiled work is available that targets both fields. This is the case, in part because only now is there enough work to make a strong and compelling case for their integration. In the previous years, research has been conducted to show that motivation is relevant and important for interactions among strangers and in close relationships. In addition developmental mechanisms for these relations are identified and mechanisms by which motivation strengthens people's relationships. Finally recent work has demonstrated the many implications for interpersonal relationships, showing that motivation impacts a range of interpersonal processes from prejudice regulation and objectification of others to empathy and care. This book seeks to summarize and organize all these findings and present them in a way that is relevant to both motivation researchers and social and relationship researchers.",Psychology,355,N/A,0,en

Hidden in Plain Sight,Avrum G Weiss,Lasting Impact Press,2021-09-21,"Pussy-whipped. Why is it that the worst thing one man can say about another is that he is controlled by a woman, or more precisely, by his need for a woman? The surprising answer hidden in plain sight is this: Most straight men are scared of their intimate partners.Men's fears of women are one of the primary causes of many emotional problems for men and of their difficulties in intimate heterosexual relationships, yet men have done such a good job of hiding their fears and vulnerabilities that even their mothers and lovers don't know how scared they are. Men's fears of women include: the fear of being dominated and controlled by women; fear of being entrapped by women; fear of being responsible for women; fear of being inadequate; fear of being abandoned; and fear of being feminized.Male readers will recognize that this is a male-positive book, written by a man about the male perspective on relationships in a way that will not make them feel inadequate or shamed. At the same time, the book's topic will interest women who often feel in the dark about men's internal experience, and who will be intrigued by the opportunity to have a peek into the secret lives of men, to learn more about the counter-intuitive idea that men are as scared of them as they are of men. Hidden in Plain Sight: How Men's Fears of Women Shape Their Intimate Relationships is a psychological non-fiction book about relationships and the hidden internal world of men. The book presents many scenarios with prescriptive content and guidance woven throughout. It is written for a popular audience in intelligent yet accessible, relatable language.",,294,N/A,0,en

Motivated Cognition in Relationships,"Sandra L. Murray, John G. Holmes",Routledge,2017-03-03,"How can newlyweds believe they will be together forever, while knowing that the majority of marriages end in divorce? Why do people who desperately want to be loved end up alienating those who love them? How can partners that seem like complete opposites end up blissfully happy? This volume explores such fascinating questions. Murray and Holmes outline how basic motivations to be safe from being hurt and find value and meaning control how people feel, think, and behave in close relationships. Additionally, the authors highlight how these motivations infuse romantic life through succinct and accessible descriptions of cutting-edge empirical research and vivid evolving stories of four couples confronting different challenges in their relationship. Integrating ideas from the interdependence, goals, and embodiment literatures, this book puts a provocative new spin on seminal findings from two decades of collaborative research. The book: provides a new, interdependence-based, perspective on motivated cognition in close relationships; advances a dyadic perspective that explores how motivation shapes perception and cognition in ways that result in motivation-consistent behavior; examines how ""goal-driven"" cognition translates a person’s wishes, desires, and preferences into judgement and behavior, and ultimately, his or her romantic partner’s relationship reality; offers a refreshing argument that the ultimate effects of motivated cognition on satisfaction and stability depend on whether the motivations which most frequently guide perception and cognition match the reality constraints imposed by the perceiver, the partner, and the characteristics of the relationship. This book is essential for social and personality psychologists and will also be valuable to clinical psychologists and clinicians who work directly with couples to effect more happy and stable relationships. Advanced undergraduate and graduate students will find it a highly engaging compendium for understanding how motivation shapes affect, cognition, and behavior in close relationships.",Psychology,339,N/A,0,en

Platonic,"Marisa G. Franco, PhD",Penguin,2022-09-06,"Instant New York Times bestseller Is understanding the science of attachment the key to building lasting friendships and finding “your people” in an ever-more-fragmented world? How do we make and keep friends in an era of distraction, burnout, and chaos, especially in a society that often prizes romantic love at the expense of other relationships? In Platonic, Dr. Marisa G. Franco unpacks the latest, often counterintuitive findings about the bonds between us—for example, why your friends aren’t texting you back (it’s not because they hate you!), and the myth of “friendships happening organically” (making friends, like cultivating any relationship, requires effort!). As Dr. Franco explains, to make and keep friends you must understand your attachment style—secure, anxious, or avoidant: it is the key to unlocking what’s working (and what’s failing) in your friendships. Making new friends, and deepening longstanding relationships, is possible at any age—in fact, it’s essential. The good news: there are specific, research-based ways to improve the number and quality of your connections using the insights of attachment theory and the latest scientific research on friendship. Platonic provides a clear and actionable blueprint for forging strong, lasting connections with others—and for becoming our happiest, most fulfilled selves in the process.",Self-Help,337,N/A,0,en

If the relationship you have with your significant other is defined more by companionship than passion . . . if you love each other deeply but are not deeply in love . . . if you feel that something's missing or is no longer there . . . then you could be experiencing ILYB (I Love You, But . . .). In I Love You, but I'm Not in Love with You --a real-life relationship guide from couples' counselor Andrew G. Marshall--partners and individuals who have “fallen out of love” or want to rekindle the love that once was will learn how to use Marshall 's program with impressive results. This is a much-needed book to help men and women of all ages in any type of committed romantic relationship to truly understand love and to point out the everyday habits that undermine growing together. Marshall's research is one of the few that delves into what causes relationships to “cool” or for emotions to be “dulled.” So much more than a quick-fix guide, I Love You, but I'm Not In Love with You empowers couples to emerge with a better understanding of themselves and each other, and ultimately build a stronger, more passionate bond. Learn how to: • Argue productively and address the core of the issue • Employ the trigger words for more effective communication • Find a balance between being fulfilled as an individual and being one half of a couple • Discover if the ILYB is simply a symptom of a workable problem • Take your sex life to a deeper level of intimacy • Create new bonds instead of searching for the old ones",Family & Relationships,320,N/A,0,en

The Radicality of Love,Srećko Horvat,John Wiley & Sons,2016-01-11,"What would happen if we could stroll through the revolutionary history of the 20th century and, without any fear of the possible responses, ask the main protagonists - from Lenin to Che Guevara, from Alexandra Kollontai to Ulrike Meinhof - seemingly naïve questions about love? Although all important political and social changes of the 20th century included heated debates on the role of love, it seems that in the 21st century of new technologies of the self (Grindr, Tinder, online dating, etc.) we are faced with a hyperinflation of sex, not love. By going back to the sexual revolution of the October Revolution and its subsequent repression, to Che's dilemma between love and revolutionary commitment and to the period of '68 (from communes to terrorism) and its commodification in late capitalism, the Croatian philosopher Srecko Horvat gives a possible answer to the question of why it is that the most radical revolutionaries like Lenin or Che were scared of the radicality of love. What is so radical about a seemingly conservative notion of love and why is it anything but conservative? This short book is a modest contribution to the current upheavals around the world - from Tahrir to Taksim, from Occupy Wall Street to Hong Kong, from Athens to Sarajevo - in which the question of love is curiously, surprisingly, absent.",Philosophy,120,N/A,0,en

"Love, H",Hettie Jones,Duke University Press,2016-09-22,"""It works, we're in business, yeah Babe!"" So begins this remarkable selection from a forty-year correspondence between two artists who survived their time as wives in the Beat bohemia of the 1960s and went on to successful artistic careers of their own. From their first meeting in 1960, writer Hettie Jones—then married to LeRoi Jones (Amiri Baraka)—and painter and sculptor Helene Dorn (1927–2004), wife of poet Ed Dorn, found in each other more than friendship. They were each other's confidant, emotional support, and unflagging partner through difficulties, defeats, and victories, from surviving divorce and struggling as single mothers, to finding artistic success in their own right. Revealing the intimacy of lifelong friends, these letters tell two stories from the shared point of view of women who refused to go along with society’s expectations. Jones frames her and Helene's story, adding details and explanations while filling in gaps in the narrative. As she writes, ""we'd fled the norm for women then, because to live it would have been a kind of death."" Apart from these two personal stories, there are, as well, reports from the battlegrounds of women's rights and tenant's rights, reflections on marriage and motherhood, and contemplation of the past to which these two had remained irrevocably connected. Prominent figures such as Allen Ginsberg and Timothy Leary appear as well, making Love, H an important addition to literature on the Beats. Above all, this book is a record of the changing lives of women artists as the twentieth century became the twenty-first, and what it has meant for women considering such a life today. It's worth a try, Jones and Dorn show us, offering their lives as proof that it can be done.",Literary Collections,278,N/A,0,en

Understanding Postmodern Family Therapy,Kelsey Railsback,Taylor & Francis,2024-11-29,"This accessible textbook provides therapy students and practitioners with an understanding of postmodern theories, founders, and practical applications to family therapy. It introduces complex concepts in bite-sized pieces so readers can cultivate and master competent real-world applications of postmodern philosophy in therapy. Relying predominantly on primary sources, Kelsey Railsback shows how postmodernist ideas influenced the development and implementation of postmodern family therapy models, focusing on collaborative-dialogic practice, narrative therapy, and solution focused brief therapy. It describes why certain therapeutic techniques developed and explains the context and history of their development. Each section begins with an introduction to the model before moving to the philosopher and ending with the founders’ application of philosophical ideas to therapy techniques. These chapters summarize prominent ideas from esteemed professionals in their fields, covering the philosophical pioneers Wittgenstein, Foucault, and Gergen and the therapy pioneers Anderson, White, Epston, de Shazer, Berg, and more. Critically, this book demonstrates how postmodern theory can be applied in mental health practice.

The First Humans,"Frederick E. Grine, John G Fleagle, Richard E. Leakey",Springer Science & Business Media,2009-05-24,"There are some issues in human paleontology that seem to be timeless. Most deal with the origin and early evolution of our own genus – something about which we should care. Some of these issues pertain to taxonomy and systematics. How many species of Homo were there in the Pliocene and Pleistocene? How do we identify the earliest members the genus Homo? If there is more than one Plio-Pleistocene species, how do they relate to one another, and where and when did they evolve? Other issues relate to questions about body size, proportions and the functional adaptations of the locomotor skeleton. When did the human postcranial “Bauplan” evolve, and for what reasons? What behaviors (and what behavioral limitations) can be inferred from the postcranial bones that have been attributed to Homo habilis and Homo erectus? Still other issues relate to growth, development and life history strategies, and the biological and archeological evidence for diet and behavior in early Homo. It is often argued that dietary change played an important role in the origin and early evolution of our genus, with stone tools opening up scavenging and hunting opportunities that would have added meat protein to the diet of Homo. Still other issues relate to the environmental and climatic context in which this genus evolved.",Social Science,217,N/A,0,en

System Test and Diagnosis,"William R. Simpson, John W. Sheppard",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"System Test and Diagnosis is the first book on test and diagnosis at the system level, defined as any aggregation of related elements that together form an entity of sufficient complexity for which it is impractical to treat all of the elements at the lowest level of detail. The ideas presented emphasize that it is possible to diagnose complex systems efficiently. Since the notion of system is hierarchical, these ideas are applicable to all levels. The philosophy is presented in the context of a model-based approach, using the information flow model, that focuses on the information provided by the tests rather than the functions embedded in the system. Detailed algorithms are offered for evaluating system testability, performing efficient diagnosis, verifying and validating the models, and constructing an architecture for system maintenance. Several advanced algorithms, not commonly available in existing diagnosis tools, are discussed, including reasoning with inexact or uncertain test data, breaking large problems into manageable smaller problems, diagnosing systems with time sensitive information and time dependent tests and learning from experience. The book is divided into three parts. The first part provides motivation for careful development of the subject and the second part provides the tools necessary for analyzing system testability and computing diagnostic strategies. The third part presents advanced topics in diagnosis. Several case studies are provided, including a single detailed case study. Smaller case studies describe experiences from actual applications of the methods discussed. The detailed case study walks the reader through a complete analysis of a system to illustrate the concepts and describe the analyses that are possible. All case studies are based upon real systems that have been modeled for the purposes of diagnosis. System Test and Diagnosis is the culmination of nearly twelve years of research into diagnosis modeling and its applications. It is designed as a primary reference for engineers and practitioners interested in system test and diagnosis.",Technology & Engineering,389,N/A,0,en

It concentrates 011 Ilew developments concerning galaxies seen at large look back times. This seemed also a good opportunity to look ahead to the next generation of ground- and space based instrumentation, and to consider various future strategies for collecting information concerning the edge of the observable universe. The main idea was to bring together people with specialities in modelling galaxy components (such as stars, clusters, gas, and dust) as well as whole stellar systems (stellar populations, star formation rates, chemical enrichment), and people specialized in making direct measurements of galaxies and clusters at large look back times. The confrontation of expectations and observations was planned to be the central theme of the conference, which explains the title ""Towards Understanding Galaxies at Large Redshift"". The first part of the workshop focussed on the physical processes that operate in galaxies, and that would likely have some observable manifestation at large redshifts. In the second part the most recent observational work was reported, and we were pleased to have the participation of most of the groups active in this field. The last part was directed towards new approaches to be made possible by the next generation of instrumentation, although in general all the contributions were indeed in this spirit of setting more ambitious goals.",Science,346,N/A,0,en

Crying in H Mart,Michelle Zauner,Vintage,2021-04-20,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • From the indie rock sensation known as Japanese Breakfast, an unforgettable memoir about family, food, grief, love, and growing up Korean American—“in losing her mother and cooking to bring her back to life, Zauner became herself” (NPR). • CELEBRATING OVER ONE YEAR ON THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER LIST In this exquisite story of family, food, grief, and endurance, Michelle Zauner proves herself far more than a dazzling singer, songwriter, and guitarist. With humor and heart, she tells of growing up one of the few Asian American kids at her school in Eugene, Oregon; of struggling with her mother's particular, high expectations of her; of a painful adolescence; of treasured months spent in her grandmother's tiny apartment in Seoul, where she and her mother would bond, late at night, over heaping plates of food. As she grew up, moving to the East Coast for college, finding work in the restaurant industry, and performing gigs with her fledgling band--and meeting the man who would become her husband--her Koreanness began to feel ever more distant, even as she found the life she wanted to live. It was her mother's diagnosis of terminal cancer, when Michelle was twenty-five, that forced a reckoning with her identity and brought her to reclaim the gifts of taste, language, and history her mother had given her. Vivacious and plainspoken, lyrical and honest, Zauner's voice is as radiantly alive on the page as it is onstage. Rich with intimate anecdotes that will resonate widely, and complete with family photos, Crying in H Mart is a book to cherish, share, and reread.",Biography & Autobiography,257,4,1,en

The Organization Family,"Gary L. Bowen, Dennis Orthner",Praeger,1989-08-22,"A penetrating analysis of the changing and interacting worlds of work and family life in the U.S. military, this volume extends the concept of the organization man to focus on the organization family. Based on the most recent literature and research on work and family dynamics in the military services today, the contributors examine such issues as the special problems of dual career couples and single parents, the challenge of rebuilding military communities, and the influence of family factors on the workplace. Taken together, their essays advance our understanding of the nature and dynamics of the work/family interface. This work also presents some significant policy implications for military leadership and family life professionals interested in forging a more productive partnership between the military organization and the military family. The book is divided into three major sections, each of which addresses a key aspect of work and family life: work and family linkages, the problems of special population groups, and the organizational response to family-level issues in the workplace. Each chapter provides a theoretical and/or historical perspective on the topic under study as well as presenting the latest empirical research in the area. Throughout, the contributors draw relevant comparisons between the military and civilian employment sectors, making the book invaluable for advanced students of military and family sociology, contemporary family patterns and issues, and public policy.",Family & Relationships,236,N/A,0,en

Humble Leadership,"Edgar H. Schein, Peter A. Schein",Berrett-Koehler Publishers,2018-08-14,"The more traditional forms of leadership that are based on static hierarchies and professional distance between leaders and followers are growing increasingly outdated and ineffective. As organizations face more complex interdependent tasks, leadership must become more personal in order to insure open trusting communication that will make more collaborative problem solving and innovation possible. Without open and trusting communications throughout organizations, they will continue to face the productivity and quality problems that result from reward systems that emphasize individual competition and “climbing the corporate ladder”. Authors Edgar Schein and Peter Schein recognize this reality and call for a reimagined form of leadership that coincides with emerging trends of relationship building, complex group work, diverse workforces, and cultures in which everyone feels psychologically safe. Humble Leadership calls for “here and now” humility based on a deeper understanding of the constantly evolving complexities of interpersonal, group and intergroup relationships that require shifting our focus towards the process of group dynamics and collaboration. Humble Leadership at all levels and in all working groups will be the key to achieving the creativity, adaptiveness, and agility that organizations will need to survive and grow.",Business & Economics,183,N/A,0,en

Library/vendor Relationships,"Sam Brooks, David H. Carlson",Psychology Press,2006,"A view of the mutual dependence between libraries and vendors As technology advances, libraries are forced to reach beyond their own resources to find effective ways to maintain accuracy and superior service levels. Vendors provide databases and integrated library systems that perform those functions for profit. Library/Vendor Relationships examines the increasing cooperation in which libraries find they must participate in, and vice versa, with the vendors that provide system infrastructure and software. Expert contributors provide insights from all sides of this unique collaboration, offering cogent perspectives on the give and take process that every librarian, publisher, and database provider/producer can use. The symbiosis between libraries and vendors of databases relies heavily upon open communication to achieve each one's beneficial results. Library/Vendor Relationships explores this partnership between profit and nonprofit entities in detail, focusing on issues of crucial importance for both sides. A variety of diverse types of libraries and vendors give voice to the multitude of issues facing them. Several charts, graphs, and other helpful visuals are included. Topics in Library/Vendor Relationships include: options for preventing systematic downloading of material benefits and challenges of delivering products on multiple platformsusing the American Psychological Association's experiences as a case study book vendors' efforts to help libraries become more efficient comprehensive online support services to help increase interaction between libraries and academic publishers Anatolian University Libraries Consortium's effective relationship with vendors publisher and vendor use of library advisory boards to provide needed feedback a review of the database marketplace fostering a good relationship between library and vendor the future of government libraries in an increasingly technological age collaboration in standards development integrated ecommerce the relationship between OCLC and member institutions libraries' position between commerce and science vendor/community college library relationships e-mail discussion lists and more!

Women and Public Policy in Canada is the groundbreaking collection by public policy scholars from across Canada that establishes an understanding of neoliberalism's impact on Canadian women and public policy and also builds a framework for theorizing future policy directions. Students will discover how a wide variety of public policy issues relate to gender in Canada through first-hand exposure to current policy research on topics such as child care, employment insurance programs, health care, climate change, race and inequality, anti-violence, and same-sex marriage. Students will also engage with the possibilities for inconsistencies and interruptions in neoliberalism, making this text an indispensable resource both for those requiring an up-to-date understanding of the topic and for current and future designers of public policy in Canada.",Language Arts & Disciplines,268,N/A,0,en

A Course in Miracles Made Easy,Alan Cohen,"Hay House, Inc",2015-10-27,"A Course in Miracles (ACIM)—the self-study spiritual-thought system that teaches the way to love and forgiveness—has captured the minds and hearts of millions of people, and delivered inner peace where fear and pain once prevailed. Its universal message is unsurpassed in its power to heal. Yet many students report that they have difficulty grasping the principles, or encounter resistance to the lessons. So, even while they yearn for the spiritual freedom the Course offers, they put the book aside, hoping one day to get to it. Alan Cohen, ACIM student and teacher for over 30 years, takes the Big Picture ideas of the Course and brings them down to earth in practical, easy-to-understand lessons with plenty of real-life examples and applications. A Course in Miracles Made Easy is the Rosetta stone that will render the Course understandable and relatable; and, most importantly, generate practical, healing results in the lives of students. This unique reader-friendly guide will serve longtime students of the Course, as well as those seeking to acquaint themselves with the program.","Body, Mind & Spirit",233,N/A,0,en

Ultralearning,Scott H. Young,HarperCollins,2019-08-06,"Now a Wall Street Journal bestseller. Learn a new talent, stay relevant, reinvent yourself, and adapt to whatever the workplace throws your way. Ultralearning offers nine principles to master hard skills quickly. This is the essential guide to future-proof your career and maximize your competitive advantage through self-education. In these tumultuous times of economic and technological change, staying ahead depends on continual self-education—a lifelong mastery of fresh ideas, subjects, and skills. If you want to accomplish more and stand apart from everyone else, you need to become an ultralearner. The challenge of learning new skills is that you think you already know how best to learn, as you did as a student, so you rerun old routines and old ways of solving problems. To counter that, Ultralearning offers powerful strategies to break you out of those mental ruts and introduces new training methods to help you push through to higher levels of retention. Scott H. Young incorporates the latest research about the most effective learning methods and the stories of other ultralearners like himself—among them Benjamin Franklin, chess grandmaster Judit Polgár, and Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynman, as well as a host of others, such as little-known modern polymath Nigel Richards, who won the French World Scrabble Championship—without knowing French. Young documents the methods he and others have used to acquire knowledge and shows that, far from being an obscure skill limited to aggressive autodidacts, ultralearning is a powerful tool anyone can use to improve their career, studies, and life. Ultralearning explores this fascinating subculture, shares a proven framework for a successful ultralearning project, and offers insights into how you can organize and exe - cute a plan to learn anything deeply and quickly, without teachers or budget-busting tuition costs. Whether the goal is to be fluent in a language (or ten languages), earn the equivalent of a college degree in a fraction of the time, or master multiple tools to build a product or business from the ground up, the principles in Ultralearning will guide you to success.",Business & Economics,278,N/A,0,en

The book draws upon wisdom from history, geography, culture, religion, the wisdom of the ancients, as well as writings and examples from all over the world. The book posits that there is a universality in the message of Honour that can prove valuable to all who would care to reflect on how to sustain success in one's life, family, community, organisation and/or nation.The purpose of this book is to invite you to think about what winning in life actually means, and seeks to raise consciousness about the virtue of Honour in our lives, particularly in the two dimensions of 'Honouring Our Word' and 'Honouring Each Other'.Segmented into 10 parts and drawing from a collection of wisdom literature, the book posits that Honour does not just explain Singapore's journey from Third World Economy to First World Economy in a generation, but is an essential virtue that undergirds purposefulness in life, happiness in family, stability in society, advantage in business, success in leadership, and security in the nation. Written in a unique format that is accessible to people from all walks of life, the book seeks to showcase what is possible if imagination and human enterprise are coupled with honour.",Business & Economics,472,N/A,0,en

"Your Father, Your Self",Barry H. Gordon,Carol Publishing Corporation,1996,"Through workshops and in group, individual, and family therapy, Dr. Gordon has helped hundreds of men and women find greater peace in their relationships with their fathers. Here he identifies nine types of disconnected fathers. He encourages readers to search for the source of their troubles by offering fundamental ways in which relationships with fathers may break down, depending on the father's personality type. Your Father, Your Self covers two aspects of relationships with a father: restoring the son's or daughter's psychological well-being by healing the emotional wounds that result from failure to connect with one's father and attempting to change and heal the current relationship between them. Through hundreds of case studies, this insightful work captures what it is like to resolve and heal father relationships. It highlights how the pathways and struggles differ significantly according to the personality of the father and the gender of the child. Effective means of dealing with the power, weakness, or absence of the father are described, such as how to respond to an autocratic father's continued need to control or how to relate to a perfectionist father. The book demonstrates the emotional rewards of working hard to heal relationships with one's father, including a new self-perspective and improved relationships not only with fathers, but with other family members, friends, children, and coworkers. Your Father, Your Self is a poignant and moving reminder of the powerful role a father plays in our lives and of the emotional imperatives that lead us to seek a deeper union with him.",Father and child,0,N/A,0,en

The Oxford Handbook of Compassion Science,"Emma M. Seppälä, Emiliana Simon-Thomas, Stephanie L. Brown, Monica C. Worline, C. Daryl Cameron, James R. Doty",Oxford University Press,2017-09-26,"How do we define compassion? Is it an emotional state, a motivation, a dispositional trait, or a cultivated attitude? How does it compare to altruism and empathy? Chapters in this Handbook present critical scientific evidence about compassion in numerous conceptions. All of these approaches to thinking about compassion are valid and contribute importantly to understanding how we respond to others who are suffering. Covering multiple levels of our lives and self-concept, from the individual, to the group, to the organization and culture, The Oxford Handbook of Compassion Science gathers evidence and models of compassion that treat the subject of compassion science with careful scientific scrutiny and concern. It explores the motivators of compassion, the effect on physiology, the co-occurrence of wellbeing, and compassion training interventions. Sectioned by thematic approaches, it pulls together basic and clinical research ranging across neurobiological, developmental, evolutionary, social, clinical, and applied areas in psychology such as business and education. In this sense, it comprises one of the first multidisciplinary and systematic approaches to examining compassion from multiple perspectives and frames of reference. With contributions from well-established scholars as well as young rising stars in the field, this Handbook bridges a wide variety of diverse perspectives, research methodologies, and theory, and provides a foundation for this new and rapidly growing field. It should be of great value to the new generation of basic and applied researchers examining compassion, and serve as a catalyst for academic researchers and students to support and develop the modern world.",Psychology,557,N/A,0,en

"Fat Art, Thin Art",Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick,Duke University Press,1994-08-12,"Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick is best known as a cultural and literary critic, as one of the primary forces behind the development of queer and gay/lesbian studies, and as author of several influential books: Tendencies, Epistemology of the Closet, and Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire. The publication of Fat Art, Thin Art, Sedgwick’s first volume of poetry, opens up another dimension of her continuing project of crossing and re-crossing the electrified boundaries between theory, lyric, and narrative. Embodying a decades-long adventure, the poems collected here offer the most accessible and definitive formulations to appear anywhere in Sedgwick’s writing on some characteristic subjects and some new ones: passionate attachments within and across genders; queer childhoods of many kinds; the performativity of a long, unconventional marriage; depressiveness, hilarity, and bliss; grave illness; despised and magnetic bodies and bodily parts. In two long fictional poems, a rich narrative momentum engages readers in the mysterious places—including Victorian novels—where characters, sexualities, and fates are unmade and made. Sedgwick’s poetry opens an unfamiliar, intimate, daring space that steadily refigures not only what a critic may be, but what a poem can do.",Poetry,170,N/A,0,en
The H Factor of Personality,"Kibeom Lee, Michael C. Ashton",Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press,2013-05-21,"The “H” in the H factor stands for “Honesty-Humility,” one of the six basic dimensions of the human personality. People who have high levels of H are sincere and modest; people who have low levels are deceitful and pretentious. It isn’t intuitively obvious that traits of honesty and humility go hand in hand, and until very recently the H factor hadn’t been recognized as a basic dimension of personality. But scientific evidence shows that traits of honesty and humility form a unified group of personality traits, separate from those of the other five groups identified several decades ago. This book, written by the discoverers of the H factor, explores the scientific findings that show the importance of this personality dimension in various aspects of people’s lives: their approaches to money, power, and sex; their inclination to commit crimes or obey the law; their attitudes about society, politics, and religion; and their choice of friends and spouse. Finally, the book provides ways of identifying people who are low in the H factor, as well as advice on how to raise one’s own level of H.",Psychology,210,N/A,0,en

How I Became Hettie Jones,Hettie Jones,Open Road + Grove/Atlantic,2007-12-01,"“A thoughtful, intimate memoir of life in the burgeoning movement of new jazz, poetry, and politics . . . in Lower Manhattan in the late 1950s and early 1960s” (Alix Kate Shulman, The Nation). Greenwich Village in the 1950s was a haven to which young poets, painters, and musicians flocked. Among them was Hettie Cohen, who’d been born into a middle-class Jewish family in Queens and who’d chosen to cross racial barriers to marry African American poet LeRoi Jones. This is her reminiscence of life in the awakening East Village in the era of the Beats, Black Power, and bohemia. “As the wife of controversial black playwright-poet LeRoi Jones (now Amiri Baraka), Hettie Cohen, a white Jew from Queens, NY, plunged into the Greenwich Village bohemia of jazz, poetry, leftish politics and underground publishing in the late 1950s. Their life together ended in 1965, partly, she implies, because of separatist pressures on blacks to end their interracial marriages. In this restrained autobiographical mix of introspection and gossip, the author writes of coping with racial prejudice and violence, raising two daughters, and of living in the shadow of her husband. When the couple divorced, she became a children’s book author and poet. The memoir is dotted with glimpses of Allen Ginsberg, Thelonious Monk, Jack Kerouac, Frank O’Hara, Billie Holiday, James Baldwin, Franz Kline, among others.” —Publishers Weekly",Biography & Autobiography,269,N/A,0,en

Named a Most Anticipated Book of 2022 by Oprah Daily ∙ Today ∙ Parade ∙ Marie Claire ∙ Bustle ∙ PopSugar ∙ Katie Couric Media ∙ Book Bub ∙ SheReads ∙ Medium ∙ The Washington Post ∙ and more! One summer. Two rivals. A plot twist they didn't see coming... Nora Stephens' life is books—she’s read them all—and she is not that type of heroine. Not the plucky one, not the laidback dream girl, and especially not the sweetheart. In fact, the only people Nora is a heroine for are her clients, for whom she lands enormous deals as a cutthroat literary agent, and her beloved little sister Libby. Which is why she agrees to go to Sunshine Falls, North Carolina for the month of August when Libby begs her for a sisters’ trip away—with visions of a small town transformation for Nora, who she’s convinced needs to become the heroine in her own story. But instead of picnics in meadows, or run-ins with a handsome country doctor or bulging-forearmed bartender, Nora keeps bumping into Charlie Lastra, a bookish brooding editor from back in the city. It would be a meet-cute if not for the fact that they’ve met many times and it’s never been cute. If Nora knows she’s not an ideal heroine, Charlie knows he’s nobody’s hero, but as they are thrown together again and again—in a series of coincidences no editor worth their salt would allow—what they discover might just unravel the carefully crafted stories they’ve written about themselves.",Fiction,417,5,3,en

Servant Leadership in Action,"Ken Blanchard, Rene Broadwell",Berrett-Koehler Publishers,2018-03-06,"From the author of The One-Minute Manager, a guide to leading others by serving them, featuring advice and tools from real-life leadership experts. We’ve all seen the negative impact of self-serving leaders in every sector of our society. Not infrequently, they end up bringing down their entire organization. But there is another way: servant leadership. Servant leaders lead by serving their people, not by exalting themselves. This collection features forty-four renowned servant leadership experts and practitioners—prominent business executives, bestselling authors, and respected spiritual leaders—who offer advice and tools for implementing this proven, but for some still radical, leadership model. Edited by legendary business author and lifelong servant leader Ken Blanchard and his longtime editor Renee Broadwell, this is the most comprehensive and wide-ranging guide ever published for what is, in every sense, a better way to lead. “Renowned expert Ken Blanchard with Renee Broadwell have assembled the insights of dozens of successful leaders in their new book Servant Leadership In Action. I doubt you will find any book or course on leadership that delivers a more on-target message of the essential element critical to being a truly great leader. Get a copy. Read it. Be it.” —Miami Herald “A comprehensive and inspiring book presented as a servant leadership primer, action plan and how-to guide, then concludes with proof of effectiveness and inspiration to go forward.

Family Values,"Harry Brighouse, Adam Swift",Princeton University Press,2016-08-02,"The family is hotly contested ideological terrain. Some defend the traditional two-parent heterosexual family while others welcome its demise. Opinions vary about how much control parents should have over their children's upbringing. Family Values provides a major new theoretical account of the morality and politics of the family, telling us why the family is valuable, who has the right to parent, and what rights parents should—and should not—have over their children. Harry Brighouse and Adam Swift argue that parent-child relationships produce the ""familial relationship goods"" that people need to flourish. Children's healthy development depends on intimate relationships with authoritative adults, while the distinctive joys and challenges of parenting are part of a fulfilling life for adults. Yet the relationships that make these goods possible have little to do with biology, and do not require the extensive rights that parents currently enjoy. Challenging some of our most commonly held beliefs about the family, Brighouse and Swift explain why a child's interest in autonomy severely limits parents' right to shape their children's values, and why parents have no fundamental right to confer wealth or advantage on their children. Family Values reaffirms the vital importance of the family as a social institution while challenging its role in the reproduction of social inequality and carefully balancing the interests of parents and children.",Philosophy,237,N/A,0,en

Finding Your Soul Mate with ThetaHealing,Vianna Stibal,"Hay House, Inc",2016-10-11,"Many of us are born into this world with the feeling and knowing of what being loved by another person should feel and be like, but we lack the feeling and knowing of how to fulfill this desire in the highest and best way.

Now in Identity Crisis, Karie helps women recapture and reclaim their God-given identity. I think for many, our identity is broken. In an increasingly technological world, our identity gets broken more and more, or certainly, we run the risk of it doing so. We now have the ability to be a culprit and a victim of identity theft by our own hands at the same time. Standing before God on my day of judgment, I wonder what I will really be accountable for. I was not who God designed me to be. The identity given to me was not the identity I lived my life as. Instead, I twisted it, distorted it, and mangled it beyond recognition so that I adapted into an identity I thought the world expected of me. I played God. Will that be my offense? If so, I plead guilty. I imagine there is more than enough evidence to convict me. In Identity Crisis, we will discuss the self-created barriers to true relationship. If we live behind a mask, we can impress, but we cannot connect. That doesnt sound right, does it? That is not the story I want to be a part of and to have as my life. It sounds lonely.

Good Relationships in Schools,Monika Platz,Springer Nature,2021-09-11,"The relationship between teacher and student is an important element of school education and as such irreplaceable: If we want schools to be good places for those who teach and learn there, we must make sure that the educational relationships between teachers and students are good, too. In research about school education, surprisingly little attention is paid to the normative dimension of the relationship between teacher and student. This lacuna points to a desideratum in the philosophy of education: More should be said about the normative structure of the teacher-student relationship, its role in teaching and learning, and its final value for teacher and student. Answering these fundamental philosophical questions is the core of this book. It offers a normatively rich concept of a good teacher-student relationship that is based on the analysis of two major relationship goods: trust and care. Moreover, the book explains the instrumental value of a good educational relationship for the student’s achievement of epistemic aims of school education as well as the final value of such a relationship for teacher and student.",Education,114,N/A,0,en

This book will give readers the aha! of recognition they have been waiting for. Unmissable."" --Naomi Wolf Unhooked Generation is about single men and women in their 20s and 30s who are having unprecedented difficulties finding love. Based on 100 in-depth interviews, Jillian Straus examines the obstacles facing unattached women and men in an age when all the choices we have, somehow, manage to decrease our chances of finding a mate. While cell phones, text messages, email, speed dating, and internet dating all conspire to create a sense that there are endless options, a culture of ""consumer sex"" and casual hook-ups make settling down feel like settling. And as the age of first marriage goes up, the level of expectation climbs right along with it, and we start subjecting prospective mates to ""the checklist."" From the collapse of courtship and the death of romance to the overriding media message that single life is sexy and married life is boring, we have a culture of mixed emotions about the very concept of marriage. Confronted by a host of factors that other generations never considered in their search for love and commitment, the ""unhooked generation"" faces a potholed road to romance. Rich with compelling personal stories, and leavened with wit and sharp observation, this is a book that clarifies this confusing, compelling issue as no other book has -- and in its final chapter offers concrete advice for addressing the problem.",Family & Relationships,196,N/A,0,en

Dehumanizing Christians,George Yancey,Transaction Publishers,2014,"Right-wing authoritarianism has emerged as a social psychological theory to explain conservative political and religious movements. Such authoritarianism is said to be rooted in the willingness of individuals to support authority figures who seek to restrict civil and human rights. George Yancey investigates the effectiveness of right-wing authoritarianism and the social phenomenon it represents. He analyzes how authoritarians on both the right and the left sides of the sociopolitical spectrum dehumanize their opponents. Yancey details earlier research on the phenomena of right-wing authoritarianism, asking whether its characteristics are inherently linked to religious and political conservatives. He presents his Christian dehumanization scale, and shows that those high in right-wing authoritarianism differ from those high in Christian dehumanization in one key aspect: they did not support authoritarian measures against conservative Christians. Yancey argues that authoritarianism is a tool of a larger phenomenon of dehumanization. He notes that dehumanization is sometimes used by conservatives who wish to use authoritarian measures against political radicals. Dehumanization is also used by progressives who would like to use authoritarian measures against conservative Christians. Yancey paints a bold picture with troubling implications about our understanding of society; he also considers the possible public policy dimensions of his work.",Religion,153,N/A,0,en

It's very funny and sad and utterly true. It's a life-saver' Miriam Margolyes Hi. I hope you're ok. My name's Joe, and I have one job, every day: don't kill myself. I live with a complex mental illness called Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). 15% of people with BPD die by suicide, and 40% try. I'm already in the 40%. My job is to keep out of the 15%. In this book I want to try and explain what life is like when you have a brain that is essentially trying to murder you every day. It's a collection of the funny, sad and shocking stuff that has happened to me along the way. Writing this book has been the hardest thing I've ever done. It had to be dragged into the world, with my condition telling me that every single word, sentence and chapter was terrible and would make strangers walk up to me in the street and punch me in the face. But I had run out of options. I'd done everything I 'd been told to do and I still thought about killing myself every day. So I wrote this book to save my life. But if there is even the smallest chance that me telling you how I live with me helps you live with you; if it opens up a space for someone, somewhere to be more honest about their mental illness, it will have been worth it.

This book also describes areas in the Christians life where a Christian needs to work toward completeness in Christ (spiritual maturity). The author describes in detail the struggles he went through trying to find answers to the question, “how in the world did I get so far from God?” He writes of God’s love for mankind and the extremes God went through to restore mankind to fellowship with him.

The book gives practices and insights on what helped the author in his quest to be more like Jesus. Christians are called to be like Jesus, and that calling does not come easy.

Will Our Love Last?,Sam R. Hamburg,Simon and Schuster,2001-03-17,"Am I with the right person? Will our love last? Men and women in love are haunted by these questions. Love -- especially why it blossoms in relationships and why it later dies -- is a mystery to them. Will Our Love Last? A Couple's Road Map solves this mystery by giving readers a new understanding of love -- an understanding they can actually use to evaluate the soundness of their relationships and to answer confidently the crucial questions that mystified them before. Based on hundreds of cases in his twenty-four years as a marital therapist and twenty-nine years in his own happy marriage, Sam R. Hamburg, Ph.D., explains how compatibility is the key to lasting love. He shows how compatibility on three major dimensions -- the Practical Dimension, the Sexual Dimension, and the Wavelength Dimension -- is essential to the mutual understanding and affirmation that keep love alive, and he leads readers through a simple but systematic procedure for assessing their compatibility with a romantic partner in these crucial relationship areas. Dr. Hamburg introduces a new technique, The Hand Rotation Exercise, to help readers express their degree of compatibility and then convey that visually to their partner. In addition, he presents two new original techniques for working through relationship conflicts and coming to agreement on difficult issues: His Way/Her Way and The Long Conversation. Written in a clear, direct style that is free of jargon, Will Our Love Last? empowers readers to make important relationship decisions that are intellectually and emotionally informed. Will Our Love Last? will help couples trying to decide if they should take the next step to a more committed relationship. It will aid individuals embarking on a new relationship, or who are between relationships, to evaluate the rightness of a new or prospective partner. And it will assist people who are already in committed relationships to make an honest assessment of their prospects for happiness with their current partner.

The Path,"Michael Puett, Christine Gross-Loh",Penguin UK,2016-04-07,"INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER SUNDAY TIMES TOP TEN BESTSELLER Harvard's most popular professor explains how thinkers from Confucius to Zhuangzi can transform our lives The first book of its kind, The Path draws on the work of the great but largely unknown Chinese philosophers to offer a profound guide to living well. By explaining what these teachings reveal about subjects from decision-making to relationships, it challenges some of our deepest held assumptions, forcing us to ""unlearn"" many ideas that inform modern society. The way we think we're living our lives isn't the way we live them. The authors show that we live well not by ""finding"" ourselves and slavishly following a grand plan, as so much of Western thought would have us believe, but rather through a path of self-cultivation and engagement with the world. Believing in a ""true self"" only restricts what we can become - and tiny changes, from how we think about careers to how we talk with our family, can start to have powerful effects that will open up constellations of new possibilities. Professor Michael Puett's course in Chinese philosophy has taken Harvard by storm. In The Path, he collaborates with journalist and author Christine Gross-Loh to make this timeless wisdom accessible to everyone for the very first time.",Philosophy,160,N/A,0,en

Steps Toward Abundant Living,Carey N. Ingram,iUniverse,2007-12-13,"Abundant living is not about fame and fortune, power or prestige. Abundant living is about making solid use of the time we have to anchor our existence around God's blessings. But most importantly, it's about the choices we make. God has made us free agents. We can choose to simply exist, without ever finding or fulfilling our destiny, or we can choose to go through the door of the Good Shepherd and live fully. In Steps Toward Abundant Living, Pastor Carey N. Ingram uses biblical principles and common sense to examine three things that bring trouble into life, to explain three essential components of happiness, and to offer the keys to genuinely abundant living, including: Exercising faith Demonstrating true love Possessing a passion for life Remaining steadfast in prayer Accepting suffering as a redemptive power Changing lifestyles to the glory of God You owe it to yourself to make life a happy experience. With God's help and Pastor Ingram's plan, you can do just that.

New Understandings of Twin Relationships,"Barbara Klein, Stephen A. Hart, Jacqueline M. Martinez",Routledge,2020-12-23,"New Understandings of Twin Relationships takes an experience-based approach to exploring how twin attachment and estrangement are critical to understanding the push and pull of closely entwined personal relationships. Based on the research expertise of each of the authors (all identical twins in their own right), and vignettes from twins across the globe, this book describes the inner workings of the twin-world, showing how the twin-world creates experiences that are often more intense and intricately textured than those in the singleton-world. Chapters debunk myths surrounding twinship and analyze the developmental stages of the twin relationship as well as the effect of being a twin on one’s mental health from different perspectives. The authors articulate how attachment, separation anxiety, loneliness, estrangement, and the subjective experience of the twin and non-twin ""other"" impact behavior, thinking, and feeling. Through its careful study of the many psychological challenges that twins face throughout their lifetime, this text will help psychologists, scholars, clinicians, and twins themselves attain a deeper understanding of all interpersonal relationships.",Psychology,295,N/A,0,en

Methods for Multilevel Analysis and Visualisation of Geographical Networks,"Céline Rozenblat, Guy Melancon",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-06-03,"This leading-edge study focuses on the latest techniques in analysing and representing the complex, multi-layered data now available to geographers studying urban zones and their populations. The volume tracks the successful results of the SPANGEO Project, which was set up in 2005 to standardize, and share, the syncretic, multinational mapping techniques already developed by geographers and computer scientists. SPANGEO sought new and responsive ways of visualising urban geographical and social data that reflected the fine-grained detail of the inputs. It allowed for visual representation of the large and complex networks and flows which are such an integral feature of the dynamism of urban geography. SPANGEO developed through the ‘visual analytics loop’ in which geographers collaborated with computer scientists by feeding data into the design of visualisations that in turn spawned the urge to incorporate more varied data into the visualisation. This volume covers all the relevant aspects, from conceptual principles to the tools of network analysis and the actual results flowing from their deployment. Detailed case studies set out in this volume include spatial multi-level analyses of flows in airports and sea ports, as well as the fascinating scientific networks in European cities. The volume shows how the primary concern of geography—the interaction of society with physical space—has been revivified by the complexities of new cartographical and statistical methodologies, which allow for highly detailed mapping and far more powerful computer analysis of spatial relationships.",Social Science,228,N/A,0,en

It Takes One to Tango,Winifred M. Reilly,Simon and Schuster,2017-04-04,"With a focus on self-empowerment and resilience, this refreshing and witty relationship guide has a reassuring counterintuitive message for unhappy spouses: you only need one partner to initiate far-reaching positive change in a marriage. Conventional wisdom says that “it takes two” to turn a troubled marriage around and that both partners must have a shared commitment to change. So when couples can’t agree on how—or whether—to make their marriage better, many give up or settle for a less-than-satisfying marriage (or think the only way out is divorce). Fortunately, there is an alternative. “What distinguishes Reilly’s book is that she says a warring couple don’t have to agree on the goal of staying together; it takes one person changing, not both, to make a marriage work” (The New York Times). Marriage and family therapist Winifred Reilly has this message for struggling partners: Take the lead. Doing so is effective—and powerful. Through Reilly’s own story of reclaiming her now nearly forty-year marriage, along with anecdotes from many clients she’s worked with, you’ll learn how to: -Focus on your own behaviors and change them in ways that make you feel good about yourself and your marriage -Take a firm stand for what truly matters to you without arguing, cajoling, or resorting to threats -Identify the “big picture” issues at the basis of your repetitive fights—and learn how to unhook from them -Be less reactive, especially in the face of your spouse’s provocations -Develop the strength and stamina to be the sole agent of change Combining psychological theory, practical advice, and personal narrative, It Takes One to Tango is a “wise and uplifting” (Dr. Ellyn Bader, Director of The Couples Institute) guide that will empower those who choose to take a bold, proactive approach to creating a loving and lasting marriage.",Family & Relationships,211,5,1,en

"Immovable Laws, Irresistible Rights",Christine Pierce,N/A,2000,"Same-sex partnerships. Pregnancy through in vitro fertilization. Ending one's own life in dignity. All are deemed inherently wrong by the standards of natural law ethics, but for many people they represent legitimate life choices that are morally right. Now a leading feminist critic of the natural law tradition explores the ongoing confrontation between natural law and moral rights to argue that rights constitute a more solid grounding for ethics in human affairs—and for feminist thought. In this volume, Christine Pierce's important essays—including the celebrated ""Natural Law Language and Women""—expand, reflect, and refine this central controversy. Reaching back to Aristotle and Aquinas and drawing on modern papal encyclicals and Supreme Court cases, Pierce demonstrates that the natural law tradition, with its doctrine of a supposed hierarchy of natural purpose, has served to mystify women's nature and thereby justify restricting women to a predetermined social stratum. Addressing issues that concern not only feminism but legal theory as well, she defends her views on equality and universalization against a growing postmodern critique and presents rights theory as an alternative to an ethics of responsibility based on Aristotelian notions of friendship and trust. Through tightly constructed arguments presented in engaging prose, Pierce conveys her deep knowledge of legal philosophy and her passion for rights as she takes on such issues as AIDS, gay marriage, animal liberation, and feminist separatism. She combats the prevailing view of Plato as sexist and explores Sartre's views of ""holes and slime."" She also examines the work of contemporary authors in ecology, biology, sociobiology, and religion to reveal their reliance on nature for ethical conclusions, and she criticizes recent efforts to root a feminist natural law in Thomism. With natural law concepts now in fashion with many conservatives and even some Supreme Court justices, Pierce's essays offer a necessary perspective on where current legal and ethical thinking is headed. Immovable Laws, Irresistible Rights is invigorating reading for all scholars, students, and interested readers who seek a better understanding of these arguments and the issues affected by them.",Law,192,N/A,0,en

Love Misinterpreted,James Russell Roundtree,"Christian Faith Publishing, Inc.",2023-06-29,"My book is about disappointment, love, pain, betrayal, and success. My dream was to finish high school in 1974 and go straight to college. I had a minor setback. My high school sweetheart was pregnant. I had a decision to make, either go to college or find a job. This was the most important decision I had to make in my life. But I chose to take care of my unborn child. I had to put college on hold. So at the age of eighteen, I married her. Eight years later, we were divorced. I was faced with another important decision: to raise my daughters without their mother. She gave me sole custody through the court. Now I had to take the role of both parents. I found love again in my third wife. There were struggles in raising six children. I had three failed businesses, which was heartbreaking, but I never gave up on business. I went back to college and graduated with an associate degree and a bachelor's degree in business and became successful. I overcame my failures from my first wife and worked on a successful marriage with my current wife. I refused to give up on life. God always walks beside me. The church is my greatest blessing. I also talk about incest, family members molesting my daughters. There were no male role models in my family.",Religion,156,N/A,0,en

In response, legal scholar Richards reflects upon the constitutional and democratic principles--relating to privacy, intimate life, free speech, tolerance, and conscience--that underpin these often heated debates. The distillation of Richards's thirty-year advocacy for the rights of gays and lesbians, his book provides a reflective treatise on basic human rights that touch all of our lives. He places in context two key Supreme Court cases: the 1986 Bowers v. Hardwick decision, and the 2003 Lawrence v. Texas decision which overturned it. Drawing upon his own experiences as a gay man, Richards interweaves personal observations with philosophical, political, judicial, and psychological insights to make a case that gays should be entitled to the same rights and protections that every American enjoys.--From publisher description.",Law,272,N/A,0,en

Attraction Explained,Viren Swami,Routledge,2021-02-11,"When it comes to relationships, there’s no shortage of advice from self-help ‘experts’, pick-up artists, and glossy magazines. But modern-day myths of attraction often have no basis in fact or – worse – are rooted in little more than misogyny. Based on science rather than self-help clichés, psychologist Viren Swami debunks these myths and draws on cutting-edge research to provide a ground-breaking and evidence-based account of relationship formation. At the core of this book is a very simple idea: there are no ‘laws of attraction’, no fool-proof methods or strategies for getting someone to date you. But this isn’t to say that there’s nothing to be gained from studying attraction. Based on science rather than self-help clichés, Attraction Explained looks at how factors such as geography, physical appearance, reciprocity, and similarity affect who we fall for and why. With updated statistics, this second edition also includes new content on online dating, queer relationships, racism in dating, shyness, and individual differences.

Love Is a Story,Robert J. Sternberg,Oxford University Press,1999-06-03,"In this groundbreaking work, Robert Sternberg opens the book of love and shows you how to discover your own story--and how to read your relationships in a whole new light. What draws us so strongly to some people and repels us from others? What makes some relationships work so smoothly and others burst into flames? Sternberg gives us new answers to these questions by showing that the kind of relationship we create depends on the kind of love stories we carry inside us. Drawing on extensive research and fascinating examples of real couples, Sternberg identifies 26 types of love story--including the fantasy story, the business story, the collector story, the horror story, and many others--each with its distinctive advantages and pitfalls, and many of which are clashingly incompatible. These are the largely unconscious preconceptions that guide our romantic choices, and it is only by becoming aware of the kind of story we have about love that we gain the freedom to create more fulfilling and lasting relationships. As long as we remain oblivious to the role our stories play, we are likely to repeat the same mistakes again and again. But the enlivening good news this book brings us is that though our stories drive us, we can revise them and learn to choose partners whose stories are more compatible with our own. Quizzes in each chapter help you to see which stories you identify with most strongly and which apply to your partner. Are you a traveler, a gardener, a teacher, or something else entirely? Love is a Story shows you how to find out.",Psychology,253,4,2,en

Love and Choice,Lucy Fry,Hachette UK,2022-02-10,"What, in your relationships, have you chosen? What would you choose, if you felt able? In Love and Choice, therapist and journalist Lucy Fry explains why relationships should start with these simple questions. Most of us are brought up with a blueprint for our most important and intimate relationships. It comes from family, the media, or even the government's tax policies, and the message is simple: The (gold) standard for a romantic relationship is one that is heterosexual, between two people, and monogamous. Lucy invites us to examine this blueprint consciously, accept that it may not be for everyone, and consider something outside the ordinary. By offering us a window into a life built on choice, and a radical approach, Lucy helps us explore what we really want, and what our relationship needs. With care, wit and candour, Fry blends insightful psychological and philosophical ideas with case studies drawn from interviews with experts, real people, and experiences in her own life. Love and Choice gives readers everything they need to choose what, who, and how to love.",Family & Relationships,228,N/A,0,en

Being hurt is an inevitable part of close relationships. What varies from relationship to relationship is not whether partners hurt each other, but how their relationship is affected by hurtful episodes. Given the potential influence of hurt feelings on people's interpersonal relationships, it is not surprising that scholars have begun to study the antecedents, processes, and outcomes associated with hurt. This collection integrates the various issues addressed by researchers, theorists, and practitioners who study the causes of hurt feelings, the interpersonal events associated with hurt, and the ways people respond to hurting and being hurt by others. To capture the breadth and depth of the literature in this area, the work of scholars from a variety of disciplines – including social psychology, communication, sociology, and family studies – is highlighted.",Psychology,549,N/A,0,en

Exit Path: How to Win the Startup End Game,Touraj Parang,McGraw Hill Professional,2022-08-02,"An exit strategy, if implemented early, is the surprising secret to ultimate startup success. Find out why—and how to develop one—in this comprehensive, practical guide from veteran Silicon Valley dealmaker Touraj Parang. In 2008, Touraj Parang's award-winning startup, Jaxtr, had 10 million users, raised nearly $20 million from top-tier Silicon Valley investors, and seemed poised to sail straight through the Great Recession. But, by January of 2009, Jaxtr’s only hope for survival was to find a buyer—sadly, it was too late for that. In Exit Path, Touraj draws on the lessons learned from that chaotic experience and the extraordinary successes that followed once he (and the entrepreneurs he advises) made creating and executing an exit strategy a top priority. For too long entrepreneurs have been failing to establish the requisite relationships and properly prepare for the most important milestone in their life cycle: a sale to an acquirer. But in today’s hyper competitive and interconnected business world, that is no longer an option. In this first-of-its-kind, comprehensive guide, you'll discover the surprising reasons few startups succeed while many fail—and you’ll learn that implementing an exit strategy early will empower you to take charge of your startup’s ultimate fate, maximizing its potential for success while mitigating the risks of failure. Arranged in four sequential parts, Exit Path walks you through actionable steps to devise and execute an effective exit strategy, starting with a fresh new perspective on the critical importance of creating a viable sale option for your startup. You'll learn why creating your exit strategy is necessary well before you're contemplating an exit, regardless of the stage of your startup. You’ll also discover how to create your own exit plan, how to make your plan a reality through personal and business relationships, and how to approach and negotiate with acquirers for an outcome best aligned with your values and ambitions should the need arise. Whether you are an entrepreneur, investor, or advisor, the expert advice and insights in Exit Path will inspire you to take charge of your startup’s destiny and unlock its strategic potential and options over time.",Business & Economics,288,N/A,0,en

You Only Fall in Love Three Times,Kate Rose,Penguin,2020-01-14,"Discover the three types of love--and the key to finding the one you're truly meant to be with. We love and we love again -- sometimes our hearts get broken but, somehow, we find the courage to dive back in. In this soul-searching book, relationship expert Kate Rose guides readers down the path to a deeper understanding of who they are, what they want, and finally, to the discovery of their Twin Flame. According to Rose, love is a journey of self-discovery and every relationship we have in our lives teaches us something that we need to learn about ourselves and what will make us truly happy. She introduces readers to the three types of love we will all experience: The Soulmate introduces us to the dream of love, but somehow what seemed like it would be ""happily ever after"" wasn't meant to last forever. We are so consumed with making The Karmic Love work that we often fail to question whether it should work. As painful as it is to accept, this love that felt so right in the beginning is actually all wrong. The Twin Flame comes into our lives and often we don't even know it's love because . . . it's too easy. This is the love who helps us to accept ourselves just as we are because this is precisely what they do. In You Only Fall in Love Three Times, Kate Rose shows us that happy endings may not happen quite the way they do in fairytales-- but they happen nonetheless.",Family & Relationships,242,N/A,0,en

Loving from Your Soul,Shepherd Hoodwin,Summerjoy Michael Book,1995,"People everywhere are looking for a higher perspective on love than the popular view of romance. Loving from Your Soul - Creating Powerful Relationships,"" an inspiring and unusual book by Shepherd Hoodwin, goes to the core of the issue by exploring the nature of love itself. It is a collection of discourses and counseling Hoodwin channeled from the Michael entity that views love as an eternal reality not dependent on other people or situations - it is something we can learn to access all the time through connecting directly with our soul. Michael is well-known to readers of metaphysical books. There are several Michael books in print, from the work of various channels, and most of them deal with a technical body of information called the Michael teachings. However, Loving from Your Soul is not a technical book. It deals with topics such as sexuality, anger, body image, loneliness, boundaries, listening, friendship, finding a mate, and alternative lifestyles. These subjects are framed within a larger context of explorations such as ""Loving Yourself,"" ""Being at Your Source,"" ""Different Ways of Loving,"" ""Oneness,"" ""Communicating Your Whole Being,"" and ""Expanding Love."" According to Loving from Your Soul, ""Love is a unified experience that does not cut off any portion of your reality. When you are loving yourself, you are loving others. When you are loving others, you are loving yourself. When you are having joy in what you are doing, you are giving joy to the world - there is no separation between you and the world."" ""What does it mean to love and to be loved? People everywhere are seeking a higher perspective than the popular view of romance. This outstanding book goes to the core of the issue by illuminating the nature of love itself as a reality that is always available. Topics include sexuality, anger, body image, loneliness, boundaries, listening, and finding a mate, framed within a larger context. With vibrant clarity, it will have a resounding impact on the way we look at love from now on."" -Sheila Andersen, Leading Edge Review ""This book positively radiates love.

Since Gran died a few months ago, twenty-five-year-old Molly has been navigating life’s complexities all by herself. No matter—she throws herself with gusto into her work as a hotel maid. Her unique character, along with her obsessive love of cleaning and proper etiquette, make her an ideal fit for the job. She delights in donning her crisp uniform each morning, stocking her cart with miniature soaps and bottles, and returning guest rooms at the Regency Grand Hotel to a state of perfection. But Molly’s orderly life is upended the day she enters the suite of the infamous and wealthy Charles Black, only to find it in a state of disarray and Mr. Black himself dead in his bed. Before she knows what’s happening, Molly’s unusual demeanour has the police targeting her as their lead suspect. She quickly finds herself caught in a web of deception, one she has no idea how to untangle. Fortunately for Molly, friends she never knew she had unite with her in a search for clues to what really happened to Mr. Black. But will they be able to find the real killer before it’s too late? Both a Clue-like, locked-room mystery and a heartwarming journey of the spirit, The Maid explores what it means to be the same as everyone else and yet entirely different—and reveals that all mysteries can be solved through connection to the human heart.",Fiction,302,5,1,en

Forced to wear Mum's odd hand-made garments and forbidden from reading teenage magazines, they know they're very different to 'normal' girls - but when Dad has a stroke and ends up in hospital, unable to move or speak, Prue suddenly discovers what it's like to have a little freedom. Sent to a real school for the first time, Prue struggles to fit in. The only person she can talk to is her kindly, young - and handsome - art teacher, Rax.

Adult Sibling Relationships,"Geoffrey L. Greif, Michael E. Woolley",Columbia University Press,2015-12-08,"The bond siblings develop in childhood may be vastly different from the relationship that evolves in adulthood. Driven by affection but also characterized by ambivalence and ambiguity, adult sibling relationships can become hurtful, uncertain, competitive, or exhausting though the undercurrents of love and loyalty remain. An approach that recognizes the positive aspects of the changing sibling relationship, as well as those that need improvement, can restore healthy ties and rebuild family closeness. With in-depth case studies of more than 260 siblings over the age of forty and interviews with experts on mental health and family interaction, this book offers vital direction for traversing the emotional terrain of adult sibling relations. It pursues a richer understanding of ambivalence, a normal though little explored feeling among siblings, and how ambiguity about the past or present can lead to miscommunication and estrangement. For both professionals and general readers, this book clarifies the most confounding elements of sibling relationships and provides specific suggestions for realizing new, productive avenues of friendship in middle and later life—skills that are particularly important for siblings who must cooperate to care for aging parents or give immediate emotional or financial support to other siblings or family members.",Psychology,327,N/A,0,en

"Calling in ""The One""",Katherine Woodward Thomas,Harmony,2007-12-18,"Are you frustrated by stymied relationships, missed connections, and the loneliness of the search for someone to spend the rest of your life with? Are you ready, instead, to find “The One”? In Calling in “The One,” Katherine Woodward Thomas shares her own personal experience to show women that in order to find the relationship that will last a lifetime, you have to be truly open and ready to create a loving, committed, romantic union. Calling in “The One” shows you how. Based on the Law of Attraction, which is the concept that we can only attract what we’re ready to receive, the provocative yet simple seven-week program in Calling in “The One” prepares you to bring forth the love you seek.

Meditation, visualization, and journaling exercises will gently lead you to recognize the obstacles on your path to love and provide ways to steer around them. At the end of those 49 days, you will be in the ideal emotional state to go out into the world and find “The One.” An inspirational approach that offers a radical new philosophy on relationships, Calling in “The One” is your guide to finding the love you seek.",Family & Relationships,354,5,3,en
Relationships in Development,Stephen Seligman,Routledge,2017-11-07,"The recent explosion of new research about infants, parental care, and infant-parent relationships has shown conclusively that human relationships are central motivators and organizers in development. Relationships in Development examines the practical implications for dynamic psychotherapy with both adults and children, especially following trauma. Stephen Seligman offers engaging examples of infant-parent interactions as well as of psychotherapeutic process. He traces the place of childhood and child development in psychoanalysis from Freud onward, showing how different images about babies evolved and influenced analytic theory and practice. Relationships in Development offers a new integration of ideas that updates established psychoanalytic models in a new context: ""Relational-developmental psychoanalysis."" Seligman integrates four crucial domains: Infancy Research, including attachment theory and research Developmental Psychoanalysis Relational/intersubjective Psychoanalysis Classical Freudian, Kleinian, and Object Relations theories (including Winnicott). An array of specific sources are included: developmental neuroscience, attachment theory and research, studies of emotion, trauma and infant-parent interaction, and nonlinear dynamic systems theories. Although new psychoanalytic approaches are featured, the classical theories are not neglected, including the Freudian, Kleinian, Winnicottian, and Ego Psychology orientations. Seligman links current knowledge about early experiences and how they shape later development with the traditional psychoanalytic attention to the irrational, unconscious, turbulent, and unknowable aspects of the mind and human interaction. These different fields are taken together to offer an open and flexible approach to psychodynamic therapy with a variety of patients in different socioeconomic and cultural situations. Relationships in Development will appeal to psychoanalysts, psychoanalytic psychotherapists, and graduate students in psychology, social work, and psychotherapy. The fundamental issues and implications presented will also be of great importance to the wider psychodynamic and psychotherapeutic communities.",Psychology,374,N/A,0,en

After twenty plus years of scheduling, I was pleased to find that I was not out in a foxhole by myself.” Ted Douglas, President, ACTPMA, LLC “I told my boss that we will need to purchase a copy for every scheduling person at Alpha, due to the technical and practical accuracy and clarity.” Chris Carson, Corporate Director of Project Controls, Alpha Corporation “I was glad to see this in print. Many people monitor a schedule strictly by float and don’t understand that there is so much more involved in the analysis of a schedule that just looking at float or even earned value. I would recommend this book to all of the classes that I teach.” Jeff Huneycutt, US Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District “I am just glad that I am not alone in the way I see the project controls business.

I suggested Murray's, even though the requestor doesn't work in construction. It's the book I turn to when I want to know the ‘right’ way to assemble and manage a schedule as well as the reasoning behind that practice.

The Earliest Relationship,"T. Berry Brazelton, Bertrand G. Cramer",Routledge,2018-05-08,"Never before has research on newborn behavior and parent-infant interaction been fully integrated with psychoanalytic insight into parents' emotions and fantasies. This book provide a vivid glimpse of the parents' daydreams and narcissistic wishes which grow into a desire for a child, and they show how these feelings develop into important attachments to the unborn infant during pregnancy. The ""power and competence"" of the newborn born then challenges parental fantasies, desires, wishes and expectations, creating the beginnings of the bond between parent and child. Using the latest research, the authors clarify all the ways the infant participates in the dawning relationship and the ingredients of very early communication and interaction. They then unveil the ""imaginary interactions"" which lend meaning and drama to each gesture and expression. We see the baby as Tyrant, as Savior, or as the reincarnation of lost relationships. Everyone who cares for mothers and babies-pediatricians, developmental and clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, early childhood specialists, nurses and social workers-as well as interested parents, will find this book of immediate value.",Psychology,144,N/A,0,en
"Strong Brands, Strong Relationships","Susan Fournier, Michael Breazeale, Jill Avery",Routledge,2015-06-12,"From the editor team of the ground-breaking Consumer-Brand Relationships: Theory and Practice comes this new volume. Strong Brands, Strong Relationships is a collection of innovative research and management insights that build upon the foundations of the first book, but takes the study of brand relationships outside of traditional realms by applying new theoretical frameworks and considering new contexts. The result is an expanded and better-informed account of people’s relationships with brands and a demonstration of the important and timely implications of this evolving sub-discipline. A range of different brand relationship environments are explored in the collection, including: online digital spaces, consumer collectives, global brands, luxury brands, branding in terrorist organizations, and the brand relationships of men and transient consumers. This book attends to relationship endings as well as their beginnings, providing a full life-cycle perspective. While the first volume focused on positive relationship benefits, this collection explores dysfunctional dynamics, adversarial and politically-charged relationships, and those that are harmful to well-being. Evocative constructs are leveraged, including secrets, betrayals, anthropomorphism, lying, infidelity, retaliation, and bereavement. The curated collection provides both a deeper theoretical understanding of brand relationship phenomena and ideas for practical application from experiments and execution in commercial practice. Strong Brands, Strong Relationships will be the perfect read for marketing faculty and graduate students interested in branding dynamics, as well as managers responsible for stewarding brands.",Business & Economics,477,1,1,en

Relationship Sabotage,William J. Matta,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2006-07-30,"Hidden forces—memories of past poor or hurtful relationships—drive repressed feelings and emotions that are often outside our awareness. Though we want to love and be loved, to nurture and be nurtured, those forces can wreak havoc and cause relationship sabotage, destroying couples and even whole families. The scenario is so common, explains therapist Matta, that often people get divorced without even fully understanding why, or what is was that came between them. In many cases, what it was were the lingering but unconscious memories of lessons learned as far back as childhood. These lessons may have no true bearing or justification in the current relationship, yet they can strongly affect it, fueling marital games, extra-marital affairs, addictions, poor parenting practices and a host of other harmful actions. Matta argues that we can learn to recognize these imprints and move past them to build or keep rewarding relationships. His book makes us aware, and gives us the tools to break the cycle.",Psychology,177,N/A,0,en

The Psychology of Social Networking Vol.1,"Giuseppe Riva, Brenda K. Wiederhold, Pietro Cipresso",Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG,2015-01-01,"Using a novel approach to consider the available literature and research, this book focuses on the psychology of social media based on the assumption that the experience of being in a social media has an impact on both our identity and social relationships. In order to ‘be online’, an individual has to create an online presence – they have to share information about themselves online. This online self is presented in different ways, with diverse goals and aims in order to engage in different social media activities and to achieve desired outcomes. Whilst this may not be a real physical presence, that physicality is becoming increasingly replicated through photos, video, and ever-evolving ways of defining and describing the self online. Moreover, individuals are using both PC-based and mobile-based social media as well as increasingly making use of photo and video editing tools to carefully craft and manipulate their online self. This book therefore explores current debates in Cyberpsychology, drawing on the most up-to-date theories and research to explore four main aspects of the social media experience (communication, identity, presence and relationships). In doing so, it considers the interplay of different areas of psychological research with current technological and security insight into how individuals create, manipulate and maintain their online identity and relationships. The social media are therefore at the core of every chapter, with the common thread throughout being the very unique approach to considering diverse and varied online behaviours that may not have been thus far considered from this perspective. It covers a broad range of both positive and negative behaviours that have now become integrated into the daily lives of many westernised country’s Internet users, giving it an appeal to both scholarly and industry readers alike.",Psychology,232,N/A,0,en

But how do our biological systems implement social behaviors, and how do these processes shape the brain and biology? Spanning multiple disciplines, Introduction to Social Neuroscience seeks to engage students and scholars alike in exploring the effects of the brain’s perceived connections with others. This wide-ranging textbook provides a quintessential foundation for comprehending the psychological, neural, hormonal, cellular, and genomic mechanisms underlying such varied social processes as loneliness, empathy, theory-of-mind, trust, and cooperation. Stephanie and John Cacioppo posit that our brain is our main social organ. They show how the same objective relationship can be perceived as friendly or threatening depending on the mental states of the individuals involved in that relationship. They present exercises and evidence-based findings readers can put into practice to better understand the neural roots of the social brain and the cognitive and health implications of a dysfunctional social brain. This textbook’s distinctive features include the integration of human and animal studies, clinical cases from medicine, multilevel analyses of topics from genes to societies, and a variety of methodologies. Unveiling new facets to the study of the social brain’s anatomy and function, Introduction to Social Neuroscience widens the scientific lens on human interaction in society.

"Communication, Intimacy, and Close Relationships",Valerian J. Derlega,Elsevier,2013-10-02,"Communication, Intimacy, and Close Relationships offers an account of the nature of intimate relationships and their effects on people's self-concepts. The development and maintenance of intimate relationships are examined, along with people's motives and goals in pursuing intimacy; the nature of social exchanges in intimate relationships; and the consequences for individuals who find themselves socially isolated. The critical role of communication in intimate relationships is given emphasis. Comprised of seven chapters, this book begins with a discussion on the role of self-disclosure in intimate relationships as well as the risks that individuals incur when they self-disclose. The next chapter presents a cognitive interaction model of the nature of intimacy and intimate relationships within the context of cognitive-social learning theory and a systems theory approach to communication. The effect of people's motives on relationships is then considered, together with the role of two fundamental human motives - power and intimacy - on love and friendship. The remaining chapters focus on the importance of the identification process - that is, how people fix their own and others' identities in social interaction - in developing relationships; patterns of nonverbal exchange in close relationships; how and why loneliness occurs; and the nature of social exchange processes in intimate relationships. The book concludes with an epilogue that provides a perspective on why people may find it difficult or easy to form intimate relationships.

The other perspective focuses on within-person differences and dynamics, i.e., fluctuations in personality in response to situations and across time. This Research Topic reflects recent developments in personality research to integrate both trait and dynamic perspectives. An integrated view on personality recognizes both stability in between-person differences and within-person change. Contributors are drawn from research teams across Europe, North America and Australasia, and from basic and applied fields, including organizational, educational, and clinical. The studies reported provide new evidence in support of an integrative approach, highlight currently active areas of research and propose new directions of research. Current streams of research include the study of contingent units of personality and within-person processes underlying traits, the comparisons of findings based on within- vs. between-person data, the conceptualisation and operationalization of perceived and objective change in situation variables, the malleability of personality and the potential for personality interventions.

Hinde, St. John′s College, Cambridge, United Kingdom Handbook of Dynamics in Parent-Child Relations provides an innovative, interdisciplinary perspective on theory, research, and methodology of dynamic processes in parent-child relations. Edited by distinguished scholar Leon Kuczynski, this accessible volume is divided into six parts. Part I concerns dyadic processes in parent-child relationships and provides the conceptual grounding for the volume as a whole. Parts II and III examine the agency of the child and the agency of the parent, respectively. Part IV considers dynamics in the parent-child dyad as they are mediated by or impact on various lifespan, cultural, and ecological contexts. Part V addresses the methodological implications of adopting a dynamic process view of parent-child relations. Part VI weighs future directions for theory, research, and practice. An eminent group of scholars and researchers present a comprehensive exploration of parent-child relationships that includes the nature of change in parent-child interactions; cognitive, behavior, and relational processes that govern parent-child relationships; what makes such interactions and relationships ""work"" the way they do; the dynamics of parent-child relations, including bidirectional influence and human agency; quantitative and qualitative methodology in the context of theory verification and discovery. Handbook of Dynamics in Parent-Child Relations focuses on process rather than outcomes, bi-directional influence rather than parent effects or child effects, and parents and children as agents and actors rather than as static traits or variables. This concern with dynamics represents an emerging research perspective that complements a long-standing alternative tradition primarily concerned with the products of parenting.

The SAGE Encyclopedia of Corporate Reputation,Craig E. Carroll,SAGE Publications,2016-05-31,"What creates corporate reputations and how should organizations respond? Corporate reputation is a growing research field in disciplines as diverse as communication, management, marketing, industrial and organizational psychology, and sociology. As a formal area of academic study, it is relatively young with roots in the 1980s and the emergence of specialized reputation rankings for industries, products/services, and performance dimensions and for regions. Such rankings resulted in competition between organizations and the alignment of organizational activities to qualify and improve standings in the rankings. In addition, today’s changing stakeholder expectations, the growth of advocacy, demand for more disclosures and greater transparency, and globalized, mediatized environments create new challenges, pitfalls, and opportunities for organizations. Successfully engaging, dealing with, and working through reputational challenges requires an understanding of options and tools for organizational decision-making and stakeholder engagement. For the first time, the vast and important field of corporate reputation is explored in the format of an encyclopedic reference. The SAGE Encyclopedia of Corporate Reputation comprehensively overviews concepts and techniques for identifying, building, measuring, monitoring, evaluating, maintaining, valuing, living up to and/or changing corporate reputations. Key features include: 300 signed entries are organized in A-to-Z fashion in 2 volumes available in a choice of electronic or print formats Entries conclude with Cross-References and Further Readings to guide students to in-depth resources. Although organized A-to-Z, a thematic “Reader’s Guide” in the front matter groups related entries by broad areas A Chronology provides historical perspective on the development of corporate reputation as a discrete field of study. A Resource Guide in the back matter lists classic books, key journals, associations, websites, and selected degree programs of relevance to corporate reputation. A General Bibliography will be accompanied by visual maps noting the relationships between the various disciplines touching upon corporate reputation studies. The work concludes with a comprehensive Index, which—in the electronic version—combines with the Reader’s Guide and Cross-References to provide thorough search-and-browse capabilities",Business & Economics,1049,N/A,0,en

Discussion in this volume moves away from any implication that relationships are only good and delightful, because even in the very closest of relationships, pain and suffering are inevitable. The contributing scholars examine the management and tolerance skills required of participants in order to construct meaningful interpretations of themselves, each other, and the relationship while all of the components evolve and interact in continually changing contexts. Issues examined include conflict, enemies, reconfiguring ""family"" after a divorce, codependency, interpersonal violence, HIV/AIDS, chronic illness, and managing grief over a partner's death.

As complex socio-economic structures, food and agricultural value chains are important means for channeling resources, knowledge, and agency in and out of rural areas. Given their prominent role on the development agendas, there is mixed evidence as to what extent value chains and their actors can contribute to improving the livelihoods in poor rural and urban areas. In order to shape sustainable living places, transformative capacities and good governance are important mainstays. Transformative agri-food value chains are robust and often act as the sole transmission belt for returning capital, resources and identity back into vulnerable areas.

Internet Use and Psychological Well-Being Among Children and Adolescents,"Yangu Pan, Zhaojun Teng, Daniel Tan Lei Shek, Chun Chen",Frontiers Media SA,2024-01-22,"Internet use (e.g., smartphone use, social media use) is ubiquitous in our daily lives and plays an increasingly important role in human well-being. Today’s adolescents and their parents spend significant amounts of time on technological devices, such as smartphones, especially during COVID-19. In this year, new research shows that nearly half of American teenagers say they use the Internet “almost constantly”, 95% of American teens have smartphones, and about 54% of teens said it would be “somewhat hard” to give up social media. Hence, further research on the relationship between Internet use and psychological well-being among children and adolescents is worth pursuing. At the same time, a new interest in this area of research is “parental technoference” which was defined as regular interruptions to real-time face-to-face communications, interactions, or time spent together among family members because of parental use of technology. Technoference has become a common phenomenon in many families with children, and evidence has been identified that extended parental time on technological devices (e.g., smartphones) could have negative effects on parent-child relationships and children’s wellbeing. For example, parental phubbing is regarded as a typical parental technoference, and this term is used widely in some countries around the world, which has been demonstrated to be detrimental to their children’s developmental outcomes and cause various psychological health problems.",Medical,99,N/A,0,en

Love Lost in Translation,K. Renato Lings,Trafford Publishing,2013-06-06,"Love Lost in Translation systematically examines the biblical stories and passages that are generally assumed to deal with, or comment on, homoerotic relationships: Noah and Ham, Sodom and Gomorrah, Leviticus 18:22, Deuteronomy 23:1718, Judges 19, Romans 1:2627, and 1 Corinthians 6:9. K. Renato Lings convincingly demonstrates that mistranslations of these texts into Greek, Latin and other languages occurred early, and that serious errors continue to be committed by translators today. This explains the painful controversy about same-sex relationships, which has rocked Christian churches for decades. Love Lost in Translation proposes a fresh approach to translating the Bible by means of linguistic and literary criteria. As demonstrated throughout this ground-breaking book, the method enables readers to become acquainted with the literary sophistication, psychological insights and spiritual depth of the Bible. Combining meticulous scholarship with an accessible style, Love Lost in Translation provides a much-needed infusion of essential learning into a subject that affects millions of Bible readers today.",Religion,787,N/A,0,en
Gender and Sexuality Diversity in a Culture of Limitation,"Tania Ferfolja, Jacqueline Ullman",Routledge,2020-05-10,"Gender and Sexuality Diversity in a Culture of Limitation provides an outstanding and insightful critique of the ways that contemporary education is impacted by a range of political, social and cultural influences that inform the approaches that schools take in relation to gender and sexuality diversity. By applying feminist poststructural and Foucauldian frameworks, the book examines the ongoing impact of broader socio-cultural discourse on the lives of gender and sexuality diverse students and teachers. Beginning with an overview of the impact of how a culture of limitation is realised in Australia, the focus moves beyond this context to examine state and federal policies from comparable societies in countries including the USA and the UK and their effect on the production of knowledges and what’s permissible to include in educational curriculum. This research-driven book thus provides a comparative, international overview of the current state of gender and sexuality diversity in schools, and convincingly demonstrates that despite some empowerment of gender and sexuality diverse individuals, silencing and marginalization remain powerful forces. This book will be of great interest to graduate and postgraduate students, academics, professionals, and policy makers interested in the field of gender and sexuality in education.

This also means a challenge for design methodology as the academic discipline that studies design processes and methods. The aim of the NATO ARW of which this book is the report was to bring together colleagues from different academic fields to discuss this increasing multidisciplinarity in the relationship between design and sciences. This multidisciplinarity made the conference a special event. At a certain moment one of the participants exclaimed: ""This is not a traditional design methodology conference!"" Throughout the conference it was evident that there was a need to develop a common language and understanding to enable the exchange of different perspectives on design and its relationship with science.

Participants were college students with disabilities collected through the Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities (rcpd) at Michigan State University and other universities and colleges via a listserv of the Michigan Association on Higher Education and Disabilities (mi-ahead). Pearson Correlation Coefficient and forward stepwise regression analyses were carried out in order to find out the relationship between sense of coherence, demographic characteristics (E.G., gender, race, and socioeconomic status), and career thought processes. Results supported that college students with disabilities who showed higher sense of coherence indicated less overall dysfunctional career thoughts, career decision-making confusion, or career-related anxiety. In addition, the relationships between sense of coherence, career thoughts, and the demographic characteristics have been found. Implications for career development professionals as well as clinical considerations of caring for college students with disabilities experiencing career-related difficulties were discussed.

On Relationship,Jiddu Krishnamurti,Harper Collins,2013-07-30,"In 1950, Krishnamurti said: ""If we are concerned with our own lives, if we understand our relationship with others, we will have created a new society; otherwise, we will but perpetuate the present chaotic mess and confusion."" Providing a far-reaching basis for solving many of the world's crises, On Relationship brings together Krishnamurti's most essential teachings on the individual's relationship to other people and institutions. The renowned teacher makes clear that the way we handle personal crises and relationships links us to the problems of all people and has a larger, global meaning. Ending the causes of war, for instance, cannot truly begin until we perform simple, but often ignored, tasks such as reconciling with estranged family members, keeping our homes in order, and respecting others.",Philosophy,180,N/A,0,en

Love is a Story,Robert J. Sternberg,"Oxford University Press, USA",1998,"What draws us so strongly to some people and repels us from others? What makes some relationships work so smoothly and others burst into flames? Sternberg gives us new answers to these questions by showing that the kind of relationship we create depends on the kind of love stories we carry inside us. Drawing on extensive research and fascinating examples of real couples, Sternberg identifies 26 types of love story -- including the fantasy story, the business story, the collector story, the horror story, and many others -- each with its distinctive advantages and pitfalls, and many of which are clashingly incompatible. These are the largely unconscious preconceptions that guide our romantic choices, and it is only by becoming aware of the kind of story we have about love that we gain the freedom to create more fulfilling and lasting relationships. As long as we remain oblivious to the role our stories play, we are likely to repeat the same mistakes again and again. But the enlivening good news this book brings us is that though our stories drive us, we can revise them and learn to choose partners whose stories are more compatible with our own. Quizzes in each chapter help you to see which stories you identify with most strongly and which apply to your partner. -- From publisher's description.",Interpersonal relations,253,N/A,0,en
Psychopharmacology Problems in Evaluation,"Jonathan O. Cole, Ralph Waldo Gerard",National Academies,1959,"""The organization of this volume has followed the various stages through which the preparation for the Conference on The Evaluation of Pharmacotherapy in Mental Illness and the actual conference went. A seventh paper, by Dr. Jack R. Ewalt, was presented at the dinner given on Friday, 21 September 1956. The general character resembles that of the introductory papers and it was therefore included with them. The first section of this volume, therefore, consists of the seven working papers, two of which were brought up to date just before the conference in September 1956, together with Dr. Gerard's summary. At the January planning meeting it was decided that five committees should be formed, composed for the most part of those participating in the planning meeting. These committees were to include the Committee on Preliminary Screening of Drugs, under the chairmanship of Dr. Louis Goodman, which was to review thoroughly our knowledge of the basic mechanisms of action of these psychoactive compounds, and more particularly the adequacy of available methods for the selection and the animal and early human screening of compounds of this general sort. The next three committees were organized as a group in order that the field of clinical drug evaluation, which was to be the primary emphasis of the conference, should receive the most thorough possible scrutiny. The general clinical area was divided into three sections. The first section, that dealing with the problems attached to the selection of patient groups for study and the problem of adequate scientific controls in clinical researches, was assigned to the Committee on Patient Selection and Controls under the chairmanship of Dr. John Clausen. The second clinical area encompassed the influence of the environment in which the drug studies were done and the problems attached to drug administration itself. This area was gradually expanded to include the more general aspects of test design in clinical drug evaluation and was assigned to the Committee on Test Conditions, under the chairmanship of Dr. Alfred Bay. The third clinical area was that of evaluation, and the third committee, the Committee on Evaluation, was to concern itself intensively with the problems of evaluation and the more detailed consideration of some of the available techniques for the measurement of change in psychiatric patients. Dr. Milton Greenblatt chaired the Committee on Evaluation and also served as ""superchairman"" and coordinator of the three clinical committees. The fifth committee was called the Committee on Planning and Coordination and was to serve both as an executive committee for the conference and to consider, in broader terms, the implications of the conference. Its major attention was to be devoted to the preparation of plans for the implementation of policy recommendations and research ideas which would emerge from the conference itself. The organization of the sections devoted to the work of the several committees is not uniform, but has varied with the nature of the committee's activities. The edited discussions have been inserted, wherever they are most appropriate, either following the article to which they are pertinent or in a separate section devoted to the general work of the committee. The summaries prepared by the various committees and presented to the main conference, together with the discussion from the floor following the presentation of these summaries, have been included as a separate section at the end of the volume, and are followed by Dr. Kety's final, over-all analysis of the work of the conference and the consolidated recommendations of the various working groups""--Introductio.

What distinguishes most successful relationships from unsuccessful ones is not the absence of conflict, but how conflict is managed. Relationship Conflict skillfully portrays the different types of conflict that we encounter in our most significant personal relationships: parent-child, friendship, and romantic relationships. The authors capture the essence of current research and theory to shed light on conflict's role in human interaction. Drawing from the findings of multiple disciplines, this volume takes a developmental development look at childhood friendships through to dating and married relationships.

Loving Like You Mean It,Ronald J. Frederick,Central Recovery Press,2019-04-30,"A 2019 Nautilus Silver Book Award Winner You can't fix what you don't see. But with awareness and the right tools, real change can and does happen. No matter how hard we try, many of us struggle to make love work with our partners. The problem, as clinical psychologist Dr. Ron Frederick explains, is that our brains are running on outdated software. Without us knowing it, our early relationship programming causes us to fear being more emotionally present and authentic with our partners—precisely what’s needed to build loving connections. But we don’t have to remain prisoners to our past. Grounded in cutting-edge neuroscience and attachment theory, Loving Like You Mean It shares a proven four-step approach to use emotional mindfulness to break free from old habits, befriend your emotional experience, and develop new ways of relating. The capacity for deep, loving connections is inside all of us, waiting to come out.

From Exclusion to Excellence,"Michal Razer, Victor J. Friedman",Springer,2017-01-28,"The authors draw on their 30 years of action-research activities helping educators provide a meaningful education to at-risk/excluded students. They explain how teacher well-being is a precondition for building the sorts of relationships that enable excluded students to learn. They present in detail four concrete skills (non-abandonment, reframing, connecting conversation, and emphatic limit-setting) for reaching children and at the same time strengthening educators’ emotional resilience and professional pride. They address how schools can rethink and reshape the way they relate to parents of excluded children, so as to allow both sides to trust and empower each other. If you are a teacher, this book will help you make sense of the difficulties you face daily and provide you with reliable methods for working more effectively. If you are a principal or policymaker, it will show how the road to excellence begins with inclusion, and with providing teachers the kind of support that enables them to succeed. I am not an education expert, but you don’t have to be to want to implement the conclusions that Michal Razer and Victor J. Friedman make about schools to societies as a whole. To produce a successful school serving the needs of all of its students, you need to focus—before passing out any curriculum or teaching any classes—on building that elusive thing called “trust”, or what the authors call “inclusion”. When there is trust in the classroom, when every student believes that they and their aspirations matter to a teacher, everything is possible and everything is easier—the most difficult students become more educable and inspired and take more ownership over their success—and the best students soar even higher. This book should be read by teachers, parents and politicians alike, because its incisive recommendations for building more successful schools apply just as much to families and parliaments. – Thomas L.

Nonverbal Communication in Close Relationships,"Robert J. Sternberg, Aleksandra Kostić",Springer Nature,2022-03-15,"This book is an up-to-date compendium of knowledge on the secret language of close relationships, namely nonverbal routes of communication. In close relationships, as everyone learns sooner or later, the usefulness of words can be somewhat limited, because people (a) mean different things by the same words, (b) mean the same thing by different words, (c) sometimes find it hard to express their feelings in words, and (d) lie. Nonverbal signals therefore often provide the best means of communication. The book points out how decoding (interpreting) nonverbal signals is a major key to success, because often what people say wholly belies how they feel—nonverbal signals reveal their true feelings rather than what they want other people to think their feelings are. This book helps decode those secret signals. The book is written by the leading worldwide experts in the field of nonverbal communication to ensure accuracy, comprehensiveness, and timeliness.",Psychology,386,N/A,0,en

What factors influence the nature and quality of today's older couple relationships, and what are the complex links between relationships and health? In this cutting-edge book, the authors present the latest theoretical, methodological, and empirical perspectives in the field of middle-age and older couple relationships. The chapters cover a broad range of topics, including the impact of health concerns, loneliness, chronic disease management, couple negotiation of everyday tasks, and coping across the lifespan.

The Covert Narcissist,Theresa J. Covert,GD Publishing Limited,2020-12-27,"Still struggling from the effects of a narcissistic or psychopathically abusive relationship? Many people do and sadly there is very little information available to be found online or in the written research, or with counsellors and therapists that can help. Narcissistic Victim Syndrome is not officially recognised, nor is it widely even known. Even when it is accepted, recognised and known not many people seem to know what to DO ABOUT IT to heal it... The fact is being in a relationship with a narcissist over a long period of time has long lasting traumatic effects that can be extremely catastrophic to the person suffering them. DO THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS SOUND FAMILIAR? - Ruined self confidence - Doubting yourself and your sanity - Mood swings - Sleeplessness - Extreme weight loss or weight gain - Uncharacteristic jealousy/ insecurity - Feeling like you don't know the difference between right and wrong The list goes on.... Covert Narcissists dangle their vulnerability in front of you as bait, just waiting for your good nurturing mothering/fathering instincts to kick in and rescue the poor little lost child they are presenting to you. But beneath the mask of a shy, vulnerable and ""good person"" something far more sinister lurks. And this what makes covert narcissism so damaging and dangerous: the nature of the disorder is such that you are brainwashed into thinking you are dealing with a human being with a morality, perhaps even a ""pillar of the community"". OFT REPEATED MYTHS OF THE INTERNET ABOUT NARCISSISTS: You are Told Narcissists are always brash, loud, assertive, flashy and Confident. The problem is Coverts are quiet, insecure and passive. You are Told Narcissists will never apologise for things they do. The problem is Coverts can learn that a quick and TOTAL apology is a really slick way of getting their target to ""go back to sleep"" if it looks like they are waking up. WHAT YOU NEED NOW: - Someone who has been through the same experiences you have and understands them from the inside. -Someone who has the knowledge, training, education and experience working on himself and others to lead you through the emotional sh*tstorm that breaking with a narcissist can create.﻿",Self-Help,146,N/A,0,en

Blended Families: Recipes for Success,Barbara J Peters,Barbara J Peters,2022-01-28,"Surprisingly, many couples about to remarry and start step-parenting do not even read a book about it (less than fifty percent do). But education about marriage and parenting does increase marital success. Blended Families: Recipes for Success, is a pivotal book from Barbara J Peters, counselor and relationship coach, that presents easy to follow recipes for a lifetime of blended marriage. Barbara has been helping couples for years with her other books such as The Gift of a Lifetime, Building a Marriage That Lasts and He Said She Said I Said 7 Keys to Relationship Success. This book offers the necessary and critical ingredients of creating a solid blended family. These principles can strengthen the parent relationship. Parents will be providing a positive role model for their children to see and families will become more cohesive by using the recipe of shared family identity. A small workbook section helps the reader put into action the concepts suggested by Barbara. By practicing such principles as flexibility and trust, the two of you can forge connections that can support each individual of the family, even into the next generation. “‘You’re NOT my dad!’ How do I even respond to that? What would my wife want me to say? These problems are so difficult to navigate. I am happy to see this book come along. I can’t wait to start cooking!” —Steve, stepdad “Barbara Peters shares effective strategies that empower blended families to be successful, such as building trust, working together to create the family they desire, and good advice on what not to say about ‘exes’. The recipe format is delightfully creative to read and practical to use.” —Elisabeth Davies, author and mental health counselor “I have performed numerous wedding ceremonies for brides and grooms who haven’t a clue of the blended family issues to come.

Relationship Economics,"Lindon J. Robison, Bryan K. Ritchie",CRC Press,2016-04-08,"In a 24/7 world and a global economy, there is no doubt that relationships impact virtually every economic transaction. In Relationship Economics, Lindon Robison and Bryan Ritchie argue that what needs to be understood is not just whether relationships matter (which, of course, they do), but also, how much, and in what circumstances they should matter. Providing a rigorous and measurable definition of the way that relationships among individuals create a capital, social capital, that can be saved, spent, and used like other forms of capital, Robison and Ritchie use numerous examples and insightful analysis, to explain how social capital shapes our ability to reduce poverty, understand corruption, encourage democracy, facilitate income equality, and respond to globalization. The first part of the book explains how social capital can be manipulated, stored, expended, and invested. The second part explores how levels of social capital within relationships influence economic transactions both positively and negatively, which in turn shape poverty levels, economic efficiency, levels and types of political participation, and institutional structures.",Business & Economics,283,N/A,0,en

The Many Faces of Polyamory,Magdalena J. Fosse,Routledge,2021-05-23,"The Many Faces of Polyamory: Longing and Belonging in Concurrent Relationships provides new perspectives on polyamory and the longing to belong in the relatively uncharted territory of nonnormative relationships. This volume offers a valuable and compelling account on how to approach polyamorous relationships from the clinical perspective. While there is no uniform answer, Dr. Fosse’s compassionate and discerning approach that combines relative neutrality, an open-minded embrace of nontraditional lifestyle choices, and skilful attention to countertransference dynamics is likely to be inspiring. Dr. Fosse exposes the dynamics of love, sex, jealousy, and compersion as they play out in lives of those interested in polyamory, and more broadly, consensual nonmonogamy. Her focus is on relationships worth having. With its nuanced clinical focus, The Many Faces of Polyamory will be an essential resource for psychotherapists, educators, students, and anyone inside and outside of the mental health field drawn to the intricacies of sexuality, intimacy, and how they are intertwined with relational satisfaction",Family & Relationships,280,N/A,0,en

From Exclusion to Excellence,"Michal Razer, Victor J. Friedman",BRILL,2019-02-18,"Dotted with lively dialogues that illustrate concrete issues, From Exclusion to Excellence: Building Restorative Relationships to Create Inclusive Schools is a practical guide to creating inclusive schools. The authors draw on their 30 years of action-research activities helping educators provide a meaningful education to at-risk/excluded students. They explain how teacher well-being is a precondition for building the sorts of relationships that enable excluded students to learn. They present in detail four concrete skills (non-abandonment, reframing, connecting conversation, and emphatic limit-setting) for reaching children and at the same time strengthening educators’ emotional resilience and professional pride. They address how schools can rethink and reshape the way they relate to parents of excluded children, so as to allow both sides to trust and empower each other. If you are a teacher, this book will help you make sense of the difficulties you face daily and provide you with reliable methods for working more effectively. If you are a principal or policymaker, it will show how the road to excellence begins with inclusion, and with providing teachers the kind of support that enables them to succeed.",Education,183,N/A,0,en

Corporate Diplomacy,Witold J. Henisz,Routledge,2017-09-08,"Managers of multinational organizations are struggling to win the strategic competition for the hearts and minds of external stakeholders. These stakeholders differ fundamentally in their worldview, their understanding of the market economy and their aspirations and fears for the future. Their collective opinions of managers and corporations will shape the competitive landscape of the global economy and have serious consequences for businesses that fail to meet their expectations. This important new book argues that the strategic management of relationships with external stakeholders – what the author calls ""Corporate Diplomacy"" – is not just canny PR, but creates real and lasting business value.Using a mix of colourful examples, practically relevant tools and considered perspectives, the book hones in on a fundamental challenge that managers of multinational corporations face as they strive to compete in the 21st century. As falling communication costs shrink, the distance between external stakeholders and shareholder value is increasingly created and protected through a strategic integration of the external stakeholder facing functions. These include government affairs, stakeholder relations, sustainability, enterprise risk management, community relations and corporate communications. Through such integration, the place where business, politics and society intersect need not be a source of nasty surprises or unexpected expenses. Most of the firms profiled in the book are now at the frontier of corporate diplomacy. But they didn’t start there. Many of them were motivated by past failings. They fell into conflicts with critical stakeholders – politicians, communities, NGO staffers, or activists – and they suffered. They experienced delays or disruptions to their operations, higher costs, angry customers, or thwarted attempts at expansion. Eventually, the managers of these companies developed smarter strategies for stakeholder engagement. They became corporate diplomats. The book draws on their experiences to take the reader to the forefront of stakeholder engagement and to highlight the six elements of corprate diplomacy.",Business & Economics,174,N/A,0,en

"Mindful Relationship Habits: 25 Practices for Couples to Enhance Intimacy, Nurture Closeness, and Grow a Deeper Connection",S. J.

Your relationship can often seem less urgent than the day-to-day emergencies that you deal with—your job, finances, children, and that to-do list full of chores. They all demand your immediate attention. What often gets lost in the shuffle is the love you share with your partner. If you want to build a deeper connection with your spouse or partner, then one solution is to build mindful relationship habits. In a mindful relationship, you are intentional about all your choices and interactions with your partner. You become more proactive in responding to each other’s needs and less reactive to the challenges that often arise. You evolve to a higher level of interaction with one another. The Wall Street Journal bestselling authors S.J. Scott and Barrie Davenport show you how to have a better relationship by applying 25 specific practices. These habits will help you be more present with one another, communicate better, avoid divisive arguments, and understand how to respond to one another’s needs in a more loving, empathic, and conscious way.",Self-Help,168,N/A,0,en

Consumer-Brand Relationships,"Susan Fournier, Michael Breazeale, Marc Fetscherin",Routledge,2012-03-29,"The creation and management of customer relationships is fundamental to the practice of marketing. Marketers have long maintained a keen interest in relationships: what they are, why they are formed, what effects they have on consumers and the marketplace, how they can be measured and when and how they evolve and decline. While marketing research has a long tradition in the study of business relationships between manufacturers and suppliers and buyers and sellers, attention in the past decade has expanded to the relationships that form between consumers and their brands (such as products, stores, celebrities, companies or countries). The aim of this book is to advance knowledge about consumer-brand relationships by disseminating new research that pushes beyond theory, to applications and practical implications of brand relationships that businesses can apply to their own marketing strategies. With contributions from an impressive array of scholars from around the world, this volume will provide students and researchers with a useful launch pad for further research in this blossoming area.",Business & Economics,501,N/A,0,en

The real question, says Krishnamurti, is: 'Why do you seek at all?' Knowing conflict, repression, self-doubt, and fear as consistent companions, we naturally wish for them to come to an end. So begins the search for relief, the search for everlasting peace--through ideas, religions, self-help, self-analysis, etc., and we think of this search as a right action towards finding what we are looking for. But do we know what we are looking for, or are we merely seeking relief from what is happening presently? Are we seeking at that point only an idea, the supposed opposite of the emotion that we are experiencing now? It is the search that maintains the present emotion and its projected opposite in a state of mutually co-existent conflict, inherently.",Philosophy,595,N/A,0,en

For seventeen years The Betrayal Bond has been the primary source for therapists and patients wrestling the effects of emotional pain and harm caused by exploitation from someone they trusted. Divorce, litigation, incest and child abuse, domestic violence, kidnapping, professional exploitation and religious abuse are all areas of trauma bonding. These are situations and relationships of incredible intensity or importance lend themselves more easily to an exploitation of trust or power. In The Betrayal Bond, Dr. Carnes presents an in-depth study of these relationships; why they form, who is most susceptible, and how they become so powerful. Dr. Carnes also gives a clear explanation of the bond that compels people to tolerate the intolerable, and for the first time, maps out the brain connection that makes being with hurtful people comparable to 'a drug of choice.' Most importantly, Carnes provides practical steps to identify compulsive attachment patterns and ultimately to change or end them for good.

Broad in its coverage, the book is process oriented and research based with each phase of the friendship process documented by empirical research. The result is a conceptual framework that illuminates the fascinating components of how we make friends, how we become close, how we maintain friends, and how friendships deteriorate and dissolve. Author Beverley Fehr equips the reader with valuable knowledge about the formations and continuations of the intriguing personal relationship called friendship. Friendship Processes also illustrates well the fact that, as a field of study, close relationships is maturing rapidly. Promising to be the definitive study of the subject for many years to come, this book will be of particular interest to professionals, academics, and students of social psychology, sociology, communication, family studies, and social work as well as any interested reader who is anxious to deepen his or her understanding and appreciation of a very engaging topic.",Psychology,259,N/A,0,en

Both theoretical essays and review chapters address issues relevant to female and male differences in power, dominance, communication, equality, and expectations/beliefs. All chapter contributors share two commonalities. First, each provides a 1990s assessment of power and equality in female and male relationships. Second, each reviews respective programs of research and focuses attention on the relevance of this research to understanding the relationships of women and men. Unique because it incorporates a multidisciplinary approach to the study of gender and the communication of power in human relationships, this book includes the original work of intellectuals with national and international reputations in the social sciences. The volume provides both scholastic breadth and centralized treatment of issues that form the very foundation of social and personal relationships.

The structural and functional information serves as an important foundation for the detailed anatomical knowledge necessary for the interpretation of imaging. The components of the temporal lobe are characterized. The temporal isocortex is considered from the point of view of its principal cellular constituents, connectivity, columnar organization, and how the cortex embodies experience. The cortical association areas for vision, audition, degustation, visceral sensory function, and olfaction are treated in detail, and the cortical area of the temporal lobe relating to speech is discussed. The structure of the insula, the temporal cortex, and its connectivity to the thalamus, pulvinar, striatum, and claustrum are described thoroughly. A chapter reviews the structure, connections and functions of the olfactory system, as well as its social aspects and pathological conditions. The largest chapter deals with the hippocampus--its anatomy and connections, its cellular architectonics, its relation to memory, and its varied functions. The final chapter details the amygdala, its connections, and its significant role in temporal lobe seizures.",Medical,896,N/A,0,en

How we interact with one another during each stage of a relationship is influenced by the volatile and sometimes divisive role that gender plays in our lives. Gender and Close Relationships is an exploration into the current world of gendered interaction and the ways in which gender influences how others perceive and treat us. This timely and comprehensive discussion demonstrates, clearly, how societies construct and create gendered relationships, but also suggests how ""non-traditional"" close relationships may strengthen, or make irrelevant, gender-linked behavior. While framed within a solid scholarship, the authorsÆ presentation style is accessible, engaging, and practical. This book is ideal for students as well as academics, researchers, and practitioners in the fields of psychology, gender studies, interpersonal communication, and family studies. Gender and Close Relationships will also provide the interested lay reader with a deeper understanding of how being gender-identified may influence the quality, quantity, and content of our relationships.",Medical,194,N/A,0,en

Win Your Partner Back After A Break Up?,Louisa Jackson,N/A,2021-05-08,"Those that go searching for love only make manifest their own lovelessness - D.H. Lawrence If you're going through the agony of a break up and you long, desperately, to reunite with your partner - this book is for you. Perhaps you're still with your partner but they're losing interest or pulling away - this book is also for you. Not all relationships can be saved. However, given the right inner conditions, some relationships can - and do - heal. Here you will learn precisely how to cultivate those conditions. Author, Louisa Jackson, describes how her life spiralled downwards after the break-up of a relationship. This triggered a long and intense period of study. Immersed in quantum physics, spirituality and Law of Attraction principles, she started to experiment with these concepts in her day-to-day life. Slowly, her intense suffering transformed into deep peace and happiness. A completely new way of living emerged and miraculous changes to all areas of her life then followed. Her long-term battle with depression, social anxiety and bulimia came to an end. Financial and family difficulties also resolved. So, too, did the cycle of toxic and dysfunctional relationships that she kept repeating over and over. Louisa now enjoys a happy, long-term, relationship - one which was successfully rekindled after applying the techniques and principles outlined in this book. The focus here is what's going on inside you, rather than on the outer circumstances of your life. For when you transform your inner world, you'll find that your outer world transforms in equal measure - sometimes in miraculous ways. As you'll see, this isn't merely a spiritual concept but is backed up by quantum physics principles. This book gets right to the heart of your beliefs about love, happiness and the fundamental nature of reality. It's faulty beliefs in these areas which are so often at the root of dysfunctional relationships. You'll learn what real happiness is, and how to cultivate it. You'll also discover techniques for sustaining the honeymoon period and how to prevent a repeating pattern of heartbreak. With practice, you'll stop needing love and instead start to radiate love. When this happens, you cannot help but attract love, whether that's from your existing partner or a new one. This is a new way of 'being' which will radiate out into all areas of your life. Whether you want to save a long-term marriage or a short-term romance, the same formula applies. You may even find after reading this book that you no longer want, or need, your partner to return.",,124,N/A,0,en

Continuing Bonds,"Dennis Klass, Phyllis R. Silverman, Steven Nickman",Taylor & Francis,2014-05-12,"First published in 1996. This new book gives voice to an emerging consensus among bereavement scholars that our understanding of the grief process needs to be expanded. The dominant 20th century model holds that the function of grief and mourning is to cut bonds with the deceased, thereby freeing the survivor to reinvest in new relationships in the present. Pathological grief has been defined in terms of holding on to the deceased. Close examination reveals that this model is based more on the cultural values of modernity than on any substantial data of what people actually do. Presenting data from several populations, 22 authors - among the most respected in their fields - demonstrate that the health resolution of grief enables one to maintain a continuing bond with the deceased. Despite cultural disapproval and lack of validation by professionals, survivors find places for the dead in their on-going lives and even in their communities. Such bonds are not denial: the deceased can provide resources for enriched functioning in the present. Chapters examine widows and widowers, bereaved children, parents and siblings, and a population previously excluded from bereavement research: adoptees and their birth parents. Bereavement in Japanese culture is also discussed, as are meanings and implications of this new model of grief. Opening new areas of research and scholarly dialogue, this work provides the basis for significant developments in clinical practice in the field.",Psychology,388,N/A,0,en

The Fractional Trigonometry,"Carl F. Lorenzo, Tom T. Hartley",John Wiley & Sons,2016-11-14,"Addresses the rapidly growing ­field of fractional calculus and provides simpli­fied solutions for linear commensurate-order fractional differential equations ­The Fractional Trigonometry: With Applications to Fractional Differential Equations and Science is the result of the authors’ work in fractional calculus, and more particularly, in functions for the solutions of fractional di­fferential equations, which is fostered in the behavior of generalized exponential functions. The authors discuss how fractional trigonometry plays a role analogous to the classical trigonometry for the fractional calculus by providing solutions to linear fractional di­fferential equations. The book begins with an introductory chapter that o­ffers insight into the fundamentals of fractional calculus, and topical coverage is then organized in two main parts. Part One develops the definitions and theories of fractional exponentials and fractional trigonometry. Part Two provides insight into various areas of potential application within the sciences. The fractional exponential function via the fundamental fractional differential equation, the generalized exponential function, and R-function relationships are discussed in addition to the fractional hyperboletry, the R1-fractional trigonometry, the R2-fractional trigonometry, and the R3-trigonometric functions. ­The Fractional Trigonometry: With Applications to Fractional Differential Equations and Science also: Presents fractional trigonometry as a tool for scientists and engineers and discusses how to apply fractional-order methods to the current toolbox of mathematical modelers Employs a mathematically clear presentation in an e­ ort to make the topic broadly accessible Includes solutions to linear fractional di­fferential equations and generously features graphical forms of functions to help readers visualize the presented concepts Provides e­ffective and efficient methods to describe complex structures ­The Fractional Trigonometry: With Applications to Fractional Differential Equations and Science is an ideal reference for academic researchers, research engineers, research scientists, mathematicians, physicists, biologists, and chemists who need to apply new fractional calculus methods to a variety of disciplines. The book is also appropriate as a textbook for graduate- and PhD-level courses in fractional calculus. Carl F. Lorenzo is Distinguished Research Associate at the NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. His past positions include chief engineer of the Instrumentation and Controls Division and chief of the Advanced Controls Technology and Systems Dynamics branches at NASA. He is internationally recognized for his work in the development and application of the fractional calculus and fractional trigonometry. Tom T.

Love and Loss,Colin Murray Parkes,Routledge,2013-05-13,"Loving and grieving are two sides of the same coin: we cannot have one without risking the other. Only by understanding the nature and pattern of loving can we begin to understand the problems of grieving. Conversely, the loss of a loved person can teach us much about the nature of love. Love and Loss, the result of a lifetime's work, has important implications for the study of attachment and bereavement. In this volume, Colin Murray Parkes reports his innovative research that enables us to bring together knowledge of childhood attachments and problems of bereavement, resulting in a new way of thinking about love, bereavement and other losses. Areas covered include: patterns of attachment and grief loss of a parent, child or spouse in adult life social isolation and support. The book concludes by looking at disorders of attachment and considering bereavement in terms of its implications on love, loss, and change in a wider context. Illuminating the structure and focus of thinking about love and loss, this book sheds light on a wide range of psychological issues.

Understanding Workplace Relationships,"Alexandra Gerbasi, Cécile Emery, Andrew Parker",Springer Nature,2023-02-20,"Workplace relationships are critical to how work gets done in organizations. While current research gives rigorous theoretical and empirical insights regarding workplace relationships, and what are often known as social networks, there are only limited details of the practical applications of workplace relations. This edited collection provides readers with cutting edge theoretical and practical insights from the latest research at the intersection of social networks and workplace relationships. This volume has a dual focus. First, it examines the outcomes of workplace relationships, such as individual performance and how social network relationships affect attitudes and behaviours. Second, it examines how workplace relationships are formed and their implications with regard to friendship, trust and collegiality. Drawing on innovative research on social networks, the authors examine the importance of workplace relationships across a broad selection of institutional settings. Featuring practical applied examples, this collection brings together insights from leading scholars in a practical and accessible format for academics and students.",Business & Economics,448,N/A,0,en

The Joy of Leadership,"Tal Ben-Shahar, Angus Ridgway",John Wiley & Sons,2017-08-07,"Think of the last time you were at your best and working in the zone. Now compare that to all the time you’ve spent just going through the motions. How would you quantify the difference between the two in terms of how you felt and what you produced? Would you rate it as a 5% difference. . . a 50% difference? Most people would describe the gulf between those two states of being as vast—as deep and wide as the Grand Canyon. For quality of experience, engagement, productivity, and just the sheer joy of living, the majority of people asked to rate the difference between flourishing and floundering found it to be around a factor of 10. In their work with managers and executives at leading companies around the world, authors Tal Ben-Shahar and Angus Ridgway have identified a select group of individuals who consistently perform at their peak, and who make work seem effortless and working with them feel easy. The name they’ve given to those lucky few is “10X Leaders”. You know who they are. They’re the team leaders who bring out the best in everyone. They’re the senior managers who drive growth and innovation. They’re the dream bosses, dream partners, and dream colleagues. There’s a good chance you’ve encountered at least one 10X leader in your career—you’re probably thinking of one right now. And you wondered how they did it. Dr. Ben-Shahar and Mr. Ridgway believe they know the answer. They have identified the core characteristics, behaviors, and cognitive styles that all 10X leaders share. Even better, they’ve developed a way for virtually anyone to cultivate those traits and ways of thinking in themselves to become happier, more effective, and more successful. In this powerful new book they describe their revolutionary SHARP (Strength, Health, Absorption, Relationships, and Purpose) program for becoming a 10X leader. They tell you the true stories of people at organizations around the globe who’ve become more effective by learning to use these performance multipliers. And they offer proven strategies for mastering those characteristics and habits for lasting change—the kind of change that can bring you greater fulfilment and success, not just at work, but in every area of your life.",Business & Economics,245,N/A,0,en
The Handbook of Research Synthesis and Meta-Analysis,"Harris Cooper, Larry V. Hedges, Jeffrey C. Valentine",Russell Sage Foundation,2009-02-05,"Praise for the first edition: ""The Handbook is a comprehensive treatment of literature synthesis and provides practical advice for anyone deep in the throes of, just teetering on the brink of, or attempting to decipher a meta-analysis. Given the expanding application and importance of literature synthesis, understanding both its strengths and weaknesses is essential for its practitioners and consumers. This volume is a good beginning for those who wish to gain that understanding."" —Chance ""Meta-analysis, as the statistical analysis of a large collection of results from individual studies is called, has now achieved a status of respectability in medicine. This respectability, when combined with the slight hint of mystique that sometimes surrounds meta-analysis, ensures that results of studies that use it are treated with the respect they deserve....The Handbook of Research Synthesis is one of the most important publications in this subject both as a definitive reference book and a practical manual.""—British Medical Journal When the first edition of The Handbook of Research Synthesis was published in 1994, it quickly became the definitive reference for researchers conducting meta-analyses of existing research in both the social and biological sciences. In this fully revised second edition, editors Harris Cooper, Larry Hedges, and Jeff Valentine present updated versions of the Handbook's classic chapters, as well as entirely new sections reporting on the most recent, cutting-edge developments in the field. Research synthesis is the practice of systematically distilling and integrating data from a variety of sources in order to draw more reliable conclusions about a given question or topic. The Handbook of Research Synthesis and Meta-Analysis draws upon years of groundbreaking advances that have transformed research synthesis from a narrative craft into an important scientific process in its own right. Cooper, Hedges, and Valentine have assembled leading authorities in the field to guide the reader through every stage of the research synthesis process—problem formulation, literature search and evaluation, statistical integration, and report preparation. The Handbook of Research Synthesis and Meta-Analysis incorporates state-of-the-art techniques from all quantitative synthesis traditions. Distilling a vast technical literature and many informal sources, the Handbook provides a portfolio of the most effective solutions to the problems of quantitative data integration. Among the statistical issues addressed by the authors are the synthesis of non-independent data sets, fixed and random effects methods, the performance of sensitivity analyses and model assessments, and the problem of missing data. The Handbook of Research Synthesis and Meta-Analysis also provides a rich treatment of the non-statistical aspects of research synthesis. Topics include searching the literature, and developing schemes for gathering information from study reports. Those engaged in research synthesis will also find useful advice on how tables, graphs, and narration can be used to provide the most meaningful communication of the results of research synthesis. In addition, the editors address the potentials and limitations of research synthesis, and its future directions. The past decade has been a period of enormous growth in the field of research synthesis. The second edition Handbook thoroughly revises original chapters to assure that the volume remains the most authoritative source of information for researchers undertaking meta-analysis today. In response to the increasing use of research synthesis in the formation of public policy, the second edition includes a new chapter on both the strengths and limitations of research synthesis in policy debates",Social Science,632,N/A,0,en

Anna K,Jenny Lee,Flatiron Books,2020-03-03,"A national indie bestseller! Meet Anna K: every happy teenage girl is the same, while every unhappy teenage girl is miserable in her own special way... At seventeen, Anna K is at the top of Manhattan and Greenwich society (even if she prefers the company of her horses and dogs); she has the perfect (if perfectly boring) boyfriend, Alexander W.; and she has always made her Korean-American father proud (even if he can be a little controlling). Meanwhile, Anna's brother, Steven, and his girlfriend, Lolly, are trying to weather an sexting scandal; Lolly’s little sister, Kimmie, is struggling to recalibrate to normal life after an injury derails her ice dancing career; and Steven’s best friend, Dustin, is madly (and one-sidedly) in love with Kimmie. As her friends struggle with the pitfalls of ordinary teenage life, Anna always seems to be able to sail gracefully above it all. That is...until the night she meets Alexia “Count” Vronsky at Grand Central. A notorious playboy who has bounced around boarding schools and who lives for his own pleasure, Alexia is everything Anna is not. But he has never been in love until he meets Anna, and maybe she hasn’t, either. As Alexia and Anna are pulled irresistibly together, she has to decide how much of her life she is willing to let go for the chance to be with him. And when a shocking revelation threatens to shatter their relationship, she is forced to question if she has ever known herself at all. Dazzlingly opulent and emotionally riveting, Anna K: A Love Story is a brilliant reimagining of Leo Tolstoy's timeless love story, Anna Karenina—but above all, it is a novel about the dizzying, glorious, heart-stopping experience of first love and first heartbreak.",Young Adult Fiction,495,N/A,0,en

Physics of Polymer Gels,Takamasa Sakai,John Wiley & Sons,2020-02-27,"Explains the correlation between the physical properties and structure of polymer gels This book elucidates in detail the physics of polymer gels and reviews their unique properties that make them attractive for innumerable applications. Geared towards experienced researchers and entrants to the field, it covers rubber elasticity, swelling and shrinking, deformation and fracture of as well as mass transport in polymer gels, enabling the readers to purposefully design polymer gels fit for specific purposes. Divided into two parts, Physics of Polymer Gels starts by explaining the statistical mechanics and scaling of a polymer chains, and that of polymer solutions. It then introduces the structure of polymer gels and explains the rubber elasticity, which predicts the solid-like nature of polymer gels. Next, it describes swelling/deswelling, which can be understood by combining the rubber elasticity and the osmotic pressure of a polymer solution. Large deformation and fracture, and the diffusion of substances in polymer gels, which are essential for practical applications, are also introduced. The last half of the book contains the authors' experimental results using Tetra-PEG gels and provides readers with the opportunity to examine and compare it with the first half in order to understand how to utilize the models to experiments. This title: * Is the first book dedicated to the physics of polymer gels * Describes in detail the properties of polymer gels and their underlying physics, facilitating the development of novel, polymer gel-based applications * Serves as a reference for all relevant polymer gel properties and their underlying physics * Provides a unified treatment of the subject, explaining the physical properties of polymer gels within a common nomenclature framework Physics of Polymer Gels is a must-have book for experienced researchers, such as polymer chemists, materials scientists, organic chemists, physical chemists, and solid-state physicists, as well as for newcomers to the field.",Technology & Engineering,392,N/A,0,en
Social Competence in Developmental Perspective,"Barry Schneider, Grazia Attili, Jacqueline Nadel, Roger Weissberg",Springer Science & Business Media,1989-08-31,"What determines the focus of a researcher's interest, the sources of inspiration for a study, or the variables scrutinized? If we were to examine the antecedents of these decisions, they would surely emerge as accidents of circumstance--the personal experiences of the researcher, the inspiration of early mentors, the influence of contemporary colleagues--all tempered by the intellectual currents that nurture the researcher's hypotheses. Among the accidents that mold the careers of researchers is geographic location. The culture in which a research program emerges helps determine both its very subject and its method. The primary purpose of this book is to assist those interested in the scientific study of children's social competence in transcending the boundaries imposed both by geography and by selective exposure to the highly diverse schools of thought that have led to interest in this field. Most of these ideas were presented and exchanged at an Advanced Study Institute entitled ""Social Competence in Developmental Perspective"" held in Savoie, France, in July 1988. This Institute was attended by scholars from France, England, Northern Ireland, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands, Canada, the United States and Brazil.

The Basics of Caring Research,"Satu Uusiautti, Kaarina Määttä",Springer,2016-07-08,"""What is caring research and how to conduct it? This book defines the new concept of caring research as a combination of two perspectives. Caring research means research that aims to promote well-being. It is focused on a good quality of life, human strengths and active life, as well as characteristics and positive development in human beings that act as buffers against malaise and help coping with adversities in life. In addition, caring research cares for the researcher well-being. Caring research is conducted by people who share the passion and enthusiasm to influence positively and collaborate. Caring research includes the joy of working and researching together. Thus, caring research is manifested in the relationships between researchers, supervisors, students, and other experts, and their mutual open and respectful interaction. The Basics of Caring Research analyzes these two elements of caring research through several viewpoints that are to illustrate the manifold nature of caring research as positively-focused and positively-conducted research. The book also includes critical analysis of the current requirements and future challenges of caring research. The book serves as a text book in, for example, research studies in psychology and educational and behavioral sciences.

Research Methods in Social Network Analysis,"Linton C. Freeman, Douglas R. White, Antone Kimball Romney",Transaction Publishers,N/A,"Since the publication of Herbert Spencer's Principles of Sociology in 1875, the use of social structure as a defining concept has produced a large body of creative speculations, insights, and intuitions about social life. However, writers in this tradition do not always provide the sorts of formal definitons and propositions that are the building blocks of modern social research. In its broad-ranging examination of the kind of data that form the basis for the systematic study of social structure, Research Methods in Social Network Analysis marks a significant methodological advance in network studies. As used in this volume, social structure refers to a bundle of intuitive natural language ideas and concepts about patterning in social relationships among people. In contrast, social networks is used to refer to a collection of precise analytic and methodological concepts and procedures that facilitate the collection of data and the systematic study of such patterning. Accordingly, the book's five sections are arranged to address analytical problems in a series of logically ordered stages or processes. The major contributors define the fundamental modes by which social structural phenomena are to be represented; how boundaries to a social structure are set; how the relations of a network are measured in terms of structure and content; the ways in which the relational structure of a network affects system actors; and how actors within a social network are clustered into cliques or groups. The chapters in the last section build on solutions to problems proposed in the previous sections. This highly unified approach to research design combined with a representative diversity of viewpoints makes Research Methods in Social Network Analysis a state-of-the-art volume.",Social Science,544,N/A,0,en
Methods for the Analysis of Asymmetric Proximity Data,"Giuseppe Bove, Akinori Okada, Donatella Vicari",Springer Nature,2021-08-14,"This book provides an accessible introduction and practical guidelines to apply asymmetric multidimensional scaling, cluster analysis, and related methods to asymmetric one-mode two-way and three-way asymmetric data. A major objective of this book is to present to applied researchers a set of methods and algorithms for graphical representation and clustering of asymmetric relationships. Data frequently concern measurements of asymmetric relationships between pairs of objects from a given set (e.g., subjects, variables, attributes,...), collected in one or more matrices. Examples abound in many different fields such as psychology, sociology, marketing research, and linguistics and more recently several applications have appeared in technological areas including cybernetics, air traffic control, robotics, and network analysis. The capabilities of the presented algorithms are illustrated by carefully chosen examples and supported by extensive data analyses. A review of the specialized statistical software available for the applications is also provided. This monograph is highly recommended to readers who need a complete and up-to-date reference on methods for asymmetric proximity data analysis.",Mathematics,203,N/A,0,en

Complex Artificial Environments,Juval Portugali,Springer Science & Business Media,2006-01-19,"Juval Portugali The notion of complex artificial environments (CAE) refers to theories of c- plexity and self-organization, as well as to artifacts in general, and to artificial - vironments, such as cities, in particular. The link between the two, however, is not trivial. For one thing, the theories of complexity and self-organization originated in the “hard” science and by reference to natural phenomena in physics and bi- ogy. The study of artifacts, per contra, has traditionally been the business of the “soft” disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. The notion of “complex artificial environments” thus implies the supposition that the theories of compl- ity and self-organization, together with the mathematical formalisms and meth- ologies developed for their study, apply beyond the domain of nature. Such a s- st position raises a whole set of questions relating to the nature of 21 century cities and urbanism, to philosophical issues regarding the natural versus the artificial, to the methodological legitimacy of interdisciplinary transfer of theories and me- odologies and to the implications that entail the use of sophisticated, state-of-t- art artifacts such as virtual reality (VR) cities and environments. The three-day workshop on the study of complex artificial environments that took place on the island of San Servolo, Venice, during April 1-3, 2004, was a gathering of scholars engaged in the study of the various aspects of CAE.",Political Science,325,N/A,0,en

"Social Work, Mental Health, and Public Policy in Diverse Contexts",Sheying Chen,Springer Nature,2023-09-30,"The discipline of social policy, oftentimes deemed a part of social work as a profession, was born in the West. Unlike social policy that started with the post-war idea of a welfare state in the mid-20th century, social work traces its roots to individual casework pioneered by the Charity Organization Society (COS), early social administration including state-wide poverty relief (an advocacy effort of the COS but with deep roots in the English Poor Laws of the 17th century), and social action emphasizing political activities to improve social conditions (originating from the Settlement House Movement which began in the 1880s). The development of social work is historically intertwined with that of public welfare, philanthropy, and charity and is an inherently international subject. This conception is broader than “international social work” as a discrete field of professional practice, which crosses geopolitical borders and all levels of social and economic organizations with a focus on development. However, each nation has a story of its own in terms of professionalization of social work in the evolution of public welfare and philanthropic/charitable undertaking within its particular economic, political, social, and cultural settings. A wide-ranging and in-depth study of various (especially non-Western) country cases is essential to an adequate, comprehensive understanding of the social work profession, which is also a basic requirement of its value of diversity. China is undoubtedly an important case with the largest population on earth. It’s also unique in view of so-called Chinese characteristics which are sometimes fundamentally different from other (particularly Western) societies. It’s even intriguing given the country’s lengthy, complex history and its recent, rapid rise to a global superpower with a claim of national goals and core values that seem to be rather considerable to social work as a helping profession. Therefore, any significant lessons learned from the Chinese experiences would help with a better international understanding and further advancement of social work and public welfare at a global scale.",Psychology,232,N/A,0,en

International Encyclopedia of Linguistics,William Frawley,Oxford University Press,2003-05,"The International Encyclopedia of Linguistics, 2nd Edition encompasses the full range of the contemporary field of linguistics, including historical, comparative, formal, mathematical, functional, and philosophical linguistics with special attention given to interrelations within branches of linguistics and to relations of linguistics with other disciplines. Areas of intersection with the social and behavioral sciences--ethnolinguistics, sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, and behavioral linguistics--receive major coverage, along with interdisciplinary work in language and literature, mathematical linguistics, computational linguistics, and applied linguistics.Longer entries in the International Encyclopedia of Linguistics, ranging up to four thousand words, survey the major fields of study--for example, anthropological linguistics, history of linguistics, semantics, and phonetics. Shorter entries treat specific topics within these fields, such as code switching, sound symbolism, and syntactic features. Other short entries define and discuss technical terms used within the various subfields or provide sketches of the careers of important scholars in the history of linguistics, such as Leonard Bloomfield, Roman Jakobson, and Edward Sapir.A major portion of the work is its extensive coverage of languages and language families. From those as familiar as English, Japanese, and the Romance languages to Hittite, Yoruba, and Nahuatl, all corners of the world receive treatment. Languages that are the subject of independent entries are analyzed in terms of their phonology, grammatical features, syntax, and writing systems. Lists attached to each article on a language group or family enumerate all languages, extinct or still spoken, within that group and provide detailed information on the number of known speakers, geographical range, and degree of intelligibility with other languages in the group. In this way, virtually every known language receives coverage.For ease of reference and to aid research, the articles are alphabetically arranged, each signed by the contributor, supported by up-to-date bibliographies, line drawings, maps, tables, and diagrams, and readily accessible via a system of cross-references and a detailed index and synoptic outline. Authoritative, comprehensive, and innovative, the 2nd edition of the International Encyclopedia of Linguistics will be an indispensable addition to personal, public, academic, and research libraries and will introduce a new generation of readers to the complexities and concerns of this field of study.",Language Arts & Disciplines,2198,5,1,en

Dating Radar,"Bill Eddy, Megan Hunter",Unhooked Books,2017-08-22,"Why do so many of us commit to the wrong person? Most believe that attraction and compatibility are the keys to relationship success when, in reality, these are red flags in 15-20% of the population. When it comes to love, the brain is irrational and shortsighted. We make decisions based on incomplete information, biased understanding, and strong emotion. Love truly is blind. That's why you need dating radar, it gives you a way to detect hazards you might otherwise miss by recognizing: 1. Warning signs of certain personalities that can spell love relationship danger 2. Ways that they can jam your radar (deceive you) 3.

The work outlines how self-esteem controls emotions and helps regulate expression of aggressive and violent feelings and behavior. The work demonstrates in three distinct parts how faculty can reduce and prevent violence in their schools by using the student-teacher relationship: theory, case studies, and learning activities. Anger and violence are reduced through increasing children’s self-esteem, which is developed through important relationships with adults. The book invites teachers, school counselors, school psychologists, and other school administrators to rethink their relationships with children and to incorporate the relational ingredients needed to increase children’s self-esteem by adopting features of evidence-based psychotherapy and demonstrating how such approaches can be applied in schools.",Education,157,N/A,0,en

Bobby and Cheryl Love were living in Brooklyn, happily married for decades, when the FBI and NYPD appeared at their door and demanded to know from Bobby, in front of his shocked wife and children: ""What is your name? No, what's your real name?"" Bobby's thirty-eight-year secret was out. As a Black child in the Jim Crow South, Bobby found himself in legal trouble before his 14th birthday. Sparked by the desperation he felt in the face of limited options and the pull of the streets, Bobby became a master thief. He soon found himself facing a thirty-year prison sentence.

During that time, he worked multiple jobs to support his wife and their growing family, coached Little League, attended church, took his kids to Disneyland, and led an otherwise normal life. Then it all came crashing down.

Why Couples Fight,Mira Kirshenbaum,Citadel Press,2021-01-26,"How do two well-meaning people who genuinely care about each other end up in a damaged, unsatisfying relationship? Every couple faces conflict. Most of the time, the root of the problem is that we’re not getting our needs met. And most of the time, we first try to remedy this with reasonable requests—or hints—and a kind tone. But when that fails, we feel disempowered, which leads to sighs, eye rolls, silences, subtle put-downs, insults, and even threats. These are power moves. And while we often use them without realizing it and without intention, the result is the same—our partner feels disempowered and will try to re-empower themselves. And so the endless, and endlessly destructive, dynamic takes hold. Relationship expert Mira Kirshenbaum, bestselling author of Too Good to Leave, Too Bad to Stay, reveals a better way: a three-step method for conflict-free problem solving. By recognizing each partner’s power moves, we can instead find mutually satisfying ways to heal our hurts and meet each other’s needs. Non-judgmental, compassionate, and wise, this is an indispensable guide to help couples end the negative cycle and get back to the loving understanding that brought them together in the first place. “Mira Kirshenbaum’s words of wisdom are an inspiration to everyone who reads them.” —Deepak Chopra",Family & Relationships,354,N/A,0,en

The background and the limitations of the existing data are reviewed and the data from sinusoidally-oscillating planar flow about smooth and rough circular cylinders are chosen to critically assess the MOJS equation. Six methods are examined to delineate the limitations of the MOJS equation and to devise a new force expression. The final method used (the Fourier analysis of the residues) led to the formulation of a three-term and a four-term MOJS equation. It is shown through numerous examples that the new MOJS equation reduces the residue significantly for both smooth and rough circular cylinders, particularly in the drag inertia dominated regime. Finally, the applicability of the new equation to the ocean conditions and the effect of spanwise coherence are discussed and numerous research projects are recommended for consideration. The suggestion is made that further improvement and understanding of the MOJS equation rest not only with carefully conducted laboratory investigations but also with additional ocean test designed to shed light on several complicating influences such as the spanwise coherence of vortices and vortex interactions.

Guanxi,"Y. H. Wong, Thomas K.

Surrounded by Setbacks,Thomas Erikson,St. Martin's Essentials,2022-11,"Part of the bestselling Surrounded by Idiots series! In Surrounded by Setbacks, internationally bestselling author Thomas Erikson turns his attention to a universal problem: what to do when things go wrong. Too often it seems like our dreams and ambitions—whether it’s finally getting that corner office, lacing up your running shoes again, or building a flourishing relationship with your partner—are derailed by one roadblock or another. So how do we learn to take setbacks in stride and still achieve our goals? In Surrounded by Setbacks, Erikson answers that question. Using simple, actionable steps, Erikson helps readers identify the “why” behind their goal, create a concrete plan towards achieving it, and—most importantly—avoid many of the most common pitfalls that derail us when we attempt something new. The simple 4-color behavior system that made Surrounded by Idiots revolutionary now helps readers reflect on how they respond to adversity, giving them the self-awareness to negotiate the inevitable obstacles of life with confidence.",Business & Economics,0,N/A,0,en

She is, without fail, the hottest girl in the room. Anytime. Anyplace. She has freckles and dimples and bright green eyes, and with someone else’s energy she’d be adorable. But there is nothing cute about Ivy. She is ice and hot metal and electricity. She is the girl who every lesbian wants, but she has never been with the same person twice. She’s one-of-a-kind but also predictable, so I will always be “best friend Andie,” never “girlfriend Andie.” Then she meets Dot, and Ivy does something even I would have never guessed—she sees Dot another day. And another. And another. Now my world is slowly going up in smoke, and no matter what I do, the flames grow higher. She lit that match without knowing who or what it would burn. Ivy K.

Panicle Architecture of Rice and its Relationship with Grain Filling,"Pravat K. Mohapatra, Binod Bihari Sahu",Springer Nature,2021-11-24,"This book shows the importance of rice for human consumption. It focuses on the rice panicle, its morphology and characteristics. High genetic diversity of rice has been economically profitable for mankind; the crop provides food calories to half of the human race on earth and because of its adaptability to diversified and unstable ecological conditions, the plant has an asynchronous flowering system in the panicle. The International Rice Research Institute has a collection of panicles with numerous branching phenotypes and lengths varying from 10 to 43 cm. Due to the heterogeneous architecture, grain filling depends on the position of the spikelet within a panicle. Spikelets on apical branches fertilize early and fill faster compared to their basal counterparts and therefore, individual grain weights of panicle vary widely. The discrepancy in grain filling between spikelets changes with panicle architecture but the relationship of variation in individual grain weight with panicle architecture has not been studied. Spikelet number has increased highly in the newly developed rice cultivars, but it has no benefit accrued on grain filling and yield. This book is recommended for students, researchers and teachers working in this field of expertise.",Technology & Engineering,328,N/A,0,en

You Are What You Love,James K. A. Smith,Brazos Press,2016-03-29,"Christianity Today Book Award Winner Martin Institute and Dallas Willard Center Book Award You are what you love. But you might not love what you think. In this book, award-winning author James K. A. Smith shows that who and what we worship fundamentally shape our hearts. And while we desire to shape culture, we are not often aware of how culture shapes us. We might not realize the ways our hearts are being taught to love rival gods instead of the One for whom we were made. Smith helps readers recognize the formative power of culture and the transformative possibilities of Christian practices. He explains that worship is the ""imagination station"" that incubates our loves and longings so that our cultural endeavors are indexed toward God and his kingdom. This is why the church and worshiping in a local community of believers should be the hub and heart of Christian formation and discipleship. Following the publication of his influential work Desiring the Kingdom, Smith received numerous requests from pastors and leaders for a more accessible version of that book's content. No mere abridgment, this new book draws on years of Smith's popular presentations on the ideas in Desiring the Kingdom to offer a fresh, bottom-up rearticulation. The author creatively uses film, literature, and music illustrations to engage readers and includes new material on marriage, family, youth ministry, and faith and work. He also suggests individual and communal practices for shaping the Christian life.",Religion,238,N/A,0,en
Awkward,Ty Tashiro,HarperCollins,2017-04-25,"Discover how the same traits that make us feel uneasy in social situations also provide the seeds for extraordinary success. As humans, we all need to belong. While modern social life can make even the most charismatic of us feel gawky, for roughly one in five of us, navigating its challenges is overwhelming. Psychologist and interpersonal relationship expert Ty Tashiro knows what it’s like to be awkward. Growing up, he could do complex arithmetic in his head and memorize the earned run averages of every National League starting pitcher. But he struggled to add up social cues during interactions with other kids and was prone to forget routine social expectations. In Awkard, Ty unpacks decades of research in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and sociology to help us better understand this widely share trait and its origins. He considers how awkward people view our complex world and explains how we can more comfortably engage with it, delivering a welcome, counterintuitive message: the same characteristics that make people socially clumsy can be harnessed to produce remarkable achievements. Interweaving the latest research with personal tales and real-world examples, Awkward provides valuable insights into how we can embrace our personal quirks and unique talents to realize our awesome potential.",Psychology,147,N/A,0,en

Gifts,"Ursula K. Le Guin, Ginger Clark",HarperCollins,2006-04-01,"In this beautifully crafted novel, the first of the Annals of the Western Shore trilogy, Ursula K. Le Guin writes of the proud cruelty of power, of how hard it is to grow up, and of how much harder still it is to find, in the world's darkness, gifts of light. Scattered among poor, desolate farms, the clans of the Uplands possess gifts. Wondrous gifts: the ability—with a glance, a gesture, a word—to summon animals, bring forth fire, move the land. Fearsome gifts: They can twist a limb, chain a mind, inflict a wasting illness. The Uplanders live in constant fear that one family might unleash its gift against another. Two young people, friends since childhood, decide not to use their gifts. One, a girl, refuses to bring animals to their death in the hunt. The other, a boy, wears a blindfold lest his eyes and his anger kill. “A brilliant exploration of the power and responsibility of gifts.” —Publishers Weekly (starred review) ""As always, Le Guin has delivered a story that captivates and draws the reader in. Anyone who enjoyed her Earthsea trilogy will relish this new work and fans of dark fantasy, such as Philip Pullman's The Golden Compass, will want to check out this title as well."" —BookPage ""In this moment in history, as well as in the current political climate, perhaps it's impossible not to see commentary behind every character in a young adult fantasy novel. But Le Guin's detailing of the consequences of greed, bullying and misused power is timeless as well as timely, and has the deep, lasting ring of truth that makes for well-loved, enduring young adult literature."" —Erin Ergenbright, The Oregonian “Gifts is an excellent read for teens of all interests. Fans of fantasy will be particularly drawn to it, but the world is grounded enough in earthly reality that it should appeal even to those who usually avoid the fantastical. Thought-provoking and suspenseful, with a dollop of action and romance, a novel like this is a gift to its readers."" —Lynn Crow, TeensReadToo The Annals of the Western Shore Trilogy includes: Gifts Voices Powers",Young Adult Fiction,288,N/A,0,en

Leaving Home before Marriage explores a step that young American adults are increasingly taking--setting up a household alone or with housemates. Frances K. Goldscheider and Calvin Goldscheider analyze this profound change as it figures in the plans of young people and their parents and in the decisions they eventually make about their living arrangements.

For all the joy that relationships and friendships can bring, showing romantic interest, establishing boundaries, and expressing identities as partners and friends isn’t easy for teens. They navigate an often ugly social universe. Even commonplace struggles can derail academic focus and harm emotional health. English teachers hope to give students communication skills, a love of literature, a passport to an intellectually vibrant life rich in opportunity. Through discussions of canonical works of literature, assignment ideas, anecdotes from teaching, and student perspectives, this book outlines how an academically rigorous English class can also heal, empower, and provide wisdom for teens weathering storms in their social lives. English class is health class. Widely taught novels brim with rich lessons about courtship, love, heartbreak, sexuality, bonds, and belonging. Learning to write stories, reflections, and arguments, speak confidently, and listen critically gives students powerful tools for self-expression, advocacy, and empathy in their relationships and friendships. The stakes are high and the rewards far-reaching. Students with healthier social lives do better academically, but they also end up becoming more responsible, caring grown-ups capable of improving an adult society that too often feels unsafe and tragically bereft of compassion.",Education,165,N/A,0,en

Becoming Toxic Person Proof,Sarah K Ramsey,Sarah K Ramsey,2021-02-05,"An intimate, powerful, and insightful playbook for navigating the world's most confusing people, brought to life by the host of the globally acclaimed Toxic-Person Proof podcast. ""Your eyes will forever be opened. This is a must read for anyone who has ever trusted someone they shouldn't have or left a conversation asking ""What just happened?'"" - Lauren In a rare combination of humor, vulnerability, and knowledge, the woman who has been deemed ""the success fairy"" and ""the narcissist ninja"" explores the peace and confidence we discover when we learn to trust ourselves rather than trusting the wrong types of people. Toxic people talk you out of listening to your intuition. They talk you out of seeing the red flags and make you feel like you are overreacting when you notice odd behavior. They talk you out of believing yourself and teach you to believe their lies instead. How do they do it? Why do we believe them? And, why do so many good people end up in bad situations? It is unusual to find a book as funny, thought provoking, and life changing as Becoming Toxic Person ProofTM. This book finally bridges the gap between studying toxic personalities and actually keeping yourself safe from them! Sarah provides the insights used to successfully help people around the world, stop talking about their toxic people problems and start solving their toxic people problems. She flips the script on traditional notions such as codependency and teaches you how toxic people use your strengths against you. Her research has shown that healing and happiness isn't found in studying narcissism, but in the triumph of a life well lived. Whether you've been taken advantage of by a boss or coworker, want to protect someone you love from a toxic person entanglement or are dealing with a toxic ex, you'll find hope and help within these pages.",,196,N/A,0,en

Divorceless Relationships,"Gary M. Douglas, Dain Heer",Access Consciousness Publishing Company,2013,"What if you don't have to divorce you in order to create an intimate relationship? Most of us spend a lot of time divorcing parts and pieces of ourselves in order to care for someone else. For example, you like to go jogging but instead of jogging, you spend that time with your partner to show him or her that you really care. ""I love you so much that I would give up this thing that is valuable to me so I can be with you."" This is one of the ways you divorce you to create an intimate relationship. How often does divorcing you really work in the long run? When you give up any part of yourself, you give up what was so attractive about you to that other person in the first place and pretty soon the other person doesn't want to be with you anymore. A divorceless relationship is one where you don't have to divorce any part of you in order to be in a relationship with someone else. It is a place where everyone and everything you are in a relationship with can become greater as a result of the relationship. Divorceless Relationship contains tools, exercises and processes you can use to: * Create divorceless relationships * Discover what you would like as a relationship * Discover what is true for you * Use energy to attract the person you're interested in * Know when it's time to leave a relationship * Renew and recreate your relationship with your partner * Bring sex back into your relationship * Turn your lover on",Interpersonal relations,0,N/A,0,en

Routledge Handbook of Celebrity Studies,Anthony Elliott,Routledge,2018-03-05,"Ours is the age of celebrity. An inescapable aspect of daily life in our media-saturated societies of the twenty-first century, celebrity is celebrated for its infinite plasticity and glossy seductions. But there is also a darker side. Celebrity culture is littered from end to end with addictions, pathologies, neuroses, even suicides. Why, as a society, are we held in thrall to celebrity? What is the power of celebrity in a world of increasing consumerism, individualism and globalization? Routledge Handbook of Celebrity Studies, edited by acclaimed social theorist Anthony Elliott, offers a remarkably clear overview of the analysis of celebrity in the social sciences and humanities, and in so doing seeks to develop a new agenda for celebrity studies. The key theories of celebrity, ranging from classical sociological accounts to critical theory, and from media studies to postmodern approaches, are drawn together and critically appraised. There are substantive chapters looking at fame, renown and celebrity in terms of the media industries, pop music, the makeover industries, soap stars, fans and fandom as well as the rise of non-Western forms of celebrity. The Handbook also explores in detail the institutional aspects of celebrity, and especially new forms of mediated action and interaction. From Web 3.0 to social media, the culture of celebrity is fast redefining the public political sphere. Throughout this volume, there is a strong emphasis on interdisciplinarity with chapters covering sociology, cultural studies, psychology, politics and history. Written in a clear and direct style, this handbook will appeal to a wide undergraduate audience. The extensive references and sources will direct students to areas of further study.",Social Science,717,N/A,0,en

The Angry Therapist,John Kim,Parallax Press,2017-04-18,"Tackling relationships, career, and family issues, John Kim, LMFT, thinks of himself as a life-styledesigner, not a therapist. His radical new approach, that he sometimes calls “self-help in a shot glass” is easy, real, and to the point. He helps people make changes to their lives so that personal growth happens organically, just by living. Let’s face it, therapy is a luxury. Few of us have the time or money to devote to going to an office every week. With anecdotes illustrating principles in action (in relatable and sometimes irreverent fashion) and stand-alone practices and exercises, Kim gives readers the tools and directions to focus on what's right with them instead of what's wrong. When John Kim was going through the end of a relationship, he began blogging as The Angry Therapist, documenting his personal journey post-divorce. Traditional therapists avoid transparency, but Kim preferred the language of ""me too"" as opposed to ""you should."" He blogged about his own shortcomings, revelations, views on relationships, and the world. He spoke a different therapeutic language —open, raw, and at times subversive — and people responded. The Angry Therapist blog, that inspired this book, has been featured in The Atlantic Monthly and on NPR.",Self-Help,170,N/A,0,en

Lateralization and cognitive systems,"Sebastian Ocklenburg, Christian Beste, Onur Gunturkun,  Marco Hirnstein",Frontiers Media SA,2015-02-24,"Left-right asymmetries of structure and function are a common organization principle in the brains of humans and non-human vertebrates alike. While there are inherently asymmetric systems such as the human language system or the song system of songbirds, the impact of structural or functional asymmetries on perception, cognition and behavior is not necessarily limited to these systems. For example, performance in experimental paradigms that assess executive functions such as inhibition, planning or action monitoring is influenced by information processing in the bottom-up channel. Depending on the type of stimuli used, one hemisphere can be more efficient in processing than the other and these functional cerebral asymmetries have been shown to modulate the efficacy of executive functions via the bottom-up channel. We only begin to understand the complex neuronal mechanisms underlying this interaction between hemispheric asymmetries and cognitive systems. Therefore, it is the aim of this Research Topics to further elucidate how structural or functional hemispheric asymmetries modulate perception, cognition and behavior in the broadest sense.",Psychology,315,N/A,0,en

It explores the idea of love as a key element in the promotion of solidarity and recognition in today’s plural and unequal societies.

"New Horizons in Arts, Heritage, Nonprofit and Social Marketing","Roger Bennett, Finola Kerrigan, Daragh O'Reilly",Routledge,2013-09-13,"Arts, heritage, non-profit and social marketing today comprise key components of the contemporary marketing management scene. Governments, charities and voluntary sector organisations throughout the world are increasingly involved in the development of marketing campaigns, and more and more of these organisations are likely to be at the cutting edge of the application of the very latest marketing methods.

Reading Madeleine L’Engle,Heidi A. Lawrence,Taylor & Francis,2023-10-20,"Using a critical lens derived from ecopsychology and its praxis, ecotherapy, this book explores the relationships Madeleine L’Engle develops for her characters in a selection of the novels from her three Time, Austin family, and O’Keefe family series as those relationships develop along a human-nonhuman kinship continuum. This is accomplished through an examination both of pairs of novels from the fantastic and the realistic series, and of single novels which stand out as slightly different from the most prominent genre in a given series. Thus, this examination also shows L’Engle’s fluid movement along a fantasy-reality continuum and demonstrates the integration of the three series with each other. Importantly, through examining these relationships and this movement along continuums in these novels, the project demonstrates how ecopsychology and ecotherapy provide strong and important – and as-yet virtually unexplored – intersections with children’s literature.",Literary Criticism,209,N/A,0,en

Conversations with Madeleine L'Engle,Jackie C. Horne,Univ. Press of Mississippi,2018-12-03,"Conversations with Madeleine L’Engle is the first collection of interviews with the beloved children’s book author best known for her 1962 Newbery Award–winning novel, A Wrinkle in Time. However, Madeleine L’Engle's accomplishments as a writer spread far beyond children’s literature. Beginning her career as a literary novelist for adults, L’Engle (1918–2007) continued to write fiction for both young and old long after A Wrinkle in Time. In her sixties, she published personal memoirs and devotional texts that explored her relationship with religion. At the time of her death, L’Engle was mourned by fans of her children’s books and the larger Christian community. L’Engle’s books, as well as her life, were often marked by contradictions. A consummate storyteller, L’Engle carefully crafted and performed a public self-image via her interviews. Weaving through the documentable facts in these interviews are partial lies, misdirections, and wish-fulfillment fantasies. But, when read against her fictions, these “truths” can help us see L’Engle more deeply—what she wanted for herself and for her children, what she believed about good and evil, and what she thought was the right way and the wrong way to be a family—than if she had been able to articulate the truth more directly. The thirteen interviews collected here reveal an amazing feat of authorial self-fashioning, as L’Engle transformed from novelist to children’s author to Christian writer and attempted to craft a public persona that would speak to each of these different audiences in meaningful, yet not painfully revealing, ways.",Biography & Autobiography,217,N/A,0,en
Classroom Control (RLE Edu L),Martyn Denscombe,Routledge,2012-05-04,"Survival as a school teacher depends on an ability to achieve classroom control. In the years since this book was first published little has changed in this respect. Classroom control continues to lie at the heart of competent teaching. Teachers know it, pupils know it. They know it implicitly because they experience it as a normal part of their daily lives in schools. But, in this book, the author stands back from our everyday knowledge about how things work in classrooms to ask what control actually consists of. What is it? How is it recognized? How is it challenged by pupils? How is done by teachers? How is it negotiated? Drawing on extensive ethnographic fieldwork in three large secondary schools in England Martyn Denscombe explores the meaning of classroom control. He looks at the influence of teacher training and the role of school organization in establishing expectations about control, and then shows how control is played out through the interaction of teachers and pupils in class. His analysis travels well across the many contexts in which teaching occurs and provides an illuminating insight into the work of teaching and the nature of classroom life. His evidence is drawn from ethnographic fieldwork in three schools in England, and secondary sources covering the phenomenon of classroom control in the UK, USA and Australia.",Education,242,N/A,0,en

Abū’l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī’s Metaphysical Philosophy,Moshe M Pavlov,Taylor & Francis,2017-04-21,"Abū’l-Barakāt is a renowned philosopher of the Arabic-Jewish milieu who composed in his magnum opus the Kitāb al-Mu‘tabar, a comprehensive metaphysics which challenged the accepted notions of the traditional metaphysical philosophy. ‘Abū’l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī’s Metaphysical Philosophy’ examines the novel philosophical conceptions of the first book of the Metaphysics of the Kitāb al-Mu‘tabar. The aim is to present a developed conception of Abū’l-Barakāt’s systematic metaphysics. This is accomplished by following the order of topics discussed, while translating the relevant passages. These different topics comprise stages of cognition that move from an analysis of time, creation and causality to the conception of a higher spiritual realm of mental entities and a conception of God as the First Knower and Teacher. The epistemological and ontological conceptions are analyzed at each culminating stage. ‘Abū’l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī’s Metaphysical Philosophy’ analyzes vast portions of the metaphysical study for the first time. The book will thus be a valuable resource for all those seeking an original and broad metaphysics, and for students and scholars of Jewish and Islamic Philosophy. Furthermore, it is of importance for those seeking a metaphysics related to scientific theories and those interested in the history of science and metaphysics.",Philosophy,401,N/A,0,en

"Sports, Religion and Disability","Nick J. Watson, Andrew Parker",Routledge,2016-04-14,"This ground-breaking book provides a fascinating insight into the relationship between sports (and leisure), religion and disability. In the shadow of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, at which athletes that were both able-bodied and disabled, provided an extravaganza of sporting excellence and drama, this text is a timely and important synthesis of ideas that have emerged in two previously distinct areas of research: (i) ‘disability sport’ and (ii) the ‘theology of disability’. Many of the elite athletes at this global sporting mega-event often explicitly displayed their religious beliefs, and in turn their importance in the context of sport, by observing different religious rituals, and or, utilising the multi-faith sports chaplaincy service. This raises a whole range of unanswered questions with regard to the intersections between sports, religion and disability, which to-date has been under- researched. Examples of subjects addressed in this text include: elite physical disability sport--Paralympics; intellectual disability sport--Special Olympics; reflections on the illness narrative of the cyclist Lance Armstrong through the lens of the theology of ‘radical orthodoxy’; the application of biblical athletic metaphors in understanding modern conceptions of disability sport; the role of sport and spirituality in the rehabilitation of injured British Military personnel, and; the importance of sports and leisure in L’Arche communities. This book begins a critical conversation on these topics, and many others, for both researchers and practitioners.

If we really understand the nature of mental illness then we should be able to not only predict but perhaps even to control it irrespective of the type of mental illness in question but also the degree of severity of the illness in order to allow us to predict their long-term outcome and begin to reduce its influence and costs to society.

"The Nature of Love, Volume 2",Irving Singer,MIT Press,2009-02-20,"An examination of ideas and ideals of medieval courtly love and the transition into later Romantic love, analyzing the work of Dante, Shakespeare, and Schopenhauer, among many others. Review), ""monumental"" (Boston Globe), ""one of the major works of philosophy in our century"" (Nous), ""wise and magisterial"" (Times Literary Supplement), and a ""masterpiece of critical thinking [that] is a timely, eloquent, and scrupulous account of what, after all, still makes the world go round"" (Christian Science Monitor). In the second volume, Singer studies the ideas and ideals of medieval courtly love and nineteenth-century Romantic love, as well as the transition between these two perspectives. According to the traditions of courtly love in the twelfth century and thereafter, not only God but also human beings in themselves are capable of authentic love. The pursuit of love between man and woman was seen as a splendid ideal that ennobles both the lover and the beloved. It was something more than libidinal sexuality and involved sophisticated and highly refined courtliness that emulated religious love in its ability to create a holy union between the participants. Adherents to Romantic love in later centuries, affirmed the capacity of love to effect a merging between two people who thus became one. Singer analyzes the transition from courtly to Romantic by reference to the writings of many artists beginning with Dante and ending with Richard Wagner, as well as Neoplatonist philosophers of the Italian Renaissance, Descartes, Spinoza, Rousseau, Hume, Kant, Hegel, and Schopenhauer. In relation to romanticism itself, he distinguishes between two aspects—""benign romanticism"" and ""Romantic pessimism""—that took on renewed importance in the twentieth century.",Philosophy,548,N/A,0,en

Yet for most women, especially those at mid-career level, building a network is an arduous task that ends up low on the priority list. Women at this level are prone to hunker down, work hard, and expect their work to speak for itself. They assume that excellent work will be rewarded with advancement. They also assume that getting ahead by ""playing the game"" will compromise their integrity.In this ground-breaking book, Dr. Rosina Racioppi, President and CEO of WOMEN Unlimited, Inc., explains why these assumptions are dead wrong. While excellent work is a prerequisite for success, without strategic thinking, visibility, and the ability to leverage relationships for knowledge, resources, and practical wisdom, outstanding work is a dead end.Relationships Matter draws on WOMEN Unlimited's extensive experience partnering with Fortune 1000 organizations, the author's comprehensive research, and in-depth interviews with 10 successful leaders.

"Family Dysfunctionalism and the Origin of Codependency Addiction Emotional Violence, Repression, Manipulation, Deception, Alienation, Self-Degeneration, and Separation-Learned in Childhood and Weaved-In Adulthood",Marteaux X Ph.D.,iUniverse,2020-04-23,"CODEPENDENCY BOOK BACKCOVER The Milky Way Galaxy, and everything therein, consisting of suns, moons, planets, asteroids, gases, energy, black holes, and particles of dust among others are-ALL-infinitely connected to each other by gravity, which holds everything together. Likewise, CoDependency Addiction, similar to the Earth revolving around our Sun, it-too-revolves around the absence of mother, father, or mother surrogate love in a child’s life and beyond. It is the primary source from which it originates, develops, and thrives within the mind-body of an affected human being. Mother, father, and mother surrogate love is the fuel that drives the development of an infant through the dependency state one is born in into the higher conscious awareness interdependency state. Initially, mother or mother surrogate love is used to assist their infant to self-actualize, namely to learn he or she is love by being loved by their parents. If this most critical step is missed, at a most critical time in the early development of an infant, from birth to six years old; unfortunately, the latter does not evolve emotionally to the interdependency state, in which the child, by this time, knows one Self as being love, and who realizes simultaneously that it is necessary to give their love to another human being, and by doing so, one is enabled to learn and experience what it feels like to be loved. When this irreplaceable process is carried-out according to Nature, the child is embodied with the fundamental tool to transform Self progressively into a “work of art.” One of the many contributions this book makes to our understanding of CoDependency Addiction is, when a child does not evolve emotionally into the interdependency state, he or she remains in a dependency state beyond appropriate years. By six years old, a child, who has been adequately nurtured with love from the outset, develops in their brain what is called “love circuits.” In the absence of mother or mother surrogate love during this crucial time, these circuits-empathy, kindness, caring, altruism, friendship, compassion, etc.-are replaced with others such as anger, shame, denial, guilt, low self-esteem, not good enough, unworthiness, narcissisms, ego etc. It is in this developmental space we find the origin of CoDependency Addiction manifested in an affected person’s adult life. Unable to make genuine friends and be loved, both of which are cornerstones of the interdependency state, fear and self-preservation emerge as a daily preoccupation and concern. This book outlines in detail how CoDependency Addiction is repressed within one’s injured and wounded “self,” and because of denial and projection, a web of deception is employed to “Go Along, To Get Along.” Although the hypnotic rhythm makes healing more formidable as the years pass, the solution is determination to shatter denial.

In this book, two pioneering researchers present a groundbreaking theory of how mutually responsive behaviors emerge—or fail to emerge—in relationships. Illustrating their findings through the vivid stories of four diverse couples, the authors explore how conscious considerations interact with unconscious impulses to foster trust and commitment.

Loving through Your Differences,James L. Creighton,New World Library,2019-02-05,"FIND HAPPINESS AND FULFILLMENT THROUGH — RATHER THAN DESPITE — YOUR DIFFERENCES Dr. James Creighton has worked with couples for decades, facilitating communication and conflict resolution and teaching them the tools to build healthy, happy relationships. He has found that many couples start out believing they like the same things, see people the same way, and share a united take on the world. But inevitably differences crop up, and it can be profoundly discouraging to find that one's partner sees a person, situation, or decision completely differently. Although many relationships flounder at this point, Creighton shows that this can actually be an opportunity to forge stronger ties. In Loving through Your Differences, he draws on the latest research in cognitive science and developmental psychology to show how we invent our realities with our perceptual minds. He then provides clear, concrete tools for shifting our perceptions and reframing our responses. The result moves couples out of the fear and alienation of ""your way or my way"" and into a deep understanding of the other that allows for an ""our way."" As Creighton shows, this way of being together, based on the reality of individuality rather than the illusion of sameness, sets the stage for long-term excitement, discovery, and fulfillment.",Family & Relationships,202,N/A,0,en
Delicate Forget-me-nots,Dana Krystle,Dana Krystle,2023-08-06,"Forget-me-nots are delicate blue cluster spring flowers used as a symbol of remembrance, true love and devotion.

The Bond of the Furthest Apart,Sharon Cameron,University of Chicago Press,2017-04-10,"In the French filmmaker Robert Bresson’s cinematography, the linkage of fragmented, dissimilar images challenges our assumption that we know either what things are in themselves or the infinite ways in which they are entangled. The “bond” of Sharon Cameron’s title refers to the astonishing connections found both within Bresson’s films and across literary works by Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and Kafka, whose visionary rethinkings of experience are akin to Bresson’s in their resistance to all forms of abstraction and classification that segregate aspects of reality. Whether exploring Bresson’s efforts to reassess the limits of human reason and will, Dostoevsky’s subversions of Christian conventions, Tolstoy’s incompatible beliefs about death, or Kafka’s focus on creatures neither human nor animal, Cameron illuminates how the repeated juxtaposition of disparate, even antithetical, phenomena carves out new approaches to defining the essence of being, one where the very nature of fixed categories is brought into question. An innovative look at a classic French auteur and three giants of European literature, The Bond of the Furthest Apart will interest scholars of literature, film, ethics, aesthetics, and anyone drawn to an experimental venture in critical thought.",Literary Criticism,279,N/A,0,en

Renewing Relationships,"Karen Anne Drake, Brenda L. Gunn",N/A,2019,"""This edited collection features essays by Indigenous legal academics from across Canada about renewing relationships between Indigenous peoples and Canada. Some Indigenous nations might embrace principles of reconciliation as reflecting a renewed relationship, while others reject the concept of reconciliation and instead advocate for resistance or decolonization. This collection includes chapters that critically engage with these theoretical debates, as well as chapters that analyze how these concepts can be instantiated in tangible and specific ways. It builds on existing literature on Indigenous-Crown relationships that addresses issues such as the inclusion of Indigenous laws, self-determination, and the role of the constitution. The chapters explore questions such as: What does a renewed relationship look like in modern Canadian society? What is the role of Indigenous law in renewing the relationship between Indigenous peoples and Canada? What does the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples contribute to an understanding of a renewed relationship? How do treaties define Indigenous-Crown relationships? What shifts must occur within Canadian institutions to move away from the current colonial relationship?""--",Canada,0,N/A,0,en

The book stimulates discussion of personal relationships as resources for and outcomes of individual development throughout the life course. Different qualities of personal relationships serve as catalysts for individual development. At the same time, relationship qualities reflect changes of developing individuals.

Where Did Our Love Go,Gil Robertson,Agate Publishing,2013-01-21,"Where Did Our Love Go?, an anthology of essays written by many major public figures and celebrities, will explore the substantive issues related to marital problem in the African-American community. From the ""my baby's mama"" syndrome to the more serious implications of what a generation of single-parent households will mean to future generations, this comprehensive collection will provide an in-depth discourse on the trends and issues that have caused the problematic behaviors within African-American relationships to persist with little sign of relief. The book will consist of a total of 40 essays divided equally into 4 lifestyle categories (single, married, divorced, and widowed), to present a wide cross section of perspectives on this subject. Marriage plays an essential role in maintaining the vitality and character of a community, so it is deeply unsettling for many African Americans to find that the value of this institution has lost its allure. While marriage among African Americans has always fallen below the average of other population segments, the gap today has grown so pronounced that the subject has sparked an intense national dialogue. A 2006 Washington Post article, “Is Marriage for White People,” created waves of controversy on the issue. In 2010, Nightline dedicated an entire broadcast to this growing crisis. The marriage gap in Black America has become such an open secret that it’s now the source of endless bad jokes and prime time reality shows. The statistics even back this up, as according to the U.S. Census, 43.3% of black men and 41.9% of black women in America have never been married, and the rate of decline is nearly twice the national average. Marriage is a rite of passage that is fundamental to every culture, which underscores the tremendous need for an active dialogue to take place that will lay a foundation for discovery. With essays from 50 Cent, Viola Davis, Jabari Asim, Darnell Williams, Faith Evans, Mara Brock Akil, and more, Where Did Our Love Go? will ignite the fight for that conversation to begin.",Family & Relationships,257,N/A,0,en

Connected Teaching,Harriet L. Schwartz,Taylor & Francis,2023-07-03,"At a time when many aspects of the faculty role are in question, Harriet Schwartz, the author of Connected Teaching, argues that the role of teachers is as important as ever and is evolving profoundly. She believes the relationships faculty have with individual students and with classes and cohorts are the essential driver of teaching and learning.This book explores teaching as a relational practice – a practice wherein connection and disconnection with students, power, identity, and emotion shape the teaching and learning endeavor. The author describes moments of energetic deep learning and what makes these powerful moments happen. She calls on readers to be open to and seek relationship, understand their own socio-cultural identity (and how this shapes internal experience and the ways in which they are met in the world), and vigilantly explore and recognize emotion in the teaching endeavor. Connected Teaching is informed and inspired by Relational Cultural Theory (RCT). The premise of RCT is that the experience of engaging in growth-fostering interactions and relationships is essential to human development. RCT’s founding scholars believed the theory would be relevant in many different settings, but this is the first book to apply them to teaching and learning in higher education. In this book, the author shows that RCT has much to offer those devoted to student learning and development, providing a foundation from which to understand the transformative potential of teaching as a relational practice.",Education,177,N/A,0,en

In writing Person to Person 5.e, Sharon Hanna, Doug Radtke, and Rose Suggett sought to delve into a skill too often glossed over or taken for granted in all our lives: building positive relationships is not an accident; each one requires understanding and effort. Because the self is the foundation of all relationships, one of the goals of this text is self-discovery and self-satisfaction, with an emphasis on heightened self-esteem, and the ability to make wise choices regarding emotional and physical health. Because through interpersonal communication human beings interact and relate to one another, it is essential to learn how to communicate in a positive way; the overriding goal of the second section of this text. Learning about oneself and developing effective communication skills will help build positive relationships. The last section of this book teaches about various interactions and all kinds of relationships. Career, love, couple relationships, marriage, and family are given special emphasis.

Let Him Chase You: A Simple Guide for Women Who Want Both Long-Lasting Love and Respect in Their Relationships with Men,L. Lynn Gilliard,N/A,2013-11,"Are you the pursuer or do you let men pursue YOU? The answer is the difference between you becoming a side toy for a man to play with or a girlfriend with a title and eventually a woman who any man would be eager to call his wife. Many of us modern 21st century women have been taught that in order to get a guy we have to go out there and snag him, trick him, tag him and drag him home. But that doesn't work -- at least not in the long run. Men are natural hunters. They won't always admit it, but they absolutely LOVE the chase. They want a woman who is interesting, confident and vocal. They want a woman who sets boundaries and keeps them on their toes. They want to earn a woman's love. This simple, easy-to-follow guide explains how you can shake off meaningless flings with men and start to attract men who are serious about you. What You'll Learn: * How to avoid Friends with Benefits and Booty Calls * How to recognize when a man is just toying with you * Why men love bad girls and strippers * The single most irresistible thing about a woman * What makes a man fall in love, I mean head over heels for you Love Lynn",Self-Help,150,N/A,0,en

Organized into brief topical discussions, the book takes a biblical look at fifty-two subjects, including: The Trinity, Life Goals, Attributes of God, Developing Habits, Worship, Budgeting, The Fall, Sharing Your Faith, The Resurrection, Contentment. Rediscover the awesome God revealed in the Bible and find the tools you need to provide you with motivation and direction for an exciting, vibrant life in Christ through Basics for Believers.",Religion,196,N/A,0,en

Loving through Your Differences,James L. Creighton,New World Library,2019-02-05,"FIND HAPPINESS AND FULFILLMENT THROUGH — RATHER THAN DESPITE — YOUR DIFFERENCES Dr. James Creighton has worked with couples for decades, facilitating communication and conflict resolution and teaching them the tools to build healthy, happy relationships. He has found that many couples start out believing they like the same things, see people the same way, and share a united take on the world. But inevitably differences crop up, and it can be profoundly discouraging to find that one’s partner sees a person, situation, or decision completely differently. Although many relationships flounder at this point, Creighton shows that this can actually be an opportunity to forge stronger ties. In Loving through Your Differences, he draws on the latest research in cognitive science and developmental psychology to show how we invent our realities with our perceptual minds. He then provides clear, concrete tools for shifting our perceptions and reframing our responses. The result moves couples out of the fear and alienation of “your way or my way” and into a deep understanding of the other that allows for an “our way.” As Creighton shows, this way of being together, based on the reality of individuality rather than the illusion of sameness, sets the stage for long-term excitement, discovery, and fulfillment.",Family & Relationships,202,N/A,0,en

Love in Africa,"Jennifer Cole, Lynn M. Thomas",University of Chicago Press,2009-08-01,"In recent years, scholarly interest in love has flourished. Historians have addressed the rise of romantic love and marriage in Europe and the United States, while anthropologists have explored the ways globalization has reshaped local ideas about those same topics. Yet, love in Africa has been peculiarly ignored, resulting in a serious lack of understanding about this vital element of social life—a glaring omission given the intense focus on sexuality in Africa in the wake of HIV/AIDS. Love in Africa seeks both to understand this failure to consider love and to begin to correct it. In a substantive introduction and eight essays that examine a variety of countries and range in time from the 1930s to the present, the contributors collectively argue for the importance of paying attention to the many different cultural and historical strands that constitute love in Africa. Covering such diverse topics as the reception of Bollywood movies in 1950s Zanzibar, the effects of a Mexican telenovela on young people’s ideas about courtship in Niger, the models of romance promoted by South African and Kenyan magazines, and the complex relationship between love and money in Madagascar and South Africa, Love in Africa is a vivid and compelling look at love’s role in African society.",Social Science,277,N/A,0,en

The Ex-Prisoner's Dilemma,Andrea M. Leverentz,Rutgers University Press,2014-03-20,"When a woman leaves prison, she enters a world of competing messages and conflicting advice. Staff from prison, friends, family members, workers at halfway houses and treatment programs all have something to say about who she is, who she should be, and what she should do. The Ex-Prisoner’s Dilemma offers an in-depth, firsthand look at how the former prisoner manages messages about returning to the community. Over the course of a year, Andrea Leverentz conducted repeated interviews with forty-nine women as they adjusted to life outside of prison and worked to construct new ideas of themselves as former prisoners and as mothers, daughters, sisters, romantic partners, friends, students, and workers. Listening to these women, along with their family members, friends, and co-workers, Leverentz pieces together the narratives they have created to explain their past records and guide their future behavior. She traces where these narratives came from and how they were shaped by factors such as gender, race, maternal status, age, and experiences in prison, halfway houses, and twelve-step programs—factors that in turn shaped the women’s expectations for themselves, and others’ expectations of them. The women’s stories form a powerful picture of the complex, complicated human experience behind dry statistics and policy statements regarding prisoner reentry into society for women, how the experience is different for men and the influence society plays. With its unique view of how society’s mixed messages play out in ex-prisoners’ lived realities, The Ex-Prisoner’s Dilemma shows the complexity of these women’s experiences within the broad context of the war on drugs and mass incarceration in America. It offers invaluable lessons for helping such women successfully rejoin society.",Social Science,249,N/A,0,en
The Data Model Toolkit,Dave Knifton,Paragon Publishing,2016-10-10,"Adopting the latest technological and data related innovations has caused many organisations to realise they don’t have a firm grasp on their basic operational data.

Exploring the Mathematical Education of Teachers Using TEDS-M Data,"Maria Teresa Tatto, Michael C. Rodriguez, Wendy M. Smith, Mark D. Reckase, Kiril Bankov",Springer,2018-08-16,"This book uses the publicly available TEDS-M data to answer such questions as: How does teacher education contribute to the learning outcomes of future teachers? Are there programs that are more successful than others in helping teachers learn to teach mathematics? How does the local and national policy environment contribute to teacher education outcomes? It invites readers to explore these questions across a large number of international settings. The importance of preparing future mathematics teachers has become a priority across many nations. Across the globe nations have allocated resources and expertise to this endeavour. Yet in spite of the importance accorded to teacher education not much is known about different approaches to preparing knowledgeable teachers and whether these approaches do in fact achieve their purpose. The Mathematics Teacher Education and Development Study (TEDS-M) is the first, and to date the only, cross-national study using scientific and representative samples to provide empirical data on the knowledge that future mathematics teachers of primary and secondary school acquire in their teacher education programs. The study addresses the central importance of teacher knowledge in learning to teach mathematics by examining variation in the nature and influence of teacher education programs within and across countries. The study collected data on teacher education programs structure, curriculum and opportunities to learn, on teacher educators’ characteristics and beliefs, and on future mathematics teachers’ individual characteristics, beliefs, and mathematics and pedagogical knowledge across 17 countries providing a unique opportunity to explore enduring questions in the field.",Education,589,N/A,0,en

While I'm Young,Chloelia Salome,Lulu.com,2019-09-09,"I wrote this book because I think everyone has a story worth sharing. It's a reflection on where I come from. I know my story isn't special or crazy, but it represents who I am. People think a lot of things about me and paint me in a way that I never intended to be painted. I don't want to be remembered as the girl who authored seven books before turning 20, or the girl who plays violin and composes music, runs marathons, travels the world, models, and goes to law school. Yes, those are things I do. But no, I want to be remembered for something else: where I come from-who I am beneath all these resume builders. Beneath it all, I'm a normal girl, just like you. I have loving parents, supportive friends, drama, and hardships.

Open Distance Learning,Oleg Zaikin,CRC Press,2022-09-30,"Motivational and social aspects as interactions among teachers and students are essential for a successful educational process in an open distance learning (ODL) environment, and the goal of this book is to develop an interactive model to manage motivation between the participants of the learning process. The book deals with the important and topical problem of e-learning, closely connected with the use of modern information technologies in education. The focus is on developing an information management system for supporting the distance learning process in colleges and universities in the context of steadily expanding information technologies. On the basis of exiting standards (SCORM, etc.) as well as information systems and platforms (e.g., Moodle, etc.), the author proposes a coherent and original concept of modelling three ODL subprocesses: (1) an ontological model (how to represent the structure of didactic materials), (2) a motivation and collaboration model (how to motivate project process participants) and (3) a simulation model (how to realise the learning/project process). The proposed models constitute a theoretical formalization of a new situation in which a teacher and students are obligated to elaborate on didactic material repository content in accordance with the requirements of acquired competencies. A mathematical method based on game theory and simulation is suggested. The kind of educational system represented in the book can be used as a model of open distance learning aimed at active behaviour of students and teachers in not only the development of knowledge but also the acquiring of competencies.",Mathematics,437,N/A,0,en
The Psychosocial Aspects of a Deadly Epidemic,Judy Kuriansky,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2016-03-21,"Edited by a clinical psychologist who has been on the ground helping to develop psychosocial support for Ebola survivors in one of the hardest-hit regions of West Africa, this book explains the devastating emotional aspects of the epidemic and its impact on survivors and the population in West Africa, families in the diaspora, and people in the United States and other countries. It also describes lessons learned from past epidemics like HIV/AIDS and SARS, and valuable approaches to healing from future epidemics. While the devastating Ebola epidemic has been contained, the effects of this outbreak—referred to by the World Health Organization as ""the most severe acute public health emergency seen in modern times""—have wreaked a tremendous emotional toll on the populations of West Africa as well as on families and survivors worldwide. This groundbreaking book covers the psychosocial needs, programs, and policies related to the Ebola epidemic and examines broader lessons of the outbreak, such as changes in the ways in which healing from future epidemics can be handled. Edited by Judy Kuriansky, PhD, a noted clinical psychologist and United Nations NGO representative with extensive experience helping after disasters worldwide, and direct experience gained from being ""on the ground"" in West Africa in the midst of the epidemic, this book identifies and explains universal psychological factors at play in all such crises.

Silencing the Self Across Cultures,"Dana C. Jack, Alisha Ali",Oxford University Press,2010-04-28,"Winner of the 2011 Ursula Gielen Global Psychology Book Award! This award is presented by APA Division 52 to the authors or editors of a book that makes the greatest contribution to psychology as an international discipline and profession. This international volume offers new perspectives on social and psychological aspects of depression. The twenty-one contributors hailing from thirteen countries represent contexts with very different histories, political and economic structures, and gender role disparities. Authors rely on Silencing the Self theory, which details the negative psychological effects that result when individuals silence themselves in close relationships, and the importance of social context in precipitating depression. Specific patterns of thought on how to achieve closeness in relationships (self-silencing schema) are known to predict depression. This book breaks new ground by demonstrating that the link between depressive symptoms and self-silencing occurs across a range of cultures. ISilencing the Self Across Cultures/I explains why women's depression is more widespread than men's, and why the treatment of depression lies in understanding that a person's individual psychology is inextricably related to the social world and close relationships. Several chapters describe the transformative possibilities of community-driven movements for disadvantaged women that support healing through a recovery of voice, as well as the need to counter violations of human rights as a means of reducing women's risk of depression. Bringing the work of these researchers together in one collection furthers international dialogue about critical social factors that affect the rising rates of depression around the globe.",Psychology,564,N/A,0,en

Relating To Others,Steve Duck,McGraw-Hill Education (UK),1999-04-16,"Reviews of the first edition: ""Concise, readable, up-to-date, this volume is an excellent introduction to a new and expanding field."" Counselling Psychology Quarterly ""...a wonderful book."" Newsletter of the American Association for Counselling and Development ""...very exciting."" Counselling How do relationships get started successfully? How do relationships develop? What makes relationships decline and how can they be repaired? As social psychologists become more aware of the ways in which relationships underpin almost everything in the social sciences, the need for an introductory book for students and scholars has further increased. This long-awaited second edition of a highly successful text summarizes the research on relationships, focusing not only on their growth and development but also on their negative aspects, breakdown and repair. The author addresses the essential use of relationship issues within applied areas such as policing, health care, and the corporate world. He also emphasizes the importance of multidisciplinary studies and the integration of different frameworks and methods, by focusing less on static factors in relationships and more on the matter of process. Finally, he examines the need to contextualize relationship processes and take account of the daily issues of management by relational partners. The second edition of Relating to Others is strongly grounded in a discussion of the contexts for relating, whether cultural, linguistic, or interpersonal. It focuses on a range of relationships, friendship, and types of marriage and is written in an engaging style for students of psychology and the wider social sciences by one of the top authorities in the scientific research on relationships.",Psychology,172,N/A,0,en

Vulnerable Children and Youth in Brazil,"Débora Dalbosco Dell'Aglio, Silvia Helena Koller",Springer,2017-10-20,"This book presents the results of researches conducted with children and youth at risk for over 20 years in Brazil. It addresses a series of topics related to children and youth living in poverty or in situations of social vulnerability, such as family, sexual and dating violence; adolescent mothers and mothers who put their children for adoption; children and youth living in foster and institutional care; and adolescents involved in drug trafficking or incarcerated in juvenile detention centers. Building upon the Bioecological Theory of Human Development, this volume emphasizes the innovative knowledge about psychosocial development of vulnerable children and youth produced in Brazil and aims to present theoretical and methodological approaches developed especially for the countries of the Global South, in an attempt to overcome the scientific divide between the North and South. Northern research agenda defines as global the theories, methodologies, and application of knowledge on social policies and interventions. However, the contexts, histories, and cultural processes are essential for producing and applying research knowledge according to specific regional characteristics, organizations, and conditions. Human development is related to contextual features and cannot be directly imported from one place to another. Departing from these original theoretical and methodological approaches, the book also presents the results of evidence-based interventions, showing its effectiveness in specific contexts. All of this makes Vulnerable Children and Youth in Brazil – Innovative Approaches from the Psychology of Social Development a valuable tool for psychologists, educators, social scientists and public health professionals studying or working with children and youth at risk in different parts of the world, contributing to the understanding of human development in cultural context.",Psychology,285,N/A,0,en

Handbook of STEM Faculty Development,"Sandra M. Linder, Cindy M. Lee, Shannon K Stefl, Karen A. High",IAP,2022-12-01,"Faculty in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines face intensifying pressures in the 21st century, including multiple roles as educator, researcher, and entrepreneur. In addition to continuously increasing teaching and service expectations, faculty are engaged in substantive research that requires securing external funding, mentoring other faculty and graduate students, and disseminating this work in a broad range of scholarly outlets. Societal needs of their expertise include discovery, innovation, and workforce development. It is critical to provide STEM faculty with the professional development to support their complex roles and to base this development on evidence derived from research. This edited handbook provides STEM stakeholders with an opportunity to share studies and/or experiences that explore STEM faculty development (FD) in higher education settings. More specifically, we include work that examines faculty development planning, techniques/models, experiences, and outcomes focused on supporting the teaching, research, service, and leadership responsibilities of STEM faculty. The Handbook is suited for researchers and practitioners in STEM, STEM Education, Mathematics, Science, Technology, and Engineering disciplines. It is also suited towards faculty developers, higher education administrators, funding agencies, industry leaders, and the STEM community at large. This handbook is organized around three constructs (INPUTS, MECHANISMS, and OUTPUTS). The STEM faculty development inputs construct focuses on topics related to the characteristics of faculty members and institutions that serve as barriers or supports to the adoption and implementation of holistic STEM faculty development programs. Questions addressed in the handbook around this topic include: What barriers/supports exist for STEM faculty? How are these barriers/supports being addressed through STEM FD? How do contexts (e.g., economic, political, historical) influence faculty/administrative needs related to STEM FD? How do demographics (e.g., gender, ethnicity, age, family background) influence faculty/administrative needs related to STEM FD? The STEM faculty development mechanisms construct focuses on topics related to the actual implementation of STEM faculty development and we consider the potential models or structures of STEM faculty development that are currently in place or conceptualized in theory. Questions addressed in the handbook around this topic include: What are the processes for developing models of STEM FD? What are effective models of STEM FD? How is effectiveness determined? What roles do stakeholders (e.g., faculty, administration, consultants) play within STEM FD mechanisms? The STEM faculty development outputs construct focuses on how to best understand the influence of STEM faculty development on outcomes such as productivity, teacher quality, and identity in relation to faculty development. Questions addressed in the handbook around this topic include: How has STEM FD influenced higher education practices and settings? What are appropriate output measures and how are they used in practice? What collaborations emerge from STEM FD? How does STEM FD affect other STEM stakeholders (e.g. students, administration, business, community)? The aim for this handbook was to examine the multifaceted demands of faculty roles, and together with members of the STEM education community, envision pathways through which universities and individuals may support STEM colleagues, regardless of their experience or rank, to enjoy long and satisfying careers. Our hope is for these chapters to aid readers in deep reflection on challenges faculty face, to contemplate adaptations of models presented, and to draw inspiration for creating or engaging in new professional development programs. Chapters across this handbook highlight a variety of institutional contexts from 2-year technical colleges, to teaching-focused institutions, in addition to research-centric settings. Some chapters focus primarily on teaching and learning practices and offer models for improving STEM instruction. Others focus on barriers that emerge for STEM faculty when trying to engage in development experiences. There are chapters that examine tenure structures in relation to faculty development and how STEM FD efforts could support research endeavors. Mentorship and leadership models are also addressed along with a focus on equity issues that permeate higher education and impact STEM FD. It is our sincere hope that this Handbook sparks increased discourse and continued explorations related to STEM FD, and in particular, the intentional focus of faculty development initiatives to extend to the many facets of academic life.",Education,416,N/A,0,en

International Handbook of Love,"Claude-Hélène Mayer, Elisabeth Vanderheiden",Springer Nature,2021-05-04,"This handbook includes state-of-the-art research on love in classical, modern and postmodern perspectives. It expands on previous literature and explores topics around love from new cultural, intercultural and transcultural approaches and across disciplines. It provides insights into various love concepts, like romantic love, agape, and eros in their cultural embeddedness, and their changes and developments in specific cultural contexts. It also includes discussions on postmodern aspects with regard to love and love relationships, such as digitalisation, globalisation and the fourth industrial revolution. The handbook covers a vast range of topics in relation to love: aging, health, special needs, sexual preferences, spiritual practice, subcultures, family and other relationships, and so on. The chapters look at love not only in terms of the universal concept and in private, intimate relationships, but apply a broad concept of love which can also, for example, be referred to in postmodern workplaces. This volume is of interest to a wide readership, including researchers, practitioners and students of the social sciences, humanities and behavioural sciences. In the 1970s through the 90s, I was told that globalization was homogenizing cultures into a worldwide monoculture. This volume, as risky and profound as the many adventures of love across our multiplying cultures are, proves otherwise. The authors’ revolutionary and courageous work will challenge our sensibilities and expand the boundaries of what we understand what love is. But that’s what love does: It communicates what is; offers what can be; and pleads for what must be. I know you’ll enjoy this wonderful book as much as I do! Jeffrey Ady, Associate Professor (retired), Public Administration Program, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Founding Fellow, International Academy for Intercultural Research The International Handbook of Love is far more than a traditional compendium. It is a breath-taking attempt to synthesize our anthropological and sociological knowledge on love. It illuminates topics as diverse as Chinese love, one-night stands, teen romance or love of leaders and many more. This is a definitive reference in the field of love studies. Eva Illouz, author of The End of Love: A sociology of Negative relationships. Oxford University Press. “This is not a volume to be read in a single sitting (though I almost did, due to a protracted hospital stay), nor is it romantic or inspirational reading (though, in some cases, I had hoped for more narrative examples and case studies. Rather it is a highly diverse scholarly effort, a massive resource collection of research papers on love in a variety of contexts, personal and professional settings, and cultures. The work is well referenced providing a large number of resources for deeper exploration. .... We owe our thanks to the authors and editors of this “handbook” for work well done, though that word in the title should not lead readers to suspect that, enlightening as it is, this book is a vade mecum or practical tour guide that provides ready solutions to the vicissitudes and challenges of our love lives!” Reviewed by Dr. George F.

Permission Marketing of Informediaries in M-Commerce Advertising,Ali-Reza Moschtaghi,diplom.de,2002-03-12,"Inhaltsangabe:Abstract: The expectations for M-Commerce are very high. The mobile user seeks for facilitation of his daily habits and companies anticipate generating high revenue stream through new mobile applications. After telecommunication companies have paid high prices for the UMTS licenses in Europe M-Commerce has started to be the new hype. In those countries which did not have auctions but beauty contests M-Commerce has been also shifted into the spotlight. Although M-Commerce is still in its infancy, it predicts to have a huge impact on many ways of people s lives. New buzz words like anywhere and anytime have evolved in order to describe the great potential of M-Commerce. Growth opportunities in terms of new arising mobile business models seem promising but only the future will be able to answer the question of success. Mobile devices offer a broad range of opportunities from entertainment service e.g. music, games or video up to transactions e.g. banking, shopping, auctions. It is still unclear if all the emerging opportunities can be commercialized successfully. Nevertheless, many scenarios of how the world could be like in the future have been made. Below an excerpt of the daily routine of a future mobile user is presented: Nancy D`Amato prepares to leave her office just before five o clock. She uses her mobile phone for a quick check of the local weather forecast, sees that fines conditions are expected for the evening, and decides to leave her umbrella by her desk. Nancy is due to meet her boyfriend Peter at seven o clock, so she has two hours in town to waste. As soon as the clock reaches five, she receives a text message telling her that the bar across the street has a happy hour when drinks are cheaper. Nancy deletes the message almost without reading it. She has given her mobile service provider permission to send her unsolicited local promotional messages after five - otherwise she would have to pay a higher subscription rates - but that does not mean she actually has to read the message, does it? Five minutes later another message arrives, with a coupon offering a discount at the local branch of her favorite coffee bar. She shows the coffee-shop attendant the numbered message on her phone s screen, and he keys in the number on the till when charging for the coffee. Now comfortably seated with her cappuccino, Nancy begins to plan her evening. She uses her mobile to check which movies are showing nearby after seven [...]",Business & Economics,112,N/A,0,en

But one thing he never expected was his cellmate. Spy, rogue, thief, and noble, Seregil of Rhiminee is many things–none of them predictable. And when he offers to take on Alec as his apprentice, things may never be the same for either of them. Soon Alec is traveling roads he never knew existed, toward a war he never suspected was brewing.

Create Your Own Love Story,David W. McMillan,Beyond Words Publishing,1997,"""Each couple has its own love story - a story that is the essence of its relationship and that transcends time. Create Your Own Love Story shows how to take the shared history of how you met, how you fell in love, and how you overcame trials to create a love story that makes your relationship stronger, more enduring, and more soul-satisfying. The book is based on a four-part model derived from Dr. McMillan's twenty year's work in community theory and clinical psychology: spirit, a relationship's passion; trust, a relationship's power; trade, a relationship's value; and art, a relationship's meaning."" ""Through these four principles. McMillan empowers couples to use their stories to create a love that is strong enough to survive external challenges yet nourishing enough to shelter each partner's spirit. Effective whether used by one or both partners, Create Your Own Love Story is an invaluable guide for those on a quest for true love that triumphs over time.""--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

HRD Perspectives on Developmental Relationships,"Rajashi Ghosh, Holly M. Hutchins",Springer Nature,2022-01-04,"Developmental relationships constitute interdependent, generative connections that promote growth and learning among individuals. While studies reporting the impact of developmental relationships on learning, performance, and career development leaves no doubt about its relevance to the human resource development (HRD) field, we lack an in-depth understanding of how developmental relationships apply to the myriad of topics relevant to contemporary HRD research and practice such as social justice, diversity and equity, leadership development, career transitions, knowledge sharing, organization development, employee engagement, organizational learning culture, globalization, national HRD, and technology at work. This book presents a comprehensive collection of evidence-based studies and conceptual articles that explore how developmental relationships that are cultivated within and outside of the workplace apply to those clusters of topics in HRD. Organized around six themes, the chapters examine topics such as knowledge management, critical perspectives on gender, diversity, and equity, building a learning organization, talent development, and emotional closeness in the context of virtual workplaces. In doing so, the book highlight how research on developmental relationships can be the underlying thread connecting the otherwise disconnected varied topical foci of HRD research and practice, thus broadening our understanding of the relevance of developmental relationships within the HRD field. This volume advances HRD scholarship and will appeal to researchers interested in exploring the nature and benefits of developmental relationships including mentoring and coaching.",Business & Economics,539,N/A,0,en

Building Positive Relationships with Parents of Young Children,"Anita M. Hughes, Veronica Read",Routledge,2012-04-12,"Positive relationships between practitioners and parents are essential for young children’s wellbeing, but achieving this can be difficult if there is not enough understanding about how relationships work when one person (the practitioner or teacher) has to play the professional role. Strong communication skills are fundamental to this relationship and to building a sense of community between home and nursery or school. This new book explores how practitioners can build warm, friendly and caring relationships with parents. It clearly explains the dynamics of a conversation, the theory behind how relationships are formed or destroyed and provides practical strategies to put this knowledge into practice. Grounded in the theories of attachment, transactional analysis and solution focused therapy this book will help you to: Increase your level of self awareness Improve your listening skills Understand ‘how’ to communicate with different parent ‘types‘ Learn how to conduct an individual parent interview Develop professional care giving skills Full of practical examples and strategies, this text will be welcomed by early years practitioners and students who wish to develop the skills and confidence they need to effectively communicate with the parents of the children they care for.",Education,131,N/A,0,en

"The Therapeutic Relationship in Psychoanalysis, Counselling Psychology and Psychotherapy",Petrūska Clarkson,N/A,1995,"It is often the therapeutic relationship between client and therapist which is more important than the theoretical orientation. This book deals with the uses and abuses of the therapeutic relationship in counselling, psychology, psychotherapy and related fields. It provides a framework for integration, pluralism or deepening singularity with reference to five kinds of therapeutic relationship potentially available in every kind of counselling or psychodynamic work. The original paper and framework upon which this book is based has been widely acclaimed within psychotherapeutic, humanistic and psychoanalytic circles internationally. It has been found useful by adherents of a single orientation, as well as by practitioners who draw from several approaches. In addition, it has formed the basis for several courses in counselling and psychotherapy which have been recognised by national and international accrediting organisations. Dealing with an issue of increasing complexity, the book will be of great value and significance to psychotherapists, psychoanalysts, clinical and counselling psychologists, and other professionals working in the field of helping human relationships such as doctors, social workers, teachers and counsellors. Informed lay people, particularly those who are involved in the helping professions, may also find it of interest and benefit.",Medical,420,N/A,0,en

The Masculine in Relationship,G. S. Youngblood,N/A,2019-10-13,"Can Masculine power successfully co-exist with the strong Feminine? Yes. In this book is a model of Masculine groundedness that you can manifest in your relationship with a strong and capable woman. Such a woman doesn't settle for mediocre. She needs you to consistently follow through on your word, have purpose in life, remain grounded in the face of her intense emotion, make her feel safe, and provide leadership in the relationship. When that doesn't happen, she may start to drift. Things between you will start to feel flat, contentious, or even toxic. To you, she will seem to nag and criticize more, and have less interest in sex. When she gets really angry, you'll label it as ""crazy"" and blame her. But, in truth, she's just expressing the pain of you not stepping up. It is a relationship arc that is all too common. Fighting or defending yourself doesn't resolve anything. Withdrawing into work or your phone just makes it worse. And contorting yourself to avoid conflict just kills her respect for you.The answer is to develop and live from your Masculine core. This book shows you how in an actionable three-part framework: Respond vs. React, Provide Structure, and Create Safety. This is not the old model based on control, but a modern model based on clarity and leadership. This is not a manual for Alpha Dogs, nor a fuzzy spiritual guide. Rather, it is a clear set of principles that help you develop your Masculine leadership. And it doesn't take anything away from Feminine power. It is a blueprint for inspiring your woman's trust, lust, and devotion.",,311,N/A,0,en
Out of Touch,Michelle Drouin,MIT Press,2022-02-01,"A behavioral scientist explores love, belongingness, and fulfillment, focusing on how modern technology can both help and hinder our need to connect. A Next Big Idea Club nominee. Millions of people around the world are not getting the physical, emotional, and intellectual intimacy they crave. Through the wonders of modern technology, we are connecting with more people more often than ever before, but are these connections what we long for? Pandemic isolation has made us even more alone. In Out of Touch, Professor of Psychology Michelle Drouin investigates what she calls our intimacy famine, exploring love, belongingness, and fulfillment and considering why relationships carried out on technological platforms may leave us starving for physical connection. Drouin puts it this way: when most of our interactions are through social media, we are taking tiny hits of dopamine rather than the huge shots of oxytocin that an intimate in-person relationship would provide. Drouin explains that intimacy is not just sex—although of course sex is an important part of intimacy. But how important? Drouin reports on surveys that millennials (perhaps distracted by constant Tinder-swiping) have less sex than previous generations. She discusses pandemic puppies, professional cuddlers, the importance of touch, “desire discrepancy” in marriage, and the value of friendships. Online dating, she suggests, might give users too many options; and the internet facilitates “infidelity-related behaviors.” Some technological advances will help us develop and maintain intimate relationships—our phones, for example, can be bridges to emotional support. Some, on the other hand, might leave us out of touch. Drouin explores both of these possibilities.",Psychology,285,N/A,0,en

Relationship Processes and Resilience in Children with Incarcerated Parents,"Julie Poehlmann, J. M. Eddy, Patricia J. Bauer",Wiley-Blackwell,2013-07-10,"Children with incarcerated parents are at risk for a variety of problematic outcomes, yet research has rarely examined protective factors or resilience processes that might mitigate such risk in this population. In this volume, we present findings from fi ve new studies that focus on child- or family-level resilience processes in children with parents currently or recently incarcerated in jail or prison. In the fi rst study, empathic responding is examined as a protective factor against aggressive peer relations for 210 elementary school age children of incarcerated parents. The second study further examines socially aggressive behaviors with peers, with a focus on teasing and bullying, in a sample of 61 children of incarcerated mothers. Emotion regulation is examined as a possible protective factor. The third study contrasts children’s placement with maternal grandmothers versus other caregivers in a sample of 138 mothers incarcerated in a medium security state prison. The relation between a history of positive attachments between mothers and grandmothers and the current cocaregiving alliance are of particular interest. The fourth study examines coparenting communication in depth on the basis of observations of 13 families with young children whose mothers were recently released from jail. Finally, in the fi fth study, the proximal impacts of a parent management training intervention on individual functioning and family relationships are investigated in a diverse sample of 359 imprisoned mothers and fathers. Taken together, these studies further our understanding of resilience processes in children of incarcerated parents and their families and set the groundwork for further research on child development and family resilience within the context of parental involvement in the criminal justice system.",Family & Relationships,152,N/A,0,en

His approach is above all sensible - down-to-earth and fair. Lermontov was a romantic, really the only Russian poet who fully fits that designation. Vickery understands very well the romantic ethos, but he is no romantic him self. He treats with tolerant but ironic amusement the adolescent posturing of Lermontov's early Byronism. He is less tolerant of the frequent arrogance and even cruelty in Lermontov's behavior toward those close to him, especially women. On the other hand, Vickery recognizes Lermontov's genuine longing for intimacy and affection and credits his capacity for friendship and generosity. He also effectively traces all these conflicting im pulses in Lermontov's poetry.",Biography & Autobiography,442,N/A,0,en

Dangerous Personalities,"Joe Navarro, Toni Sciarra Poynter",Rodale,2014-10-07,"What makes a narcissist go from self-involved to terrifying? In this national bestseller, Joe Navarro, a leading FBI profiler, unlocks the secrets to the personality disorders that put us all at risk. ""I should have known."" ""How could we have missed the warning signs?"" ""I always thought there was something off about them."" When we wake up to new tragedies in the news every day - shootings, rampages, acts of domestic terrorism - we often blame ourselves for missing the mania lurking inside unsuspecting individuals. But how could we have known that the charismatic leader had the characteristics of a tyrant? And how can ordinary people identify threats from those who are poised to devastate their lives on a daily basis--the crazy coworkers, out-of control family members, or relentless neighbors? In Dangerous Personalities, former FBI profiler Joe Navarro has the answers. He shows us how to identify the four most common ""dangerous personalities"" and how to analyze the potential threat level: the Narcissist, the Predator, the Paranoid, and the Unstable Personality. Along the way, he provides essential tips and tricks to protect ourselves both immediately and in the long-term, as well as how to heal the trauma of being exposed to the destructive egos in our world.",Psychology,258,N/A,0,en

Emotional Infidelity,M. Gary Neuman,Harmony,2009-06-03,"What’s holding you back from a great marriage? “I don’t believe in ‘okay,’ ‘decent,’ or ‘solid’ marriages. I’m against them,” says M. Gary Neuman. “I believe only in great marriages, and that you should expect and reach for no less.” In the last fifteen years, M. Gary Neuman, marital therapist and architect of the Sandcastles Divorce Therapy Program, has helped thousands of couples in crisis. Couples who fight. Who’ve grown apart. Who are stuck in relationships that run more on routine and rancor than love and understanding. What he’s found is that, contrary to popular belief, the problem is usually not poor communication. It’s the failure to put most of your focus into your marriage. You’ve only got so much energy. Are you spending it by being emotionally unfaithful? Take a quick check: Do you send that funny e-mail to your friends at work—but not to your spouse? Do you chew over all the problems on the job so thoroughly with your colleagues that by the time you get home, you just don’t feel like going into it all over again? Do you get a secret thrill out of flirting with coworkers—thinking it’s safe because you know it’s not going any further? If so, you’re committing emotional infidelity—and you’re draining your marriage of the energy it needs to be great. Learning how to break this cycle is one of eleven secrets M. Gary Neuman shares in his provocative new book. Based on the ten-week program he’s developed in his successful couples counseling practice, the book offers guidelines that are often counterintuitive, even outrageous or shocking. But they work. Dare to limit contact with members of the opposite sex. Dare to need each other. Dare to put in writing the nitty-gritty realities of a marriage plan. Dare to put your marriage before your kids or job. Dare to make love in a whole new way. Dare to change your focus: make the commitment to focus on each of the eleven secrets (ten plus one bonus secret) for one week apiece and you’ll reap the rewards of a transformed marriage and a reconfirmed relationship. M. Gary Neuman’s program is guaranteed to challenge you and make you reexamine the myths holding you back from true happiness and satisfaction. It will change your marriage forever.",Family & Relationships,322,N/A,0,en

Handbook of Interpersonal Commitment and Relationship Stability,"Jeffrey M. Adams, Warren H. Jones",Springer Science & Business Media,1999-09-30,"A fundamental assumption underlying the formation of our most important relationships is that they will persist indefinitely into the future. As an acquaintanceship turns into a friend ship, for example, both members of this newly formed interpersonal bond are likely to expect that their interactions will become increasingly frequent, diverse, and intimate over time. This expectation is perhaps most apparent in romantically involved couples who, through a variety of verbal and symbolic means, make explicit pledges to a long-lasting relationship. In either case, it is clear that these relationships represent something valuable to the individuals in volved and are pursued with great enthusiasm. Virtually all close relationships are formed within the context of mutually rewarding in teractions and/or strong physical attraction between partners. Friends and romantically in volved couples alike are drawn to one another because of similarity of attitudes, interests, and personality and, quite simply, because they enjoy one another's company. This enjoyment, cou pled with the novelty that characterizes new relationships, almost makes the continuation of the relationship a foregone conclusion. As relationships progress, however, their novelty fades, conflicts may arise between partners, negative life events may occur, and the satisfaction that previously characterized the relationships may diminish.",Psychology,560,N/A,0,en

And as the violence escalated, Leslie felt trapped in a world of terror - a world from which she knew she had to escape.

Personal Relationships and Personal Networks,Malcolm R. Parks,Routledge,2017-09-25,"The effort to understand personal relationships has traditionally focused on the individual characteristics of participants. Personal Relationships and Personal Networks takes this analysis a step further, focusing on research linking participants' feelings and actions within a given personal relationship to the larger social context surrounding it. Author Malcolm R. Parks expands on the idea that the initiation, development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships are inextricably connected to each participant's social network-a perspective that allows for a better appreciation of our connection to the world, and a greater understanding our significant power as social actors. This book offers a new way to consider basic notions about how relationships form, such as how particular people meet, and how relationships are started. Among many findings, the volume demonstrates that individuals in relationships feel closer and generally more connected when they also have a greater amount of contact with the members of each other's personal networks and when they believe that network members support their relationship. Additional topics discussed include how this social context model is applicable to different types of relationships; how participants interact with network members; how social networks are involved in the deterioration of personal relationships; and what drives change in relationships. Students, researchers, and professionals in a wide variety of disciplines such as communication, psychology, sociology, anthropology, family studies, clinical psychology, public health nursing, education, and social work will find this book useful, as will anyone seeking to better understand their own personal relationships.",Language Arts & Disciplines,465,N/A,0,en

An Introduction to Duplicate Detection,"Feliz Nauman, Melanie Herschel",Morgan & Claypool Publishers,2010-05-05,"With the ever increasing volume of data, data quality problems abound. Multiple, yet different representations of the same real-world objects in data, duplicates, are one of the most intriguing data quality problems. The effects of such duplicates are detrimental; for instance, bank customers can obtain duplicate identities, inventory levels are monitored incorrectly, catalogs are mailed multiple times to the same household, etc. Automatically detecting duplicates is difficult: First, duplicate representations are usually not identical but slightly differ in their values. Second, in principle all pairs of records should be compared, which is infeasible for large volumes of data. This lecture examines closely the two main components to overcome these difficulties: (i) Similarity measures are used to automatically identify duplicates when comparing two records. Well-chosen similarity measures improve the effectiveness of duplicate detection. (ii) Algorithms are developed to perform on very large volumes of data in search for duplicates. Well-designed algorithms improve the efficiency of duplicate detection. Finally, we discuss methods to evaluate the success of duplicate detection.

Bonobos,"Brian Hare, Shinya Yamamoto",Oxford University Press,2017-10-20,"The bonobo, along with the chimpanzee, is one of our two closest living relatives. Their relatively narrow geographic range (south of the Congo River in the Democratic Republic of Congo) combined with the history of political instability in the region, has made their scientific study extremely difficult. In contrast, there are dozens of wild and captive sites where research has been conducted for decades with chimpanzees. Because data sets on bonobos have been so hard to obtain and so few large-scale studies have been published, the majority of researchers have treated chimpanzee data as being representative of both species. However, this misconception is now rapidly changing. With relative stability in the DRC for over a decade and a growing community of bonobos living in zoos and sanctuaries internationally, there has been an explosion of scientific interest in the bonobo with dozens of high impact publications focusing on this fascinating species. This research has revealed exactly how unique bonobos are in their brains and behavior, and reminds us why it is so important that we redouble our efforts to protect the few remaining wild populations of this iconic and highly endangered great ape species.",Science,308,N/A,0,en

Relationship Economics,"Mr Bryan K Ritchie, Mr Lindon J Robison","Gower Publishing, Ltd.",2012-08-28,"In a 24/7 world and a global economy, there is no doubt that relationships impact virtually every economic transaction. In Relationship Economics, Lindon Robison and Bryan Ritchie argue that what needs to be understood is not just whether relationships matter (which, of course, they do), but also, how much, and in what circumstances they should matter. Providing a rigorous and measurable definition of the way that relationships among individuals create a capital, social capital, that can be saved, spent, and used like other forms of capital, Robison and Ritchie use numerous examples and insightful analysis, to explain how social capital shapes our ability to reduce poverty, understand corruption, encourage democracy, facilitate income equality, and respond to globalization. The first part of the book explains how social capital can be manipulated, stored, expended, and invested. The second part explores how levels of social capital within relationships influence economic transactions both positively and negatively, which in turn shape poverty levels, economic efficiency, levels and types of political participation, and institutional structures.",Business & Economics,292,N/A,0,en

Reasoning Robots,Michael Thielscher,Springer Science & Business Media,2005-12-15,"The creation of intelligent robots is surely one of the most exciting and ch- lenginggoals of Arti?cial Intelligence. A robot is, ?rst of all, nothing but an inanimate machine with motors and sensors. In order to bring life to it, the machine needs to be programmed so as to make active use of its hardware c- ponents. This turns a machine into an autonomous robot. Since about the mid nineties of the past century, robot programming has made impressive progress. State-of-the-art robots are able to orient themselves and move around freely in indoor environments or negotiate di?cult outdoor terrains, they can use stereo vision to recognize objects, and they are capable of simple object manipulation with the help of arti?cial extremities. At a time where robots perform these tasks more and more reliably,weare ready to pursue the next big step, which is to turn autonomous machines into reasoning robots.Areasoning robot exhibits higher cognitive capabilities like following complex and long-term strategies, making rational decisions on a high level, drawing logical conclusions from sensor information acquired over time, devising suitable plans, and reacting sensibly in unexpected situations. All of these capabilities are characteristics of human-like intelligence and ultimately distinguish truly intelligent robots from mere autonomous machines.",Philosophy,334,N/A,0,en

The authors provide a clear explanation of how the characteristics of Asperger's syndrome can affect the development of a relationship and the expression of love. They then provide sound practical advice for individuals and couples. I really enjoyed reading The Asperger Love Guide and will be recommending the book to my clients' - Professor Tony Attwood `This is the first book I've read in a long time that, once started, I couldn't put down until it was finished. It is an exceptionally good read. The 77 pages are written succinctly with no waffle - just straight to the point. I will definitely buy a copy of this book for the whole family to use! I will use it to guide Joe (my 17 year old Asperger son) when he's ready for it.

Quality and Inequality in Regional and Urban Systems,"Karima Kourtit, Peter Nijkamp, Roger Stough",BoD – Books on Demand,2019-11-25,"In the aftermath of both ongoing globalisation (with both widening and deepening effects on countries, regions and cities) and structural changes resulting from the 2008 economic recession, regions and cities in our world are confronted with a different arena of players, performances and institutions. The challenges are formidable and numerous. Many regions and cities seem to resort to their indigenous strength, without much regard to other players in the field. This has enormous consequences for the competitive behaviour and profile of regional and urban actors but has at the same time deep impacts on the distribution of wealth, income and employment over and within countries, regions and cities. There is indeed much evidence that disparities among regions and in cities are increasing in this new force field. This special issue of REGION makes a solid scientific attempt (i) to map out the spatial consequences of recent transitions in growth trajectories of countries or regions, and (ii) to trace policy strategies and design effective policy information, to cope adequately with these new challenges.

Handbook of Conceptual Modeling,"David W. Embley, Bernhard Thalheim",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-04-23,"Conceptual modeling is about describing the semantics of software applications at a high level of abstraction in terms of structure, behavior, and user interaction. Embley and Thalheim start with a manifesto stating that the dream of developing information systems strictly by conceptual modeling – as expressed in the phrase “the model is the code” – is becoming reality. The subsequent contributions written by leading researchers in the field support the manifesto's assertions, showing not only how to abstractly model complex information systems but also how to formalize abstract specifications in ways that let developers complete programming tasks within the conceptual model itself. They are grouped into sections on programming with conceptual models, structure modeling, process modeling, user interface modeling, and special challenge areas such as conceptual geometric modeling, information integration, and biological conceptual modeling. The Handbook of Conceptual Modeling collects in a single volume many of the best conceptual-modeling ideas, techniques, and practices as well as the challenges that drive research in the field.

A Clinician’s Guide to Functional Neurological Disorder,Egberdina-Józefa van der Hulst,Taylor & Francis,2023-04-28,"This manual for clinicians presents a ground-breaking, accessible and unifying new model for understanding functional neurological disorder (FND) that bridges the gap between theoretical FND-specific models and the more practical, but non-FND-specific Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) models. Grounded in psychology, the Pressure Cooker Model provides a clear metaphor for FND, focusing on intra-individual and inter-individual cognitive, emotional and behavioural processes. Developed based on years of clinical experience in the field, it is applicable to the assessment and treatment of every type of FND. Viewed as a systemic condition with unique psychosocial features, the book will describe the rationale for radically transforming FND recovery by providing a treatment model that aims to resolve emotion dysregulation processes and repair relationships between the person and the system. It uses a unifying framework to guide the steps of intervention and can be adapted for work in a multidisciplinary team context to facilitate communication between disciplines. Enriched with case studies and research data, the book also highlights a plethora of clinical tools and strategies based on the Pressure Cooker Model, as well as contextualising its position alongside CBT models.

Probabilistic Foundations of Statistical Network Analysis,Harry Crane,CRC Press,2018-04-17,"Probabilistic Foundations of Statistical Network Analysis presents a fresh and insightful perspective on the fundamental tenets and major challenges of modern network analysis. Its lucid exposition provides necessary background for understanding the essential ideas behind exchangeable and dynamic network models, network sampling, and network statistics such as sparsity and power law, all of which play a central role in contemporary data science and machine learning applications. The book rewards readers with a clear and intuitive understanding of the subtle interplay between basic principles of statistical inference, empirical properties of network data, and technical concepts from probability theory. Its mathematically rigorous, yet non-technical, exposition makes the book accessible to professional data scientists, statisticians, and computer scientists as well as practitioners and researchers in substantive fields. Newcomers and non-quantitative researchers will find its conceptual approach invaluable for developing intuition about technical ideas from statistics and probability, while experts and graduate students will find the book a handy reference for a wide range of new topics, including edge exchangeability, relative exchangeability, graphon and graphex models, and graph-valued Levy process and rewiring models for dynamic networks. The author’s incisive commentary supplements these core concepts, challenging the reader to push beyond the current limitations of this emerging discipline. With an approachable exposition and more than 50 open research problems and exercises with solutions, this book is ideal for advanced undergraduate and graduate students interested in modern network analysis, data science, machine learning, and statistics. Harry Crane is Associate Professor and Co-Director of the Graduate Program in Statistics and Biostatistics and an Associate Member of the Graduate Faculty in Philosophy at Rutgers University. Professor Crane’s research interests cover a range of mathematical and applied topics in network science, probability theory, statistical inference, and mathematical logic.

"Love, Sex, and Marriage",Julie Coleman,BRILL,2022-06-13,"If the language we use influences and reflects the way that we see the world, then the fields of LOVE, SEX, and MARRIAGE, will show how speakers of English view their closest social and emotional relationships. Love, Sex, and Marriage provides a classification of English terms for these three fields from the earliest written records of the language until the present day. This volume makes it possible to trace changing attitudes towards social and sexual ties, and to understand those ties as earlier speakers of English did, through the language they used. The terms are arranged by meaning, and are listed chronologically within semantic fields, with their dates of usage. Notes on individual terms provide further information about their connotations and development. Language does not exist in isolation from the people who speak it, so background information about changes in social conditions, religious beliefs, and medical advancements is also included. A brief introduction to basic semantic terminology explains the principles behind the classification, and an alphabetical index facilitates the location of individual terms.",Literary Criticism,621,N/A,0,en

It encompasses the structural and annual changes, forces of change, long-ecological changes in the atmosphere and ocean, plankton, fish, birds and mammals, and the effects of the 1989 Exxon Valdez Oil Spill. With 5 major sections, Long-term Ecological Change in the Northern Gulf of Alaska first describes the physical features, the atmosphere and physical oceanography, the annual production cycle, the forage base for higher animals and trophic transfer, and the adaptations for survival in this changing environment for 9 portal species. Then, the major forces of change are introduced: climate, geophysics, fisheries and harvesting, species interactions, disease and contaminants. Next, the long-term records of change in physical factors and biological populations are presented, as well as the potential reasons for the biological changes. Following is the history of the Exxon Valdez oil spill and its long-term effects. And, finally, the emergent properties of the ecosystem are discussed and an attempt is made to weigh the importance of the major forcing factors in terms of their temporal and spatial scales of influence.* Examines important data on long-term change in the ecosystem and the forcing factors that are responsible for it * Provides an account of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill with emphasis on the long-term effects * Describes the effects of climate change, geophysical change, species interactions, harvesting, disease, the 1989 oil spill, and marine contaminants on key populations of marine organisms",Nature,609,N/A,0,en

Traditional Christian Ethics,David W. T. Brattston,WestBow Press,2014,"Traditional Christian Ethics features two exhaustive alphabetical lists of affirmative commandments and prohibitions from the earliest Christian ethics, as found in writers before the mass apostasy of 249-251 AD. The affirmatives, or positives, list consists of what Christians are/were commanded or encouraged to do. The other list is of negatives or prohibitions, i.e. what Christians are/were discouraged from doing, similarly arranged. The source material for the work encompasses far more than the ten-volume Ante-Nicene Fathers edited by Roberts and Donaldson. It also draws from all writings of the period: Christian, Jewish, and pagan, available in English or French translation, plus a few Latin translations. Some translations have been published only in scholarly journals, and some only in the twenty-first century. Volumes Two and Three form a single exhaustive alphabetical list of affirmative commandments or precepts, including mental attitudes, i.e. what Christian ethics commanded or encouraged according to writers on Christian ethics before 250 AD. Using earlier drafts of this set of books, Dr. Brattston's articles and booklets synthesizing early and contemporary Christianity have been published by a wide variety of denominations and ministries in every major English-speaking country. He hopes readers will use them as a starting-point for writing articles, papers, and sermons of their own.",Religion,597,N/A,0,en

Love and Freedom,Jorge N. Ferrer,Rowman & Littlefield,2021-06-24,"In Love and Freedom, Jorge Ferrer proposes a paradigm shift in how romantic relationships are conceptualized, a step forward in the evolution of modern relationships. In the same way that the transgender movement surmounted the gender binary, Ferrer defines how a parallel step can—and should—be taken with the relational style binary. This book offers the first systematic discussion of relationship modes beyond monogamy and polyamory, as well as introduces the notion of “relational freedom” as the capability to choose one’s relational style free from biological, psychological, and sociocultural conditionings. To achieve these goals, Ferrer first discusses a number of critical categories—specifically, monopride/polyphobia, and polypride/monophobia—that mediate the contemporary “mono–poly wars,” that is, the predicament of mutual competition among monogamists and polyamorists. The ideological nature of these “mono–poly wars” is demonstrated through a review of available empirical literature on the psychological health and relationship quality of monogamous and polyamorous individuals and couples. Then, after showing how monogamy and polyamory ultimately reinforce each other, Ferrer articulates three relational pathways to living in-between, through, and beyond the mono/poly binary: fluidity, hybridity, and transcendence. Moving beyond that binary opens a fuzzy, liminal, and multivocal relational space that Ferrer calls novogamy. In this groundbreaking book, readers will learn practical tools to not only transform jealousy, but also enhance their relational freedom while being aware of key issues of diversity and social justice. They will also learn novel criteria to evaluate the success of their intimate relationships, and be introduced to a transformed vision of romantic love beyond both monocentrism and emerging polynormativities.",Philosophy,213,N/A,0,en

The Nature and Nurture of Love,Marga Vicedo,University of Chicago Press,2013-05-16,"The notion that maternal care and love will determine a child’s emotional well-being and future personality has become ubiquitous. In countless stories and movies we find that the problems of the protagonists—anything from the fear of romantic commitment to serial killing—stem from their troubled relationships with their mothers during childhood. How did we come to hold these views about the determinant power of mother love over an individual’s emotional development? And what does this vision of mother love entail for children and mothers? In The Nature and Nurture of Love, Marga Vicedo examines scientific views about children’s emotional needs and mother love from World War II until the 1970s, paying particular attention to John Bowlby’s ethological theory of attachment behavior. Vicedo tracks the development of Bowlby’s work as well as the interdisciplinary research that he used to support his theory, including Konrad Lorenz’s studies of imprinting in geese, Harry Harlow’s experiments with monkeys, and Mary Ainsworth’s observations of children and mothers in Uganda and the United States. Vicedo’s historical analysis reveals that important psychoanalysts and animal researchers opposed the project of turning emotions into biological instincts. Despite those substantial criticisms, she argues that attachment theory was paramount in turning mother love into a biological need. This shift introduced a new justification for the prescriptive role of biology in human affairs and had profound—and negative—consequences for mothers and for the valuation of mother love.",Science,332,N/A,0,en
love (luv) n.,Sorensen Karen Porter,Adams Media,2009-12-18,"""Looking for the perfect meaning of love? Ask a perfect stranger. That’s what Karen Sorensen did on the streets of New York City. She set up a table, put out a sign that read ""Love Research,"" and asked the passersby: Have you ever fallen in love? What does love mean to you? Has your love ever been tested? How do you prepare for love? From a jaded inner-city teen to a five-year-old translating for his Russian Grandmother, people from all walks of life lined up to take part. Every answer won the respondent a flower—and Karen a new understanding. Hundreds of interviews and flowers later, this delightful, moving, even profound book brings together the most entertaining and enlightening reflections on the meaning of love ever gathered into one volume.

ARE YOU A HIGHLY SENSITIVE PERSON? Do you have a keen imagination and vivid dreams? Is time alone each day as essential to you as food and water? Are you noted for your empathy? Your conscientiousness? Do noise and confusion quickly overwhelm you? If your answers are yes, you may be a highly sensitive person (HSP) and Dr. Elaine Aron’s The Highly Sensitive Person is the life-changing guide you’ll want in your toolbox. Over twenty percent of people have this amazing, innate trait. Maybe you are one of them. A similar percentage is found in over 100 species, because high sensitivity is a survival strategy. It is also a way of life for HSPs. In this 25th anniversary edition of the groundbreaking classic, Dr. Elaine Aron, a research and clinical psychologist as well as an HSP herself, helps you grasp the reality of your wonderful trait, understand your past in the light of it, and make the most of it in your future. Drawing on her many years of study and face-to-face time spent with thousands of HSPs, she explains the changes you will need to make in order to lead a fuller, richer life. Along with a new Author’s Note, the latest scientific research, and a fresh discussion of anti-depressants, this edition of The Highly Sensitive Person is more essential than ever for creating the sense of self-worth and empowerment every HSP deserves and our planet needs. “Elaine Aron has not only validated and scientifically corroborated high sensitivity as a trait—she has given a level of empowerment and understanding to a large group of the planet’s population. I thank Dr. Aron every day for her having brought this awareness to the world.” —Alanis Morissette, artist, activist, teacher",Self-Help,404,5,2,en

The Book of Love,,Plume Books,1996,"The late John Cheever once insisted that saving a letter is like trying to preserve a kiss. Luckily for us, the loved ones of great writers ranging from Sappho to Anne Sexton, from Anton Chekhov to Mr. Cheever himself have ignored that clever dictum. In more than one hundred of the most powerful, witty, wicked and whimsical letters ever written, we chronicle passion's erratic progress. Why should Marcus Aurelius's amorous words sit side by side with John Steinbeck's letter to the woman who inspired much of his late work? Distinguished scholar Cathy Davidson argues that the love letter is a form of literature all its own, a genre whose language may have changed from ancient Rome to twentieth-century America but whose basic form and content remain the same. For if all literature is a kind of seduction, then the love letter becomes the perfect vehicle for writers to hone their seductive skills. With novelistic flair, Ms. Davidson has arranged these letters as though they were all part of one romance - a romance in which any of us may have played a part. From the joy of Falling in Love to the pain of Unrequited Love, we chart the evolution of that most hard-to-define emotion. These pages are filled with glorious examples of writers being just like the rest of humanity, to wit: willing to stake so much on what at times seems like nothing more than a promise and an act of faith. How delightful to discover the master of light verse Ogden Nash writing tenderly to a woman he first saw across a crowded room nine months earlier: This is a particularly gifted and intelligent pen. Look what it's writing now: I love you. That's a phrase I can't get out of my head - but I don't want to. I'vewanted to try it out for a long time; I like the look of it and the sound of it and the meaning of it. Of course what writers do better than anyone else is to write about love. Through Ms. Davidson's deft touch, The Book of Love becomes a treasure trove of literary discovery. She",Biography & Autobiography,324,N/A,0,en

Hard to Love,Briallen Hopper,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2019-02-05,"A sharp and entertaining essay collection about the importance of multiple forms of love and friendship in a world designed for couples, from a laser-precise new voice. Sometimes it seems like there are two American creeds, self-reliance and marriage, and neither of them is mine. I experience myself as someone formed and sustained by others' love and patience, by student loans and stipends, by the kindness of strangers. Briallen Hopper's Hard to Love honors the categories of loves and relationships beyond marriage, the ones that are often treated as invisible or seen as secondary--friendships, kinship with adult siblings, care teams that form in times of illness, or various alternative family formations. She also values difficult and amorphous loves like loving a challenging job or inanimate objects that can't love you back. She draws from personal experience, sharing stories about her loving but combative family, the fiercely independent Emerson scholar who pushed her away, and the friends who have become her invented or found family; pop culture touchstones like the Women's March, John Green's The Fault in Our Stars, and the timeless series Cheers; and the work of writers like Joan Didion, Gwendolyn Brooks, Flannery O'Connor, and Herman Melville (Moby-Dick like you've never seen it!). Hard to Love pays homage and attention to unlikely friends and lovers both real and fictional. It is a series of love letters to the meaningful, if underappreciated, forms of intimacy and community that are tricky, tangled, and tough, but ultimately sustaining.",Literary Collections,337,N/A,0,en

A South Side Love Story,Jessica N Watkins,Independently Published,2021-09-19,"Tricey, Vic, and Lyric are three friends from the Southside of Chicago fighting in the tumultuous war between finding the one amongst the chaotic sea of Mr. Wrongs. After breaking up with her baby's father, Memphis, Vic is in the arms of one new beau after the next; turning her heartbreak into a life filled with bald-headed h*e shenanigans. Vic's new approach to love terribly clashes with Asa's uncontrollable need for being more than her next sneaky link. However, Vic's refusal to commit doesn't keep Asa's alpha male, street swag from trying desperately to blow up the wall that she has built around her terribly damaged heart. As Vic runs from Asa's attempts to woo her, Tricey has done the unthinkable: fallen in love with her friend-with-benefits. After the heart-rendering endings of her past relationships, Akbar was the ideal replacement. Everything was perfect about him... except for his pregnant wife. After fighting against it, she falls in love and realizes that she needs to walk away from the man that she can't imagine living without. Then enters ""Blood"" the dope boy ready to sweep her off of her feet. But can she find the courage to walk away from the explosive chemistry between she and Akbar in order to enjoy the life that Blood wants to give her? While Tricey is stuck between a dope boy and her married love, Lyric and Salem are approaching their wedding date. As they prepare to spend the rest of their lives together, Salem is under the impression that he has chosen the perfect wife-to-be. Lyric struggles with this cloak of perfection as she figures out a way to quietly end the affair she's had on the side since the day she met her soon-to-be-husband. This is only the beginning of this Urban Romance, which is filled with love that hurts, betrayals, and feels tragically unsustainable. Packed with a sea of characters that add their own two cents of drama and contribute to the shocking and heartrending end, this love story is of three homegirls, not only falling in love with the one, but also falling in love with themselves. * This is a re-release of the previously published book, Love, Sex, Lies. Since this book was written when I was very young, I wanted to give it the quality and attention that these characters deserve. This story has been revamped.

Need Management Therapy (Nmt),"Robert N. Johansen Ph.D, Todd W. Gaffaney Ph.D",Archway Publishing,2021-03-25,"Divorce, separation, and couple breakups are on the rise in the United States of America, with about 48 percent of couples breaking up within nine years of starting a committed relationship. Only a minority of distressed couples ever seek couple counseling—and those that stay together do not necessarily enjoy healthy relationships. Just as sadly, marriage counselors divorce at or about the national average. The Need Management Therapy model asserts that positive change is possible and even likely. The authors offer a treatment package both for the professional in practice and a self-help guide for the non-professional. We have successfully treated hundreds of couple-clients using the NMT model. We are now conducting a randomized pretest posttest two group design investigating several crucial NMT hypothesis (pending). Preliminary data suggest that significant and meaningful change may be achieved in just a few sessions. When the NMT model is applied, couples report not fighting as much—and sometimes, fighting stops altogether. Communication improves dramatically. If you’re passionate about making your relationship work, you’ll find a new science of love, intimacy, and relationships in Need Management Therapy.",Psychology,428,N/A,0,en

Watkins,N/A,2021,"""In this raunchy, romantic soap-opera–style tale of promiscuity and corruption, Jessica continues this saga with the usual drama, romance, and loveable bad boys. Yet, with an ending that will leave you breathless. The only thing on nineteen-year-old Star Anderson's mind is taking care of her son, by any means necessary. However, by means of breaking her back at a minimum wage nine-to-five is not an option. Therefore, she follows in the footsteps of her friend, Roxie, down a path of scamming, tricking, and robberies. Though this path seems to be paved with fast and easy money, tragedy strikes when plans become hurried and messy. Star's big sister, Tricey, attempts to clean up Star's mess while fighting with her new and loving beau. He suddenly wants her to leave Chicago with him with no explanation. Though she is deeply concerned about her boyfriend's sudden need to leave Chicago, Tricey is so focused on rescuing Star that being a lovesick puppy and following him out of state is not an option. However, Lyric doesn't mind being lovesick. She and her boyfriend are knee-deep in love and the ""lifestyle"". Their relationship is full of excitement, raunchiness, and spontaneity. Yet, once he settles into the lifestyle and presents Lyric with an ultimatum, she is forced to decide how knee-deep in love and the lifestyle she is willing to be. While Lyric contemplates allowing her heart to make her decision instead of her mind, Tricey's bitterness drives her to secretly stalk her boyfriend, which leads to a revelation of hidden deception and the biggest blow of deceit she has ever experienced.""-- Author's synopsis.",African American women,247,N/A,0,en

Object Relationship Notation (ORN) for Database Applications,Bryon K. Ehlmann,Springer Science & Business Media,2009-06-05,"Conceptually, a database consists of objects and relationships. Object Relationship Notation (ORN) is a simple notation that more precisely defines relationships by combining UML multiplicities with uniquely defined referential actions.

For the database developer, it presents many examples of relationships modeled using ORN-extended class diagrams and shows how these relationships are easily mapped to an ORN-extended SQL or Object DDL. For the DBMS developer, it presents the specifications and algorithms needed to implement ORN in a relational and object DBMS. This book also describes tools that can be downloaded or accessed via the Web.

The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce,"Julia M. Lewis, Sandra Blakeslee",Hachette Books,2001-10-01,"Divorce is at once a widespread reality and a painful decision, so it is no surprise that this landmark study of its long-term effects should both spark debate and find a large audience. In this compelling, thought-provoking book, Judith Wallerstein explains that, while children do learn to cope with divorce, it in fact takes its greatest toll in adulthood, when the sons and daughters of divorced parents embark on romantic relationships of their own. Wallerstein sensitively illustrates how children of divorce often feel that their relationships are doomed, seek to avoid conflict, and fear commitment. Failure in their loving relationships often seems to them preordained, even when things are going smoothly. As Wallerstein checks in on the adults she first encountered as youngsters more than twenty-five years ago, she finds that their experiences mesh with those of the millions of other children of divorce, who will find themselves on every page. With more than 100,000 copies in print, The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce spent three weeks on the New York Times, San Francisco Chronicle, and Denver Post bestseller lists. The book was also featured on two episodes of Oprah as well as on the front cover of Time and the New York Times Book Review.",Family & Relationships,442,N/A,0,en

Colorado Real Estate License Exam Prep,"Stephen Mettling, David Cusic, Ryan Mettling, Donna Welschmeyer",Performance Programs Company,2022-05,"Features of Colorado Real Estate License Exam Prep (CO-RELEP): National Principles & Law Key Point Review (60 pages) Real Estate Math Key Formula Review & Practice (20 pages) Colorado-Specific Laws and Practices (44 pages) National Practice Tests (500 questions) Colorado Practice Tests (140 questions) Colorado Sample Exam (115 questions) We know the real estate licensing exam can be tough, and very nerve-wracking to prepare for. That’s why we created Colorado Real Estate License Exam Prep (CO-RELEP) the way we did. Since we have been managing real estate schools and developing curriculum for forty years, we know how all this works – or fails to work. CO-RELEP is comprehensive in that it contains both key content review and testing practice. And the text review is Colorado-specific – not just simplistic national content, but terse, relevant and accurate Colorado laws and regulations presented as a well-organized set of state ‘key point reviews’ ideal for pre-test memorization. But let’s not dismiss the importance of the national content either. CO-RELEP’s national key point reviews are a succinct compression of tested national principles and practices that comprise the national portion of state license exams from coast to coast. Our content is drawn from our own national textbook, Principles of Real Estate Practice – one of the most widely used principles textbooks in the country. Finally, our national content, as well as our question selection, is further tailored to the state testing outline promulgated by PSI for Colorado. Thus the breadth and depth of the law reviews and test questions reflect the topic emphasis of your state’s testing service and your Colorado license exam. A word about the test questions… CO-RELEP’s testing practice section consists of ten national practice tests, eight state practice tests, and one state exam sample test. The practice tests are roughly 50 questions in length and the sample test is 115 questions. The test questions are designed to cover the content covered by the law reviews – which reinforces your learning of the total body of information tested by your state exam. The questions are direct, to the point, and designed to test your understanding. When you have completed a given test, you can check your answers against the answer key in the appendix. You may also note that each question’s answer is accompanied by a brief explanation, or “rationale” to further reinforce your understanding. In the end, as you know, it’s all up to you. Unlike other publications, we are not going to tell you that using this book will guarantee that you pass your state exam. It still takes hard work and study to pass. But we have done our best here to get you ready. Following that, the most we can do is wish you the best of success in taking and passing your Colorado real estate exam. So good luck!!",Law,309,N/A,0,en

Love and Christian Ethics,Frederick V. Simmons,Georgetown University Press,2016-12-15,"At the heart of Christian ethics is the biblical commandment to love God and to love one's neighbor as oneself. But what is the meaning of love? Scholars have wrestled with this question since the recording of the Christian gospels, and in recent decades teachers and students of Christian ethics have engaged in vigorous debates about appropriate interpretations and implications of this critical norm. In Love and Christian Ethics, nearly two dozen leading experts analyze and assess the meaning of love from a wide range of perspectives. Chapters are organized into three areas: influential sources and exponents of Western Christian thought about the ethical significance of love, perennial theoretical questions attending that consideration, and the implications of Christian love for important social realities. Contributors bring a richness of thought and experience to deliver unprecedentedly broad and rigorous analysis of this central tenet of Christian ethics and faith. William Werpehowski provides an afterword on future trajectories for this research. Love and Christian Ethics is sure to become a benchmark resource in the field.",Religion,409,N/A,0,en

Digital Information Design (DID) Foundation,"Brian Johnson, Leon-Paul de Rouw",Van Haren,2021-03-09,"Digital Information Design (DID) is primarily a business information management (BIM) model. As with any model it is used to help you to describe problems and test potential solutions. DID is not like any other method or framework model; it is independent of any other existing model or framework and does not claim to manage the entirety of the design of business information services. DID identifies useful and widely used best practices that are designed specifically for use in any phase of business information service development from idea, conception, specification, design, test, handover, service management and operation, or managing architectural issues or hardware and software installation. Primarily, DID was developed to manage the quality of information, and how to put it to good use. The DID model has been designed for you to identify what you need and when you need it when designing business information services and as a broad guide, identifies key points in existing frameworks that are particularly useful. The model is wholly independent of all other frameworks (including BiSL and BiSL Next in which the basic design is rooted). You can choose and use whatever you wish, the model will help you to assess the validity of your choice(s) and identify strengths and weaknesses in your approach. The DID model focuses on the common languages to describe key elements of design (need and value, mission and capability), key business information perspectives (business, information/data, services and technology) and the high-level domains (governance, strategy, improvement and operation) that must be managed in order to effectively run any business. DID helps you to identify only what you need to ensure that business information design reflects what is needed by your enterprise. The model can be used entirely separately from the framework level guidance discussed and it can be used at any level in the organization. The essentials of DID are explained in two books: this book, Foundation and the Practitioner book that will be published later.",Architecture,233,N/A,0,en

Sources of Business Finance - English,Navneet Singh,Navneet Singh,N/A,"Business finance refers to the management of money and financial resources within a business. It encompasses the processes of acquiring, allocating, and managing resources and capital to support the activities and goals of a business entity. Here are some key aspects of business finance: Financial Planning: This involves setting financial goals and objectives for the business and developing strategies to achieve them. It includes budgeting, forecasting, and creating financial plans to guide the business's operations and investments. Capital Investment: Business finance involves decisions about how to allocate capital for long-term investments in assets and projects that will generate returns over time. This includes capital budgeting, which evaluates the potential profitability of investment opportunities. Funding and Financing: Businesses need funds to operate and grow. Business finance involves identifying and securing sources of funds, such as equity financing (selling ownership stakes in the business), debt financing (borrowing money), or alternative financing options like crowdfunding or venture capital. Risk Management: Financial decisions involve assessing and managing various types of financial risks, such as credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, and operational risk. Risk management strategies may include hedging, diversification, and insurance to mitigate potential losses. Financial Control and Reporting: Business finance includes monitoring financial performance through regular financial reporting and analysis. This involves preparing financial statements (e.g., balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements) and using financial ratios and metrics to evaluate profitability, liquidity, and efficiency. Working Capital Management: Managing short-term assets and liabilities to ensure the business has enough liquidity to meet its short-term obligations and operational needs. This includes managing cash flow, inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable effectively. Financial Strategy: Developing and implementing financial strategies that align with the overall strategic goals of the business. This may include decisions on capital structure (mix of equity and debt financing), dividend policy, mergers and acquisitions, and financial restructuring. Compliance and Governance: Ensuring compliance with financial regulations, accounting standards, and tax laws. Business finance also involves implementing effective corporate governance practices to promote transparency, accountability, and ethical behavior in financial management. Effective management of business finance is essential for the long-term success and sustainability of a business. It requires financial acumen, strategic thinking, and the ability to make informed decisions in a dynamic and often unpredictable business environment.",Art,74,N/A,0,en

Data Science with Semantic Technologies,"Archana Patel, Narayan C. Debnath, Bharat Bhusan",John Wiley & Sons,2022-10-26,"DATA SCIENCE WITH SEMANTIC TECHNOLOGIES This book will serve as an important guide toward applications of data science with semantic technologies for the upcoming generation and thus becomes a unique resource for scholars, researchers, professionals, and practitioners in this field. To create intelligence in data science, it becomes necessary to utilize semantic technologies which allow machine-readable representation of data. This intelligence uniquely identifies and connects data with common business terms, and it also enables users to communicate with data. Instead of structuring the data, semantic technologies help users to understand the meaning of the data by using the concepts of semantics, ontology, OWL, linked data, and knowledge-graphs. These technologies help organizations to understand all the stored data, adding the value in it, and enabling insights that were not available before. As data is the most important asset for any organization, it is essential to apply semantic technologies in data science to fulfill the need of any organization. Data Science with Semantic Technologies provides a roadmap for the deployment of semantic technologies in the field of data science. Moreover, it highlights how data science enables the user to create intelligence through these technologies by exploring the opportunities and eradicating the challenges in the current and future time frame. In addition, this book provides answers to various questions like: Can semantic technologies be able to facilitate data science? Which type of data science problems can be tackled by semantic technologies? How can data scientists benefit from these technologies? What is knowledge data science? How does knowledge data science relate to other domains? What is the role of semantic technologies in data science? What is the current progress and future of data science with semantic technologies?

Furthermore, it is the very backbone of lifelong solidarity in inter-generational relations, and the very place where the readiness of taking on care and responsibility are experienced and learned. The publication’s underlying idea opens up two perspectives: on the one hand, differences and similarities in family life forms are chiselled out on the base of an international cooperation. Simultaneously, the international authors are called upon to express their ideas about their own country’s future more distinctly and clearly; thus, distinctions and similarities of the respective paths of development are rather easily perceived.",Social Science,672,N/A,0,en

Temperament-Based Elementary Classroom Management,Sandee Graham McClowry,Rowman & Littlefield,2014-04-28,"This book presents an alternative to the “one size fits all” classroom approach. The majority of classroom management books present generic strategies as if they are applicable to all students. The underlying assertion of such books is that if teachers use such approaches, student behavior problems will seldom occur. An alternative framework, presented in this book, asserts that teachers need to incorporate knowledge about temperament into their strategies for classroom management. As studies have demonstrated, targeted temperament-based strategies succeed where global disciplinary practices have failed. Because students differ in their temperaments, variations in classroom behavior are to be expected. Child temperament is the inborn individual characteristics that affect the way children react to different situations. It is also a social processing system through which children view and interact with the world, both altering the responses of others and contributing toward their own development. Once teachers learn the major tenets of temperament, they no longer view their students as intentionally misbehaving. Instead they understand how the temperaments of their students influence their classroom behavior. Such insights release teachers from engaging in futile battles with their students. They can redirect their energies into enhancing their relationships with their students, implementing effective temperament-based strategies, and, as a result, spend more time on instructional activities.",Education,155,N/A,0,en

Counseling and Motivational Interviewing in Speech-Language Pathology,Jerry Hoepner,Taylor & Francis,2024-06-01,"Written as a helpful guide for speech-language pathologists and students, Counseling and Motivational Interviewing in Speech-Language Pathology provides a solid base in theoretical foundations, while prioritizing skill development and practical applications of counseling in speech-language pathology. Now more than ever, there is a burgeoning need for speech-language pathologists to incorporate counseling into their everyday practice. However, most practitioners currently lack the training and knowledge necessary to fulfill that role. Counseling and Motivational Interviewing in Speech-Language Pathology seeks to remedy that by providing techniques and tools for counseling across the lifespan and practice settings. The book is divided into two main parts: • Chapters 1 through 4 cover the foundational principles of motivational interviewing, including several self-assessment tools to support learners in the process. • Chapters 5 through 8 address specific counseling techniques and topics, providing readers with practical examples of how to properly counsel individuals with communication, cognition, and swallowing disorders. What’s included in Counseling and Motivational Interviewing in Speech-Language Pathology: • Sample dialogues between clinicians and clients. • Case examples, thinking exercises, and potential assignments for readers to apply the knowledge and skills addressed in the book. • A chapter dedicated to communicatively accessible structured interview approaches, eliciting and monitoring collaborative goals, and screening for other mental health concerns. Counseling and Motivational Interviewing in Speech-Language Pathology is an approachable guide that will address the issues of scope of practice while proving why speech-language pathologists are uniquely suited to provide counseling.",Medical,273,N/A,0,en

Bracketed between texts on giraffe morphology, ecological perception, ugliness, and hopeful monsters, architectural case studies investigate historical moments when relationships between architecture and site were productively intertwined, from the anomalous city designs of Francesco de Marchi in the sixteenth century to Le Corbusier’s near eradication of context in his Plan Voisin in the twentieth century to the more recent contextualist movements.

Social Decentering,Mark Redmond,Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG,2018-05-22,"Social decentering theory was developed in response to the confusion created by the use of the term empathy and to a lesser extent, perspective-taking, to reflect a wide and varied set of human cognitive processes and behaviors. Theory of Social Decentering: A Theory of Other-Orientation Encompassing Empathy and Perspective-Taking, presents an innovative approach to the social cognitive process by which humans take into consideration the thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and dispositions of other people. The multidimensional theory and measure of social decentering represents a unifying theory that identifies and incorporates key elements imbedded in other-oriented terms. The first chapters present the theory and development of a measure of social decentering in a complete and detailed manner examining the important role that social decentering plays in human communication. The remaining chapters of the book examine the role that social decentering, empathy, and perspective-taking play in the development and management of interpersonal relationships, in marital relationships, in teams and group interactions, and in the workplace. The final chapter examines the negative consequences to individuals, decisions, and relationships potentially created by engaging in social decentering. The appendices include copies of the measure of social decentering and the measure of relationship-specific social decentering. The book is of interest for graduates in communication studies, psychology, and sociology, and valuable for communication and social psychology scholars interested in empathy or perspective taking.",Social Science,318,N/A,0,en

The Ethical and Professional Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy,Len Sperry,Allyn & Bacon,2007,"In addition to providing foundational information about ethical codes and legal statues, this new text advocates for counseling personnel to view ethical issues as challenges for personal and professional growth. Written in an accessible, concise and easy to read style, this book endeavors to broaden the traditional focus of ethical study to include topics that students and practicing clinicians will find consistent with their own personal strivings and professional needs. While covering the traditional core percepts of professional ethics in considerable detail: confidentiality, informed consent, boundaries and the use of power, and competency and professional responsibility, it also advocates for counseling personnel to view ethical issues as challenges for personal and professional growth. And, it includes a number of critical topics that counselors and therapists face or will face in daily practice. These include organizational ethics, virtue ethics, and an expanded view of multicultural ethics with a focus on community values as well as on religious and spiritual issues. This new book includes a special chapter in the appendix that emphasizes ways in which counselors and therapists can grow and achieve excellence in their personal and professional lives. Unique and essential coverage of organizational ethics (OE) is addressed making readers aware of how organizational dynamics can exert such powerful influence on ethical decision making (Ch 4 & 10-14). Unique coverage of the ethical considerations involving spiritual and religious issues as well as the use of alternative interventions in counseling and psychotherapy are covered, including the common lawsuits brought against counselors and therapists using spiritual and alternative interventions (Ch 3).

Loves Me Not,"William J. O'Brien, Lesley Elliott",Penguin Random House New Zealand Limited,2014-11-07,"An essential guide for keeping relationships safe. In 2008, the horrific murder of Sophie Elliott by her former boyfriend and university lecturer, Clayton Weatherston, shocked New Zealand. During the police investigation it became clear Sophie’s murderer was a typical abuser who had a track record of treating partners badly. Sophie’s mother, Lesley Elliott, driven to research domestic and partner abuse, was astonished to find the very characteristics evident in abusive relationships were right there in Sophie’s. Lesley quickly realised that if she and Sophie, ‘through ignorance and naivety’ missed the signs, then so could many others. It became obvious that education was the key; Lesley set up the Sophie Elliott Foundation to raise awareness among all young women, their friends and families to the signs of partner abuse. The Loves Me Not programme was developed by the Sophie Elliott Foundation along with the New Zealand Police and members of the Ministry of Social Development. Its primary aim is to help young people help themselves to keep safe. Loves Me Not includes advice and suggestions on how to identify problems, how to deal with them and where to seek help. Also included is ‘One for the Boys’, a chapter written by well-known clinical psychologist and commentator, Nigel Latta, as well as a chapter written by school guidance counsellor, Gayna McConnell.",Family & Relationships,128,N/A,0,en

Accelerating Customer Relationships,Ronald S. Swift,Prentice Hall Professional,2001,"Preface Corporations that achieve high customer retention and high customer profitability aim for: The right product (or service), to the right customer, at the right price, at the right time, through the right channel, to satisfy the customer's need or desire. Information Technology—in the form of sophisticated databases fed by electronic commerce, point-of-sale devices, ATMs, and other customer touch points—is changing the roles of marketing and managing customers. Information and knowledge bases abound and are being leveraged to drive new profitability and manage changing relationships with customers. The creation of knowledge bases, sometimes called data warehouses or Info-Structures, provides profitable opportunities for business managers to define and analyze their customers' behavior to develop and better manage short- and long-term relationships. Relationship Technology will become the new norm for the use of information and customer knowledge bases to forge more meaningful relationships. This will be accomplished through advanced technology, processes centered on the customers and channels, as well as methodologies and software combined to affect the behaviors of organizations (internally) and their customers/channels (externally). We are quickly moving from Information Technology to Relationship Technology. The positive effect will be astounding and highly profitable for those that also foster CRM. At the turn of the century, merchants and bankers knew their customers; they lived in the same neighborhoods and understood the individual shopping and banking needs of each of their customers. They practiced the purest form of Customer Relationship Management (CRM). With mass merchandising and franchising, customer relationships became distant. As the new millennium begins, companies are beginning to leverage IT to return to the CRM principles of the neighborhood store and bank. The customer should be the primary focus for most organizations. Yet customer information in a form suitable for marketing or management purposes either is not available, or becomes available long after a market opportunity passes, therefore CRM opportunities are lost. Understanding customers today is accomplished by maintaining and acting on historical and very detailed data, obtained from numerous computing and point-of-contact devices. The data is merged, enriched, and transformed into meaningful information in a specialized database. In a world of powerful computers, personal software applications, and easy-to-use analytical end-user software tools, managers have the power to segment and directly address marketing opportunities through well managed processes and marketing strategies. This book is written for business executives and managers interested in gaining advantage by using advanced customer information and marketing process techniques. Managers charged with managing and enhancing relationships with their customers will find this book a profitable guide for many years. Many of today's managers are also charged with cutting the cost of sales to increase profitability. All managers need to identify and focus on those customers who are the most profitable, while, possibly, withdrawing from supporting customers who are unprofitable. The goal of this book is to help you: identify actions to categorize and address your customers much more effectively through the use of information and technology, define the benefits of knowing customers more intimately, and show how you can use information to increase turnover/revenues, satisfaction, and profitability. The level of detailed information that companies can build about a single customer now enables them to market through knowledge-based relationships. By defining processes and providing activities, this book will accelerate your CRM ""learning curve,"" and provide an effective framework that will enable your organization to tap into the best practices and experiences of CRM-driven companies (in Chapter 14). In Chapter 6, you will have the opportunity to learn how to (in less than 100 days) start or advance, your customer database or data warehouse environment. This book also provides a wider managerial perspective on the implications of obtaining better information about the whole business. The customer-centric knowledge-based info-structure changes the way that companies do business, and it is likely to alter the structure of the organization, the way it is staffed, and, even, how its management and employees behave. Organizational changes affect the way the marketing department works and the way that it is perceived within the organization. Effective communications with prospects, customers, alliance partners, competitors, the media, and through individualized feedback mechanisms creates a whole new image for marketing and new opportunities for marketing successes. Chapter 14 provides examples of companies that have transformed their marketing principles into CRM practices and are engaging more and more customers in long-term satisfaction and higher per-customer profitability. In the title of this book and throughout its pages I have used the phrase ""Relationship Technologies"" to describe the increasingly sophisticated data warehousing and business intelligence technologies that are helping companies create lasting customer relationships, therefore improving business performance. I want to acknowledge that this phrase was created and protected by NCR Corporation and I use this trademark throughout this book with the company's permission. Special thanks and credit for developing the Relationship Technologies concept goes to Dr. Stephen Emmott of NCR's acclaimed Knowledge Lab in London. As time marches on, there is an ever-increasing velocity with which we communicate, interact, position, and involve our selves and our customers in relationships. To increase your Return on Investment (ROI), the right information and relationship technologies are critical for effective Customer Relationship Management. It is now possible to: know who your customers are and who your best customers are stimulate what they buy or know what they won't buy time when and how they buy learn customers' preferences and make them loyal customers define characteristics that make up a great/profitable customer model channels are best to address a customer's needs predict what they may or will buy in the future keep your best customers for many years This book features many companies using CRM, decision-support, marketing databases, and data-warehousing techniques to achieve a positive ROI, using customer-centric knowledge-bases. Success begins with understanding the scope and processes involved in true CRM and then initiating appropriate actions to create and move forward into the future. Walking the talk differentiates the perennial ongoing winners. Reinvestment in success generates growth and opportunity. Success is in our ability to learn from the past, adopt new ideas and actions in the present, and to challenge the future. Respectfully, Ronald S.

Creating Commitment,Michael O'Malley,John Wiley & Sons,2000-05-08,"Contrary to popular belief, most people truly desire to commit to the organizations for which they work. Just as most of us would prefer not to drift from one relationship to the next, the majority of workers would rather not live like corporate gypsies. So why, at a time when employee retention is so critical to success, do so many businesses find it hard to hold on to their best people? Why, despite the perks, bonuses, and all the other ""goodies"" with which companies attempt to create employee commitment, does turnover continue to be such a serious problem? In this groundbreaking book, Michael O'Malley-an acknowledged expert with more than two decades of experience helping the Fortune 500 attract and retain the brightest and best-provides answers to these questions. More importantly, he spells out proven strategies for fostering solid employee/employer relationships that last. Deftly interweaving personal insight, case histories, and the latest research in the field, O'Malley explores the nature of employee commitment. He shows how many of the same needs and passions that bind people to one another in their personal lives also bind employees to managers and organizations. O'Malley describes the roles played by factors such as compatibility, trust, predictability, dependability, sensitivity to individual needs, and a willingness to compromise. He explains why organizations invariably fail when they attempt to buy employee commitment. Conversely, while more money is the most commonly cited reason for employee defection, O'Malley reveals that the real reasons often have to do with neglect, distrust, burn-out, inconsiderateness, and other nonmonetary considerations. The lion's share of Creating Commitment is devoted to detailing a practical approach to building commitment in your organization. O'Malley describes specific attitudes and behaviors that either encourage or discourage commitment and provides guidelines for assessing your company's standing on commitment. He also outlines specific steps you can take to find and hire employees who are compatible with your corporate culture; to foster a sense of belonging among employees; to build trust and reciprocity; to promote economic interdependence; and much more. A complete guide to understanding and overcoming one of the greatest challenges to business success today, Creating Commitment is must reading for every manager. Advance Praise for Michael O'Malley's Creating Commitment ""Michael O'Malley has found the key to employee retention-commitment! He has taken a rigorous, research-based approach to understanding employee commitment and its implications for organization health, while using examples and comparisons from everyday life to make his insights accessible to all. The result is a must-read book for any leader concerned about keeping the best employees.""-Dr. Susan Gale, Vice President, Change Management and Human Resources, Howrey Simon Arnold & White ""Michael O'Malley has created a work of great insight that all professionals charged with attracting, retaining, and developing the leaders of today and tomorrow will want to read.""-Corey Seitz, Senior Vice President, Executive Development, Bank of America Corporation ""The two most important human aspects of organizations today are trust and commitment. Creating Commitment covers both and is loaded with stories and examples that are both readable and timely. O'Malley's contribution to today's business leaders is truly a gift.""-Dr. W. Warner Burke, Chair, Department of Organization and Leadership, Teachers College, Columbia University ""This is an important book for companies seeking a competitive advantage.

Mastering Data Modeling,John Carlis,Addison-Wesley Professional,2000-11-10,"Data modeling is one of the most critical phases in the database application development process, but also the phase most likely to fail. A master data modeler must come into any organization, understand its data requirements, and skillfully model the data for applications that most effectively serve organizational needs. Mastering Data Modeling is a complete guide to becoming a successful data modeler. Featuring a requirements-driven approach, this book clearly explains fundamental concepts, introduces a user-oriented data modeling notation, and describes a rigorous, step-by-step process for collecting, modeling, and documenting the kinds of data that users need. Assuming no prior knowledge, Mastering Data Modeling sets forth several fundamental problems of data modeling, such as reconciling the software developer's demand for rigor with the users' equally valid need to speak their own (sometimes vague) natural language. In addition, it describes the good habits that help you respond to these fundamental problems. With these good habits in mind, the book describes the Logical Data Structure (LDS) notation and the process of controlled evolution by which you can create low-cost, user-approved data models that resist premature obsolescence. Also included is an encyclopedic analysis of all data shapes that you will encounter. Most notably, the book describes The Flow, a loosely scripted process by which you and the users gradually but continuously improve an LDS until it faithfully represents the information needs. Essential implementation and technology issues are also covered. You will learn about such vital topics as: The fundamental problems of data modeling The good habits that help a data modeler be effective and economical LDS notation, which encourages these good habits How to read an LDS aloud--in declarative English sentences How to write a well-formed (syntactically correct) LDS How to get users to name the parts of an LDS with words from their own business vocabulary How to visualize data for an LDS A catalog of LDS shapes that recur throughout all data models The Flow--the template for your conversations with users How to document an LDS for users, data modelers, and technologists How to map an LDS to a relational schema How LDS differs from other notations and why ""Story interludes"" appear throughout the book, illustrating real-world successes of the LDS notation and controlled evolution process. Numerous exercises help you master critical skills. In addition, two detailed, annotated sample conversations with users show you the process of controlled evolution in action.",Computers,629,N/A,0,en

"Ancient Lakes: Biodiversity, Ecology and Evolution","Andrew Rossiter, Hiroya Kawanabe",Academic Press,2000-08-22,"Scattered over several continents, the ancient lakes of the world have a unique uninterrupted history dating back beyond 100,000 years. Ancient lakes are, in effect, aquatic islands in which a complex of ecology, genetics and evolutionary constraints have shaped in isolation their biotas over hundreds of thousands to millions of years. The diverse faunas achieve some of the highest levels of diversity known to any habitat, offering unique opportunities as 'natural laboratories' for studying the mechanisms of evolution and speciation in situ. This internationally authored volume contains the latest research results and theories to emerge from a diverse range of studies in these lakes. Containing exciting new findings in the ecology, evolution and systematic studies of ancient lake biotas together with many suggested areas for future research, it will be essential reading for all those with a general interest in ecology, evolution and natural history. In this volume expert scientists present the latest results and perspectives from their research on the organisms of the ancient lakes. Diverse in its taxonomic coverage and themes, and international in its authorship and coverage, Ancient Lakes will appeal to all biologists interested in evolution, ecology and biodiversity.

The Meaning of Faith,Harry Emerson Fosdick,N/A,1917,"A book on faith has been for years my hope and intention. And now it comes to final form during the most terrific war men ever waged, when faith is sorely tried and deeply needed. Direct discussion of the war has been purposely avoided; the issues here presented are not confined to those which the war suggests; but many streams of thought within the book flow in channels that the war has worn. Since the conflict had to come, I am glad for this book's sake that it was not written until it had Europe's holocaust for a background. Against one misunderstanding the reader should be guarded. If anyone approaches these studies, expecting to find detailed and special views of Christian doctrine, he will be disappointed. The perplexities of mind and life and the affirmations of religious faith, with which these studies deal, lie far beneath sectarian doctrinal controversy. I have tried to make clear a foundation on which faith might build its thoughts of Christian truth. And while I have spoken freely of God and Christ and the Spirit, of the Cross and life eternal, I have not intended or endeavored a complete theology. - Preface.",Faith,336,N/A,0,en

Harvesting External Innovation,Mr Donal O'Connell,"Gower Publishing, Ltd.",2012-09-01,"A fundamental change in the way organisations approach innovation is taking place. It involves cooperating and collaborating with external parties in the area of innovation and in the research and development of products and services and is driven by the simple realisation that not all the smart people work for just one organisation – it is necessary to work with smart people outside the company. Few intellectual property books concentrate on external innovation and more particularly on dealing with external inventors and handling their inventions. Harvesting External Innovation is different. It begins by examining the broad subject of innovation, stressing the need to understand its forms and phases, ways and means to encourage innovation. It then addresses the growing phenomenon of external innovation, where companies are cooperating and collaborating with a variety of external parties, driven by a passion for innovation. Intellectual property, especially patents, plays a fundamental role promoting and protecting innovation, regardless of whether that innovation comes from internal employees or persons external to the company. Donal O'Connell specifically examines this responsibility. A number of different approaches to engaging with the external innovator community are then considered, together with real life case studies. Harvesting External Innovation discusses in depth how best to handle intellectual property matters, how to actually work with these external inventors and how to handle their inventions, including a suggested process and check list. The critical importance of innovation to business, the role that intellectual property and patents play in promoting and protecting such innovation, and the growing phenomenon of external innovation, means this book is a must read.",Business & Economics,209,5,1,en

Bourdain,Laurie Woolever,HarperCollins,2021-09-28,"New York Times bestseller An unprecedented behind-the-scenes view into the life of Anthony Bourdain from the people who knew him best When Anthony Bourdain died in June 2018, fans around the globe came together to celebrate the life of an inimitable man who had dedicated his life to traveling nearly everywhere (and eating nearly everything), shedding light on the lives and stories of others. His impact was outsized and his legacy has only grown since his death. Now, for the first time, we have been granted a look into Bourdain’s life through the stories and recollections of his closest friends and colleagues. Laurie Woolever, Bourdain’s longtime assistant and confidante, interviewed nearly a hundred of the people who shared Tony’s orbit—from members of his kitchen crews to his writing, publishing, and television partners, to his daughter and his closest friends—in order to piece together a remarkably full, vivid, and nuanced vision of Tony’s life and work. From his childhood and teenage days, to his early years in New York, through the genesis of his game-changing memoir Kitchen Confidential to his emergence as a writing and television personality, and in the words of friends and colleagues including Eric Ripert, José Andrés, Nigella Lawson, and W. Kamau Bell, as well as family members including his brother and his late mother, we see the many sides of Tony—his motivations, his ambivalence, his vulnerability, his blind spots, and his brilliance. Unparalleled in scope and deeply intimate in its execution, with a treasure trove of photos from Tony's life, Bourdain: The Definitive Oral Biography is a testament to the life of a remarkable man in the words of the people who shared his world.",Biography & Autobiography,497,N/A,0,en

The Self+Love (P)roject,Sasha Ravae,QUEENS HEALING QUEENS,2022-08-19,"Is self-love something you can obtain through a makeover or a shopping spree? Can you get more of it by reading something inspirational or motivational? Or can a new boo make you love yourself more? The answer to all of these questions is “no.” Although they feel good and are gratifying in the moment, you can’t grow in self-love through these types of activities. Self-love is not simply a state of feeling good; it’s dynamic, which means that it grows through actions that mature us. When we act in ways that expand self-love within ourselves, we begin to accept our weaknesses as well as our strengths much better, have less need to explain away our shortcomings, have compassion for ourselves as human beings struggling to find personal meaning, are more centered in our life purpose and values, and expect living fulfillment through our own efforts. We usually search for love outwardly because that is how, as children, we found love and security. It was rewarded to us when we did good things, but we didn’t grow out of this as we got older. We continue to look for love in other people, but the truth of it is, the love you are looking for can only come from within. That is why someone else’s love will never be enough for you to be truly happy, and you can never feel safe if you are not comfortable with your own capabilities. It’s cool shouting, “love yourself” from the top of our lungs, but for those who find it hard to, those who experience their needs going unmet, of having countless disappointing relationships, prolonged periods of isolation or loneliness, abusive partners, or emotionally neglectful parents/caregivers—it can leave you feeling like there is something wrong with you. So, how do we fix this…?",Self-Help,219,N/A,0,en

Going well beyond any of the previously published reports on the Excellence study, this book contains many new statistical analyses of the survey data and more details from the case studies. Discussing theory and data related to several ongoing discussions in the communication profession, this book answers the following questions: *How can we show the value of public relations? *What is the value of relationships? *How do relationships affect reputation? *What does it mean to practice communication strategically? *How can we measure and evaluate the effects of public relations programs? *Should communication programs be integrated? *How does the new female majority in the profession affect communication Excellence? This book, as well as the research it reports, is the product of symmetrical communication and collaboration. As such, it is intended for scholars, applied researchers, students, and informed professionals who understand the value of research in developing a profession, such as public relations.

Cross-Cultural Brand Personality and Brand Desirability,Corinna Colette Vellnagel,Springer Nature,2020-08-13,"This research proposes and empirically tests the impact of brand personality dimensions on brand desirability in a cross-cultural context. Further, the concept of brand-self-congruity is tested on its mediating role between brand personality dimensions and brand desirability. The results reveal that certain brand personality dimensions can have a direct and/ or indirect impact on brand desirability. Yet, this effect mechanism has not only been found to be brand-dependent but also culture-dependent. In this context, the mediating role of brand-self-congruity was confirmed across all cultures and brands investigated. Important implications are derived for research and brand management. In different countries, different brand personality dimensions lead to brand desirability. Therefore, brand managers should know their markets, understand cultural differences and adjust their brand strategy accordingly in order to attain brand desirability.",Business & Economics,272,N/A,0,en
Markers of Psychosocial Maturation,Mufid James Hannush,Springer Nature,2021-07-15,"This book advances an integrative approach to understanding the phenomenon of psychosocial maturation. Through a rigorous, dialectically-informed interpretation of psychoanalytic and humanistic-existential-phenomenological sources, Mufid James Hannush distils thirty essential markers of maturity. The dialectical approach is described as a process whereby lived, affect-and-value laden polar meanings are transformed, through deep insight, into complementary and integrative meta-meanings. The author demonstrates how responding to the call of maturation can be viewed as a life project that serves the ultimate purpose of living a balanced life.

Love Stories of Later Life,Amanda Smith Barusch,Oxford University Press,2008-03-13,"Even with baby boomers retiring and greater media and research attention being lavished on older people, most gerontologists have studiously avoided examining romance among the elderly. Love Stories of Later Life is an appealing and eye-opening remedy to this neglect, as leading gerontologist Amanda Smith Barusch presents original research into what love and romance mean in seniors' lives. The result is a glimpse into a world many people didn't know existed - that of romantic love in later life. Unlike superficial guidebooks that purport to help seniors find a new mate, Love Stories of Later Life integrates theory and the latest research on love and the aging process. Drawing on a wealth of personal narratives collected during a landmark five-year study, the book presents the lived experiences of older adults from all walks of life. It addresses the impact of common age-related changes, both emotional and physical, on romantic relationships, and argues that love continues to sculpt our personalities and our lives, even in life's later decades. Each chapter includes practical tools for the serious student of love, including exercises designed to increase self-awareness and relationship-building as well as annotated lists of suggested reading that are at once comprehensive and accessible. Barusch's fresh perspective, engaging voice, and in-depth qualitative research make Love Stories of Later Life an important contribution to the study of individual lives and the aging process. This book will guide gerontologists, social workers, and counselors as they in turn help their older clients navigate love's challenges.

The Stepfamily Puzzle,Craig Everett,Routledge,2014-02-04,"Do stepfamilies experience greater levels of stressors than first families? Do they also experience more negative manifestations of stress? Find the latest research on these questions and more in this groundbreaking exploration of the complex factors and dynamics that make up stepfamilies. The Stepfamily Puzzle fills a gap in research that has not kept pace with the rapid growth of interest in this subject. It sets some of the pieces of the stepfamily puzzle into an intergenerational framework that includes the roles of grandparents, parent-child interactions, the struggles to define boundaries and achieve marital intimacy, and the underlying effects of financial support on stepfamily well-being. The Stepfamily Puzzle compares the effects of stress in stepfamilies and conditions in other families and reveals that the differences between the two types of families may not be as dramatic as long assumed. It also examines in-depth the emotional and financial stressors that impact stepfamilies and how this stress is exhibited in family relationships. Other groundbreaking research presented in this book includes: the closeness of relationships between children and grandparents in stepfamilies as compared to children and grandparents in first families effects of ongoing attachment to the former spouse on post-divorce relationships stepsibling subsystems a comparison of self-esteem and behavior problems of stepchildren and children in other family structures social support received by children in stepmother, stepfather, and intact families quality of stepfather-adolescent relationships effect of child support on stepfamily satisfaction Therapists, attorneys, and those interested in the numerous therapeutic and psychoeducational programs, self-help groups, and trade literature available on stepfamily relationships will find The Stepfamily Puzzle a valuable introduction to current research in this area. By presenting the complex variables that interact within stepfamilies, this book helps professionals understand the dynamics behind stepfamily relationships so they can provide effective support and care.",Family & Relationships,253,N/A,0,en

Here, Ferreira seeks to rehabilitate Works of Love as one of Kierkegaard's most important works. He shows that Kierkegaard's deliberations on love are highly relevant to some important themes in contemporary ethics, including impartiality, duty, equality, mutuality, reciprocity, self-love, sympathy, and sacrifice. Ferreira also argues that Works of Love bears on issues peculiar to a religious ethic, such as the role of God as ""middle term,"" and the possibility of preserving the aesthetic dimensions of love in a religious ethic of relation.",Philosophy,329,5,1,en

The New Turkey and Its Discontents,"Simon Waldman, Emre Caliskan",Oxford University Press,2017-01-03,"Today's Turkey little resembles that of recent decades. Newfound economic prosperity has had many unexpected social and political repercussions, most notably the rise of the AKP party and President Erdogan. Despite unprecedented electoral popularity, the conduct of the AKP has faced growing criticism: Turkey has yet to solve its Kurdish question; its foreign policy is increasingly fraught as it balances relations with Iran, Israel, Russia and the EU; and widespread protests gripped the country in 2013, as did an unsuccessful coup in 2016. The government is now perceived by many to be corrupt, unaccountable, intimidating of the press and intolerant of political alternatives. Has this once promising democracy descended into a tyranny of the majority led by a charismatic leader? Is Turkey more polarised now than at any point in its recent history? These are among the questions at the heart of The New Turkey and Its Discontents, which traces Turkey's evolution under Erdogan's leadership, and assesses the likely consequences at home and abroad.",Political Science,362,N/A,0,en

Loyalty,George P. Fletcher,Oxford University Press,1995-07-13,"At a time when age-old political structures are crumbling, civil strife abounds, and economic uncertainty permeates the air, loyalty offers us security in our relationships with associates, friends, and family. Yet loyalty is a suspect virtue. It is not impartial. It is not blind. It violates the principles of morality that have dominated Western thought for the last two hundred years. Loyalties are also thought to be irrational and contrary to the spirit of Capitalism. In a free market society, we are encouraged to move to the competition when we are not happy. This way of thinking has invaded our personal relationships and undermined our capacities for friendship and loyalty to those who do not serve our immediate interests. As George P. Fletcher writes, it is time for loyal bonds, born of history and experience, to prevail both over impartial morality and the self-interested thinking of the market trader. In this extended essay, George P. Fletcher offers an account of loyalty that illuminates its role in our relationships with family and friends, our ties to country, and the commitment of the religious to God and their community. Fletcher opposes the traditional view of the moral self as detached from context and history. He argues instead that loyalty, not impartial detachment, should be the central feature of our moral and political lives. Writing as a political ""liberal,"" he claims that a commitment to country is necessary to improve the lot of the poor and disadvantaged. This commitment to country may well require greater reliance on patriotic rituals in education and a reconsideration of the Supreme Court's extending the First Amendment to protect flag burning. Given the worldwide currents of parochialism and political decentralization, the task for us, Fletcher argues, is to renew our commitment to a single nation united in its diversity. Bringing to bear his expertise as a law professor, Fletcher reasons that the legal systems should defer to existing relationships of loyalty. Familial, professional, and religious loyalties should be respected as relationships beyond the limits of the law. Thus surrogate mothers should not be forced to surrender and betray their children, spouses should not be required to testify against each other in court, parents should not be prevented from willing their property to their children, and the religiously committed should not be forced to act contrary to conscience. Yet the question remains: Aren't loyalty, and particularly patriotism, dangerously one-sided? Indeed, they are, but no more than are love and friendship. The challenge, Fletcher maintains, is to overcome the distorting effects of impartial morality and to develop a morality of loyalty properly suited to our emotional and spiritual lives. Justice has its sphere, as do loyalties. In this book, Fletcher provides the first step toward a new way of thinking that recognizes the complexity of our moral and political lives.",Philosophy,224,N/A,0,en

Love as Passion,Niklas Luhmann,John Wiley & Sons,2014-12-08,"In this important book Niklas Luhmann - one of the leading social thinkers of the late 20th century - analyses the emergence of ‘love' as the basis of personal relationships in modern societies. He argues that, while family systems remained intact in the transition from traditional to modern societies, a semantics for love developed to accommodate extra-marital relationships; this semantics was then transferred back into marriage and eventually transformed marriage itself. Drawing on a diverse range of historical and literary sources, Luhmann retraces the emergence and evolution of the special semantics of passionate love that has come to form the basis of modern forms of intimacy and personal relationships. This classic book by Luhmann has been widely recognized as a work of major importance. It is an outstanding contribution to social theory and it provides an original and illuminating perspective on the nature of modern marriage and sexuality.",Social Science,231,N/A,0,en

Love's Vision,Troy Jollimore,Princeton University Press,2011-07-05,"Love often seems uncontrollable and irrational, but we just as frequently appear to have reasons for loving the people we do. In Love's Vision, Troy Jollimore offers a new way of understanding love that accommodates both of these facts, arguing that love is guided by reason even as it resists and sometimes eludes rationality. At the same time, he reconsiders love's moral status, acknowledging its moral dangers while arguing that it is, at heart, a moral phenomenon--an emotion that demands empathy and calls us away from excessive self-concern. Love is revealed as neither wholly moral nor deeply immoral, neither purely rational nor profoundly irrational. Rather, as Diotima says in Plato's Symposium, love is ""something in between."" Jollimore makes his case by proposing a ""vision"" view of love, according to which loving is a way of seeing that involves bestowing charitable attention on a loved one. This view recognizes the truth in the cliché ""love is blind,"" but holds that love's blindness does not undermine the idea that love is guided by reason. Reasons play an important role in love even if they rest on facts that are not themselves rationally justifiable. Filled with illuminating examples from literature, Love's Vision is an original examination of a subject of vital philosophical and human concern.",Philosophy,220,N/A,0,en
China and International Theory,Chih-yu Shih et al.,Routledge,2019-03-27,"Major IR theories, which stress that actors will inevitably only seek to enhance their own interests, tend to contrive binaries of self and other and ‘inside’ and ‘outside’. By contrast, this book recognizes the general need of all to relate, which they do through various imagined resemblances between them. The authors of this book therefore propose the ‘balance of relationships’ (BoR) as a new international relations theory to transcend binary ways of thinking. BoR theory differs from mainstream IR theories owing to two key differences in its epistemological position. Firstly, the theory explains why and how states as socially-interrelated actors inescapably pursue a strategy of self-restraint in order to join a network of stable and long-term relationships. Secondly, owing to its focus on explaining bilateral relations, BoR theory bypasses rule-based governance. By positing ‘relationality’ as a key concept of Chinese international relations, this book shows that BoR can also serve as an important concept in the theorization of international relations, more broadly. The rising interest in developing a Chinese school of IR means the BoR theory will draw attention from students of IR theory, comparative foreign policy, Chinese foreign policy, East Asia, cultural studies, post-Western IR, post-colonial studies and civilizational politics.",Political Science,426,N/A,0,en
Love in the Post-Reconceptualist Era of Curriculum Work,Allan Michel Jales Coutinho,Taylor & Francis,2023-03-08,"By employing the autobiographical method of currere and bifocalization, this book sheds light on the significance of love and the ethics of caregiving as means to transform curriculum studies into a post-reconceptualist and collective endeavor. Advancing an understanding of curriculum as a ""collective public moral enterprise,"" it critically asks whether we can build a world where love is not negotiated, but only proliferated. Through the creation of short and interconnected autobiographical narratives about the meanings of love, the author provides pivotal insights for curricularists who labor in conflicting and paradoxical contexts. As such, the book seeks to demonstrate how the labor of ""love fortification"" may be accomplished in a world of agonistic, antagonistic, and competitive becoming(s). Highlighting the role of caregiving, this book questions the role of evaluations in post-reconceptualization and provides insights for educators and policymakers on how to promote ""actualization"" and reconciliation in schools in contexts across the global-north and -south. Engaging with a long scholarly tradition that ultimately seeks to understand the meanings of love in our lives and in our work, supporting the ""historization"" of the field of curriculum, and with an international focus, this book will appeal to scholars and students with interests in curriculum studies and curriculum theory.",Education,124,N/A,0,en

Ways & Power Of Love,Pitirim A. Sorokin,Templeton Foundation Press,2002-03-04,"The Ways and Power of Love was originally published in 1954 when Pitirim Sorokin was in the twilight of his career and leading the Harvard Research Center in Creative Altruism. His elaborate scientific analysis of love with regard to its higher and lower forms, its causes and effects, its human and cosmic significance, and its core features constitutes the first study on this topic in world literature to date. Sorokin was the one absolutely essential twentieth-century pioneer in the study of love at the interface of science and religion. Bringing The Ways and Power of Love back into print allows a new generation of readers to appreciate Sorokin's genius and to move forward with his endeavor at a time when civilization itself continues to be threatened by a marked inability to live up to the ideal of love for all humankind. It is certainly right to hope, with Sorokin, that progress in knowledge about love can move humanity forward to a better future. Turning the sciences toward the study of love is no easy task, but it can and must be done.",Psychology,582,N/A,0,en

Lacan on Love,Bruce Fink,John Wiley & Sons,2017-09-05,"Quintessentially fascinating, love intrigues and perplexes us, and drives much of what we do in life. As wary as we may be of its illusions and disappointments, many of us fall blindly into its traps and become ensnared time and again. Deliriously mad excitement turns to disenchantment, if not deadening repetition, and we wonder how we shall ever break out of this vicious cycle. Can psychoanalysis – with ample assistance from philosophers, poets, novelists, and songwriters – give us a new perspective on the wellsprings and course of love? Can it help us fathom how and why we are often looking for love in all the wrong places, and are fundamentally confused about “what love really is”? In this lively and wide-ranging exploration of love throughout the ages, Fink argues that it can. Taking within his compass a vast array of traditions – from Antiquity to the courtly love poets, Christian love, and Romanticism – and providing an in-depth examination of Freud and Lacan on love and libido, Fink unpacks Lacan’s paradoxical claim that “love is giving what you don’t have.” He shows how the emptiness or lack we feel within ourselves gets covered over or entwined in love, and how it is possible and indeed vital to give something to another that we feel we ourselves don’t have. This first-ever commentary on Lacan’s Seminar VIII, Transference, provides readers with a clear and systematic introduction to Lacan’s views on love. It will be of great value to students and scholars of psychology and of the humanities generally, and to analysts of all persuasions.",Psychology,268,N/A,0,en

The Impact of Technology on Relationships in Educational Settings,"Angela Costabile, Barbara Spears",Routledge,2013-02-28,"As the linguistic, cognitive and social elements of our lives are transformed by new and emerging technologies, educational settings are also challenged to respond to the issues that have arisen as a consequence. This book focuses on that challenge: using psychological theory as a lens to highlight the positive uses of new technologies in relationships and educational settings, and to advocate technological learning opportunities and social support where the misuse and abuse of ICT occurs. The Impact of Technology on Relationships in Educational Settings sets out to explore the role of ICTs in relationship forming, social networking and social relationships within our schools and has grown out of the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST); Action on cyberbullying, involving 28 participating countries, and two non-COST countries, of which Australia is one. This cutting edge international text offers cross-cultural, psychological perspectives on the positive uses of new and emerging technologies to improve social relationships and examples of best practice to prevent virtual bullying. This comes at a time when much of the focus in current writings has been on the more negative aspects which have emerged as new technologies evolved: cyberbullying, cyber-aggression and cybersafety concerns. This text is ideally suited to researchers and practiitioners in the fields of Educational and developmental psychology, as well as those specialising in educational technology and the sociology of education.",Education,241,N/A,0,en

Love in Sufi Literature,Omneya Ayad,Taylor & Francis,2023-09-27,"Focused on Aḥmad Ibn ‘Ajība – an eighteenth-century Moroccan Sufi scholar renowned for his contribution to Sufi Qur’ānic exegesis – this book engages critically with his theory of divine love to elucidate his impact on the wider field of Qur’ānic scholarship. The principal source of analysis is Ibn ‘Ajība’s Oceanic Exegesis of the Qur’ān which connected theoretical works on the concept of divine love to their practical application, a breakthrough in Sufi literature. Close analysis of this text is supplemented by a comparative approach focusing on several other eminent Sufi commentaries, including those of Abū al-Qāsim al-Qushayrī and Rūzbihān Baqlī Shīrāzī. This comparative approach situates Ibn ‘Ajība’s thought in theological and historical perspective, engaging with his mystical approach which integrates his theory of divine love with other Sufi doctrines in an accessible manner. This approach, it is argued, left an indelible impact on future generations of Qur’ānic exegetes within North Africa and across the Islamic world. The book will prove an important resource for academic researchers who wish to explore the vast intellectual heritage that Ibn ‘Ajība left, as well as to those interested in Sufi literature and Islamic theology in general.",Religion,271,N/A,0,en

Early Childhood Pedagogies,Jane Murray,Routledge,2018-12-07,"Diverse international perspectives on the ways in which young children’s learning and care may be supported converge in this book. Traversing the field of early childhood education and care from its established philosophical underpinnings to 21st century research, policies, and practices, the contributions to this volume draw together past and present discourses as a basis for shaping future trajectories. In spite of a growing international consensus on the strong influence of early childhood experiences on lifetime outcomes, the nineteen chapters reveal contemporary early childhood pedagogy as a collection of spaces characterised by plurality, complexity, and dissonance. These characteristics signal the importance of recognising early childhood pedagogies: multiple models of practice for the many diverse learning and care contexts that have the capacity to value young children as individuals and enable each to flourish now and throughout their lives. Moreover, such characteristics disrupt notions that a single ‘optimal’ early childhood pedagogy is either possible or desirable.",Education,377,N/A,0,en

Kierkegaard's Philosophy of Religion,Reidar Thomte,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2009-01-23,"Reidar Thomte's Kierkegaard's Philosophy of Religion is an excellent read for students beginning their study of one of the ""greats"" of nineteenth and twentieth century philosophy. Thomte directly appropriates Kierkegaard's insightful language and discussion of the theological and philosophical issues that stimulated him, all of which are still alive and well today. This approach has the happy result that readers seeking an introduction do not have to be led through technical debates in order to approach Kierkegaard's thought. Thomte is a master of incisive summary; his presentations of crucial distinctions are level-headed and to the point. Kierkegaard's categories such as ""the stages on life's way"" (the aesthetic, the ethical, Religiousness A, and Religiousness B), the individual, subjectivity, the Paradox, the varieties of love, faith and knowledge, etc., are provocative and illuminating. Not only is this book a good a ""starter,"" it is also a comprehensive review of the principal issues in Kierkegaard's philosophy of religion. (by Robert L.

From Russia With Love,Llewella Chapman,Bloomsbury Publishing,2022-10-06,"Often hailed as the 'best' James Bond film, From Russia With Love (1963) is celebrated for its direction by Terence Young, memorable performances from Sean Connery in his second outing as 007, Pedro Armendáriz as Kerim, Lotte Lenya as the lesbian villain Colonel Rosa Klebb, and Robert Shaw as Red Grant, the sexually ambiguous SPECTRE assassin. And regardless of its place within the longest-running continuous film series in cinema history, it is also an outstanding example of the British spy thriller in its own right. Llewella Chapman's study of the iconic film pinpoints its place within the James Bond film franchise, and its significant cultural value to critics and fans as well as this film's important place within British cinema history more widely. Drawing on a broad range of archival sources, Chapman traces the film's development and production history, including its adaptation from Ian Fleming's source novel, as well as its reception and lasting impact. Chapman also considers the film's portrayal of gender politics, with its queer villains counterpoised with the heterosexual couple Bond and his Russian counterpart Tatiana Romanova, the context of Cold War politics, and the influence of Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest (1959).",Performing Arts,112,N/A,0,en

Spectacular Flirtations,Gillian Perry,Yale University Press,2007,"During the Georgian period there was a remarkable proliferation of seductive visual imagery and written accounts of female performers. Focusing on the close relationship between the dramatic and visual arts at this time, this beautiful and stimulating book explores popular ideas of the actress as coquette, whore, celebrity, muse, and creative agent, charting her important symbolic role in contemporary attempts to professionalize both the theatre and the practice of fine art. Gill Perry shows how artists such as Gainsborough, Reynolds, Hoppner or Lawrence produced complex images of female performers as fashion icons, coquettes, dignified queens or creative artists. The result is a rich interdisciplinary study of the Georgian actress. Published for the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art",Art,256,N/A,0,en

For example, the faculty has shifted from one composed mostly of tenure-track, full-time employees to one made up of contingent, part-time teachers. Non-tenure-track instructors now make up 70 percent of college faculty. Their pay for teaching eight courses averages $22,400 a year—less than the annual salary of most fast-food workers. In The Gig Academy, Adrianna Kezar, Tom DePaola, and Daniel T. Scott assess the impact of this disturbing workforce development. Providing an overarching framework that takes the concept of the gig economy and applies it to the university workforce, this book scrutinizes labor restructuring across both academic and nonacademic spheres. By synthesizing these employment trends, the book reveals the magnitude of the problem for individual workers across all institutional types and job categories while illustrating the damaging effects of these changes on student outcomes, campus community, and institutional effectiveness. A pointed critique of contemporary neoliberalism, the book also includes an analysis of the growing divide between employees and administrators. The authors conclude by examining the strengthening state of unionization among university workers. Advocating a collectivist, action-oriented vision for reversing the tide of exploitation, Kezar, DePaola, and Scott urge readers to use the book as a tool to interrogate the state of working relations on their own campuses and fight for a system that is run democratically for the benefit of all. Ultimately, The Gig Academy is a call to arms, one that encourages non-tenure-track faculty, staff, postdocs, graduate students, and administrative and tenure-track allies to unite in a common struggle against the neoliberal Gig Academy.",Education,259,N/A,0,en

Intimacy and Ageing,"Bildtgård, Torbjörn, Öberg, Peter",Policy Press,2017-06-21,"As people live longer around the world, remaining healthy into old age, the phenomenon of new intimate relationships in later life is rapidly growing. This book, part of the Ageing in a Global Context series, looks closely at how these relationships have developed within the current cohort of elderly, with particular attention to the ways in which new relationships at older ages are simultaneously rooted in older cultures of intimacy and partake in changes in social relations and behavior that have emerged more recently. What do new intimate relationships offer older men and women, and what do they expect or hope for from them?",Family & Relationships,224,N/A,0,en

The Possibility of Salvation Among the Unevangelised,Daniel Strange,Paternoster,2002,"'Between Horror and Hope' is a study of Paul's metaphorical language of death in Romans 6:1-11. The scholarly debate focuses on two main issues; the origin of the 'commentatio mortis' tradition and its development. Dr. Sabou argues that the origin of this terminology is original to Paul; that it was the apostle's own insight into the meaning of Christ's death (a ""death to sin"") and his understanding of the identity of Christ in his death (as the anointed davidic king) which guided him to create this metaphor of ""dying to sin"" as a way of describing the relationship of the believer with sin. On the development of this language of death, the author argues that this language conveys two aspects — horror and hope. The first is discussed in the context of crucifixion in which Paul explains the believer's ""death to sin"" by presenting Christ's death as the death of the anointed davidic king who won the victory over sin and death by rising from the dead. Paul affirms that believers are ""coalesced"" with what was ""proclaimed"" about Christ's death and resurrection, thereby allowing him to assert that the releasing of the body from the power of sin is a result of ""crucifixion."" This ""crucifixion"" is the ""condemnation"" inflicted on our past lives in the age inaugurated by Adam's sin and this is such a horrible event that believers have to stay away from sin since sin leads to such punishment. In contrast, hope is presented in the context of ""burial."" The believers' ""burial with"" Christ points to the fact that they are part of Christ's family and this is accomplished by the overwhelming action of God by which he pushes us toward the event of Christ's death, an act pictured in baptism. It is this ""burial with"" Christ that allows believers to share with Christ in newness of life.",Religion,400,N/A,0,en

Every person is wired for love differently—with different habits, needs, and reactions to conflict. The good news is that most people’s minds work in predictable ways and respond well to security, attachment, and routines, making it possible to neurologically prime the brain for greater love and connection and fewer conflicts. This go-to guide will show you how. Drawn from neuroscience, attachment theory, and emotion regulation, this highly anticipated second edition of Wired for Love presents cutting-edge research on how and why love lasts, and offers ten guiding principles that can improve any relationship. This fully revised and updated edition also includes new guidance on how to manage disagreements, as well as new exercises to help you create a sense of safety and security, establish healthy conflict ground rules, and deal with the threat of the third—any outside source which threatens the harmony in your relationship, including in-laws, alcohol, children, and affairs. You’ll find proven-effective strategies to help you strengthen your relationship by: Creating and maintaining a safe “couple bubble” Using morning and evening routines to stay connected Learning how to see your partner’s point of view Meeting each other halfway in a fight Becoming the expert on what makes your partner feel loved By using simple gestures and words, you’ll learn to put out emotional fires and help your partner feel appreciated and loved. You’ll also discover how to move past a “warring brain” mentality and toward a more cooperative “loving brain.” Most importantly, you’ll gain a better understanding of the complex dynamics at work behind love and trust in intimate relationships. While there’s no doubt that love is an inexact science, if you understand how you and your partner are wired differently, you can overcome your differences, and create a lasting intimate connection.",Family & Relationships,332,N/A,0,en

Distracted,James M. Lang,Hachette UK,2020-10-20,"Keeping students focused can be difficult in a world filled with distractions—which is why a renowned educator created a scientific solution to one of every teacher's biggest problems. Why is it so hard to get students to pay attention? Conventional wisdom blames iPhones, insisting that access to technology has ruined students' ability to focus. The logical response is to ban electronics in class. But acclaimed educator James M. Lang argues that this solution obscures a deeper problem: how we teach is often at odds with how students learn. Classrooms are designed to force students into long periods of intense focus, but emerging science reveals that the brain is wired for distraction. We learn best when able to actively seek and synthesize new information. In Distracted, Lang rethinks the practice of teaching, revealing how educators can structure their classrooms less as distraction-free zones and more as environments where they can actively cultivate their students' attention. Brimming with ideas and grounded in new research, Distracted offers an innovative plan for the most important lesson of all: how to learn.",Education,254,N/A,0,en

Getting Close to Others 5 Steps,"Jill P. Weber, Ph.d.",N/A,2017-07-08,"Many desire an emotionally intimate relationship and yet react to the prospect by pulling away. They do this to obscure their true selves for one of two reasons. They fear rejection if they are to honestly reveal themselves to another. Or, it may be because of a foreboding sense that their identity will be taken away if they truly open up to another. In either case, by pulling away they make themselves seem aloof and guarded and that makes rejection all the more likely. When it happens, their conviction that intimacy is not possible for them is reinforced. For those caught in this web or for those who know people who are, author Jill P. Weber, PhD, a clinical psychologist, explains why a capacity for intimacy is not a fixed quality, but a skill to be developed and refined. This book is the fourth in her Relationship Formula Workbook series. Weber shows how with practice it is possible to foster fulfilling relationships not only with romantic partners, but with family members, friends and coworkers. She draws on years of experience in her practice to layout doable strategies that fundamentally change an individual's ability to find genuine emotional rapport.",,84,N/A,0,en

Handbook of Marital Therapy: A Positive Approach to Helping Troubled Relationships,"Robert P. Liberman, Eugene G. Wheeler, Louis A.J.M. de Visser, Julie Kuehnel, Timothy Kuehnel",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-11-21,"In the treatment of marital problems, behaviorally oriented and com munication oriented approaches have been in conflict and seen as con trasting and unlikely bed partners. Many therapists, focusing on com munication skills, have felt that behaviorists were too structured and uncaring; on the other hand, behaviorists have considered humanistic therapists as being ""touchy-feely,"" vague, and unfocused. However, in the Handbook of Marital Therapy, Liberman, Wheeler, de Visser, and the Kuehnels have wedded these two potent approaches into an inte grated framework that makes them loving bed partners. With over a decade of experience in applying behaviorally ori ented treatment to couples, Liberman and his co-authors have devel oped an educational model that focuses on teaching specific commu nication skills to couples. The communication skills they describe have been used extensively in all types of marital therapy, regardless of the therapist's theoretical orientation. The unique contribution of this book is that the authors provide a step-by-step approach to teaching these communication skills within a behavioral framework. Each chapter guides the therapist through the many issues and problems confronting him or her as a change agent. This highly readable book is enhanced by a liberal use of case exam ples. Emphasis is given to homework and structured sessions that focus on increasing specific communication skills in a sequential manner. The advantages of working with couples in a group setting are dis cussed, and concrete suggestions on how to manage these groups are clearly presented.",Psychology,267,N/A,0,en

Dyadic Coping: A Collection of Recent Studies,"Guy Bodenmann, Mariana K. Falconier, Ashley K. Randall",Frontiers Media SA,2019-09-25,"Dyadic coping is a concept that has reached increased attention in psychological science within the last 20 years. Dyadic coping conceptualizes the way couples cope with stress together in sharing appraisals of demands, planning together how to deal with the stressors and engage in supportive or joint dyadic coping. Among the different theories of dyadic coping, the Systemic Transactional Model (STM; Bodenmann, 1995, 1997, 2005) has been applied to many studies on couples’ coping with stress. While a recent meta-analysis shows that dyadiccoping is a robust and consistent predictor of relationship satisfaction and couple’s functioning in community samples, some studies also reveal the significance of dyadic coping in dealing with psychological disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety) or severe illness (e.g., cancer, diabetes, COPD, etc.). Researchers all over the world build their research on this or other concepts of dyadic coping and many typically use the Dyadic Coping Inventory (DCI) for assessing dyadic coping. So far, research on dyadic coping has been systematically presented in two books, one written by Revenson, Kayser, & Bodenmann in 2005, focussing on emerging perspectives on couples’ coping, the other by Falconier, Randall, & Bodenmann more recently in 2016, addressing intercultural aspects of dyadic coping in African, American, Asian and European couples.

Everything I Know About Love,Dolly Alderton,Penguin UK,2018-02-01,"TIKTOK BOOK AWARDS WINNER 2023 “Nearly everything I know about love, I've learnt from my long-term friendships with women.” I know that love can be loud and jubilant. It can be dancing in the swampy mud and the pouring rain at a festival and shouting “YOU ARE AMAZING” over the band. It’s laughing until you wheeze. It’s walking along the street together on a Saturday night and feeling an entire city is yours. I also know that love is a pretty quiet thing. It’s lying on the sofa together drinking coffee, talking about where you’re going to go that morning to drink more coffee. It’s folding down pages of books you think they’d find interesting. I know that love happens under the splendour of fireworks and sunsets, but also happens when you’re lying on blow-up airbeds in a childhood bedroom, sitting in A&E or in the queue for a passport. Everything I Know About Love is a celebration of our female friendships, of our messy years, and of growing up together. Glittering with wit, heart, and humour, it’s a book to share with every woman you’ve ever been lucky enough to call a friend. ***** WHAT READERS ARE SAYING: ‘A book every girl in her 20s needs to read’ ‘I’ll never stop recommending this book’ ‘This is my comfort book!

"Sex, Love and Money in Cambodia",Heidi Hoefinger,Routledge,2013-07-04,"Dealing with the complex and discomforting ‘grey ‘area where sex, love and money collide, this book highlights the general materiality of everyday sex that takes place in all relationships. In doing so, it draws attention to and destigmatizes the transactional elements within many ‘normative’ partnerships – be they transnational, inter-ethnic or otherwise. Focusing on Cambodia, and on a subculture of young women employed in the tourist bar scene referred to as ‘professional girlfriends’, the book shows that the resulting transnational relationships between Cambodian women and their foreign partners are complex and multi-layered. It argues that the sex-for-cash prostitution framework is no longer an appropriate model of analysis. Instead, a new vocabulary of ‘professional girlfriends’ and ‘transactional sex’ is used, with which the nuanced complexities of these transnational partnerships are analysed. Interdisciplinary in nature, the book inspires new understandings of gender, power, sex, love, desire, political economy and materiality within everyday relationships around the globe. It is a useful contribution for students and scholars of Anthropology, Sociology, Southeast Asian Studies, Gender and Sexuality Studies, and Cultural Studies.",Social Science,260,N/A,0,en

NEUROEPISTEMOLOGY,YURI ZAMBRANO,Lulu.com,2012-10-01,"The Epistemologic study of the mind-mind problem (Mind-brain / ToM) and conscious cognition, can apply the ""Theory of Neuronal Epistemology"" (TNE) based on backpropagation of specific neural networks. For operating in functionalist terms and in a cognitive way, the TNE is supported by a connectionist model holding the algorithmic equation that includes probabilistic features, spatiotemporal units, computational components and fractal-geometric-tensorial variables. The main arguments of the TNE deal with the study of diverse neuronal lineages and their sophisticated specialization (Neuronalism and the ""neurons knowledge""). A second argument is the ""Protein Epistem"" determining this specialization degree, and the third is associated with connectionism. The essential unit of the TNE formula is the Fractal Coincidental Pattern (FCP) used for evaluating the multiple-vectorial probabilities of this ""small world"" during the quantal release of neurotransmitters.",Science,694,5,1,en
From There to Here,William E. Powell,Strategic Book Publishing,2011-07-01,"The novel is a semi-fictionalized roman a clef in which the author describes in great detail, and through the eyes of others, his protagonist, Peter Wyse. The almost 70-year storyline begins in 1937 and ends in 2005, with the scene shifting from New York to Oklahoma, on to West Virginia, and then to Houston and Harris County, Texas. Peter's story starts with his childhood (and a brutal rape), continuing through his school years and into college, where he meets his true love, Sarah. Letters between the lovers tell of their courtship and engagement. An unintended pregnancy threatens Peter's medical school career, while severe depression challenges his marriage and results in a suicide attempt. Along the way, Peter and Sarah raise four children and share many happy memories. Each chapter tells a fascinating story, until deceit, betrayal, and infidelity culminate in divorce. A thorough vetting of the legal process adds fury to the situation. The tragic deaths of Peter's two medical partners, life post-divorce and through remarriage are all explored. From There to Here is not all serious, however. As in life, there is humor, pathos and discovery, and the book ends with a truly surprising conclusion.",Fiction,427,N/A,0,en
Interactive Qualitative Analysis,"Norvell Northcutt, Danny McCoy",SAGE Publications,2024-05-21,"""The authors take a ′user friendly′ systematic approach to qualitative research, something that has long been missing in the field. I consider this to be a groundbreaking work, one that will hit home with students and faculty alike."" —Justin M. Laird, SUNY Brockport ""This book does an excellent job of integrating design, methods, and analysis. . . . The real beauty of the book is that it overturns many of the age-old assumptions about how ′good′ research should be done. . . . The authors′ pleasant and refreshing style, coupled with subtle irreverence for outmoded or constraining paradigms of inquiry, makes for highly enjoyable reading."" —Roger Rennekamp, University of Kentucky Interactive Qualitative Analysis: A Systems Method for Qualitative Research aims to help students unscramble the mysteries of qualitative data collection, coding, and analysis by showing how to use a systematic, qualitative technique: interactive qualitative analysis. The authors synthesize ideas from grounded theory, path and factor analysis, quality management theory, Foucauldian concepts of power and knowledge, and systems theory. A dialectical revision of Guba and Lincoln′s theory of rigor is offered which, combined with systems theory, offers new insights into the meaning of reliability and validity in qualitative research. Unlike many theoretical works, Interactive Qualitative Analysis develops the theory into a complete and transparent set of protocols for research design, observation, analysis, and interpretation. The construction, interpretation, and comparison of recursive systems of meaning, or mindmaps, is articulated in detail. The book is organized so that those not interested in theory can skip to the applied chapters. Case studies illustrate each stage of the research process with an emphasis on interpretation. The combination of theory and practice perfectly suits the book for advanced qualitative research courses across the social sciences, especially those that address epistemology. Professional researchers and evaluators will also find this an invaluable guide to qualitative analysis. Key Features * Advice boxes alert readers to potential pitfalls in qualitative research, and offer the appropriate steps to take in order to avoid such issues * Sidebars provide clear and concise snapshots of the theoretical basis for research decisions * Interactive CD contains sample data and exercises to provide students with effective practice as well as reinforce and clarify principles explained in the book * Provides a ""road map"" to using interactive qualitative inquiry in dissertation writing",Social Science,473,N/A,0,en

Encyclopedia of Consciousness,William P. Banks,Academic Press,2009-03-26,"Consciousness has long been a subject of interest in philosophy and religion but only relatively recently has it become subject to scientific investigation. Now, more than ever before, we are beginning to understand this mental state. Developmental psychologists understand when we first develop a sense of self; neuropsychologists see which parts of the brain activate when we think about ourselves and which parts of the brain control that awareness. Cognitive scientists have mapped the circuitry that allows machines to have some form of self awareness, and neuroscientists investigate similar circuitry in the human brain. Research that once was separate inquiries in discreet disciplines is converging. List serves and small conferences focused on consciousness are proliferating. New journals have emerged in this field. A huge number of monographs and edited treatises have recently been published on consciousness, but there is no recognized entry point to the field, no comprehensive summary. This encyclopedia is that reference. Organized alphabetically by topic, coverage encompasses a summary of major research and scientific thought regarding the nature of consciousness, the neural circuitry involved, how the brain, body, and world interact, and our understanding of subjective states. The work includes contributions covering neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, and artificial intelligence to provide a comprehensive backdrop to recent and ongoing investigations into the nature of conscious experience from a philosophical, psychological, and biological perspective.",Psychology,1034,N/A,0,en

The Good Muslim,Mona Siddiqui,Cambridge University Press,2012-06-11,"In this thought-provoking book, Mona Siddiqui reflects upon key themes in Islamic law and theology. These themes, which range through discussions about friendship, divorce, drunkenness, love, slavery, and ritual slaughter, offer fascinating insights into Islamic ethics, and the way in which arguments developed in medieval juristic discourse. These pre-modern religious works contained a richness of thought, hesitation and speculation on a wide range of topics, which were socially relevant but also presented intellectual challenges to the scholars for whom God's revelation could be understood in diverse ways. These subjects remain relevant today, for practicing Muslims and scholars of Islamic law and religious studies.

These are important attributes for a book, which charts the authors own journey through the classical texts, and reflects upon how the principles expounded there have guided her own thinking and impacted her teaching and research.",History,241,N/A,0,en

Fuzzy Information Retrieval,"Donald H. Kraft, Erin Colvin",Springer Nature,2022-06-01,"Information retrieval used to mean looking through thousands of strings of texts to find words or symbols that matched a user's query. Today, there are many models that help index and search more effectively so retrieval takes a lot less time. Information retrieval (IR) is often seen as a subfield of computer science and shares some modeling, applications, storage applications and techniques, as do other disciplines like artificial intelligence, database management, and parallel computing. This book introduces the topic of IR and how it differs from other computer science disciplines. A discussion of the history of modern IR is briefly presented, and the notation of IR as used in this book is defined. The complex notation of relevance is discussed. Some applications of IR is noted as well since IR has many practical uses today. Using information retrieval with fuzzy logic to search for software terms can help find software components and ultimately help increase the reuse of software. This is just one practical application of IR that is covered in this book. Some of the classical models of IR is presented as a contrast to extending the Boolean model. This includes a brief mention of the source of weights for the various models. In a typical retrieval environment, answers are either yes or no, i.e., on or off. On the other hand, fuzzy logic can bring in a ""degree of"" match, vs. a crisp, i.e., strict match. This, too, is looked at and explored in much detail, showing how it can be applied to information retrieval. Fuzzy logic is often times considered a soft computing application and this book explores how IR with fuzzy logic and its membership functions as weights can help indexing, querying, and matching. Since fuzzy set theory and logic is explored in IR systems, the explanation of where the fuzz is ensues. The concept of relevance feedback, including pseudorelevance feedback is explored for the various models of IR. For the extended Boolean model, the use of genetic algorithms for relevance feedback is delved into. The concept of query expansion is explored using rough set theory. Various term relationships is modeled and presented, and the model extended for fuzzy retrieval. An example using the UMLS terms is also presented. The model is also extended for term relationships beyond synonyms. Finally, this book looks at clustering, both crisp and fuzzy, to see how that can improve retrieval performance. An example is presented to illustrate the concepts.",Computers,63,N/A,0,en

Builders,Darren Thiel,Routledge,2013-05-07,"Building workers constitute between five and ten per cent of the total labour market in almost every country of the world. They construct, repair and maintain the vital physical infrastructure of our societies, and we rely upon and trust their achievements every day. Yet we know surprisingly little about builders, their cultures, the organization of their work or the business relations that constitute their industry. This book, based on one-year’s participant observation on a London construction site, redresses this gap in our knowledge by taking a close-up look at a section of building workers and businessmen. By examining the organizational features of the building project and describing the skill, sweat, malingering, humour and humanity of the building workers, Thiel illustrates how the builders were mostly autonomous from formal managerial control, regulating their own outputs and labour markets. This meant that the men’s ethnic, class and gender-bound cultural activities fundamentally underpinned the organization of their work and the broader construction economy, and thereby highlights the continuing centrality of class-bound culture and social stratification in a post-industrial, late modern world. Thiel outlines the on-going connections and intersections between economy, state, class and culture, ultimately showing how these factors interrelated to produce the building industry, its builders, and its buildings. Based predominately on cultural and economic sociology, this book will also be of interest to those working in the fields of gender and organizational studies; social class and inequality; migration and ethnicity; urban studies; and social identities.",Social Science,221,N/A,0,en
Advances in Spatial and Temporal Databases,"Christian S. Jensen, Markus Schneider, Bernhard Seeger, Vassilis J. Tsotras",Springer,2003-05-15,"The Seventh International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases (SSTD 2001), held in Redondo Beach, CA, USA, July 12{15, 2001, brought together leading researchers and developers in the area of spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal databases to discuss the state of the art in spatial and temporal data management and applications, and to understand the challenges and - search directions in the advancing area of data management for moving objects. The symposium served as a forum for disseminating research in spatial and temporal data management, and for maximizing the interchange of knowledge among researchers from the established spatial and temporal database com- nities. The exchange of research ideas and results not only contributes to the academic arena, but also bene ts the user and commercial communities. SSTD 2001 was the seventh in the series of symposia that started in Santa Barbara a dozen years ago and has since been held every two years, in Zurich, Singapore, Portland (Maine), Berlin, and Hong Kong. By 1999, the series had become well established as the premier international forum devoted solely to spatial database management, and it was decided to extend the scope of the series to also cover temporal database management. This extended scope was chosen due, in part, to the increasing importance of research that considers spatial and temporal aspects jointly.",Computers,532,N/A,0,en
"Love, Reason and Morality","Katrien Schaubroeck, Esther Kroeker",Routledge,2016-07-28,"This book brings together new essays that explore the connection between love and reasons. The observation that considerations of love carry significant weight in the deliberative process opens up new perspectives in the classic discussion about practical reasons, and gives rise to many interesting questions about the nature of love’s reasons, about their source and legitimacy, about their relation to moral and epistemic reasons, and about the extent to which love is sensitive to reasons. The contributors to this volume orient questions related to love within the broader context of the contemporary discussion on practical reasons, and move forward the conversation about the normative dimensions of love. Love, Reason and Morality will be of interest to philosophers working on issues of normativity, meta-ethics and moral psychology, and especially those interested in the source of practical reasons and the role of attachments in practical deliberation.",Philosophy,215,N/A,0,en

Social entropy theory, using Shannon's H and the entropy concept, avoids the common (and often artificial) separation of theory and method in sociology. The hallmark of the volume is integration, as seen in the author's interdisciplinary discussions of equilibrium, entropy, and homeostasis. Unique features of the book are the introduction of the three-level model of social measurement, the theory of allocation, the concepts of global-mutable-immutable, discussion of order and power, and a large set of testable hypotheses.",Social Science,333,N/A,0,en

From Psychoanalytic Narrative to Empirical Single Case Research,"Horst Kächele, Joseph Schachter, Helmut Thomä",Taylor & Francis,2011-05-20,"Recognition of the need for empirical research and interest in its findings are growing in psychoanalysis. Many psychoanalysts now acknowledge that research is imperative to try to deal with the factors propelling the diminution in status and prestige of the discipline, as well as the number of patients in intensive psychoanalytic treatment. In addition, there is increased pressure to expose and acquaint candidates with analytic research in the course of their education. From Psychoanalytic Narrative to Empirical Single Case Research revivifies the experimental potential of psychoanalysis by focusing a number of structured research methods on a single case study. Drs. Kächele, Schachter, and Thomä, in tandem with the Ulm Psychoanalytic Process Research Study Group, bring their formidable tools and knowledge to bear on Amalia X, a former patient of Dr. Thomä’s, whose case history is well-documented, preserved and available for formal empirical study. After providing an intensive review of the problematic aspects of clinical psychoanalytic research and an exegesis on the use of the case study itself, the specific case history of Amalia X, which dominates and centers the remainder of the book, is thoroughly examined. The following two chapters – utilizing clinical and linguistic models, respectively – deconstruct Amalia’s psychopathology along a variety of methodological axes in an effort not only to uncover the roots of her presenting symptoms, but also to reify and validate the strange bedfellows of psychoanalysis and empiricism in general. The book would be incomplete, however, without its final chapter, which provides suggestions and insights into the clinical applications and implications of their combined research.",Philosophy,497,N/A,0,en

Love's Labor's Lost,"William Shakespeare, Paul Werstine",Simon and Schuster,2011-08-23,"At first glance, Shakespeare’s early comedy Love’s Labor’s Lost simply entertains and amuses. Four young men (one of them a king) withdraw from the world for three years, taking an oath that they will have nothing to do with women. The King of Navarre soon learns, however, that the Princess of France and her ladies are about to arrive. Although he lodges them outside of his court, all four men fall in love with the ladies, abandoning their oaths and setting out to win their hands. The laughter triggered by this story is augmented by subplots involving a braggart soldier, a clever page, illiterate servants, a parson, a schoolmaster, and a constable so dull that he is named Dull. Letters and poems are misdelivered, confessions are overheard, entertainments are presented, and language is played with, and misused, by the ignorant and learned alike. At a deeper level, Love’s Labor’s Lost also teases the mind. The men begin with the premise that women either are seductresses or goddesses. The play soon makes it clear, however, that the reality of male-female relations is different. That women are not identical to men’s images of them is a common theme in Shakespeare’s plays. In Love’s Labor’s Lost it receives one of its most pressing examinations. The authoritative edition of Love’s Labor’s Lost from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes: -The exact text of the printed book for easy cross-reference -Hundreds of hypertext links for instant navigation -Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play -Full explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play -Scene-by-scene plot summaries -A key to the play’s famous lines and phrases -An introduction to reading Shakespeare’s language -An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play -Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library’s vast holdings of rare books -An annotated guide to further reading Essay by William C.

Cortese offers critical analyses of ethnicity and moral judgment, combining two controversial and central areas: morality and race relations. Critiquing the cognitive-developmental model, Cortese examines social class, gender, and ethnic differences in moral judgment and concludes that moral judgment reflects the structure of social relations, not the structure of human cognition.

All About Love,bell hooks,HarperCollins,2018-01-30,"A New York Times bestseller and enduring classic, All About Love is the acclaimed first volume in feminist icon bell hooks' ""Love Song to the Nation"" trilogy. All About Love reveals what causes a polarized society, and how to heal the divisions that cause suffering. Here is the truth about love, and inspiration to help us instill caring, compassion, and strength in our homes, schools, and workplaces. “The word ‘love’ is most often defined as a noun, yet we would all love better if we used it as a verb,” writes bell hooks as she comes out fighting and on fire in All About Love. Here, at her most provocative and intensely personal, renowned scholar, cultural critic and feminist bell hooks offers a proactive new ethic for a society bereft with lovelessness--not the lack of romance, but the lack of care, compassion, and unity. People are divided, she declares, by society’s failure to provide a model for learning to love. As bell hooks uses her incisive mind to explore the question “What is love?” her answers strike at both the mind and heart. Razing the cultural paradigm that the ideal love is infused with sex and desire, she provides a new path to love that is sacred, redemptive, and healing for individuals and for a nation. The Utne Reader declared bell hooks one of the “100 Visionaries Who Can Change Your Life.” All About Love is a powerful, timely affirmation of just how profoundly her revelations can change hearts and minds for the better.",Family & Relationships,272,N/A,0,en

Deeper Dating,Ken Page,Shambhala Publications,2014-12-30,"With exercises, practical tools, and inspiring stories, Deeper Dating will guide you on a journey to find the love—and personal fulfillment—you long for Lose weight. Be confident. Keep your partner guessing. At the end of the day, this soulless approach to dating doesn't lead to love but to insecurity and desperation. In Deeper Dating, Ken Page presents a new path to love. Out of his decades of work as a psychotherapist and his own personal struggle to find love, Page teaches that the greatest magnet for real love lies in our ""Core Gifts""—the places of our deepest sensitivity, longing, and passion. Deeper Dating guides us to discover our own Core Gifts and empowers us to express them with courage, generosity, and discrimination in our dating life. When we do this, something miraculous happens: we begin to attract people who love us for who we are, we become more self-assured and emotionally available, and we lose our taste for relationships that chip away at our self-esteem. Without losing a pound, changing our hairstyle, or buying a single new accessory, we find healthy love moving closer . . .

Set in 1954, Towles uses the story of two brothers to show that our personal journeys are never as linear or predictable as we might hope.” —Bill Gates “A real joyride . . . elegantly constructed and compulsively readable.” —NPR The bestselling author of A Gentleman in Moscow and Rules of Civility and master of absorbing, sophisticated fiction returns with a stylish and propulsive novel set in 1950s America In June, 1954, eighteen-year-old Emmett Watson is driven home to Nebraska by the warden of the juvenile work farm where he has just served fifteen months for involuntary manslaughter. His mother long gone, his father recently deceased, and the family farm foreclosed upon by the bank, Emmett's intention is to pick up his eight-year-old brother, Billy, and head to California where they can start their lives anew. But when the warden drives away, Emmett discovers that two friends from the work farm have hidden themselves in the trunk of the warden's car. Together, they have hatched an altogether different plan for Emmett's future, one that will take them all on a fateful journey in the opposite direction—to the City of New York. Spanning just ten days and told from multiple points of view, Towles's third novel will satisfy fans of his multi-layered literary styling while providing them an array of new and richly imagined settings, characters, and themes. “Once again, I was wowed by Towles’s writing—especially because The Lincoln Highway is so different from A Gentleman in Moscow in terms of setting, plot, and themes. Towles is not a one-trick pony. Like all the best storytellers, he has range. He takes inspiration from famous hero’s journeys, including The Iliad, The Odyssey, Hamlet, Huckleberry Finn, and Of Mice and Men. He seems to be saying that our personal journeys are never as linear or predictable as an interstate highway. But, he suggests, when something (or someone) tries to steer us off course, it is possible to take the wheel.” – Bill Gates",Fiction,593,N/A,0,en

It's Not You,Sara Eckel,Penguin,2014-01-07,"“Why am I still single?” If you’re single and searching, there’s no end to other people’s explanations, excuses, and criticism explaining why you haven’t found a partner: “You’re too picky. Just find a good-enough guy and you’ll be fine.” “You’re too desperate. If men think you need them, they’ll run scared.” “You’re too independent. Smart, ambitious women always have a harder time finding mates.” “You have low self-esteem. You can’t love someone else until you’ve learned to love yourself.” “You’re too needy. You can’t be happy in a relationship until you’ve learned to be happy on your own.” Based on one of the most popular Modern Love columns of the last decade, Sara Eckel’s It’s Not You challenges these myths, encouraging singletons to stop picking apart their personalities and to start tapping into their own wisdom about who and what is right for them. Supported by the latest psychological and sociological research, as well as interviews with people who have experienced longtime singledom, Eckel creates a strong and empowering argument to understand and accept that there’s no one reason why you’re single—you just are.",Family & Relationships,210,N/A,0,en

Christian Dating: the Q & a Book,Rita Henderson,WestBow Press,2014-11-18,"When you reached the proper dating age, did your parents discuss dating relationships with you, or like most of us, are you still trying to figure it out on your own? This is not surprising news. Research shows that most people date without a clue of what to do, or to expect in a relationship. However, I believe that Christian singles must understand how to navigate the dating waters. Christian Dating: The Q & A Book shows how two people can cultivate a healthy and loving Christian bond, at any age. To help singles choose better-suited companions, the book includes a checklist of the most desirable traits of a Christian mate. Christian Dating: The Q & A Book explores a biblical view of dating. It inspires singles to consider whether current relationship attitudes and values are in line with godly principles. Accordingly, Christians are encouraged to evaluate their own thinking and actions. You will find straightforward, Scripture-based answers to 250 difficult relationship questions like: How can I determine if my partner is relationship worthy? How do I avoid rushing into love because I am lonely? Are there ways to know if my partner loves me? How should Christian women present themselves? How do I recover from heartbreak? Do Christian men love as deeply as Christian women? How do I move beyond the bad relationships? Are independent women problematic in Christian relationships? What type of woman should a Christian man avoid? How does a Christian woman earn a Christian mans respect? Christian Dating: The Q & A Book establishes a practical link between present day dating concerns and the timeless relevance of Gods Word. It validates that biblical Scripture is sufficient for teaching us to resolve our personal relationship challenges.",Self-Help,143,N/A,0,en

Liv Varanakis doesn’t have a lot of fond memories of her father, which makes sense—he fled to Greece when she was only eight. What Liv does remember, though, is their shared love for Greek myths and the lost city of Atlantis. So when Liv suddenly receives a postcard from her father explaining that National Geographic is funding a documentary about his theories on Atlantis—and will she fly out to Greece and help?—Liv jumps at the opportunity. But when she arrives to gorgeous Santorini, things are a little…awkward. There are so many questions, so many emotions that flood to the surface after seeing her father for the first time in years. And yet Liv doesn’t want their past to get in the way of a possible reconciliation. She also definitely doesn’t want Theo—her father’s charismatic so-called “protégé”—to witness her struggle. And that means diving into all that Santorini has to offer—the beautiful sunsets, the turquoise water, the hidden caves, and the delicious cuisine. But not everything on the Greek island is as perfect as it seems. Because as Liv slowly begins to discover, her father may not have invited her to Greece for Atlantis, but for something much more important.",Young Adult Fiction,512,N/A,0,en
The Little Prince,Antoine de Saint-Exupéry,Seven Books,2024-11-08,"Beschreibung I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating it to a grown-up. I have a serious reason: he is the best friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up understands everything, even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs cheering up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew. All grown-ups were once children-- although few of them remember it. And so I correct my dedication: To Leon Werth when he was a little boy Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing. In the book it said: ""Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it.

Spatial Relationships Between Two Georeferenced Variables,"Ronny Vallejos, Felipe Osorio, Moreno Bevilacqua",Springer Nature,2020-09-22,"This book offers essential, systematic information on the assessment of the spatial association between two processes from a statistical standpoint. Divided into eight chapters, the book begins with preliminary concepts, mainly concerning spatial statistics. The following seven chapters focus on the methodologies needed to assess the correlation between two or more processes; from theory introduced 35 years ago, to techniques that have only recently been published. Furthermore, each chapter contains a section on R computations to explore how the methodology works with real data. References and a list of exercises are included at the end of each chapter. The assessment of the correlation between two spatial processes has been tackled from several different perspectives in a variety of applications fields. In particular, the problem of testing for the existence of spatial association between two georeferenced variables is relevant for posterior modeling and inference. One evident application in this context is the quantification of the spatial correlation between two images (processes defined on a rectangular grid in a two-dimensional space). From a statistical perspective, this problem can be handled via hypothesis testing, or by using extensions of the correlation coefficient. In an image-processing framework, these extensions can also be used to define similarity indices between images.",Mathematics,200,N/A,0,en
Knowing and Not Knowing in Intimate Relationships,"Paul C. Rosenblatt, Elizabeth Wieling",Cambridge University Press,2013-07-25,"In the extensive literature on couples and intimacy, little has been written about knowing and not knowing as people experience and understand them. Based on intensive interviews with thirty-seven adults, this book shows that knowing and not knowing are central to couple relationships. They are entangled in love, sexual attraction, trust, commitment, caring, empathy, decision making, conflict, and many other aspects of couple life. Often the entanglement is paradoxical. For example, many interviewees revealed that they hungered to be known and yet kept secrets from their partner. Many described working hard at knowing their partner well, and yet there were also things about their partner and their partner's past that they wanted not to know.

The Philosophy of Friendship,M. Vernon,Springer,2005-09-08,"In this new accessible philosophy of friendship, Mark Vernon links the resources of the philosophical tradition with numerous illustrations from modern culture to ask what friendship is, how it relates to sex, work, politics and spirituality. Unusually, he argues that Plato and Nietzsche, as much as Aristotle and Aelred, should be put centre stage. Their penetrating and occasionally tough insights are invaluable if friendship is to be a full, not merely sentimental, way of life for today.",Philosophy,189,N/A,0,en

Beyond Friendship and Eros,"John R. Scudder Jr., Anne H. Bishop",State University of New York Press,2001-07-26,"Culminating a twenty-year personal and scholarly quest, the authors explore the phenomenon of loving relationships (minus the sexual attraction) between men and women. They articulate these relationships as dialogical love in which partners respond to each other's presence personally rather than categorically as friend or lover. In a society where relationships of dialogical love are neither articulated and named nor recognized as acceptable ways of being, they are usually mistaken as affairs or regarded as ""just"" friend relationships. Since these relationships are spontaneous, free, and open, their meaning is disclosed through examples rather than by traditional definition. Throughout the book, the authors share their own personal relationship, similar relationships of those they interviewed, and relationships from literature and popular movies. Further illuminating interpretations of friendship and love are excerpts from C. S. Lewis, Rollo May, Caroline Simon, and Robert Solomon. Personal relationships are explicated by the work of Martin Buber, John Macmurray, and Alfred Schutz.",Social Science,144,N/A,0,en

There is the semantic dimension (including object orientation, data deduction and extended knowledge representation schemes), there is improved systems integration, and there are new tools. All these extensions aim to provide semantically richer and better engineered information systems that allow for more adequate and complete representations and thus extend the effective use of database technology to a wider class of applications. Database researchers and developers, whether they are committed to application or to system construction, are convinced that next-generation information system technology will be heavily determined by a handful of new concepts that they have to understand and work out in detail now. This volume concentrates on the following topics: - Extended data types and data models, database programming languages; - Rule-based data deduction, expert systems, knowledge bases; - Object orientation and semantic data modelling; - DB application development, methodologies and tools; - Interface technology, parallelism, interoperability, ...; - New database applications.",Business & Economics,468,5,1,en
The Prudence of Love,Eric J. Silverman,Rowman & Littlefield,2009-12-02,"The Prudence of Love: How Possessing the Virtue of Love Benefits the Lover focuses upon the intersection of philosophical, theological, and psychological issues concerning love. Eric Silverman advocates an account of the virtue of love derived from Thomas Aquinas's account of charity and makes three claims concerning love's effect on a person's happiness. First, he argues that there are at least five distinct ways that possessing the virtue of love contributes to the lover's happiness. Surprisingly, only one of these benefits is primarily relational, while the other benefits are largely psychological. Second, Silverman argues that the combination of love's benefits typically increases the lover's overall level of happiness. Finally, he argues that possessing a loving disposition is a more reliable strategy for increasing one's overall happiness than possessing an unloving disposition. Throughout The Prudence of Love, Silverman demonstrates that love's benefits are identifiable according to all four major views of happiness.",Philosophy,223,N/A,0,en

Corporate Social Capital and Liability,"Roger Th.A.J. Leenders, Shaul M. Gabbay",Springer Science & Business Media,1999-07-31,"What enables some organizations to routinely perform better than others? Conversely, what makes some firms consistently perform worse than their competitors? Within a single corporation, what enables some teams or individual firm members to outperform their counterparts? Through the concept of social capital, this book addresses these questions by studying the effects of relationship networks on the ability of corporate players (firms and their members) to attain their professional goals. The idea of social capital has become one of the premier approaches to studying networks in the context of organizations but the literature still lacks a conceptual paradigm that connects the various approaches, definitions and measure of social capital into an integrated analytical model. By explicitly connecting social networks to the goals of corporate players, this book provides a unifying framework to the study of social capital in an organizational context. In this volume `social capital' is defined as the resources that accrue to an actor through his or her social relationships and that aid in the attainment of goals. The book introduces the new notion of `social liability' as a framework to analyze the negative effects social networks can have on the attainment of goals by firms and/or their members. Corporate Social Capital and Liability thus presents a new way to tie together findings and approaches in the literature by explicitly addressing the distinction between networks and outcomes, the distinction between networks at the level of firms and networks at the level of individuals, and the distinction between positive outcomes of social structure (social capital) and negative outcomes (social liability). The book's contributors are forty-six acclaimed scholars from around the world with backgrounds in management, business and sociology. Together, they describe how social relationships within and between firms positively affect the ability of corporations to achieve fruitful alliances; gain access to information, resources, knowledge and financial capital; and recruit qualified personnel. The book makes an explicit distinction between networks at the level of firms and networks at the level of individuals. The outcomes of networks are also considered at these different analytical levels by addressing such questions as: how do social relationships between firms assist firms and individuals in the attainment of their goals? How do these relationships obstruct goals? What is the effect of networks between individuals (within and between firms) on the performance of these individuals and the firms they work for? Can networks be managed to yield social capital rather than social liability? The unifying framework of social capital and social liability is helpful in studying business enterprises, and also useful in other disciplines which analyze social networks and organizations, such as community studies, economics, and political science.",Business & Economics,586,5,1,en

Six Lenses,Ramabadran Gopalakrishnan,Rupa Publications India,2015-12-14,"Almost with a touch of philosophy, yet firmly grounded in the reality of business and national affairs, the author argues thatthere is no reality, only perceptions of reality. Perceptions influence our thoughts and actions and these, in turn, are influenced by thelenses through which we see the world. There are six such lenses: purpose, authenticity, courage, trust, luck and fulfilment. R. Gopalakrishnan uses, as examples, the lives ofordinary people' to illustrate his view. By rotating the lenses, Gopal attempts to understand what success in career and life really means. While biographies of celebrities are inspiring to read, they are often read like dramatic fairy tales-out of the scope of an average person. But in Six Lenses, Gopalakrishnan narrates the stories of PLUs (people like us)-as he likes to call them-from business and society, whom he has known during his illustrious career.

While the parent-child attachment relationship is of critical importance for the child in the early years of life, the parent-child relationship continues to be a source of great importance over the course of the individual’s life span for both the child and the parent.

Applied Econometrics with R,"Christian Kleiber, Achim Zeileis",Springer Science & Business Media,2008-12-10,"R is a language and environment for data analysis and graphics. It may be considered an implementation of S, an award-winning language initially - veloped at Bell Laboratories since the late 1970s. The R project was initiated by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, in the early 1990s, and has been developed by an international team since mid-1997. Historically, econometricians have favored other computing environments, some of which have fallen by the wayside, and also a variety of packages with canned routines. We believe that R has great potential in econometrics, both for research and for teaching. There are at least three reasons for this: (1) R is mostly platform independent and runs on Microsoft Windows, the Mac family of operating systems, and various ?avors of Unix/Linux, and also on some more exotic platforms. (2) R is free software that can be downloaded and installed at no cost from a family of mirror sites around the globe, the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN); hence students can easily install it on their own machines. (3) R is open-source software, so that the full source code is available and can be inspected to understand what it really does, learn from it, and modify and extend it. We also like to think that platform independence and the open-source philosophy make R an ideal environment for reproducible econometric research.",Business & Economics,229,5,1,en

Animal Intimacies,Radhika Govindrajan,University of Chicago Press,2018-05-29,"“A delightful read [and] an important addition to human-animal relations studies.” —Anthropology Matters What does it mean to live and die in relation to other animals? Animal Intimacies posits this central question alongside the intimate—and intense—moments of care, kinship, violence, politics, indifference, and desire that occur between human and non-human animals. Built on extensive ethnographic fieldwork in the mountain villages of India’s Central Himalayas, Radhika Govindrajan’s book explores the number of ways that human and animal interact to cultivate relationships as interconnected, related beings. Whether it is through the study of the affect and ethics of ritual animal sacrifice, analysis of the right-wing political project of cow-protection, or examination of villagers’ talk about bears who abduct women and have sex with them, Govindrajan illustrates that multispecies relatedness relies on both difference and ineffable affinity between animals. Animal Intimacies breaks substantial new ground in animal studies, and Govindrajan’s detailed portrait of the social, political and religious life of the region will be of interest to cultural anthropologists and scholars of South Asia as well. “Immerses us in passionate case studies on the multiple relationships between Kumaoni villagers and animals in Uttarakhand.” —European Bulletin of Himalayan Research “A memorable and innovative ethnography.” —Piers Locke, University of Canterbury",Social Science,235,N/A,0,en

"Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus",John Gray,Zondervan,2009-10-13,"The Phenomenal #1 New York Times Bestseller In his classic guide to understanding the opposite sex, Dr. John Gray, provides a practical and proven way for men and women to improve their communication and relationships by acknowledging the differences between them. Once upon a time Martians and Venusians met, fell in love, and had happy relationships together because they respected and accepted their differences. Then they came to Earth and amnesia set in: they forgot they were from different planets. Based on years of successful counseling of couples and individuals, Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus has helped millions of couples transform their relationships. Now viewed as a modern classic, this timeless book has helped men and women realize how different they can be in their communication styles, their emotional needs, and their modes of behavior, and offers the secrets of communicating without conflicts, allowing couples to give intimacy every chance to grow.",Family & Relationships,370,5,1,en
Loneliness: Human Nature and the Need for Social Connection,"John T. Cacioppo, William Patrick",W. W. Norton & Company,2008-08-17,"Based on groundbreaking research showing that prolonged loneliness can be as harmful to your health as smoking, Loneliness is “one of the most important books about the human condition to appear in a decade” (Daniel Gilbert, author of Stumbling on Happiness). University of Chicago social neuroscientist John T. Cacioppo pioneered research on the startling effects of loneliness: a sense of isolation or social rejection disrupts not only our ability to think and will power but also our immune systems, and can be as damaging as obesity or smoking. On the flip side, social connection can be a powerful therapy. Cacioppo’s sophisticated studies relying on brain imaging, analysis of blood pressure, immune response, stress hormones, behavior, and even gene expression show that human beings are simply far more intertwined and interdependent—physiologically as well as psychologically—than our cultural assumptions have ever allowed us to acknowledge. Loneliness traces the evolution of these tandem forces, showing how, for our primitive ancestors, survival depended not on greater brawn but on greater commitments to each other. Serving as a prompt to repair frayed social bonds, the pain of loneliness engendered a fear response so powerfully disruptive that even now, millions of years later, a persistent sense of rejection or isolation can impair DNA transcription in our immune cells. This disruption also impairs our ability to read social signals and exercise social skills, as well as limits our ability to internally regulate our emotions—all of which can combine to trap us in self-defeating behaviors that reinforce the very isolation and rejection that we dread. Loneliness shows us how to overcome this feedback loop to achieve better health and greater happiness. As individuals and as a society, we have everything to gain, and everything to lose, in how well or how poorly we manage our need for social bonds.",Science,348,3.5,2,en

Inside Relationships,Sandra L. Faulkner,N/A,2021-12,"The second edition of this book again uses original case studies as a means to bring home to students, through lived experiences, the theories and concepts of interpersonal communication. Each piece takes an arts-based approach--spanning essays, short stories, scripts, photographs, poetry-- and has been newly written for this edition by communication researchers, writers, and artists. The case studies focus on the aesthetic dimensions of relating to illustrate to students the workings of relationship management with regards to friendship, race, class, gender, family interaction, sexuality, and other key topics in relational communication. The case studies are framed from a critical interpersonal perspective to encourage students to consider how power and cultural discourses about relationships influence their relating. Faulkner's introduction to each section provides important pedagogical content to give context and meaning to the cases that follow. Each case closes with questions for discussion, activities, and additional resources to help students analyze the material. The book is suited as core or supplemental reading for courses in interpersonal or relational communication.",Interpersonal communication,310,N/A,0,en

Daring Greatly,Brené Brown,Penguin UK,2013-01-17,"**Now on Netflix as The Call to Courage** 'She's so good, Brené Brown, at finding the language to articulate collective feeling' Dolly Alderton Every time we are faced with change, no matter how great or small, we also face risk. We feel uncertain and exposed. We feel vulnerable. Most of us try to fight those feelings - or feel guilt for feeling them in the first place. In a powerful new vision Dr Brené Brown challenges everything we think we know about vulnerability, and dispels the widely accepted myth that it's a weakness. She argues that, in truth, vulnerability is strength and when we shut ourselves off from vulnerability - from revealing our true selves - we distance ourselves from the experiences that bring purpose and meaning to our lives. Daring Greatly is the culmination of 12 years of groundbreaking social research, across every area of our lives including home, relationships, work, and parenting. It is an invitation to be courageous; to show up and let ourselves be seen, even when there are no guarantees. This is vulnerability. This is daring greatly.",Business & Economics,166,5,1,en

The Pragmatist's Guide to Relationships,"Malcolm Collins, Simone Collins",Pragmatist Foundation,2020-07-16,"The Pragmatist's Guide to Relationships presents a data-driven dissection of sex, dating, and marriage by taking a deep dive into academic literature and stress testing strategies advocated by ""marriage gurus"" and self-styled pick-up artists. Combining insights from these disparate fields, we construct novel models detailing how humans secure partners and make long-term relationships work while exploring how these systems can be exploited to one's advantage in a world of broken dating markets and plummeting marriage rates. This guide acts as an instruction manual for mate acquisition strategies of all stripes, providing the foundation needed to excel at any number of tricky tasks-be it getting laid, writing a marriage contract, training a spouse, determining whether a partner cheated, exploring the world of non-monogamy, or finding the perfect long-term partner. As with all Pragmatist Foundation books, the proceeds from this book go to nonprofits. In line with the foundation's goals, the book attempts to explore the topic of human relationships without pushing the agenda of any particular ideological team.",,540,5,2,en

This is the story of Offred, one of the unfortunate “Handmaids” under the new social order who have only one purpose: to breed. In Gilead, where women are prohibited from holding jobs, reading, and forming friendships, Offred’s persistent memories of life in the “time before” and her will to survive are acts of rebellion.

Beyond Mars and Venus,John Gray,"BenBella Books, Inc.",2017-01-24,"The author of the most well-known and trusted relationship book of all time returns with an updated guide for today's generation. Two decades ago, Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus revolutionized the way we thought about love and partnership. John Gray's work has helped countless readers improve and even save their relationships. But as society evolves, relationships do, too. It's time to move beyond Mars and Venus, toward a new relationship model for modern couples. Today, men and women are no longer trapped by rigid societal roles. Now more than ever, we have the freedom to be our authentic selves. Women can access their masculine side, and men can embrace their feminine side. This new freedom is a good thing, but it also brings new challenges. Men and women still need the right tools and skills to help build stronger relation- ships. While previous generations sought ""role mate"" relationships, based on the more rigid gender roles of the time, today's couples need a new kind of relationship: a ""soul mate"" relationship. These more emotionally satisfying relationships require a deeper understanding of our partners' individual needs. In Beyond Mars and Venus, Gray teaches you how to strengthen your bond and grow in love together, so you and your loved one can meet each other's needs in the best way possible, bringing you lasting happiness and a fulfilling partnership.",Self-Help,188,N/A,0,en

The Power of Discord,"Ed Tronick, Claudia M. Gold",Scribe Publications,2020-06-03,"How can we create more meaningful and intimate connections with our loved ones? By using moments of discord to strengthen our relationships, explains this original, deeply researched book. You might think that perfect harmony is the defining characteristic of healthy relationships, but the truth is that human interactions are messy, complicated, and confusing. And according to renowned psychologist Ed Tronick and paediatrician Claudia Gold, that is not only okay, but crucial to our social and emotional development. In The Power of Discord they show how working through the inevitable dissonance of human connection is the path to better relationships with romantic partners, family, friends, and colleagues. Dr. Tronick was one of the first researchers to show, via ‘The Still-Face Experiment’, that babies are profoundly affected by their parents’ emotions and behaviour. His work, which brought about a foundational shift in our understanding of human development, shows that our highly evolved sense of self makes us separate, yet our survival depends on connection. Working through the volley of mismatch and repair in everyday life helps us form deep, lasting, trusting relationships, resilience in times of stress and trauma, and a solid sense of self in the world. Drawing on Dr Tronick’s research and Dr Gold’s clinical experience, The Power of Discord is a refreshing and original look at our ability to relate to others and to ourselves.",Psychology,234,N/A,0,en

Friendship,A. C. Grayling,Yale University Press,2013-09-15,"A central bond, a cherished value, a unique relationship, a profound human need, a type of love. What is the nature of friendship, and what is its significance in our lives? How has friendship changed since the ancient Greeks began to analyze it, and how has modern technology altered its very definition? In this fascinating exploration of friendship through the ages, one of the most thought-provoking philosophers of our time tracks historical ideas of friendship, gathers a diversity of friendship stories from the annals of myth and literature, and provides unexpected insights into our friends, ourselves, and the role of friendships in an ethical life. A. C. Grayling roves the rich traditions of friendship in literature, culture, art, and philosophy, bringing into his discussion familiar pairs as well as unfamiliar-Achilles and Patroclus, David and Jonathan, Coleridge and Wordsworth, Huck Finn and Jim. Grayling lays out major philosophical interpretations of friendship, then offers his own take, drawing on personal experiences and an acute awareness of vast cultural shifts that have occurred. With penetrating insight he addresses internet-based friendship, contemporary mixed gender friendships, how friendships may supersede family relationships, one's duty within friendship, the idea of friendship to humanity, and many other topics of universal interest.

The first three chapters cover the social context of the relationship, the inherent power differential that delineates the relational boundaries, and professionals’ difficulty with managing that power appropriately. Also discussed are the four characteristics of a boundary violation—a reversal of roles, a secret, a double bind, and an indulgence of professional privilege—and the damage to the client. Throughout the book, clients share their stories of violations—sometimes blatant, often subtle—in relationships. These vignettes, along with Peterson’s engaging style, transform ethics from dry, abstract, and theoretical principles to vital struggles to understand and appropriately manage power with clients.",Psychology,0,N/A,0,en
Bread & Wine,"Samuel R. Delany, Mia Wolff",Fantagraphics Books,2013-07-19,"Written by black, gay science-fiction writer, professor, and theorist Samuel R. Delany, and drawn by artist/martial arts instructor Mia Wolff, Bread & Wine is a graphic autobiography that flashes back to the unlikely story of how Delany befriend ed Dennis, and how they became an enduring couple―Delany, a professor at Philadelphia’s Temple University, Dennis, an intelligent man living on the streets. For casual readers and fans, Bread & Wine is a moving, sexually charged love story, with visuals informed by Wolff’s professional physical pursuits. Her black-and-white, pen-and-ink work not only expressionistically represents the characters’ “body language” and the bustling New York setting, but is also filled with impish art references and visual puns. The scholarly potential for the book, based on the poem “Bread and Wine” by the German lyric poet Friedrich Holderlin, not only encompasses queer, African-American, and graphic novel studies, but also exploration in the literary and paraliterary academic fields.

Outside the Box to Box,Tak Maeda,N/A,2021-05-22,"The majority of people live a lifestyle where most of their lives are spent going back and forth from one of two ""boxes"" work and home-and they're lonely, sad, and anxious because of it. The problem with the ""box-to-box"" lifestyle is that there is little room for social connection. Science has proven that the quality of your social connections is the strongest factor to lifelong happiness-over money, status, or fame.

Heavens' Embroidered Cloths,William Butler Yeats,"Pavilion Books, Limited",1996,"As a boy Yeats dramatized himself as a sage, magician or poet, and when fellow poet Katharine Tynan first met him in 1885 he seemed to her all dreams and gentleness. His lifelong interest in the myths, legends and folk history of his native Ireland, his fascination with magic and the occult, the theatre, language, politics, love and friendship are all prevalent in this collection of poems.

Managing for Stakeholders,"R. Edward Freeman, Jeffrey S. Harrison, Andrew C. Wicks",Yale University Press,2007-01-01,"Managing for Stakeholders: Survival, Reputation, and Success, the culmination of twenty years of research, interviews, and observations in the workplace, makes a major new contribution to management thinking and practice. Current ways of thinking about business and stakeholder management usually ask the Value Allocation Question: How should we distribute the burdens and benefits of corporate activities among stakeholders? Managing for Stakeholders, however, helps leaders develop a mindset that instead asks the Value Creation Question: How can we create as much value as possible for all of our stakeholders?Business is about how customers, suppliers, employees, financiers (stockholders, bondholders, banks, etc.), communities, the media, and managers interact and create value. World-renowned management scholar R. Edward Freeman and his coauthors outline ten concrete principles and seven practical techniques for managing stakeholder relationships in order to ensure a firm’s survival, reputation, and success. Managing for Stakeholders is a revolutionary book that will change not only how managers do business but also how they recognize and evaluate business opportunities that would otherwise be invisible.",Business & Economics,200,4,1,en

Visible Learning,John Hattie,Routledge,2008-11-19,"This unique and ground-breaking book is the result of 15 years research and synthesises over 800 meta-analyses on the influences on achievement in school-aged students. It builds a story about the power of teachers, feedback, and a model of learning and understanding. The research involves many millions of students and represents the largest ever evidence based research into what actually works in schools to improve learning. Areas covered include the influence of the student, home, school, curricula, teacher, and teaching strategies. A model of teaching and learning is developed based on the notion of visible teaching and visible learning. A major message is that what works best for students is similar to what works best for teachers – an attention to setting challenging learning intentions, being clear about what success means, and an attention to learning strategies for developing conceptual understanding about what teachers and students know and understand. Although the current evidence based fad has turned into a debate about test scores, this book is about using evidence to build and defend a model of teaching and learning. A major contribution is a fascinating benchmark/dashboard for comparing many innovations in teaching and schools.",Education,389,N/A,0,en

Friend-ish,Kelly Needham,Thomas Nelson,2019-08-27,"For so many of us, our friends are like family members--we lean on them through our highest highs and our lowest lows--but sometimes those friendships don't turn out quite as we hoped. Bible teacher Kelly Needham debunks our world's constricted, narrow view of friendship and casts a richer, more life-giving, biblical vision for friendship. In Friend-ish, Kelly Needham reminds us that we were called to more than halfhearted friendships and lukewarm connections. We need something more stable, secure, and sacred. We were designed for real friendship--but the difficult truth is that too many of us are settling for less. Kelly deconstructs what Scripture says about the gift of friendship and takes a closer look at the distorted view that most of us have instead. As she shares the lessons she's learned from experience, Kelly paints her own glorious vision of what Christian friendship could look like. With hard-fought wisdom, a clear view of Scripture, and a been-there perspective, Friend-ish teaches us how to: Recognize symptoms of idolatry and toxic dependency Boldly ask for what we need from our community of friends Understand and address the problems that arise in friendship--from neediness to discord Recognize when it's time to end an unhealthy friendship Reorient toward the purposeful, loving relationships we all crave that ultimately bring us closer to God Find the friends you need and start to become that friend for others Join Kelly as she challenges you to view your chosen family in a new light, gain a vision of friendship according to Jesus, and finally enjoy friendships as God intended.",Religion,220,N/A,0,en

It departs from much of the existing scholarship on same-sex marriage, which argues either for or against marriage for same-sex couples. Instead, this book begins from a critical analysis of the institution of marriage itself (as well as separate forms of relationship recognition, such as civil partnership, PaCS, domestic partnership) and asks whether and how feminist critiques of marriage might be applied specifically to same-sex marriage.

LIVE-IN RELATIONSHIP AND RIGHTS OF WOMEN,Dr. Sonika Mathur,Laxmi Book Publication,2024-10-04,"India is a country having strong cultural foundation and high moral values. Marriage (matrimonial relationship or wedlock) in India has secured a sacred place and it is a general conception that marriage is a heavenly creature which is celebrated on earth. In India, marriage is a sacred bonding between two heterogeneous persons by which kinship is created and mutual rights and obligations are generated by this relationship. It is also a general conception that cohabitation between man and woman can only be done through bonding of marriage and for cohabitation, no other relationships is allowed between them. Marriage is a divine concept which has been practiced since ages. Interpersonal relationships which are generally intimate and sexual in nature are acknowledged by the marriage. It is also a social obligation to keep a man and woman together and since a woman is considered to be the better half of man, so, many of the rituals are considered to be incomplete unless it is to be performed by both husband and wife together. Hence in addition to be a social obligation, it is very much customary in nature also and necessary for the strengthening and progress of society.

Cross-Cultural Perspectives on the Experience and Expression of Love,Victor Karandashev,Springer,2019-06-05,"This ambitious volume integrates findings from various disciplines in a comprehensive description of the modern research on love and provides a systematic review of love experience and expression from cross-cultural perspective. It explores numerous interdisciplinary topics, bringing together research in biological and social sciences to explore love, probing the cross-cultural similarities and differences in the feelings, thoughts, and expressions of love. The book’s scope, which includes a review of major theories and key research instruments, provides a comprehensive background for any reader interested in developing an enlightened understanding of the cultural diversity in the concepts, experience, and expression of love. Included among the chapters: How do people in different cultures conceptualize love? How similar and different are the experiences and expressions of love across cultures? What are the cultural factors affecting the experience and expression of love? Cross-cultural understanding of love as passion, joy, commitment, union, respect, submission, intimacy, dependency, and more. A review of the past and looking into the future of cross-cultural love research. Critical reading for our global age, Cross-Cultural Perspectives on the Experience and Expression of Love promotes a thorough understanding of cross-cultural similarities and differences in love, and in so doing is valuable not only for love scholars, emotion researchers, and social psychologists, but also for practitioners and clinicians working with multicultural couples and families. “The most striking feature of this book is the broad array of perspectives that is covered. Love is portrayed as a universally found emotion with biological underpinnings. The text expands from this core, incorporating a wide range of manifestations of love: passion, admiration of and submission to a partner, gift giving and benevolence, attachment and trust, etc. Information on each topic comes from a variety of sources, cross-culturally and interdisciplinary. The text is integrative with a focus on informational value of ideas and findings. If you take an interest in how love in its broadest sense is experienced and expressed, you will find this to be a very rich text.” Ype H. Poortinga, Tilburg University, The Netherlands & Catholic University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium “In this wide-ranging book, Victor Karandashev expertly guides us through the dazzling complexity of our concept and experience of love. Not only does he show the many different ingredients that make up our conceptions of love in particular cultures, such as idealization of the beloved, commitment, union, intimacy, friendship, and others, he draws our attention to the bewildering array of differences between their applications in different cultural contexts, or to their presence or absence in a culture. In reading the book, we also get as a bonus an idea of how an elusive concept such as love can be scientifically studied by a variety of methodologies – all to our benefit. A masterful accomplishment.” Kövecses Zoltán, Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest, Hungary “Long considered a research purview of only a portion of the world’s cultures, we know today that love is universal albeit with many cultural differences in meaning, form, and expression. Moreover, love has a rich history of scholarship across multiple disciplines. Within this backdrop, Karandashev has compiled a remarkably comprehensive global review of how people experience and express their emotions in love. Covering the topic from a truly international and interdisciplinary perspective, this book is an indispensable source of knowledge about cultural and cross-cultural studies conducted in recent decades and is a must read for anyone interested in the universal and culturally diverse aspects of love.” David Matsumoto, San Francisco State University, Director of SFSU’s Culture and Emotion Research Laboratory",Psychology,259,N/A,0,en
Carnivorous Plants,"Aaron Ellison, Lubomír Adamec",Oxford University Press,2017-12-08,"Carnivorous plants have fascinated botanists, evolutionary biologists, ecologists, physiologists, developmental biologists, anatomists, horticulturalists, and the general public for centuries. Charles Darwin was the first scientist to demonstrate experimentally that some plants could actually attract, kill, digest, and absorb nutrients from insect prey; his book Insectivorous Plants (1875) remains a widely-cited classic. Since then, many movies and plays, short stories, novels, coffee-table picture books, and popular books on the cultivation of carnivorous plants have been produced. However, all of these widely read products depend on accurate scientific information, and most of them have repeated and recycled data from just three comprehensive, but now long out of date, scientific monographs. The field has evolved and changed dramatically in the nearly 30 years since the last of these books was published, and thousands of scientific papers on carnivorous plants have appeared in the academic journal literature. In response, Ellison and Adamec have assembled the world's leading experts to provide a truly modern synthesis. They examine every aspect of physiology, biochemistry, genomics, ecology, and evolution of these remarkable plants, culminating in a description of the serious threats they now face from over-collection, poaching, habitat loss, and climatic change which directly threaten their habitats and continued persistence in them.",Science,563,N/A,0,en

Passionate Friendship,Deborah M. Shamoon,University of Hawaii Press,2012-03-13,"Shojo manga are romance comics for teenage girls. Characterized by a very dense visual style, featuring flowery backgrounds and big-eyed, androgynous boys and girls, it is an extremely popular and prominent genre in Japan. Why is this genre so appealing? Where did it come from? Why do so many of the stories feature androgynous characters and homosexual romance? Passionate Friendship answers these questions by reviewing Japanese girls’ print culture from its origins in 1920s and 1930s girls’ literary magazines to the 1970s “revolution” shojo manga, when young women artists took over the genre. It looks at the narrative and aesthetic features of girls’ literature and illustration across the twentieth century, both pre- and postwar, and discusses how these texts addressed and formed a reading community of girls, even as they were informed by competing political and social ideologies. The author traces the development of girls’ culture in pre–World War II magazines and links it to postwar teenage girls’ comics and popular culture. Within this culture, as private and cloistered as the schools most readers attended, a discourse of girlhood arose that avoided heterosexual romance in favor of “S relationships,” passionate friendships between girls. This preference for homogeneity is echoed in the postwar genre of boys’ love manga written for girls. Both prewar S relationships and postwar boys’ love stories gave girls a protected space to develop and explore their identities and sexuality apart from the pressures of a patriarchal society. Shojo manga offered to a reading community of girls a place to share the difficulties of adolescence as well as an alternative to the image of girls purveyed by the media to boys and men. Passionate Friendship’s close literary and visual analysis of modern Japanese girls’ culture will appeal to a wide range of readers, including scholars and students of Japanese studies, gender studies, and popular culture.",Literary Criticism,198,N/A,0,en
International Surrogacy Arrangements,"Katarina Trimmings, Paul Beaumont",Bloomsbury Publishing,2013-05-17,"This book addresses the pressing challenges presented by the proliferation of international surrogacy arrangements. The book is divided into three parts. Part 1 contains National Reports on domestic approaches to surrogacy from Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, China, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States and Venezuela. The reports are written by domestic specialists, each demonstrating the difficult and urgent problems arising in many States as a result of international surrogacy arrangements. These National Reports not only provide the backdrop to the authors' proposed model regulation appearing in Part 3, but serve as a key resource for scrutinising the most worrying incompatibilities in national laws on surrogacy. Part 2 of the book contains two contributions that provide international perspectives on cross-border surrogacy such as the 'human rights' perspective. Part 3 contains a General Report, which consists of an analysis of the National Reports appearing in Part 1, together with a proposed model of regulation of international surrogacy arrangements at the international level written by the two co-editors, Paul Beaumont and Katarina Trimmings.

Adult Friendship,"Rosemary Blieszner, Rebecca G. Adams",SAGE Publications,1992-06-10,"Do you have a best friend? If so, you probably share the same race and social status. Why is this so? Does social structure determine your choice of friends? Or do other factors cause you to choose friends? Co-authors Blieszner and Adams explore these issues and offer a theoretical framework which incorporates both sociological and psychological perspectives on friendship. They use this model to synthesize the research theoretically, identify gaps in the literature, scrutinize the methods used, and produce a map for future research. Adult Friendship also covers historical conceptions of friendship, the internal structure of friendship, and the phases of friendship. Clearly written yet scholarly, Adult Friendship is perfect for students, researchers and professionals in psychology, sociology, communication, gerontology, family studies and social work. ""The analysis is ably argued, identifying the contributions to and gaps in the field and challenging others to give attention to the theoretical and methodological issues in the emerging research on adult friendship."" --Contemporary Sociology ""Adult Friendship is a noteworthy publication in the emerging area of the study of personal relationships. . . . A useful synthesis of theory and research on close relationships over the life cycle. . . . suitable for students and others wanting an introduction to the topic, yet also gives professionals more knowledgeable with this literature a fresh, distinctive perspective on it. . . .Blieszner and Adams′ chapters are concise and internally well organized. . . . a worthwhile read for researchers, students, practitioners, and laypersons concerned with the study of friendship across the life span."" --Journal of Marriage & The Family ""This volume is an important addition to the useful Sage Series on Close Relationships. It treats a topic that has been too frequently ignored in the area of close relationship research. . . . The coverage of the literature in this volume is especially good due to the tight organizational scheme that facilitates summaries of many different findings. . . . In sum, there is no doubt that both researchers and students will find this volume to be extremely useful. This is a well-organized and comprehensive book that provides a concise summary of research on adult friendship, both from sociological and psychological perspectives. Significant gaps in the literature are identified and methodological criticisms are raised. Finally, the authors provide clear guideposts for future research on a topic that has often received too little attention in the area of close relationships."" --ISSPR Bulletin",Psychology,161,N/A,0,en

Phylogenomic Discordance in Plant Systematics,"Stefan Wanke, Susann Wicke",Frontiers Media SA,2023-11-15,"Phylogenetics often uncovers contradicting hypotheses regarding the relationships within the same group of organisms, a phenomenon known since the beginning of the molecular systematics era. While, historically, single marker-based analyses produced discordance, nowadays entire cellular genomes or portions of the same genomic compartment conflict with others or the rest, respectively. In contrast to the beginning of the molecular systematics era, when adding markers and taxa offered a way out of systematic errors, genome inference-based incongruences cannot be addressed and explained easily. Disagreeing phylogenomic hypotheses might originate from various evolutionary processes, including but not limited to hybridization or incomplete lineage sorting, thereby leading to gene tree-versus species tree-associated discrepancies. Today, this can be expanded to genome discordance, where phylogenomic signals of organellar genomes (plastid, mitochondrial) and the nuclear genome disagree due to intrinsically different coalescent paths or phenomena like organelle capture.",Science,233,N/A,0,en

Business Marketing: An Interaction and Network Perspective,"Kristian K. Möller, David T. Wilson",Springer Science & Business Media,1995-11-30,"Changing Views of Business Marketing This book aims to provide an in-depth understanding of long-term busi in industrial markets. During the late 1980s our view ness relationships on business marketing changed remarkably. From a single-transaction oriented, market mechanism-based description of marketing and purchas ing, we are moving into domestic and international buyer-seller relation ships. In academic terms, we are experiencing a broadening of the para digms that describe how companies interact. This change in focus has its roots in the recognition that business marketing is frequently characterized by long-term interaction, coopera tion, and coalitions between participant firms. The forces of quality, total cost management, and the need to decrease response times in new prod uct/service development all are combining to accelerate the trend to wards strategic relationships. In increasingly global markets, different forms of strategic alliances provide ways of joining forces in attempts to reach goals beyond any single firm's resources. Also, our way of seeing the corporate environment is changing. In stead of the traditional view of markets or industries as constituted by independent companies operating mainly through market competition, we are starting to realize that markets can be more realistically defined and described as networks of interlinked organizations. The network view offers a highly promising tool for describing and analyzing the rapidly integrating global marketplace. For instance, strategic alliances can be seen as moves of establishing positions in a network or as ways of changing the whole network.",Business & Economics,666,N/A,0,en

Decision Making And Programming,Vyacheslav V Kolbin,World Scientific,2003-06-13,"The problem of selection of alternatives or the problem of decision making in the modern world has become the most important class of problems constantly faced by business people, researchers, doctors and engineers.The fields that are almost entirely focused on conflicts, where applied mathematics is successfully used, are law, military science, many branches of economics, sociology, political science, and psychology. There are good grounds to believe that medicine and some branches of biology and ethics can also be included in this list. Modern applied mathematics can produce solutions to many tens of classes of conflicts differing by the composition and structure of the participants, specific features of the set of their objectives or interests, and various characteristics of the set of their actions, strategies, behaviors, controls, and decisions as applied to various principles of selection or notions of decision optimization.The current issues of social and economic systems involve the necessity to coordinate and jointly optimize various lines of development and activities of modern society. For this reason, the decision problems arising in investigation of such systems are versatile, which shows up not only in the multiplicity of participants, their interests and complexity of reciprocal effects, but also in the laborious development of social utility criteria for a variety of indices and versatile objectives. The efficient decision methods for such complex systems can be developed only the basis of specially developed mathematical tools.",Mathematics,757,N/A,0,en

Redefining Regional French,David Hornsby,Taylor & Francis,2022-10-10,"This study challenges the orthodox view that emergent regional varieties of French represent no more than an ephemeral dialect residue of little theoretical interest. It follows the life cycle of an obsolescent urban Picard variety, spoken in a mining town in the Pas-de-Calais, and attempts to unravel the complex reasons behind the survival of some local variants at the expense of others. Applying a sociolinguistic model developed by Peter Trudgill, it shows how the processes of levelling and simplification have driven change in a dialect contact situation, giving rise to a new, stable variety or koine. This is compared with other new urban varieties in Sweden and the UK, where different economic, social and demographic conditions have produced very different linguistic outcomes. The emergence of Regional French in the north, it is argued, may herald the start of a new diversification of French in Europe. This book will therefore interest both students of French and of language variation more generally.",Foreign Language Study,173,N/A,0,en

The last decade, however, has witnessed a growing movement to abandon the exclusive focus on the negative. Psychologists from several subdisciplines are now asking an intriguing question: ""What strengths does a person employ to deal effectively with life?"" The Handbook of Positive Psychology provides a forum for a more positive view of the human condition. In its pages, readers are treated to an analysis of what the foremost experts believe to be the fundamental strengths of humankind.

Comparative Succession Law,"Kenneth G C Reid, Marius J de Waal, Reinhard Zimmermann",Oxford University Press,2020-10-09,"This third volume in a series on Comparative Succession Law concerns the entitlement of family members to override the provisions of a deceased person's will to obtain money or assets (or more money or assets) from the person's estate. Some countries, notably those in the civil law tradition (such as France or Germany), confer a pre-ordained share of the deceased's estate or of its value on certain members of the deceased's family, and especially on the deceased's children and spouse. Other countries, notably those in the common law tradition (such as England, Canada, or Australia), leave the matter to the discretion of the court, the amount awarded depending primarily on financial need. Whichever form it takes, mandatory family provision is both a protection against disinheritance and also, therefore, a restriction on testamentary freedom. The volume focuses on Europe and on countries influenced by the European experience. In addition to detailed treatment of the law in Austria, England and Wales, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Scotland, and Spain, the book also has chapters on Australia and New Zealand, South Africa, the United States, Canada, the countries of Latin America, and the People's Republic of China. Some other countries are covered more briefly, and there is a separate chapter on Islamic law.

Marital Agreements and Private Autonomy in Comparative Perspective,Jens M Scherpe,Bloomsbury Publishing,2012-02-24,"This book deals with a subject that has recently been the focus of debate and law reform in many jurisdictions: how much scope should spouses have to conclude agreements concerning their financial affairs - and under what circumstances should such agreements be binding and enforceable? These marital agreements include pre-nuptial, post-nuptial and separation agreements. The book is the result of a British Academy-funded research project which investigated and compared the relevant law of England and Wales, Australia, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Scotland, Singapore, Spain, Sweden and the jurisdictions of the United States. In addition to chapters on these jurisdictions, the book includes a chapter on the 'English practitioner's view'. It also provides a comparative analysis of the different matrimonial property regimes and the rules on marital agreements that explores underlying themes and principlesand makes recommendations for regulating marital agreements. A key theme is the function and effect of marital agreements in the different jurisdictions. Thus, each chapter first explains the underlying 'default' rules for ancillary relief/matrimonial property and maintenance. It then analyses the current rules for marital agreements, and gives a brief account of the private international law rules. The book provides a comprehensive source of reference on ancillary relief/matrimonial property and maintenance and the rules on pre-nuptial, post-nuptial and separation agreements in 14 jurisdictions. It offers guidance for academics and practitioners dealing with international matters, and a basis for discussions on law reform.

Obligation and Commitment in Family Law,Gillian Douglas,Bloomsbury Publishing,2018-04-19,"A tension lies at the heart of family law. Expressed in the language of rights and duties, it seeks to impose enforceable obligations on individuals linked to each other by ties that are usually regarded as based on love or blood. Taking a contextual approach that draws on history, sociology and social policy as well as law and legal theory, this book examines the concept of obligation as it has been developed in family law and the difficulties the law has had in translating it from a theoretical and ideological concept into the basis of enforceable actions and duties. Increasingly, the idea of commitment has been offered as the key organising principle for the recognition of family relationships, often as a means of rebutting claims that family ties are becoming attenuated, but the meaning and scope of this concept have not been explored. The book traces how the notion of commitment is understood and how far it has come to be used as a rationale for imposing the core legal obligations which underpin care and caring within families.",Law,270,N/A,0,en

Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships,Miloň Tichý,Birkhäuser,1976,"The conference on ""Chemical Structure-Biological Activity: Quantitative Approaches"" was held in Prague, Czechoslovakia, on June 27-29, 1973. It took place under the auspices of the J .E. PurkynC! Czechoslovak Medical SOciety, the Czechoslovak Chemi cal SOciety, and the International Society of Quantwn Biology (Organizing Commit tee: A. David, Chairman; M. Tichy, Secretary General; K. Bo ek, J. Kopeck ., R. Zahradnik). This volume contains the lectures and communications presented at the conference. There has been an ever increasing interest, especially during the last eight years, in the study of the quantitative relationships between the chemical structure of substan ces and their biological activity (QSAR - quantitative structure-activity relationships). One of the reasons for this increasing interest has been the desire to fmd ways of estimating the quantitative characteristics of a given biological activity as well as to shorten time and reduce the costs of research into optimally active compounds. In contrast to qualitative studies seeking the critical biologically active group, the QSAR approach involves the search for that property, or those properties, which determine the magnitude of the biological effect. Methods of physical chemistry and quantum chemistry appear to be suitable for estimating the quantitative characteristics of the biological activity of different compounds. Forecasting the specific activity of a certain substance by means of theoretical methods is still a matter of future devel opment. One of the basic ideas of QSAR studies is to work with a series of chemical compounds thereby enabling the collection and classification of experimental data.""",Juvenile Nonfiction,274,N/A,0,en

We say and do things we deeply regret later on. So we need to make things right. But just saying you’re sorry isn’t enough. That’s only the first step on the road to restoration. In The 5 Apology Languages, Gary Chapman, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of the 5 Love Languages®, partners with Jennifer Thomas to help you on the journey toward restored relationships. True healing comes when you learn to: Express regret: “I’m sorry.” Accept responsibility: “I was wrong.” Make restitution: “How can I make it right?” Plan for change: “I’ll take steps to prevent a reoccurrence.” Request forgiveness: “Can you find it in your heart to . . . ?” Don’t let hurts linger or wounds fester.

Relationships in Counseling and the Counselor's Life,"Jeffrey A. Kottler, Richard S. Balkin",John Wiley & Sons,2016-10-26,"In this engaging book, Jeffrey Kottler and Richard Balkin address common misconceptions about what works in counseling and offer suggestions for building constructive counseling relationships and facilitating positive counseling outcomes. Key aspects of the client–counselor relationship are supported by interesting examples and stories integrated with clinically useful research on counseling results. Part 1 reviews basic assumptions about the nature of helping relationships and examines how and why they can empower client change efforts. Part 2 describes practical approaches to encourage client trust and growth, including chapters on the cultural and environmental context of relationships; the ways in which counseling is used to treat trauma; how exchanging stories solidifies and fortifies counseling relationships; and using creative and innovative techniques to enhance relationships. Part 3 discusses the influence of relationships on counselors’ personal lives and explores how counselors are affected by their work, process disappointments and failures, and deal with personal conflicts. *Requests for digital versions from ACA can be found on www.wiley.com. *To purchase print copies, please visit the ACA website *Reproduction requests for material from books published by ACA should be directed to publications@counseling.org",Education,229,N/A,0,en

Inelasticity of Materials,"Arun Ramaswamy Srinivasa, Srinivasan M. Sivakumar",World Scientific Publishing Company,2009,"With the advent of a host of new materials ranging from shape memory alloys to biomaterials to multiphase alloys, acquiring the capacity to model inelastic behavior and to choose the right model in a commercial analysis software has become a pressing need for practicing engineers. Even with the traditional materials, there is a continued emphasis on optimizing and extending their full range of capability in the applications. This textbook builds upon the existing knowledge of elasticity and thermodynamics, and allows the reader to gain confidence in extending one's skills in understanding and analyzing problems in inelasticity. By reading this textbook and working through the assigned exercises, the reader will gain a level of comfort and competence in developing and using inelasticity models. Thus, the book serves as a valuable book for practicing engineers and senior-level undergraduate/graduate-level students in the mechanical, civil, aeronautical, metallurgical and other disciplines. The book is written in three parts. Part 1 is primarily focused on lumped parameter models and simple structural elements such as trusses and beams. This is suitable for an advanced undergraduate class with just a strength of materials background. Part II is focused on small deformation multi-dimensional inelasticity and is suitable for a beginning graduate class. Sufficient material is included on how to numerically implement an inelastic model and solve either using a simple stress function type of approach or using commercial software. Case studies are included as examples. There is also an extensive discussion of thermodynamics in the context of small deformations. Part III focuses on more advanced situations such as finite deformation inelasticity, thermodynamical ideas and crystal plasticity. More advanced case studies are included in this part. bull; This textbook takes a new, task- or scenario-based approach to teaching and learning inelasticity. The book is written in an active learning style that appeals to engineers and students who wish to design or analyze structures and components that are subject to inelasticity. bull; The book incorporates thermodynamical considerations into the modeling right from an early stage. Extensive discussions are provided throughout the book on the thermodynamical underpinnings of the models. bull; This textbook is the first to make extensive use of MATLAB to implement many inelasticity models. It includes the use of concepts such as Airy stress functions to solve plane problems for inelastic materials. The MATLAB codes are listed in the appendix for one to modify with their own models and requirements. bull; Step-by-step procedures for formulations and calculations are provided for the reader to readily adapt to the inelastic problems that he or she attempts to solve. bull; A large number of problems, exercises and projects for one to teach or learn from are included. These can be assigned as homework, in-class exercises or projects. bull; The book is written in a modular fashion, which provides adequate flexibility for adaptation in classes that cater to different audiences such as senior-level students, graduate students, research scholars, and practicing engineers.",Science,580,N/A,0,en

"Precipitation and Runoff Characteristics, Queen Charlotte Islands","Daniel Lewis Hogan, James W. Schwab, British Columbia. Ministry of Forests",N/A,1990,"The report provides a regional evaluation of precipitation and streamflow on the Queen Charlotte Islands. All available hydrometeorological data were consolidated from federal and provincial government agencies. The Queen Charlotte Islands were stratified into regions with homogeneous precipitation regimes. This regionalization was then used to develop relationships between monthly runoff and monthly precipitation. Frequency analyses for large magnitude rainstorms and runoff events are presented and used to determine the relationship between storm runoff and storm precipitation. For design purposes, where no data exists for storm precipitation characterisitics, a statistically significant relationship for estimating mean annual peak flows, based upon watershed properties and mean annual precipitation, is presented. Standard hydrology analyses are used. The relationships presented in the paper are statistically significant. However, limitation noted in the report indicated that long-term hydrometeorological data must be collected for the Queen Charlotte Islands so that more reliable precipitation-runoff relationships and more confident return period estimates can be developed.",Haida Gwaii (B.C.),60,N/A,0,en

Please Scream Quietly,Julie L. Fennell,Rowman & Littlefield,2022-06-27,"In Please Scream Quietly, professor and self-identified kinkster Julie Fennell offers an intimate, nuanced, and engaging portrayal of the lives and loves of a BDSM community. In this first-of-its-kind collective autobiography of the frequently misunderstood and often maligned BDSM subculture, Fennell’s insider perspective shows that while most people are a little bit kinky, the BDSM community teaches its members to emphasize and cherish their kinky differences. Drawing from interviews, survey data, and years of observations, Fennell showcases kinksters’ lives and loves in a captivating, vibrant, and authoritative story. She addresses questions such as: How do kinksters define their identities? How do BDSM community members construct socially meaningful identities for themselves? Are BDSM identities always experienced as sexual? How are kinky relationships and consensual nonmonogamy/polyamory experienced in the community? Fennell provides an unprecedented exploration of kinksters’ community group norms and rules, analyzing the demographics along with the behavioral and attitudinal norms in—and out—of BDSM dungeons. Fennell analyzes the multiple ways kinksters construct positive and negative social status, illustrating how the social world of kinksters is frequently quite different from outsiders’ perceptions of it.",Social Science,297,N/A,0,en

Needed Relationships and Psychoanalytic Healing,Steven Stern,Routledge,2017-02-17,"Needed Relationships and Psychoanalytic Healing is both a personal analytic credo and a multidimensional approach to thinking about clinical interaction. The book’s central theme is that of analytic needed relationships—the science and art of co-creating unique, evolving relational experiences fitted to each patient’s implicit therapeutic aims and needs. Steven Stern argues that, while we need psychoanalytic theories to ""grow the receptors and processors"" necessary to sense, understand, and connect with our patients, these often tend to frame the therapist’s participation in terms of theoretical and technical categories rather than offering a more holistic view of the relationship in all of its human complexity. Stern believes that a new set of higher order constructs is needed to counteract this tendency. In addition to his own concept of needed relationships, he invokes principles from the work of renowned developmental researcher and theorist, Louis Sander: especially his concept of relational fittedness. Stern draws on the work of Freud, Bion, Winnicott, Kohut, and a broad spectrum of contemporary psychoanalytic authors, in fleshing out the therapeutic implications of Sander’s (and Stern’s own) vision. The result is a rich, humane, and accessible narrative. Needed Relationships and Psychoanalytic Healing offers diverse clinical examples in which you will find Stern engaging with each of his patients in idiomatic, spontaneous ways as he attempts to contour interventions to the evolving analytic situation. This case material will inspire therapist-readers to feel freer to find their own creative voices and idioms of participation, as they seek to meet each patient within the psychoanalytic space. The book is intended for psychoanalysts and psychodynamic therapists at all levels of experience, including those in training.",Psychology,397,N/A,0,en
Forgiveness in Intimate Relationships,Shahrzad Siassi,Routledge,2018-03-08,"How can one overcome deeply-held resentment so as to resume or establish a bond with a traumatizing person, mindful that the experience of the self is rooted in the very intimate relationships from which such trauma arose? This book centres on the challenge of forgiveness and recovery from trauma in intimate relationships as viewed psychodynamically in the clinical context. Traumas inflicted by intimates, especially by parents, differ from transgressions and betrayals-however legitimately traumatizing-committed in less psychically-rooted relationships. While some betrayals are in fact not forgivable, what is at issue when parents or other intimates betray is the inevitable yearning for reunion: a wish whose potential fulfillment raises the spectre of re-traumatization and humiliation and is thus fraught with risk.",Psychology,152,N/A,0,en

Behaviour for Learning,"Simon Ellis, Janet Tod",Routledge,2018-07-04,"Behaviour for Learning offers teachers a clear conceptual framework for making sense of the many behaviour management strategies on offer, allowing them to make a critical assessment of their appropriateness and effectiveness in the classroom, and assisting them to promote closer links between ‘behaviour’ and ‘learning’. Now in a fully updated second edition, the book focuses on how teachers can provide a safe and secure setting where positive relationships are fostered, placing increased emphasis on learning behaviours that contribute to pupils’ cognitive, social and emotional development. The book is full of practical approaches that can help teachers support pupils to achieve, relate to others and develop behaviours that characterise self-esteem, confidence and resilience. It includes chapters covering: • relationship with the curriculum, relationship with self and relationship with others; • whole-school approaches and the school behaviour policy; • reframing special educational needs; • dealing with more challenging behaviour; • transitions. This second edition also includes an updated emphasis on the links between mental health, behaviour and relationships in schools, and reflects Department for Education advice for school staff, changes to the National Curriculum and the new SEND Code of Practice. Through the application of the Behaviour for Learning framework, the book encourages teachers to address the needs of pupils who exhibit behavioural difficulties, whilst still pursuing excellence in teaching and learning for all pupils. It is a compelling and essential read for all trainees and practising teachers, CPD coordinators and other professionals working with children in schools.",Education,445,N/A,0,en

ACT and RFT in Relationships,"JoAnne Dahl, Ian Stewart, Christopher R. Martell, Jonathan S Kaplan",New Harbinger  Publications,2014-01-02,"Even if you are not a couples therapist, chances are you have dealt with clients whose problems are based in relationship issues. In order to successfully treat these clients, you must first help them understand what their values are in these relationships, and how their behavior may be undermining their attempts to seek intimacy and connection. Combining elements of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and relational frame theory (RFT), ACT and RFT for Relationships presents a unique approach for therapists to help clients develop and experience deeper, more loving relationships. By exploring personal values and expectations, and by addressing central patterns of behaviors, therapists can help their clients establish and maintain intimacy with their partner and gain a greater understanding of their relationship as a whole. ACT is a powerful treatment model that teaches clients to accept their thoughts, identify their core values, and discover how these values are extended to their relationships with others. RFT focuses on behavioral approaches to language and cognition, and can help clients identify their own expectations regarding relationships and how they might communicate these expectations with their loved ones more effectively. This book aims to shed light on the thought processes behind intimate relationships—from the attraction phase to the end of intimacy—from a functional, contextual perspective.",Psychology,266,N/A,0,en

Educational Research and Innovation Educating 21st Century Children Emotional Well-Being in the Digital Age,Oecd,N/A,2019-10-22,"What is the nature of childhood today? On a number of measures, modern children's lives have clearly improved thanks to better public safety and support for their physical and mental health. New technologies help children to learn, socialise and unwind, and older, better-educated parents are increasingly playing an active role in their children's education. At the same time, we are more connected than ever before, and many children have access to tablets and smartphones before they learn to walk and talk. Twenty-first century children are more likely to be only children, increasingly pushed to do more by ""helicopter parents"" who hover over their children to protect them from potential harm. In addition to limitless online opportunities, the omnipresent nature of the digital world brings new risks, like cyber-bullying, that follow children from the schoolyard into their homes. This report examines modern childhood, looking specifically at the intersection between emotional well-being and new technologies. It explores how parenting and friendships have changed in the digital age. It examines children as digital citizens, and how best to take advantage of online opportunities while minimising the risks. The volume ends with a look at how to foster digital literacy and resilience, highlighting the role of partnerships, policy and protection.",Business & Economics,284,N/A,0,en

Safe People,"Henry Cloud, John Townsend",Zondervan,2009-05-26,"Safe People will help you discover why good people can get tangled in bad relationships, how to avoid repeating your own mistakes, and how to pick safe, healthy people for the friends you make and the company you keep. Too many of us have invested in relationships that have gone wrong. Maybe you've been judged, manipulated, or controlled. Or maybe you've trusted the wrong people in the past. It's easy to make the same mistakes of judgment over and over--or, worse, to give up on trying to have great, authentic relationships again. But it doesn't have to be that way. In Safe People, Drs. Henry Cloud and John Townsend teach you that being with an unsafe person can be damaging to your confidence, your trust in others, and even your health. You'll learn that you have the power to surround yourself with accepting, honest, and safe people who draw you closer to being the person God intended you to be. Drs. Cloud and Townsend, authors of the New York Times bestseller Boundaries, are here to share the lessons they've learned in their years of practicing psychology and studying the patterns and practices that support clear, biblical boundaries. In Safe People, they offer guidance for making safe choices in all of your day-to-day relationships, from family and friends to colleagues and partners. Safe People will give you the tools you need to recognize what makes people relationally safe, form positive relationships, and even become a safe person along the way. Drs. Cloud and Townsend share expert insights that will help you ask important questions: How can I learn to pick better friends? Why do I choose people who let me down? How did I end up with this critical boss? How do I attract irresponsible people? Why did I invest money with that unscrupulous person? What is it about me that draws the wrong types of people to me? Why am I drawn to the wrong types of people? It's time to revitalize your connections and finally start enjoying the healthy, balanced relationships that you deserve.",Religion,204,5,1,en
What We Don’T Understand About Relationships,Dr. Larry Adams,Abbott Press,2012-02-15,"Keeping a relationship alive and successful can be immensely challenging in todays world. More often than not, relationships fail because the nucleus of the partnership has been based on selfish needs, desires, and purposes instead of spiritual truths. In his guidebook What We Dont Understand about Relationships, Dr. Larry Adams offers practical tips, Scriptures, and advice that will help anyone learn to apply Christian values and principles to their relationship, ultimately realizing a lasting and loving partnership. Dr. Adams, a biblical counselor and Bible teacher for nearly thirty years, relies on his education and the word of God as he carefully reexamines relationships from a spiritual perspective and reveals misunderstood truths about relationships and why they fail. By teaching concepts that relationships are not natural and should not be based on emotional or physical feelings, Dr. Adams introduces a fresh perspective that focuses on spiritual commitments, effective communication, forgiveness, and thinking of others first before ourselves. What We Dont Understand about Relationships shares practical advice and applicable Scriptures that will help anyone struggling within a relationship to lay a new foundation based on seeking oneness with God first, and then each other.",Family & Relationships,120,N/A,0,en

Relationship,Lee Thayer,Xlibris Corporation,2017-04-24,"This book is about all of the kinds of relationships people can have. It is a very insightful book about how relationships emerge. But it is also about how indispensable they are to our ongoing sense of being who we are in the worlds we inhabit. We have relationships with various people. But we also have relationships with our possessions, with our pets, and with our pens and car keys. We have relationships with the foods we eat, the places we go, and the diversions we take. We have relationships with the news we attend to, the gossip we consume, and the places we are familiar with. We have relationships with our clothes, our lotions and potions, our grooming equipment, our computers and our snow shovels. Taken together, all of the relationships we have had, have today, and will have in the future attach us to our worlds in an admixture of pushes and pulls on our attention and our behavior. Metaphorically, it might visually look much like an intricate circular spider web, with us individually stuck at the core. We use the singular relationship here because we want to explore what it is that all relationships have in common: relationship. Relationships are sticky. They are far easier to fall into than to escape from. They are often demanding, requiring our attention when we wanted to devote our attention elsewhere. The drama of misplaced keys or a balky computer can take over our lives. We have hopes for certain relationships. We can be disappointed in how they turn out. But most of the myriad relationships that affect our lives just sort of happen. If they dont serve our purposes as we think we deserve, we drop them. A piece of clothing that just doesnt look right in the light can be dropped. Thats something you cant do with your own baby. You have a relationship with your body. If youre rich, you can get a remodeling job. If youre not, you may be stuck with the body youve got. Some relationships bring us down. Other relationships lift us up. In this book, you will learn how to create the kinds of relationships you need to get to where you want to go. The relationship you have with yourself is key. This book reveals to you how, if you get that right, most of the other relationships you live in, and by, will fall into place.",Psychology,207,N/A,0,en

We only had to deal with the common cold and the flu, which, although deadly enough, could not even begin to compete with the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Gospel People Don't Want to Hear,Lisa Cressman,Fortress Press,2020-05-05,"Lisa Cressman, founder of Backstory Preaching, offers preachers tools to craft difficult sermon messages that can be heard. The gospel changes lives, but to do that it must first be heard. For it to be heard, people have to trust they are ""seen"" and their concerns and fears are acknowledged. They have to feel their perspectives are real, valid, and respected. Preachers have a difficult message to preach, a message many will not want to hear: new life always emerges from death. Cressman shows preachers how to craft sermons with the right tone and how to have the courage to say what you're called to say. Part 1 of the book provides the preparatory work needed before crafting those difficult sermon messages. Here the focus is on how preachers prepare themselves, build relationships of mutual trust with listeners, and understand and appropriately use authority and leadership to proclaim the gospel. Part 2 focuses on the sermon itself with suggestions on what to say and how to say it. The preacher will find new tools and sharpen existing ones to preach difficult messages with empathy, compassion, and skill.",Religion,162,N/A,0,en

Dimensional Analysis and Similarity in Fluid Mechanics,Nord-Eddine Sad Chemloul,John Wiley & Sons,2020-11-02,"Dimensional analysis is the basis for the determination of laws that allow the experimental results obtained on a model to be transposed to the fluid system at full scale (a prototype). The similarity in fluid mechanics then allows for better redefinition of the analysis by removing dimensionless elements. This book deals with these two tools, with a focus on the Rayleigh method and the Vaschy-Buckingham method. It deals with the homogeneity of the equations and the conversion between the systems of units SI and CGS, and presents the dimensional analysis approach, before addressing the similarity of flows.

X That Ex,"Kristin E. Carmichael, LISW",Turner Publishing Company,2013-01-03,"""Hell no. It’s over. I am done."" Saying it to him felt so damned good. God knows he deserved it. Still deserves it. So why is it that only a few weeks later, I doubt if I can stand by what I said? X That Ex is the long-awaited answer for women who have left a bad relationship and don’t want to go back. It is incredibly common for women to leave partners who are emotionally unavailable, disrespectful, immature, selfish or even abusive, but then struggle to stay away. Women might be tripped up by their exes’ schemes to get them back, their own self-sabotaging ways or even by our society, which seems to glorify a ""just give him one more chance"" philosophy. To their family and friends’ dismay, huge numbers of women go back to toxic relationships, wasting years and the possibility of happier lives on men who can’t give them what they deserve. If the post-breakup world for most people were logical, fair, regulated and well-defined, there would be no need for X That Ex. As most of us know, however, the time after a breakup is emotionally messy, sometimes chaotic and filled with conflicting feelings, motivations, hopes, temptations and realities that must be dealt with. X That Ex focuses on this confusing time, demystifying why it is so difficult to stay away from a problematic ex, and distinguishing itself by making personalized predictions for readers about what to expect from their exes and themselves in the tumultuous time right after a relationship ends. This book is a unique roadmap that guides readers through the sometimes perilous time when a woman’s ex might try time-tested tactics to tempt her back, when self-sabotage may make a woman her own worst enemy, and when even our culture gets in on the action by making reunification seem reasonable.",Family & Relationships,90,N/A,0,en
Wouldn't You Love to Know?,Ian W. Payne,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2014-08-08,"With all the jumble of human disagreements, how can we know? Can the Christian church think coherently about knowledge? Can it regain confidence in teaching what it knows? In an increasingly divided and pessimistic postmodern world this book offers a theology for epistemology and for pedagogy that aims to be faithful and fruitful. Building on Karl Barth, it argues that God's knowing guides how humans know. We should imitate God's epistemic stance--his love--for that is the best model for knowing anything. The Trinitarian theme in Barth identifies three key concepts: committedness, openness, and relationality. These mean being committed and open towards what we wish to know. Relational open committedness also profoundly clarifies and shapes what love means in knowing and in teaching. This book unpacks an epistemology and pedagogy of love.

Best friends Ophelia Winesap and Jamie Kendell both work with kids, adore dessert, and will be in-laws once their respective cousins finally tie the knot. Their friendship has one rule: no discussing love, sex, or romance. Self-declared spinster Ophelia doesn’t want to waste her energy when love is an illusion and sex isn’t nearly as satisfying as a chocolate cupcake. Jamie uses their pact to avoid telling Ophelia he’s been pining for her since they met, but things get complicated when a night of platonic bed-sharing leads to Jamie’s discovery that Ophelia might be just as attracted to him as he is to the curvy blonde. And when the bride-to-be demands their plus-ones to the wedding, Ophelia finds herself hoping Jamie won’t want to bring anyone but her. Friends with benefits is one thing, but a real relationship is so much more. While Jamie’s ready to commit, Ophelia’s a proud member of the “Never a Bride” club. Jamie knows he can’t make Ophelia love him back… but maybe she already does?

Love Her Well,Kari Kampakis,Thomas Nelson,2020-08-18,"Now an ECPA Best Seller—Kari Kampakis's Love Her Well gives moms ten practical tips for how to build strong and lasting relationships with their daughters. For many women, having a baby girl is a dream come true. But as girls grow up, the narrative of innocence and joy changes to one of dread as moms are told, ""Just wait until she's a teenager!"" and handed a disheartening and too-often-true script about a daughter's teenage season of life. Author, blogger, and mom to four daughters Kari Kampakis thinks it's time to change the narrative and mind-set that leads moms to parent teen girls with a spirit of defeat instead of strength. Love Her Well isn't a guide to help mothers ""fix"" their daughters or make them behave. It's about a mom's journey, doing the heart-work necessary to love a teenager while still being a steady, supportive parent. Kari offers wisdom about how moms can: Choose their words and timing carefully. Listen and empathize with her teen's world. See the good, and love her for who she is. Take care of themselves and find a support system in the process. By working on the foundation, habits, and dynamics of the relationship; mothers can connect with their teen daughters and earn a voice in their lives that allows moms to offer guidance, love, wisdom, and emotional support. Kari gives mothers hope, wisdom, and a reminder that all things are possible through God, who is the source of the guidance and clarity they need in order to grow strong relationships with their daughters at every age—especially during the critical teen years.",Religion,241,4,1,en
Works of Love,Robert L. Perkins,Mercer University Press,1999,"""To claim that Works of Love is an important philosophical essay is to assume hazardous burden of proof. The book's title is an allusion to the Bible's injunction that we should love our neighbor as we love ourselves, a far cry, far instance, from Diotoma's ladder of erotic desire up which we climb from the love of bodies until we catch a vision of that ""single sea of beauty,"" beauty itself (Plato, Symposium). This contrast, given that some of some of our neighbors may not be particularly likable or one may even be a determined enemy, suggests immediately to some that a book with such an obviously religious title must be excessively moralistic and, at best, full of sermon helps for the harried clergy or, at worst, laden with rules for the unlearned laity. A casual perusal of a few paragraphs, however, shows these ""put-down"" views of the book to be unfounded""--",Philosophy,410,N/A,0,en

"Love Me, Don't Leave Me",Michelle Skeen,New Harbinger  Publications,2014-09-01,"Everyone thrives on love, comfort, and the safety of family, friends, and community. But if you are denied these basic comforts early in life, whether through a lack of physical affection or emotional bonding, you may develop intense fears of abandonment that can last well into adulthood—fears so powerful that they can actually cause you to push people away. If you suffer from fears of abandonment, you may have underlying feelings of anger, shame, fear, anxiety, depression, and grief. These emotions are intense and painful, and when they surface they can lead to a number of negative behaviors, such as jealousy, clinging, and emotional blackmail. In Love Me, Don’t Leave Me, therapist Michelle Skeen combines acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), schema therapy, and dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) to help you identify the root of your fears. In this book you’ll learn how schema coping behaviors—deeply entrenched and automatic behaviors rooted in childhood experiences and fears—can take over and cause you to inadvertently sabotage your relationships. By recognizing these coping behaviors and understanding their cause, you will not only gain powerful insights into your own mind, but also into the minds of those around you. If you are ready to break the self-fulfilling cycle of mistrust, clinginess, and heartbreak and start building lasting, trusting relationships, this book will be your guide.",Family & Relationships,140,N/A,0,en

You Can't Lead With Your Feet On the Desk,Ed Fuller,John Wiley & Sons,2011-03-01,"Personal relationships are the real bedrock of long-term success in any business and any industry. But in today's global economy, forging bonds across cultural divides requires a heightened level of sensitivity. In You Can't Lead with Your Feet on the Desk, the leader of Marriott International Lodging, Ed Fuller, delivers real-world advice on how to connect with, manage, and do business with people in any culture, including employees, suppliers, and customers who often have roots in other cultures. Fuller, who grew Marriott's international business from sixteen hotels in six countries to 400 properties in seventy countries, explains how to navigate cultural nuances and language differences, unfamiliar geography, and frustrating bureaucracy. Building trust, shared values, and commitment to a business partnership is harder in cross-cultural situations, but it can and must be done if you want to be successful in today's world. No matter the country or community, relationships are the currency of every culture. Fuller explains how to build these relationships, how to discover the other person's interests and needs—and why you have to get your feet off the desk, cross the cultural borders, and go meet them in the context in which they're most comfortable. Fuller prepares you for this journey with guiding principles for avoiding missteps and for creating lasting connections crucial to every business leader: Build relationships through mutual respect Earn trust quickly by delivering during a crisis Understand how verbal and nonverbal cues can make or break a deal Lead from the front and be willing to give yourself the tough jobs Learn the local customs and history in order to create positive relationships Your skills at forming and maintaining close ties with associates and partners give you the competitive advantage.

Mothers Who Can't Love,"Susan Forward, Donna Frazier Glynn",Harper Collins,2013-10-01,"With Mothers Who Can't Love: A Healing Guide for Daughters, Susan Forward, Ph.D., author of the smash #1 bestseller Toxic Parents, offers a powerful look at the devastating impact unloving mothers have on their daughters—and provides clear, effective techniques for overcoming that painful legacy. In more than 35 years as a therapist, Forward has worked with large numbers of women struggling to escape the emotional damage inflicted by the women who raised them. Subjected to years of criticism, competition, role-reversal, smothering control, emotional neglect and abuse, these women are plagued by anxiety and depression, relationship problems, lack of confidence, and difficulties with trust. They doubt their worth, and even their ability to love. Forward examines the Narcissistic Mother, the Competitive Mother, the Overly Enmeshed mother, the Control Freak, Mothers who need Mothering, and mothers who abuse or fail to protect their daughters from abuse. Filled with compelling case histories, Mothers Who Can’t Love outlines the self-help techniques Forward has developed to transform the lives of her clients, showing women how to overcome the pain of childhood and how to act in their own best interests. Warm and compassionate, Mothers Who Can’t Love offers daughters the emotional support and tools they need to heal themselves and rebuild their confidence and self-respect.",Self-Help,303,N/A,0,en

He started by reaching out to people he admired, searching for mentors, and applying his past coaches’ advice from sports to life off the field. Lewis did more than bounce back: He built a multimillion-dollar online business and is now a sought-after business coach, speaker, and podcast host. In The School of Greatness, Howes shares the essential tips and habits he gathered in interviewing “the greats” on his wildly popular podcast of the same name. In discussion with people like Olympic gold medalist Shawn Johnson and Pencils of Promise CEO Adam Braun, Howes figured out that greatness is unearthed and cultivated from within. The masters of greatness are not successful because they got lucky or are innately more talented, but because they applied specific habits and tools to embrace and overcome adversity in their lives. A framework for personal development, The School of Greatness gives you the tools, knowledge, and actionable resources you need to reach your potential. Howes anchors each chapter with a specific lesson he culled from his greatness “professors” and his own experiences to teach you how to create a vision, develop hustle, and use dedication, mindfulness, joy, and love to reach goals. His lessons and practical exercises prove that anyone is capable of achieving success and that we can all strive for greatness in our everyday lives.",Self-Help,274,N/A,0,en

GAINES AWARD • LONGLISTED FOR THE STORY PRIZE • ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR—Garden & Gun, Electric Lit • “Every sentence is both something that makes you want to laugh in a gut-wrenching way and threatens to break your heart in a way that you did not anticipate.”—Robert Jones, Jr., author of The Prophets, in The Wall Street Journal Maurice Carlos Ruffin has an uncanny ability to reveal the hidden corners of a place we thought we knew. These perspectival, character-driven stories center on the margins and are deeply rooted in New Orleanian culture. In “Beg Borrow Steal,” a boy relishes time spent helping his father find work after coming home from prison; in “Ghetto University,” a couple struggling financially turns to crime after hitting rock bottom; in “Before I Let Go,” a woman who’s been in NOLA for generations fights to keep her home; in “Fast Hands, Fast Feet,” an army vet and a runaway teen find companionship while sleeping under a bridge; in “Mercury Forges,” a flash fiction piece among several in the collection, a group of men hurriedly make their way to an elderly gentleman’s home, trying to reach him before the water from Hurricane Katrina does; and in the title story, a young man works the street corners of the French Quarter, trying to achieve a freedom not meant for him. These stories are intimate invitations to hear, witness, and imagine lives at once regional but largely universal, and undeniably New Orleanian, written by a lifelong resident of New Orleans and one of our finest new writers.",Fiction,193,N/A,0,en

Guy Schermerhorn, brilliant young professor of psychology and disciple of the pioneering Dr Moncrieff, is making a name for himself on the talk show circuit with an unusual protégé in tow: a chimp by the name of Sam. Sam lives in Guy's apartment, wears diapers and neckties, devours pizza and Macdonalds – and, through Guy's careful training, can communicate through sign language. But living with Sam is wreaking havoc on Guy's personal life, and when shy, meek undergraduate Aimee Villard volunteers to take on babysitting for him, he can't believe his luck. Aimee and Sam have an immediate rapport, and before Guy knows it she's moved in, proudly devoting herself to Sam's care and Guy's project. Aimee has never known purpose and happiness like this; but when Guy's funding is imperilled, and Sam is taken away by the sinister Moncrief, her world falls apart.

"Friends, Partners, and Lovers",Kevin A. Thompson,Revell,2017-05-02,"Great marriages don't just happen--they're made, intentionally, day by day. Yet most of us enter the covenant of marriage thinking that the role of spouse will be easy, natural, effortless. Rarely is this true. In fact, the number one cause of divorce isn't adultery or finances or disagreements. It's apathy--a lack of intentional emotional, physical, and mental investment in the relationship. With engaging stories and clear, simple language, pastor Kevin A. Thompson explains the three critical roles of a spouse--friend, partner, and lover--and shows how to nurture those roles in order to keep a marriage healthy and strong. Using solid biblical principles, he helps couples understand how to grow their friendship, be a supportive partner through the good times and the bad, and develop a healthy and satisfying sex life. Friends, Partners, and Lovers offers essential insight for couples at any stage of marriage but will be especially helpful to those who are struggling and those who are engaged or newly married and looking to start their marriage on strong footing.",Religion,218,N/A,0,en
It's Not Always Depression,Hilary Jacobs Hendel,Random House,2018-02-06,"Fascinating patient stories and dynamic exercises help you connect to healing emotions, ease anxiety and depression, and discover your authentic self. Sara suffered a debilitating fear of asserting herself. Spencer experienced crippling social anxiety. Bonnie was shut down, disconnected from her feelings. These patients all came to psychotherapist Hilary Jacobs Hendel seeking treatment for depression, but in fact none of them were chemically depressed. Rather, Jacobs Hendel found that they’d all experienced traumas in their youth that caused them to put up emotional defenses that masqueraded as symptoms of depression. Jacobs Hendel led these patients and others toward lives newly capable of joy and fulfillment through an empathic and effective therapeutic approach that draws on the latest science about the healing power of our emotions. Whereas conventional therapy encourages patients to talk through past events that may trigger anxiety and depression, accelerated experiential dynamic psychotherapy (AEDP), the method practiced by Jacobs Hendel and pioneered by Diana Fosha, PhD, teaches us to identify the defenses and inhibitory emotions (shame, guilt, and anxiety) that block core emotions (anger, sadness, fear, disgust, joy, excitement, and sexual excitement). Fully experiencing core emotions allows us to enter an openhearted state where we are calm, curious, connected, compassionate, confident, courageous, and clear. In It’s Not Always Depression, Jacobs Hendel shares a unique and pragmatic tool called the Change Triangle—a guide to carry you from a place of disconnection back to your true self. In these pages, she teaches lay readers and helping professionals alike • why all emotions—even the most painful—have value. • how to identify emotions and the defenses we put up against them. • how to get to the root of anxiety—the most common mental illness of our time. • how to have compassion for the child you were and the adult you are. Jacobs Hendel provides navigational tools, body and thought exercises, candid personal anecdotes, and profound insights gleaned from her patients’ remarkable breakthroughs. She shows us how to work the Change Triangle in our everyday lives and chart a deeply personal, powerful, and hopeful course to psychological well-being and emotional engagement.",Psychology,322,N/A,0,en

Choice of Payoff Horizon and Firm Performance,David Lawrence Souder,N/A,2007,"""An important managerial challenge is choosing the payoff horizon for strategic investments, since projects with long run benefits have immediate costs that reduce short run profits. My dissertation draws from the behavioral theory of the firm and agency theory to explain differences in payoff horizon choices between firms, based on performance relative to aspirations, incentive compensation, and external market pressure. I also test the intuition that long horizon investments have a positive impact on long run performance. The business model for cable operators during its programming variety phase from 1972-1996 offers a quasi-experimental setting ideally suited for research into these issues. Like public utilities, local cable companies are natural monopolies with single providers in each market. Unlike electricity, heat, or water service, however, there is neither a mandate for universal service nor municipal financing for capital investments. Furthermore, the distribution technology of microwave and, later, satellite eliminate the need for single firms to serve contiguous geographic regions, and the industry's pre-1972 history as a broadcast retransmission service contributed to a particularly disparate pattern of geographic expansion. As a result, cable operators during the research period do not compete with each other for market share among customers, but they do compete over future growth through their choice of investments. These investments have varying payoff horizons. In testing predictions about which firms pursue longer or shorter payoff horizons, I use simultaneous equation techniques. To assess the impact of short- and long-horizon investments on ex post performance, I use dynamic panel modeling that allows the direction and significance of investment choices to be interpreted at different lag lengths. What makes firms choose different payoff horizons? Are longer horizon investments associated with higher eventual performance, as conventional wisdom suggests? The first question is central to understanding firm strategy, while the second is crucial for evaluating that strategy. By addressing both, my dissertation generates corporate governance implications and insight into the value-creation potential of longer payoff horizons. In addition, it analyzes the causes and effects of the wide heterogeneity of firm strategies observed in the partially regulated and monopolistic cable industry""--Http://www.cablecenter.org/education/awards/2006GrantWinner.cfm (as viewed on 08/18/08)",Cable television,432,N/A,0,en

Unshared Care,Caroline Glendinning,Routledge & Kegan Paul Books,1983,"The vast majority of the 100,000 or so children with serious mental or physical disabilities in Britain today live at home with their families. A series of in-depth interviews carried out with a number of parents enabled the author to describe the extensive physical, practical and emotional demands made on those looking after their disabled child at home. In their own words, parents report how and when they learnt about their child's disability; the sheer physical work and mental effort of daily care which more often than not fall unremittingly on the child's mother; the feelings of isolation and the lack of information which are often relieved only by talking with parents of other disabled children. Unshared Care examines the community services available, revealing that, from the parents' point of view, the rhetoric of public concern is only barely matched by the practical support available. It shows that services are, all too often, insufficiently specialized and lacking in coherence.",Family & Relationships,300,N/A,0,en

Humilitas,John Dickson,Zondervan,2011-06-07,"Humility, or holding power loosely for the sake of others, is sorely lacking in today’s world. Without it, many people fail to develop their true leadership potential and miss out on genuine fulfillment in their lives and their relationships. Humilitas: A Lost Key to Life, Love, and Leadership shows how the virtue of humility can turn your strengths into true greatness in all areas of life. Through the lessons of history, business, and the social sciences, author John Dickson shows that humility is not low self-esteem, groveling, or losing our distinct gifts. Instead, humility both recognizes our inherent worth and seeks to use whatever power we have at our disposal on behalf of others. Some of the world’s most inspiring and influential players have been people of immense humility. The more we learn about humility, the more we understand how essential it is to a satisfying career and personal life. By embracing this virtue, we will transform for good the unique contributions we each make to the world.",Business & Economics,203,N/A,0,en

More Than a Mom,Kari Kampakis,Thomas Nelson,2022-04-05,"What if taking care of yourself was the first step to helping your family thrive? If you’ve parented long enough, then you’ve learned firsthand why your personal wellness matters. You’ve felt the pain (or consequences) of devaluing yourself. Whether your wake-up call came from a diagnosis, a breakdown, an issue with your child or spouse, anxiety, or simply feeling depleted and numb, it most likely unveiled this truth: Mothers are humans too. We require love, compassion, rest, and renewal. Taking care of our needs strengthens us and equips us for the road ahead. In More Than a Mom, bestselling author Kari Kampakis offers a practical, approachable, and attainable framework to stay on a healthy path. You can take your kids only as far as you’ve come–and since their strength builds on your strength, you must take time to focus on you. More Than a Mom is about unleashing God’s power in your life and standing on timeless truths that will help you know your worth and embrace your purpose, build strong, uplifting friendships that you can model for your children, quit the negative self-talk and make peace with your body, and learn to mother yourself by resting and setting boundaries. The world shaping your children is more callous and complex than the world that shaped you. Kids need to be stronger, smarter, and more rooted in what’s real. Empower your son or daughter by tending to your heart, soul, body, and mind. Give them a vision of a healthy adult–and know that as they launch into the real world, they will build on what you started.",Religion,238,N/A,0,en

Splitopia,Wendy Paris,Simon and Schuster,2016-03-15,"Packed with research, insights, and illuminating (and often funny) examples from Paris’s own divorce experience, this book is a “practical and reassuring guide to parting well.” —Gretchen Rubin, author of The Happiness Project Engaging and revolutionary, filled with wit, searing honesty, and intimate interviews, Splitopia is a call for a saner, more civil kind of divorce. As Paris reveals, divorce has improved dramatically in recent decades due to changes in laws and family structures, advances in psychology and child development, and a new understanding of the importance of the father. Positive psychology expert and author of Happier, Tal Ben-Shahar, writes that Paris’s “personal insights, stories, and research” create “a smart and interesting guide that can be extremely helpful for those going through divorce.” Reading this book can be the difference between an expensive, ugly battle and a decent divorce, between children sucked under by conflict or happy, healthy kids. This is “a compelling case that it’s high time for a new definition of Happily Ever After—for everyone” (Brigid Schulte, author of Overwhelmed: Work, Love, and Play When No One Has the Time).",Family & Relationships,336,N/A,0,en

A Girl’s Guide to the Outback,Jessica Kate,Thomas Nelson,2020-01-28,"How far will a girl go to win back a guy she can’t stand? This funny, sweet, and romantic story proves that opposites do attract—and that God has a sense of humor. Samuel Payton is a passionate youth pastor in Virginia, but below the surface, he’s still recovering from the blow of a failed business and insecurities he can’t shake. His coworker, start-up expert Kimberly Foster, is brilliant, fearless, and capable, but years of personal rejection have left her defensive and longing for a family. Two people have never been more at odds—or more attracted to one another. And every day at work, the sparks sure do fly. When Kimberly’s ambitious plans for Sam’s ministry butt up against his risk-averse nature, Sam decides that obligations to family trump his work for the church. He quits the ministry and heads home to Australia to help his sister, Jules, save her struggling farm. As Kimberly’s grand plans flounder, she is forced to face the truth: that no one can replace Sam. Together they strike up a deal: If Kimberly comes to work on Jules’s dairy farm and lends her business brains to their endeavor, then maybe—just maybe—Sam will reconsider his future with the church. As Kimberly tries her hand at Australian farm life, she learns more about herself than she could’ve ever expected. Meanwhile Sam is forced to re-evaluate this spunky woman he thought he already knew. As foes slowly morph into friends, they wonder if they might be something even more. But when disaster strikes the farm, will Sam find it within himself to take a risk that could lead to love? And will Kimberly trust God with her future? “Original, heartwarming, full of lovable characters amid a fast-paced plot. Romance readers will love the bicontinental adventure of a sassy, strong-willed woman going across the ocean to win back the Aussie man who holds the key to her career dreams—but also, as it turns out, so much more.” —Melissa Ferguson, author of The Dating Charade “Combining breathtaking realness, natural humor, and scorching romantic chemistry that leaps off the page, author Jessica Kate has given us a thoroughly modern tale about risk, acceptance, and the true meaning of home.

PostSecret,,N/A,2006,"'You are invited to anonymously contribute a secret to a group art project. Your secret can be a regret, fear, betrayal, desire, confession, or childhood humiliation. Reveal anything - as long as it is true and you have never shared it with anyone before. Be brief. Be legible. Be creative.' So began Frank Warren's PostSecret project when he handed out postcards to strangers, and asked for them to mail it back. In under a year, more than 10,000 did so, and their secrets were sometimes moving or funny or just plain weird: 'I stole valium from my epileptic dog', 'I waste office supplies because I hate my boss', and 'I've always wanted to rob a bank'. All of these thought-provoking confessions are superbly illustrated throughout, and reveal much about the modern state of life.

It is a book for intending lovers, those who are struggling, and those who are still navigating around the path of healing.Before you move on or give up, you must find the problem in your relationship. It is only when you see the problem that you can fix it.Relationships can be likened to automobiles in this instance. It needs to be serviced. All the parts that make it up must function properly. If something is not working and the people involved are too lazy or not ready to work at it; it's going to come crashing down. We all know that it is more challenging to fix a dead car than to repair a little mechanical fault as soon as you discover it.Your situation may be quite different from others.You could be in a relationship with someone who doesn't feel as connected as you are to the relationship.At first, it will hurt deeply. You may begin to wonder if you are good enough. You'll have self-doubts and wonder why this person isn't proud of you like you are of them.They don't show you off. They aren't ready to let you into the deepest and darkest places of their lives. They aren't ready to take things to the next level. This could affect your self-image. It will rub off on your self-confidence, and you may start to resent the person you are in a relationship with.While it's easy to be hurt, angry, and upset, when someone is not ready to be committed to you, it has nothing to do with you.One mystery that life has offered us is the inability to get inside someone else's head.It's not possible to truly understand people's motives except when they tell you.This is whyyou shouldn't take the rejection personally.What if they are going through something? What if they aren't ready? These are just 'What Ifs?' But they could be people's realities. Some people are conscientious enough to block you out from whatever they are struggling with.They understand their inner fights.They seek healing and do not want to drag you into it.It becomes essential for them to set boundaries; create a wall and shield their hearts in it. You may think they are cold and unemotional.However, this is their way of blocking you from accessing those parts of them that still hurt.There are people that are hypocritical about it. Although they struggle with something, they are willing to let others in.And they find desperate people to be like prey.They use people's love to channel their pain, and this comes out toxic every time.You will always be at the receiving end of bad energy. There's nothing you will do that could ever be good enough. Once you are done with this set of people, you'll realize that they have transferred their pain to you.The cycle of brokenness is continued.There are people who were broken as children, through physical, sexual or emotional trauma.Until they heal from this trauma they cannot be in a healthy relationship because they are no health. Again, this is not your fault, but don't stay in a codependent or abusive relationship.It is essential to understand that people are at different stages in their lives. When you have feelings for someone, it's easy to remain in a relationship with them even if your relationship has no future.While it's incredible that you are sticking it out against all the odds, you need to ask yourself if that person is even in the same stage of life as you. if you examine this simple guidance from jiro, you will understand why this book is a necessary tool that will help you to identify what stage of life your partner is currently in and how crucial it is for the future of your relationship. it will also help you to have a more fulfilling life",,232,N/A,0,en

Confessions of a Happily Married Man,Joshua L. Rogers,Worthy Books,2019-12-17,"Discover God in the messiness of your marriage, as popular marriage and family columnist Joshua Rogers offers spouses hope with real-life stories from his own marriage and helps you see how God is at work in the ordinary and extraordinary of your relationship. Confessions of a Happily Married Man is a husband's painfully honest account of his first ten years of marriage. It offers a window into the perspective of a man who went from ""hello"" to ""I do"" in nine months and then figured out how hard marriage could be. When Joshua Rogers thought back on the marriage books he had read or sermons about marriage he had heard, it occurred to him that he could only remember one thing about them: the stories. That's why this book is anchored by stories that other couples will relate to and can easily learn from. The stories are cringe-worthy, humorous, inspiring, heart-breaking, and full of wisdom--but the author isn't telling the reader what to do with that wisdom. He's letting the reader learn along with him as he's gradually becoming more self-aware, increasingly grateful for his wife, and surprised to discover what God is doing in the middle of it all.",Religion,162,N/A,0,en

If you've ever found yourself in a relationship that feels and seemingly looks like one but you're struggling with commitment or you've been in the ambiguous territory of a 'casual relationship', you've likely tried to change them, wondered what you 'did' to cause this, what you can do to win their love and commitment, or even whether you're going crazy. Mr Unavailable and the Fallback Girl is the definitive guide to understanding the relationship between emotionally unavailable men and the women that love them. From explaining how and why they blow hot and cold, to where that future they promised went to, how you've ended up being a booty call, why you've been together for a gazillion years but aren't going anywhere, and more importantly how and why you're involved with them in the first place, all of the answers are here. You know you're dealing with unavailability when you ask stuff like What happened to that 'great guy' from the beginning? Why won't he break up or stay away if he doesn't want to commit? What the hell did I do to make him disappear? Is he going to leave 'her' for me? It's because he's shy/busy/scared of his feelings isn't it? Inspired by the real life adventures in unavailability of Natalie Lue and the readers of her site BaggageReclaim.com, Mr Unavailable and the Fallback Girl is an empowering, entertaining and inspiring read that will wise you up to pitfalls such as men who aren't over their exes, Future Fakers, guys that have more baggage than a Heathrow terminal and reappearing childhood 'sweethearts'.

THE ART OF RELATIONSHIPS,RICHARD MARTINEZ,ART OF RELATIONSHIPS,2021-07-19,"Do you feel that your current relationship is hopeless, that the passion is gone, and that the person you are with does not understand you, value you, or provide what you need? Everything that matters most in life revolves around people. Our relationships determine our quality of life. Therefore, toxic relationships will create a dysfunctional life. The relationship with our partner is the most intimate, since we share more time, space, and energy with that person than any other.

Picturing Hegel,Julie E. Maybee,Rowman & Littlefield,2009,"In her innovative take on G.W. F. Hegel's The Encyclopaedia Logic, Julie E. Maybee uses pictures and diagrams to cut through the philosopher's dense, difficult writing. Picturing Hegel: An Illustrated Guide to Hegel's Encyclopaedia Logic utilizes diagrams in order to rehabilitate Hegel's logic for serious consideration by showing how each stage develops step-by-step from earlier stages according to definite, logical patterns. This interpretation makes Hegel's work accessible and understandable for new and experienced readers alike. Because Hegel uses the same logic in all of his works, Maybee's analysis and defense of the logic will capture the attention of those readers interested in Hegel's ethics, politics, history, philosophy of religion, and phenomenology. Through the included diagrams, Maybee is able to define central Hegelian concepts such as 'being-in-itself, ' and 'being-in-and-for-itself' with a new level of precision. Maybee argues that Hegel's logic does not include the one logistical pattern most often attributed to him; namely, the pattern 'thesis-antithesis-synthesis.' Rather, Hegel's model of logic was more scientific than formalistic in nature, as the philosopher himself pointed out. Hegel considered himself an encyclopedic culmination of Western philosophy in some ways, and indeed his work summarizes many of the presuppositions of Western philosophy. By picturing Hegel's logic, we can gain a greater understanding of ourselves.",Philosophy,672,N/A,0,en

Reduction of the Pareto Set,Vladimir D. Noghin,Springer,2017-09-26,"This book focuses on the issues of decision-making with several numerical criteria. It introduces an original general approach to solving multicriteria problems given quantitative information about the preference relation of a decision-maker. It considers the problems with crisp as well as fuzzy preference relations, accepting the four axioms of “reasonable choice”. Further, it defines the notion of an information quantum about the preference relation of a decision-maker and studies the reduction of the Pareto set using a finite collection of information quanta, demonstrating that the original approach yields a good approximation for the set of nondominated alternatives in a multicriteria problem. Lastly, it analyzes a possible combination of the axiomatic approach with other well-known methods. Intended for a wide range of professionals involved in solving multicriteria problems, including researchers, design engineers, product engineers, developers and analysts, the book is also a valuable resource for undergraduate and postgraduate students of mathematics, economics, and engineering.",Technology & Engineering,248,N/A,0,en
Coastal and Marine Geo-Information Systems,"David R. Green, Stephen D. King",Springer Science & Business Media,2006-04-11,"The emphasis now placed on the concept of sediment cells as boundaries for coastal defence groups, and the development of SMPs, should help CPAs realise the importance of natural processes at the coast when designing defence and protection schemes. However, this will only be the case where defence groups exist, and where CPAs take up the challenge of developing SMPs. Coastal landscapes have been produced by the natural forces of wind, waves and tides, and many are nationally or internationally important for their habitats and natural features. Past practices at the coast, such as the construction of harbours, jetties and traditional defence systems may have contributed to the deterioration of the coast. English Nature (1992) have argued that if practices and methods of coastal defence are allowed to continue, then coastlines would be faced with worsening consequences, including: The loss of mudflats and the birds which live on them Damage to geological Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) and scenic heritage by erosion, due to the stabilisation of the coast elsewhere Cutting of sediment supplies to beaches resulting in the loss of coastal wildlife Cessation through isolation from coastal processes, of the natural operation of spits, with serious deterioration of rare plants, animals and geomorphological and scenic qualities (English Nature, 1992) A number of designations, provided by national and international legislation do exist to aid conservation.",Science,620,N/A,0,en
Don't Call It Love,"Dr. Gregory L. Jantz, Dr. Tim Clinton, Ann McMurray",Revell,2015-08-25,"""You complete me"" may be a romantic line in a popular movie, but it's not a healthy basis for a real relationship. Unfortunately, many people are drawn into relationships that are unfulfilling precisely because they are looking to other people to fill in the places where they are lacking--they are looking for a person who will ""complete"" them. At the heart of relationship dependency is a person's belief that he or she alone is not enough. But using others to provide wholeness simply does not work, because while we are made to be relationship dependent, it is God we must turn to in order to find wholeness. In a warm, engaging style, Drs. Jantz and Clinton walk readers through patterns of relationship dependency, helping them unravel why they are drawn back to the same dry well of unfulfilled relationships over and over again. Readers will discover how to break the cycle, banish their fears, and find wholeness in the God who designed them to be in relationship first and foremost with him, thus freeing them to find healthy relationships with others.

Humans Being is a book dedicated to all who long to find their voice, pursue their passion, and live more fulfilling, creative, and healthier lives. It offers a simple framework in the form of the Universal Soul Grid for reconnecting with unique purpose and voice and for recognizing unconscious choices that block creativity, insight, and lives of ease. The exercises are designed tp provide practice fields for readers to engage at their own pace and to reinforce what it means to live in grace, listen to the heart, and lead a life of clarity and courage. The path to lives of ease and grace is available to all, and yet, not all of us have been engaging all aspects of this path. But its influence and prompting in your life become clear when you look squarely at who you are becoming, the results of your choices, and the relative ease or difficulty of your life. The simple truth in your heart, in whatever form you recognize it, serves your own unique journey. As long as you remember that point, faith and courage more easily follow. The desire to open your eyes and see where you invest your energy to hold yourself back, for whatever reason, becomes a curiosity, rather than a failure. And the possibility of greatness and living your dreams emerges much more clearly.",Health & Fitness,162,N/A,0,en

How Will You Measure Your Life? (Harvard Business Review Classics),Clayton M. Christensen,Harvard Business Review Press,2017-01-17,"In the spring of 2010, Harvard Business School’s graduating class asked HBS professor Clay Christensen to address them—but not on how to apply his principles and thinking to their post-HBS careers. The students wanted to know how to apply his wisdom to their personal lives. He shared with them a set of guidelines that have helped him find meaning in his own life, which led to this now-classic article. Although Christensen’s thinking is rooted in his deep religious faith, these are strategies anyone can use.

The Empowered Life + Part 2,Cassandra Blizzard,Bad Rabbit Publications,2014-06-15,"🌈 Ready to change your life? ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ ""So empowering. Loved the book."" ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ ""The book is well written and keeps you interested. It brings new approaches as well as reminds us of lessons already learned but put aside."" ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ ""Just buy it!"" 🤦🏻‍♀️ There are very few people who escape this physical life without having the experience of feeling like giving up. Life can get so hectic and out of control at times that we feel like we don't have any control at all. What we believe about ourselves becomes our reality; and in so many ways, what we believe about ourselves forms our future. I'm not speaking in airy-fairy, New Age terms here. I am talking about the real deal. 🙍🏻 Our paradigms drive us, one way or the other. You have to willfully choose how you want to be steered. If you are the captain of your boat called life, then your hands need to firmly remain on the wheel that moves the rudder. You can't be the captain of your boat called life if you allow other people to form your paradigms, your beliefs about Self. Don't allow others to shape your beliefs about yourself. Read The Empowered Life. 👍🏻 Success coach Cassandra Blizzard offers an intensive look at how we inadvertently give away our personal power and how we can regroup and bring ourselves back into balance. This book is the culmination of years of working with people and teaching clients how to trust in their Soul, live a more balanced life, and find fulfillment and happiness in the world. Build a bridge of trust with your own Soul, become self-actualized, and take charge of your life like never before. Learn how to get rid of old baggage and break up old belief systems that hold you back, and be bold about moving forward in positive ways. You can have the good life, a balanced life, and an emotionally healthy life. Cassandra shows readers how to appreciate, respect, and value Self, how to lay down positive boundary lines in relationships, and how to transform your life overall. Break through wrong-thinking, overcome obstacles, restore hope, and create personal success. Using this book, together with The Empowered Life: The Workbook, you can transform yourself and your life, reconnect with your Soul, and develop inner peace. 🤸🏻‍♂️ Wouldn’t you like to feel better about your life? Empowerment is just a choice away. Sometimes we make major changes in life just by taking one, small step, or making one, simple decision. But those decisions are not always easy to make. We tend to cater to other people’s whim, or we are afraid of hurting someone’s feelings. Afraid to take a risk, to step out of that dead-end job and aim for something higher. Afraid to make a decision to get out of a bad relationship. Afraid, fearful, anxious. Too often, these are the emotions that rule our lives and make our decisions for us. But it doesn’t have to be that way. You can empower yourself to be more in control of your life, to be more centered, to make more positive decisions for self, and to understand how the soul works in your life to bring you to a better place, always. Whether in business, relationship, or just within yourself, you can learn how to take control and be a much more balanced, much happier person.

Access 2007: The Missing Manual,Matthew MacDonald,"""O'Reilly Media, Inc.""",2006-12-29,"Compared to industrial-strength database products such as Microsoft's SQL Server, Access is a breeze to use. It runs on PCs rather than servers and is ideal for small- to mid-sized businesses and households. But Access is still intimidating to learn. It doesn't help that each new version crammed in yet another set of features; so many, in fact, that even the pros don't know where to find them all. Access 2007 breaks this pattern with some of the most dramatic changes users have seen since Office 95. Most obvious is the thoroughly redesigned user interface, with its tabbed toolbar (or ""Ribbon"") that makes features easy to locate and use. The features list also includes several long-awaited changes. One thing that hasn't improved is Microsoft's documentation. To learn the ins and outs of all the features in Access 2007, Microsoft merely offers online help. Access 2007: The Missing Manual was written from the ground up for this redesigned application. You will learn how to design complete databases, maintain them, search for valuable nuggets of information, and build attractive forms for quick-and-easy data entry. You'll even delve into the black art of Access programming (including macros and Visual Basic), and pick up valuable tricks and techniques to automate common tasks -- even if you've never touched a line of code before. You will also learn all about the new prebuilt databases you can customize to fit your needs, and how the new complex data feature will simplify your life. With plenty of downloadable examples, this objective and witty book will turn an Access neophyte into a true master.",Computers,755,4.5,6,en

Road to Greatness,Pritam S. Sahota Donald A. Assmann Mary Arnella-Venezia Michael Rubell Gulzar S. Sandhu Zbigniew W. Wojcinski,Page Publishing Inc,2022-04-08,"“Greatness” has been defined as a quality of being great, distinguished, or eminent. “Road to Greatness” employs examples of selected individuals who achieved greatness. The road begins with a desire to become successful by creating a personal path to attain exceptional goals. “Genius= 1% Inspiration and 99% Perspiration.” - Thomas Edison (Inventor: He made 1000 unsuccessful attempts before inventing the light bulb.) “Never, never, never, never give up.” – Sir Winston Churchill (Historian, Nobel Prize Winner in Literature (1953) and Prime Minister of the UK during World War-2.) “A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.” – Albert Einstein (Theoretical physicist; Winner of the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics.) “If you can dream it, you can do it.” – Walt Disney (Entrepreneur, animator, writer, film producer; record holder for individual Academy Awards.) “People do not decide to become extraordinary. They decide to accomplish extraordinary things.” Sir Edmund Hillary (Mountaineer, explorer, philanthropist; first climber with Tenzing Norgay to summit Mount Everest in 1953). “Road to Greatness” explores four groupings of over forty success factors that are instrumental in extraordinary achievement: Physical and Mental Fitness Connection of Inner and Outer Circles Constant Learning Skill Development Achieving competence in the success factors enhances an individual’s ability to achieve greatness and can be developed through discipline and deliberate practice by incorporation in small increments into routine activities. True greats consistently grow through self-awareness to overcome their limitations, take on challenges, and endeavor to face the obstacles they encounter. The characteristics and traits that drive greatness are inherent within all of us and can be applied to any field, subject, or discipline. “Road to Greatness” provides a roadmap to create a personalized path to extraordinary achievement for students, parents, teachers and graduates entering the workforce. Although it is uncertain what challenges you will face, the roadmap and exploration of greatness arms you with the tools you will need. As such, only one question remains: Are you willing to embark on your own road to greatness?",Self-Help,164,N/A,0,en
Godunov-type Schemes,V. Guinot,Elsevier,2003-01-29,"Godunov-type schemes appear as good candidates for the next generation of commercial modelling software packages, the capability of which to handle discontinuous solution will be a basic requirement. It is in the interest of practising engineers and developers to be familiar with the specific features of discontinuous wave propagation problems and to be aware of the possibilities offered by Godunov-type schemes for their solution. This book aims to present the principles of such schemes in a way that is easily understandable to practising engineers.The features of hyperbolic conservation laws and their solutions are presented in the first two chapters. The principles of Godunov-type schemes are outlined in a third chapter. Chapters 4 and 5 cover the application of the original Godunov scheme to scalar laws and to hyperbolic systems of conservation laws respectively. Chapter 6 is devoted to higher-order schemes in one dimension of space. The design of such a scheme is described for the general case and applied to some well-known schemes such as the MUSCL and PPM schemes. Chapter 7 focuses on multidimensional problems. The classical alternate directions and finite volume approaches are presented together with the wave splitting technique that is described in depth with an application to two-dimensional systems. Chapter 8 deals with large-time step algorithms. These include front tracking-based methods, explicit-implicit techniques and the time-line interpolation technique.

Forever I Love You,Aleksandar B. Asentić,Author House,2014,"This is about an unusual yet simple issue, a love novel by the name Forever, I Love You. On two hundred pages, top quality paper, perfect design of cover, ""I love you"" is inscribed in red letters immensely many times. This original piece of love writing is a splendid ally in expressing feelings for everyone who is in love but is not so good at the choice of words. All the more, the indication ""forever"" shows that the one who it is presented to can be convinced that they have been given all the love, forever and ever. This is for the reason that everyone has, at least once, been confronted with their consciousness, wondering whether they have said convincingly enough that they love someone they have lost one way or another. That is what makes Forever, I Love You an original gift, which affords the giver the peace of mind and makes the presented one moved at the turning of each page.

I and Thou,Martin Buber,A&C Black,2004-12-09,"'The publication of Martin Buber's I and Thou was a great event in the religious life of the West.' Reinhold Niebuhr Martin Buber (1897-19) was a prolific and influential teacher and writer, who taught philosophy at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem from 1939 to 1951. Having studied philosophy and art at the universities of Vienna, Zurich and Berlin, he became an active Zionist and was closely involved in the revival of Hasidism. Recognised as a landmark of twentieth century intellectual history, I and Thou is Buber's masterpiece. In this book, his enormous learning and wisdom are distilled into a simple, but compelling vision. It proposes nothing less than a new form of the Deity for today, a new form of human being and of a good life. In so doing, it addresses all religious and social dimensions of the human personality.

"I Love Jesus, But I Want to Die",Sarah J. Robinson,WaterBrook,2021-05-11,"A compassionate, shame-free guide for your darkest days “A one-of-a-kind book . . . to read for yourself or give to a struggling friend or loved one without the fear that depression and suicidal thoughts will be minimized, medicalized or over-spiritualized.”—Kay Warren, cofounder of Saddleback Church What happens when loving Jesus doesn’t cure you of depression, anxiety, or suicidal thoughts? You might be crushed by shame over your mental illness, only to be told by well-meaning Christians to “choose joy” and “pray more.” So you beg God to take away the pain, but nothing eases the ache inside. As darkness lingers and color drains from your world, you’re left wondering if God has abandoned you. You just want a way out. But there’s hope. In I Love Jesus, But I Want to Die, Sarah J. Robinson offers a healthy, practical, and shame-free guide for Christians struggling with mental illness. With unflinching honesty, Sarah shares her story of battling depression and fighting to stay alive despite toxic theology that made her afraid to seek help outside the church. Pairing her own story with scriptural insights, mental health research, and simple practices, Sarah helps you reconnect with the God who is present in our deepest anguish and discover that you are worth everything it takes to get better. Beautifully written and full of hard-won wisdom, I Love Jesus, But I Want to Die offers a path toward a rich, hope-filled life in Christ, even when healing doesn’t look like what you expect.",Religion,257,5,1,en

Leaders Eat Last,Simon Sinek,Penguin,2014-01-07,"The New York Times bestseller by the acclaimed, bestselling author of Start With Why and Together is Better. Now with an expanded chapter and appendix on leading millennials, based on Simon Sinek's viral video ""Millenials in the workplace"" (150+ million views). Imagine a world where almost everyone wakes up inspired to go to work, feels trusted and valued during the day, then returns home feeling fulfilled. This is not a crazy, idealized notion. Today, in many successful organizations, great leaders create environments in which people naturally work together to do remarkable things. In his work with organizations around the world, Simon Sinek noticed that some teams trust each other so deeply that they would literally put their lives on the line for each other. Other teams, no matter what incentives are offered, are doomed to infighting, fragmentation and failure. Why? The answer became clear during a conversation with a Marine Corps general. ""Officers eat last,"" he said. Sinek watched as the most junior Marines ate first while the most senior Marines took their place at the back of the line. What's symbolic in the chow hall is deadly serious on the battlefield: Great leaders sacrifice their own comfort--even their own survival--for the good of those in their care. Too many workplaces are driven by cynicism, paranoia, and self-interest. But the best ones foster trust and cooperation because their leaders build what Sinek calls a ""Circle of Safety"" that separates the security inside the team from the challenges outside. Sinek illustrates his ideas with fascinating true stories that range from the military to big business, from government to investment banking.",Business & Economics,370,4,5,en

So says Mark Manson, superstar blogger and author of the international bestseller, The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, a self help book that packs a punch. Mark brings the same approach to teaching men what they need to know about attracting women. In Models he shows us how much it sucks trying to attract women using the tricks and tactics recommended by other books. Instead, he says, men need to focus on seduction as an emotional process not a physical or social one. What matters is the intention, the motivation, the authenticity. To improve your dating life you must improve your emotional life - how you feel about yourself and how you express yourself to others. Funny, irreverent and confronting, Models is a mature and honest guide on how a man can attract women by giving up the bullsh*t and becoming an honest broker.

You're the Only One I Can Tell,Deborah Tannen,Hachette UK,2017-05-02,"A Washington Post Notable Book of 2017. Deborah Tannen's bestselling You Just Don't Understand: Conversations Between Women and Men made us aware of the deep and subtle meanings behind the words we say. She has since explored the way we talk at work, in arguments, to our mothers and our daughters. Now she turns to that most intense, precious and potential minefield: women's friendships. Best friend, old friend, good friend, new friend, neighbour, fellow mother at the school gate, workplace confidante: women's friendships are crucial. A friend can be like a sister, daughter, mother, mentor, therapist or confessor. She can also be the source of pain and betrayal. From casual chatting to intimate confiding, from talking about problems to sharing funny stories, there are patterns of communication and miscommunication that affect friendships. Tannen shows how even the best of friends - with the best intentions - can say the wrong thing, how the ways women friends talk can bring friends closer or pull them apart, but also how words can repair the damage done by words. She explains the power of women friends who show empathy and can just listen; how women use talk to connect - and to subtly compete; how fears of rejection can haunt friendships; how social media is reshaping relationships. Exploring what it means to be friends, helping us hear what we are really saying, understanding how we connect to other people; this illuminating and validating book gets inside the language of one of most women's life essentials - female friendships.",Family & Relationships,310,N/A,0,en

Psychologist Michele Novotni noticed that many of her clients who were working through their anger with people had a parallel need to work through their anger with God. Beneath the psychological issues, many of us also silently struggle with our faith. Yet, we are afraid to give voice to this anger. We're told that ""good"" people, ""people of faith, "" accept what happens without asking questions. Unvoiced thoughts are forced underground, leaving us feeling disconnected from God or even flat-out angry with God -- but unable to do much about it. It's time to break the silence. This book won't try to talk you out of your anger, but it will talk you through it while presenting an image of a compassionate God who continues to love you.",Religion,194,N/A,0,en
Trust Me I'm Lying,Ryan Holiday,Profile Books,2018-02-01,"Recently, fake news has become real news, making headlines as its consequences become crushingly obvious in political upsets and global turmoil. But it's not new - you've seen it all before. A malicious online rumour costs a company millions. Politically motivated 'fake news' stories are planted and disseminated to influence elections. Some product or celebrity zooms from total obscurity to viral sensation. Anonymous sources and speculation become national conversation. What you don't know is that someone is responsible for all this. Usually, someone like Ryan Holiday: a media manipulator. Holiday wrote this book to explain how media manipulators work, how to spot their fingerprints, how to fight them, and how (if you must) to emulate their tactics. Why is he giving away these secrets? Because he's tired of a world where trolls hijack debates, marketers help write the news, reckless journalists spread lies, and no one is accountable for any of it. He's pulling back the curtain because it's time everyone understands how things really work.",Self-Help,369,N/A,0,en

Codependent No More,Melody Beattie,Pan Macmillan,2023-04-13,"Have you lost sight of yourself while addressing the needs of others? Fully revised and updated, with a new chapter on trauma and anxiety, this modern classic – that has already sold over 7 million copies across the globe – will help you heal and grow. Is someone else's problem your problem? If, like so many others, you've lost sight of your own life in the drama of tending to a loved one's self-destructive behaviour, you may be codependent – and you may find yourself in this book. A cultural phenomenon that has helped heal millions of readers, this modern classic holds the key to understanding codependency and unlocking its hold on your life. Melody Beattie's compassionate and insightful look into codependency – the concept of losing oneself in the name of helping another – has helped to guide millions of readers towards the understanding that they are powerless to change anyone but themselves and that caring for the self is where healing begins. With personal reflections, exercises, and instructive stories drawn from Beattie's own life and the lives of those she's counselled, Codependent No More will help you break old patterns and maintain healthy boundaries, and offers a clear and achievable path to healing, hope, freedom and happiness. This revised edition includes an all-new chapter on trauma and anxiety – subjects Beattie has long felt need to be addressed within the context of codependency – making it even more relevant today than it was when it first entered the international conversation over thirty-five years ago.",Self-Help,253,N/A,0,en

Messy Grace,Caleb Kaltenbach,WaterBrook,2015-10-20,"Sometimes, grace gets messy. Caleb Kaltenbach was raised by LGBT parents, marched in gay pride parades as a youngster, and experienced firsthand the hatred and bitterness of some Christians toward his family. But then Caleb surprised everyone, including himself, by becoming a Christian…and a pastor. Very few issues in Christianity are as divisive as the acceptance of the LGBT community in the church. As a pastor and as a person with beloved family members living a gay lifestyle, Caleb had to face this issue with courage and grace. Messy Grace shows us that Jesus’s command to “love your neighbor as yourself” doesn’t have an exception clause for a gay “neighbor”—or for that matter, any other “neighbor” we might find it hard to relate to. Jesus was able to love these people and yet still hold on to his beliefs. So can you. Even when it’s messy. “Messy Grace is an important contribution to the conversation about sexual identity for churches and leaders. Caleb's story is surprising and unique, and he weaves it together compellingly. He states his views clearly, leaves room for disagreement, and champions love no matter where you are in this conversation.” —Jud Wilhite, Sr. Pastor, Central Christian Church",Religion,226,N/A,0,en

This text stresses the idea that professional recognition isn't automatically bestowed upon a person when he or she completes an educational program, obtains a degree or certificate, or secures a license to practice. Recognition as a healthcare professional has to be earned and maintained each and every day. Professionalism is a state of mind, a way of ""being,"" ""knowing,"" and ""doing"" that distinguishes ""exceptional"" workers from the ""ordinary."" Enhancing professionalism has become a major challenge for healthcare educators, employers, and personnel.

Dr. Gary W. Lewandowski Jr. is a nationally recognized expert on the psychology of relationships.

For instance, did you know that . . . To forecast your relationship's future, you are the worst person to ask. Men are the real romantics in heterosexual relationships, not women. The amount of sex you should have to keep your relationship going strong is lower than you think. It's okay to be selfish. Putting me before you, can help both of you. When it comes to closeness, you can have too much of a good thing. Struggles actually strengthen your relationship. In terms of partner support, what you’re not seeing is more important than what you notice. When your relationship doesn't help you become a better person, ending it does. A bold, fresh take on what it means to love and be loved, Stronger Than You Think will help you more confidently and accurately view yourself and your relationship—so that you can fully appreciate the love you have, or find the one you want and deserve.",Family & Relationships,217,N/A,0,en

The Gaslight Effect,Dr. Robin Stern,Harmony,2007-05-01,"In this groundbreaking guide, the prominent therapist Dr. Robin Stern shows how the Gaslight Effect works, how you can decide which relationships can be saved and which you have to walk away from—and how to gasproof your life so you'll avoid gaslighting relationship. Your husband crosses the line in his flirtations with another woman at a dinner party. When you confront him, he asks you to stop being insecure and controlling. After a long argument, you apologize for giving him a hard time. Your mother belittles your clothes, your job, and your boyfriend. But instead of fighting back, you wonder if your mother is right and figure that a mature person should be able to take a little criticism. If you think things like this can’t happen to you, think again. Gaslighting is an insidious form of emotional abuse and manipulation that is difficult to recognize and even harder to break free from. Are you being gaslighted? Check for these telltale signs: 1) Does your opinion of yourself change according to approval or disapproval from your spouse? 2) When your boss praises you, do you feel as if you could conquer the world? 3) Do you dread having small things go wrong at home—buying the wrong brand of toothpaste, not having dinner ready on time, a mistaken appointment written on the calendar? 4) Do you have trouble making simple decisions and constantly second guess yourself? 5) Do you frequently make excuses for your partner's behavior to your family and friends? 6) Do you feel hopeless and joyless?",Psychology,290,5,1,en

Who Would You Be Without Your Story?,Byron Katie,"Hay House, Inc",2008-10-15,"This book is a collection of 15 dialogues that occurred throughout the United States and Europe with Byron Katie. Some of the people who worked with Katie have painful illnesses, others are lovelorn or in messy divorces. Some are simply irritated with a co-worker or worried about money. What they all have in common is a willingness to question, with Katie’s help, the painful thoughts that are the true cause of their suffering. In every case we see how Katie’s acute mind and fierce kindness helps each person dismantle for themselves what is felt to be unshakable reality. Although these dialogues make fascinating reading—some are both hilarious and deeply moving at once—they are intended primarily as teaching tools. Each took place in front of an audience, and Katie never lost connection with that audience, repeatedly reminding each person in the room to follow the dialogues inwardly, asking themselves the questions the participant must ask. The dialogue between Katie and these volunteers is an external enactment of precisely the kind of dialogue each person can have with their own thoughts. The results, even in the seemingly most dire situation, can be unimagined freedom and joy.",Self-Help,338,N/A,0,en

Handbook of Parenting,Marc H. Bornstein,Psychology Press,2005-02-16,"Despite the fact that most people become parents and everyone who has ever lived has had parents, parenting remains a mystifying subject about which almost everyone has opinions, but about which few people agree. Striking permutations on the theme of parenting are emerging--single parenthood, blended families, lesbian and gay parents, and teen versus fifties first-time moms and dads. Divided into four volumes, the Handbook of Parenting is concerned with different types of parents, basic characteristics of parenting, forces that shape parenting, problems faced by parents, and the practical sides of parenting. Contributors have worked in different ways toward understanding all of these diverse aspects of parenting and look to the most recent research and thinking in the field to shed light on many topics every parent has wondered about. Because development is too subtle, dynamic, and intricate to admit that parental caregiving alone determines the course and outcome of ontogeny, volume 1 concerns how children influence parenting. Volume 2 relates parenting to its biological roots and sets parenting in its ecological framework. Volume 3 distinguishes among the cast of characters responsible for parenting and is revealing of the psychological make-ups and social interests of those individuals. Volume 4 describes problems of parenting as well as the promotion of positive parenting practices. Written to be read and absorbed in a single sitting, each chapter addresses a different but central topic in parenting, and is rooted in current thinking and theory as well as classic and modern research on that topic. All chapters follow a standard organization including an introduction to the chapter as a whole followed by historical considerations of the topic, a discussion of central issues and theory, a review of classic and modern research, forecasts of future directions for theory and research, and a conclusion. In addition to considering their own convictions and research, the chapter contributors present and broadly interpret all major points of view and central lines of inquiry.",Education,584,N/A,0,en
Handbook of Parenting: Being and becoming a parent,Marc H. Bornstein,Psychology Press,2002,"Completely revised and expanded from four to five volumes, this new edition of the Handbook of Parenting appears at a time that is momentous in the history of parenting. Parenting and the family are today in a greater state of flux, question, and redefinition than perhaps ever before. We are witnessing the emergence of striking permutations on the theme of parenting: blended families, lesbian and gay parents, and teen versus fifties first-time moms and dads. One cannot but be awed on the biological front by technology that now not only renders postmenopausal women capable of childbearing, but also presents us with the possibility of designing babies. Similarly on the sociological front, single parenthood is a modern day fact of life, adult child dependency is on the rise, and parents are ever less certain of their own roles, even in the face of rising environmental and institutional demands that they take increasing responsibility for their offspring. The Handbook of Parenting concerns itself with: *different types of parents--mothers and fathers, single, adolescent, and adoptive parents; *basic characteristics of parenting--behaviors, knowledge, beliefs, and expectations about parenting; *forces that shape parenting--evolution, genetics, biology, employment, social class, culture, environment, and history; *problems faced by parents--handicap, marital difficulties, drug addiction; and *practical concerns of parenting--how to promote children's health, foster social adjustment and cognitive competence, and interact with school, legal, and public officials. Contributors to the Handbook of Parenting have worked in different ways toward understanding all these diverse aspects of parenting, and all look to the most recent research and thinking in the field to shed light on many topics every parent wonders about. Each chapter addresses a different but central topic in parenting; each is rooted in current thinking and theory, as well as classical and modern research in that topic; each has been written to be read and absorbed in a single sitting. In addition, each chapter follows a standard organization, including an introduction to the chapter as a whole, followed by historical considerations of the topic, a discussion of central issues and theory, a review of classical and modern research, forecasts of future directions of theory and research, and a set of conclusions. Of course, contributors' own convictions and research are considered, but contributions to this new edition present all major points of view and central lines of inquiry and interpret them broadly. The Handbook of Parenting is intended to be both comprehensive and state of the art.

Proverbs,Paul Overland,Inter-Varsity Press,2022-07-21,"Chock-full of pithy sayings, the book of Proverbs presents ancient Israelite advice for leading a flourishing life. What is more, it apparently preserves four divisions of an ancient curriculum for cultivating youthful character, teaching reverence toward God and faithful love of our neighbours. In this comprehensive commentary, Paul Overland examines Proverbs not as a loose collection of isolated sayings, but as an organised whole that forms a series of cohesive poems. Along with a fresh, annotated translation of each saying, he offers detailed commentary on the form and structure of the text, showing the dynamic development of persuasive thinking marshalled by its author. Exploring the practical implications for living wisely today as well offering cogent analysis, this is a Bible commentary on Proverbs that will benefit all preachers and serious students of the Bible. Part of the Apollos Old Testament commentary series, Proverbs follows a clear, helpful structure that provides a thorough exploration of the text – beginning with translation and notes, examining form and structure, offering insightful commentary and ending with a full exposition of the theological message within the framework of biblical theology. It will leave you with a deeper knowledge of the divine and human aspects of Scripture, as well as a broader understanding of its meaning and continued relevance for modern Christians. The Apollos Old Testament Commentaries are ideal bible commentaries for those preaching from the Old Testament and looking to explore its riches in depth within their sermons, and will also help lay people and scholars studying the Bible at a higher level. Clear and discerning, Paul Overland’s commentary on Proverbs is a brilliant study that will give you a profound appreciation for both the poetry of these sayings and the lessons that they can still Christians today.",Religion,888,N/A,0,en

Cultural Sociology of Divorce,Robert E. Emery,SAGE,2013-02-21,"While the formal definition of divorce may be concise and straightforward (legal termination of a marital union, dissolving bonds of matrimony between parties), the effects are anything but, particularly when children are involved. The Americans for Divorce Reform estimates that ""40 or possibly even 50 percent of marriages will end in divorce if current trends continue."" Outside the U.S., divorce rates have markedly increased across developed countries. Divorce and its effects are a significant social factor in our culture and others. It might be said that a whole ""divorce industry"" has been constructed, with divorce lawyers and mediators, family counselors, support groups, etc. As King Henry VIII's divorces showed, divorce has not always been easy or accepted. In some countries, divorce is not permitted and even in Europe, countries such as Spain, Italy, Portugal, and the Republic of Ireland legalized divorce only in the latter quarter of the 20th century. This multi-disciplinary encyclopedia covers curricular subjects related to divorce as examined by disciplines ranging from marriage and the family to anthropology, social and legal history, developmental and clinical psychology, and religion, all through a lens of cultural sociology. Features: 550 signed entries, A-to-Z, fill 3 volumes (1,500 pages) in print and electronic formats, offering the most detailed reference work available on issues related to divorce, both in the U.S. and globally. Cross-References and Further Readings guide readers to additional resources. A Chronology provides students with context via a historical perspective of divorce. In the electronic version, the comprehensive Index combines with Cross-References and thematic Reader's Guide themes to provide convenient search-and-browse capabilities. For state and nation entries, uniform entry structure combined with an abundance of statistics facilitates comparison between and across states and nations. Appendices provide further annotated sources of data and statistics.",Family & Relationships,1625,N/A,0,en
Divine versus Worldly Love,Helena Petrovna Blavatsky,Philaletheians UK,2017-10-28,"Worldly and Devotional Love compared and contrasted. Worldly Love is an intoxication of the Astral Light. It is a state of severe mental perturbation. Divine Love is the Law of Universal Sympathy. Worldly and Devotional Love are the two opposing paths of One Divine Love in the mayavic universe of being. Monosexual consciousness is a characteristic of psychic development. But in spiritual de-velopment consciousness is asexual. The first step in true occultism is to try to apprehend the meaning of Universal Brotherhood. Devotion and aspiration will help to raise consciousness to higher planes, where faith, self-sacrifice, and loyalty to the Teachers is rewarded. Give it all away or you will lose it. Can devotion to inner contemplative life, and a life of fine unselfishness, allow of the growth of faculties otherwise dormant, and a growing recognition of the underlying unity of man and his surroundings, so that truth will make itself known from within, and help one to develop a greater physical command of the forces of nature? Without Esoteric Philosophy guiding the soul, neither meditation nor devotion to duty can make the Wisdom of Love bare her bosom to the inner eye and reveal the sublime secrets of Cosmogony to the multitude.

Encyclopedia of Deception,Timothy R. Levine,SAGE Publications,2014-02-20,"The Encyclopedia of Deception examines lying from multiple perspectives drawn from the disciplines of social psychology, sociology, history, business, political science, cultural anthropology, moral philosophy, theology, law, family studies, evolutionary biology, philosophy, and more. From the “little white lie,” to lying on a resume, to the grandiose lies of presidents, this two-volume reference explores the phenomenon of lying in a multidisciplinary context to elucidate this common aspect of our daily lives. Not only a cultural phenomenon historically, lying is a frequent occurrence in our everyday lives. Research shows that we are likely to lie or intentionally deceive others several times a day or in one out of every four conversations that lasts more than 10 minutes. Key Features: More than 360 authored by key figures in the field are organized A-to-Z in two volumes, which are available in both print and electronic formats. Entries are written in a clear and accessible style that invites readers to explore and reflect on the use of lying and self-deception. Each article concludes with cross references to related entries and further readings. This academic, multi-author reference work will serve as a general, non-technical resource for students and researchers within social and behavioral science programs who seek to better understand the historical role of lying and how it is employed in modern society.",Social Science,1094,N/A,0,en
Sacra Pagina: The Gospel of John,Francis J. Moloney,Liturgical Press,2016-03-18,"No other book of the New Testament has attracted as much attention from commentators as the Fourth Gospel. It has stirred minds, hearts, and imaginations from Christianity's earliest days. In The Gospel of John, Francis Moloney unfolds the identifiable point of view"" of this unique Gospel narrative and offers readers, heirs to its rich and widely varied interpretative traditions, relevance for their lives today. The Gospel of John's significance for Christianity has been obvious from the time of Irenaeus. It was also fundamental in the emergence of Christian theology, especially in the trinitarian and christological debates that produced the great ecumenical Councils, from Nicaea to Chalcedon. What sets this commentary on the Fourth Gospel apart from others is Moloney's particular attention to the narrative design of the Gospel story. He traces the impact the Johannine form of the Jesus story has made on readers and explicates the way in which the author has told the story of Jesus. Through this he demonstrates how the Gospel story articulates a coherent theology, christology, and ecclesiology. """,Religion,570,1,1,en

The Self and Social Relationships,"Joanne V. Wood, Abraham Tesser, John G. Holmes",Psychology Press,2013-05-13,"Although the two major research areas of the ""Self"" and ""Social Relationships"" have flourished, they have done so largely independently of each other. More and more research, however, has indicated that relationships shape the nature of the self and identity, and that self-views influence interpersonal processes and the manner in which people navigate their close relationships. The integration of research on self and social relationships has proved a particularly rich one, generating some of the most creative and insightful theories in psychology. The Self and Social Relationships is the first volume that marks, expedites, and defines this exciting new research synthesis. It serves both as a platform for authors to present their latest ideas on the topic and to encourage continued integration in this emerging field. The contributions represent a diverse set of perspectives from social/personality and clinical psychology. Each chapter covers a topic that is central to the study of self and relationships, and presents some of the most exciting research programs in the field. This volume is essential reading for researchers and students in the areas of both self and relationships.",Psychology,407,N/A,0,en

Feeling tired of romantic relationships with no purpose—or looking to put more spark in your long-term love? Pastor Michael Todd draws on the themes of Relationship Goals to give you a month of biblically rich “let’s go deeper” challenges designed just for couples. We’re not talking simple date ideas or tips on what flowers to buy. We’re talking daily Scripture, intentional questions, and victorious outcomes as you get real about seeking God’s goals for you individually and together. As Michael looks at three key values of romantic relationships—purpose, healing, and oneness—he helps you find answers to questions like these: • How can we communicate with greater intentionality? • How does our relationship affect who we’re becoming as individuals? • How are we going to fight well, with our greater purpose in mind? • How do we find healing for deep-seated issues? • How do our spiritual lives affect our life as a couple? Take the next thirty days to create new habits that will set you down solidly on the road to meeting your relationship goals. At the end of this month-long challenge, you can look back on the goals you’ve already met and set new ones to look forward to. So get ready to win in relationship . . . together.

In addition, I have produced the forthcoming Disciples Literal New Testament (tentative title), which is a simplified version of this book, about one third its size. It is the same translation found in this volume, but now presented in paragraph format (no outline), with interpretive section headings and a few notes. Moving the translation to paragraph format required changes to the punctuation, and these are now incorporated into this volume as well. Some improvements to the outline structure of The New Testament TransLine were also made as an outcome of viewing the text in paragraphs. May God bless you as you study His Word, and may God use these two works according to His good pleasure. In contradiction to the tenor and direction of our current world, the Word of God will stand forever as objective truth corresponding to true reality from God's point of view.

"Perfect Love, Imperfect Relationships",John Welwood,Shambhala Publications,2005-12-27,"A nationally known couples therapist reveals the single root cause of all relationship problems—and offers revolutionary advice on what to do about it While most of us have moments of loving freely and openly, it is often hard to sustain this where it matters most—in our intimate relationships. If love is so great and powerful, why are human relationships so challenging and difficult? If love is the source of happiness and joy, why is it so hard to open to it fully and let it govern our lives? In this book, John Welwood addresses these questions and shows us how to overcome the most fundamental obstacle that keeps us from experiencing love's full flowering in our lives. Perfect Love, Imperfect Relationships begins by showing how all our relational problems arise out of a universal ‘wound of the heart’ that affects not only our personal relationships but the quality of life in our world as a whole. This core wound shows up as a pervasive mood of unlove—a deep sense that we are not intrinsically lovable just as we are. It shuts down our capacity to trust, so that even though we may hunger for love, we have difficulty opening to it and letting it circulate freely through us. This book takes the reader on a powerful journey of healing and transformation that involves learning to embrace these imperfections—within ourselves and within our relationships—as trail-markers along the path to great love. It sets forth a process for releasing deep-seated grievances we hold against others for not loving us better and against ourselves for not being better loved. And it shows how our longing to be loved can magnetize the great love that will free us from looking to others to find ourselves. Written with penetrating realism and a fresh, lyrical style that honors the subtlety and richness of our relationship to love itself, this revolutionary book offers profound and practical guidance for healing our lives as well as our embattled world.",Family & Relationships,219,5,1,en

Healthy Relationships 101,Michael Jascz,Bookbaby,2016-01-08,"Do relationships have to be so difficult? Maybe not. Don't we all want to be more satisfied in our relationships with everyone in our life? Friends, family, co-workers, husband, wife, girlfriend, boyfriend, these are the relationships we most value. When we look at the news, what do we see? Endless stories about how we're all getting along? No Most of what we see is about all the fighting and the disruption in our world? We can choose to be a part of that or we can choose to have relationships that flourish harmoniously. If you drive a car, you bring it in for a tune-up. You take care of your health with check-ups. Where do you go for a relationship check-up? This book is about cultivating and sustaining healthy, thriving, fulfilling and meaningful relationships. The key to this is greater awareness. And it doesn't have to be so difficult. Christine Kiernan-Producer, Thomson Reuters, New York ""I picked up Healthy Relationships 101 on a friend's recommendation. Once I started reading, I couldn't stop until I'd read it cover to cover. Author and Relationship Foundation director Michael Jascz has created a compelling narrative, in which he interweaves personal history and anecdotes from students with clear-cut information and guidelines for becoming a more effective communicator. Among the lessons the book spells out: how to express oneself without placing blame on others; how to empathize and be a better listener; how adverse childhood experiences can affect our present-day relationships - and what we can do to change this. For those of us who did not have the good fortune to pick up effective communication skills in childhood, and for others just wanting a brush-up, this book is an extremely engaging, useful guide. I'd recommend Healthy Relationships 101 to adults, children, school groups, work places - to anyone wanting to improve her/his relationships with others and the world at large."" Barbara Davis Thompson, Psychotherapist, MSW, MA, New York City ""Michael Jascz has written a powerful book that is engagingly readable. No surprise that good relationships are one of the critical elements of a satisfying life. Michael spells this message out smartly and effectively. His book gives example after example from the lives of those emotionally hacked by bullies, uninformed parents and other authority figures whose hurtful words and behavior carry the power to emotionally damage for a life time. His book Healthy Relationships 101 shares transformative information on how to develop the types of relational skills that allow you and yours to tune into the most important needs and wants of oneself and others. Just imagine every child, teacher and parent experiencing being heard and understood. Healthy Relationships 101 is Michael's impassioned dedication to reaching families, teachers, society and the young people of the world. He asks us to meet the challenge of developing ""Relationship Smart"" children and to start now reaching them at the youngest age possible. Michael asks the world to listen up; change is possible. There have been over 80 student incidences of attempted or completed mass murder and suicides taking place since 2010 in our school systems. ""Enough is enough These tragedies can be prevented."" Christine E. Ivey - Licensed Drug Dependency Counselor, Masters in Counseling, San Antonio. Texas ""I am so impressed with your book This piece of work is invaluable. Who isn't in a dysfunctional family these days? Most of our clients have a true addiction and have been masking their emotions with some type of substance and have no clue who they are, much less what a healthy relationship looks like. I am doing an hour and a half workshop using your book. Thanks from the bottom of my heart for what you are doing.""

However, we can no longer use what we weren't taught as reasons not to move forward and experience authentic love and healthy relationships. Instead, we must be intentional. Looking Glass is for women looking to experience a rare glimpse of a man's transparency. To get insight into what men think about dating and relationships from a place of deep reflection and love. Not from a place driven by fear, false perceptions, and hyper-masculinity. This book is also for men looking for better ways to relate to their feelings and articulate them in healthy ways within their relationships. The goal of Looking Glass is to develop common empathy and to build a bridge for deeper communication between the sexes.",Family & Relationships,106,N/A,0,en

Love and Respect in the Family,Dr. Emerson Eggerichs,Thomas Nelson,2013-11-12,"The secret to parenting success is out! Children need love, parents need respect. It's as simple and complex as that. Bestselling author Dr. Emerson Eggerichs has studied family dynamics for more than 30 years, earning a Ph.D. in Child and Family Ecology. As a senior pastor for nearly two decades, he builds on a foundation of strong biblical principles, walking the reader through an entirely new way to approach the family dynamic. When frustrated with an unresponsive child, a parent doesn’t declare, “You don’t love me.” Instead, the parent asserts, “You are being disrespectful right now.” A parent needs to feel respected, especially during conflicts. When upset a child does not whine, “You don’t respect me.” Instead, a child pouts, “You don’t love me.” A child needs to feel loved, especially during disputes. But here’s the rub: An unloved child or teen negatively reacts in a way that feels disrespectful to a parent. A disrespected parent negatively reacts in a way that feels unloving to the child. This dynamic gives birth to the FAMILY CRAZY CYCLE. This book teaches you to: See love and respect as basic family needs Stop the Family Crazy Cycle of conflict Parent in six biblical ways that energize your children Discipline defiance and overlook childishness Be the mature one since parenting is for adults only Become a loving parent in God's eyes, regardless of a child's response Based on what the Bible says about parenting, this book focuses on achieving healthy family dynamics. Dr. Eggerichs offers unprecedented transparency from his wife and three adult children, who share wisdom gained from the good, the bad, and the ugly of their family life. It's all here in this eye-opening exploration of the biblical principles on parenting that can help make families function as God intended.",Religion,296,N/A,0,en

It follows the King of Navarre and his three companions as they attempt to swear off the company of women for three years in order to focus on study and fasting. Their subsequent infatuation with the Princess of France and her ladies makes them forsworn. In an untraditional ending for a comedy, the play closes with the death of the Princess's father, and all weddings are delayed for a year.

Enemies in Love,Alexis Clark,The New Press,2018-05-15,"A “New & Noteworthy” selection of The New York Times Book Review “Alexis Clark illuminates a whole corner of unknown World War II history.” —Walter Isaacson, New York Times bestselling author of Leonardo da Vinci “[A]n irresistible human story. . . . Clark's voice is engaging, and her tale universal.” —Jon Meacham, Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power and American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House A true and deeply moving narrative of forbidden love during World War II and a shocking, hidden history of race on the home front This is a love story like no other: Elinor Powell was an African American nurse in the U.S. military during World War II; Frederick Albert was a soldier in Hitler's army, captured by the Allies and shipped to a prisoner-of-war camp in the Arizona desert. Like most other black nurses, Elinor pulled a second-class assignment, in a dusty, sun-baked—and segregated—Western town. The army figured that the risk of fraternization between black nurses and white German POWs was almost nil. Brought together by unlikely circumstances in a racist world, Elinor and Frederick should have been bitter enemies; but instead, at the height of World War II, they fell in love. Their dramatic story was unearthed by journalist Alexis Clark, who through years of interviews and historical research has pieced together an astounding narrative of race and true love in the cauldron of war. Based on a New York Times story by Clark that drew national attention, Enemies in Love paints a tableau of dreams deferred and of love struggling to survive, twenty-five years before the Supreme Court's Loving decision legalizing mixed-race marriage—revealing the surprising possibilities for human connection during one of history's most violent conflicts.",History,176,5,1,en

More pointedly, contributors discuss how effective research is when it’s demonstrated through acts of reconciliation. Encouraging active, participatory approaches to research, this seminal text includes a range of examples, including a variety of creative forms, such as storytelling, conversations, letters, social media, and visual methodologies that challenge linear ways of thinking and embrace Indigenous ways of knowing and seeing.

For progress in human relationships, he explains that we must give up the punishing, relationship–destroying external control psychology. For example, if you are in an unhappy relationship right now, he proposes that one or both of you could be using external control psychology on the other. He goes further. And suggests that misery is always related to a current unsatisfying relationship. Contrary to what you may believe, your troubles are always now, never in the past.

One Hundred Years of Solitude,Gabriel García Márquez,Blackstone Publishing,2022-10-11,"Netflix’s series adaptation of One Hundred Years of Solitude premieres December 11, 2024! One of the twentieth century’s enduring works, One Hundred Years of Solitude is a widely beloved and acclaimed novel known throughout the world and the ultimate achievement in a Nobel Prize–winning career. The novel tells the story of the rise and fall of the mythical town of Macondo through the history of the Buendía family. Rich and brilliant, it is a chronicle of life, death, and the tragicomedy of humankind. In the beautiful, ridiculous, and tawdry story of the Buendía family, one sees all of humanity, just as in the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, one sees all of Latin America. Love and lust, war and revolution, riches and poverty, youth and senility, the variety of life, the endlessness of death, the search for peace and truth—these universal themes dominate the novel. Alternately reverential and comical, One Hundred Years of Solitude weaves the political, personal, and spiritual to bring a new consciousness to storytelling. Translated into dozens of languages, this stunning work is no less than an account of the history of the human race.",Fiction,342,N/A,0,en

The Mask of Masculinity,Lewis Howes,Rodale,2017-10-31,"A USA Today Bestseller! Standing between you and the man you CAN be is one thing: The Mask of Masculinity. Lewis Howes grew up as an athlete. He was a two-sport All-American, played almost every sport in high school, and went on to play football professionally. Howes then transferred his competitive nature from sports to business, building his podcast, “The School of Greatness,” into a global phenomenon and becoming successful beyond his wildest dreams. But his whole identity was built on misguided beliefs aboutwhat “masculinity” was: dangerous, false ideas learned from teammates and coaches in locker rooms and stereotypes in the media. Like so many men, Howes grew up to be angry, frustrated, and always chasing something that was never enough. At 30 years old, outwardly thriving but unfulfilled inside, Howes began a personal journey to find inner peace and to uncover the many masks that men—young and old—wear: by asking for advice from some of the world’s best psychologists, doctors, and household names like Tony Robbins, Alanis Morissette, and Ray Lewis. That journey created this book—a must read for every man, and for every woman who loves a man. In The Mask of Masculinity, Howes exposes the ultimate emptiness of the Material Mask, the man who chases wealth above all things; the cowering vulnerability that hides behind the Joker and Stoic Masks of men who never show real emotion; and the destructiveness of the Invincible and Aggressive Masks worn by men who take insane risks or can never back down from a fight. He teaches men how to break through the walls that hold them back and shows women how they can better understand the men in their lives. It’s not easy, but if you want to love, be loved, and live a great life, then it’s an odyssey of self-discovery that all modern men must make.",Self-Help,258,N/A,0,en

Why Marriages Succeed or Fail,John Gottman,Simon and Schuster,2012-12-11,"Psychologist John Gottman has spent twenty years studying what makes a marriage last. Now you can use his tested methods to evaluate, strengthen, and maintain your own long-term relationship. This breakthrough book guides you through a series of self-tests designed to help you determine what kind of marriage you have, where your strengths and weaknesses are, and what specific actions you can take to help your marriage. You'll also learn that more sex doesn't necessarily improve a marriage, frequent arguing will not lead to divorce, financial problems do not always spell trouble in a relationship, wives who make sour facial expressions when their husbands talk are likely to be separated within four years and there is a reason husbands withdraw from arguments—and there's a way around it. Dr. Gottman teaches you how to recognize attitudes that doom a marriage—contempt, criticism, defensiveness, and stonewalling—and provides practical exercises, quizzes, tips, and techniques that will help you understand and make the most of your relationship. You can avoid patterns that lead to divorce, and—Why Marriages Succeed or Fail will show you how.",Family & Relationships,240,N/A,0,en
Regulation of and by Pharmacists in the Netherlands and Belgium,Niels Philipsen,Intersentia nv,2003,"This book examines the regulation of pharmacists in the Netherlands and Belgium from the perspective of law and economics. It starts with an extensive and accessible overview of the economic literature with respect to the regulation (including self-regulation) of liberal professions. Subsequently, this book analyses the extent to which the current regulation of Dutch and Belgian pharmacists serves the public interest and the extent to which this regulation is a result of rent-seeking behaviour by private interest groups. The author concludes that some regulation, notably with respect to advertising, design of the pharmacy, establishment of pharmacies and drug prices, does not seem to serve the public interest. Moreover, he criticises the regulation of reimbursement for the pharmacist, which in both countries is still linked to the phar-macists monopoly in the distribution of drugs, despite new tasks of the pharmacist in the field of pharmaceutical care. In addition to a theoretical analysis, the author carries out an empirical research of rent-seeking behaviour in the pharmaceutical market. Although the book studies the situation in the Netherlands and in Belgium, its conclusions will certainly apply to other countries and other professions. The book will therefore be of interest to all economists, lawyers and practitioners interested in regulation of the liberal professions as well as practitioners and academics working in the field of health care.",Pharmacists,211,N/A,0,en
Focus,Daniel Goleman,A&C Black,2013-10-08,"Bestselling author Daniel Goleman returns with a groundbreaking look at the secret to high performance and fulfillment: attention. 'A highly readable manifesto for turning our smartphones off once in a while' Financial Times For more than two decades, psychologist and journalist Daniel Goleman has been scouting the leading edge of the human sciences for what's new, surprising and important. In Focus, Goleman delves into the science of attention in all its varieties, presenting a long overdue discussion of this little-noticed and underrated mental asset that matters enormously for how we navigate life. Goleman boils down attention research into a three parts: inner, other, and outer focus. Goleman shows why high-achievers need all three kinds of focus, as demonstrated by rich case studies from fields as diverse as competitive sports, education, the arts, and business. Those who excel rely on what Goleman calls 'Smart Practices' such as mindfulness meditation, focused preparation and recovery, positive emotions and connections, and mental 'prosthetics' which help them improve habits, add new skills, and sustain excellence. Combining cutting-edge research with practical findings, Focus reveals what distinguishes experts from amateurs and stars from average performers.",Business & Economics,306,N/A,0,en
Principles,Ray Dalio,Simon and Schuster,2018-08-07,"#1 New York Times Bestseller “Significant...The book is both instructive and surprisingly moving.” —The New York Times Ray Dalio, one of the world’s most successful investors and entrepreneurs, shares the unconventional principles that he’s developed, refined, and used over the past forty years to create unique results in both life and business—and which any person or organization can adopt to help achieve their goals. In 1975, Ray Dalio founded an investment firm, Bridgewater Associates, out of his two-bedroom apartment in New York City. Forty years later, Bridgewater has made more money for its clients than any other hedge fund in history and grown into the fifth most important private company in the United States, according to Fortune magazine. Dalio himself has been named to Time magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Along the way, Dalio discovered a set of unique principles that have led to Bridgewater’s exceptionally effective culture, which he describes as “an idea meritocracy that strives to achieve meaningful work and meaningful relationships through radical transparency.” It is these principles, and not anything special about Dalio—who grew up an ordinary kid in a middle-class Long Island neighborhood—that he believes are the reason behind his success. In Principles, Dalio shares what he’s learned over the course of his remarkable career. He argues that life, management, economics, and investing can all be systemized into rules and understood like machines. The book’s hundreds of practical lessons, which are built around his cornerstones of “radical truth” and “radical transparency,” include Dalio laying out the most effective ways for individuals and organizations to make decisions, approach challenges, and build strong teams. He also describes the innovative tools the firm uses to bring an idea meritocracy to life, such as creating “baseball cards” for all employees that distill their strengths and weaknesses, and employing computerized decision-making systems to make believability-weighted decisions. While the book brims with novel ideas for organizations and institutions, Principles also offers a clear, straightforward approach to decision-making that Dalio believes anyone can apply, no matter what they’re seeking to achieve. Here, from a man who has been called both “the Steve Jobs of investing” and “the philosopher king of the financial universe” (CIO magazine), is a rare opportunity to gain proven advice unlike anything you’ll find in the conventional business press.",Business & Economics,560,5,1,en

The Gifts of Imperfection,Brené Brown,Simon and Schuster,2022-03-01,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • This tenth-anniversary edition of the game-changing #1 New York Times bestseller features a new foreword and new tools to make the work your own. For over a decade, Brené Brown has found a special place in our hearts as a gifted mapmaker and a fellow traveler. She is both a social scientist and a kitchen-table friend whom you can always count on to tell the truth, make you laugh, and, on occasion, cry with you. And what’s now become a movement all started with The Gifts of Imperfection, which has sold more than two million copies in thirty-five different languages across the globe. What transforms this book from words on a page to effective daily practices are the ten guideposts to wholehearted living. The guideposts not only help us understand the practices that will allow us to change our lives and families, they also walk us through the unattainable and sabotaging expectations that get in the way. Brené writes, “This book is an invitation to join a wholehearted revolution. A small, quiet, grassroots movement that starts with each of us saying, ‘My story matters because I matter.’ Revolution might sound a little dramatic, but in this world, choosing authenticity and worthiness is an absolute act of resistance.”",Self-Help,188,4,1,en
How to Fix a Broken Heart,Guy Winch,Simon and Schuster,2018-02-13,"Imagine if we treated broken hearts with the same respect and concern we have for broken arms? Psychologist Guy Winch urges us to rethink the way we deal with emotional pain, offering warm, wise, and witty advice for the broken-hearted. Real heartbreak is unmistakable. We think of nothing else. We feel nothing else. We care about nothing else. Yet while we wouldn’t expect someone to return to daily activities immediately after suffering a broken limb, heartbroken people are expected to function normally in their lives, despite the emotional pain they feel. Now psychologist Guy Winch imagines how different things would be if we paid more attention to this unique emotion—if only we can understand how heartbreak works, we can begin to fix it. Through compelling research and new scientific studies, Winch reveals how and why heartbreak impacts our brain and our behavior in dramatic and unexpected ways, regardless of our age. Emotional pain lowers our ability to reason, to think creatively, to problem solve, and to function at our best. In How to Fix a Broken Heart he focuses on two types of emotional pain—romantic heartbreak and the heartbreak that results from the loss of a cherished pet. These experiences are both accompanied by severe grief responses, yet they are not deemed as important as, for example, a formal divorce or the loss of a close relative. As a result, we are often deprived of the recognition, support, and compassion afforded to those whose heartbreak is considered more significant. Our heart might be broken, but we do not have to break with it. Winch reveals that recovering from heartbreak always starts with a decision, a determination to move on when our mind is fighting to keep us stuck. We can take control of our lives and our minds and put ourselves on the path to healing. Winch offers a toolkit on how to handle and cope with a broken heart and how to, eventually, move on.",Psychology,128,N/A,0,en

Friends,Robin Dunbar,Abacus,2022-05-31,"'Fascinating...In essence, the number and quality of our friendships may have a bigger influence on our happiness, health and mortality risk than anything else in life save for giving up smoking' Guardian, Book of the Day Friends matter to us, and they matter more than we think. The single most surprising fact to emerge out of the medical literature over the last decade or so has been that the number and quality of the friendships we have has a bigger influence on our happiness, health and even mortality risk than anything else except giving up smoking. Robin Dunbar is the world-renowned psychologist and author who famously discovered Dunbar's number: how our capacity for friendship is limited to around 150 people. In Friends, he looks at friendship in the round, at the way different types of friendship and family relationships intersect, or at the complex of psychological and behavioural mechanisms that underpin friendships and make them possible - and just how complicated the business of making and keeping friends actually is. Mixing insights from scientific research with first person experiences and culture, Friends explores and integrates knowledge from disciplines ranging from psychology and anthropology to neuroscience and genetics in a single magical weave that allows us to peer into the incredible complexity of the social world in which we are all so deeply embedded. Working at the coalface of the subject at both research and personal levels, Robin Dunbar has written the definitive book on how and why we are friends.",Family & Relationships,432,N/A,0,en
Being Aware of Being Aware,Rupert Spira,New Harbinger  Publications,2017-11-01,"Everybody is aware, all seven billion of us. We are aware of thoughts, feelings, sensations, and perceptions. All people share the experience of being aware, but relatively few people are aware that they are aware. Most people’s lives consist of a flow of thoughts, images, ideas, feelings, sensations, sights, sounds, and so on. Very few people ask, 'What is it that knows this flow of thoughts, feelings, and perceptions? With what am I aware of my experience?' The knowing of our being—or rather, awareness’s knowing of its own being in us—is our primary, fundamental and most intimate experience. It is in this experience that the peace, happiness and love for which all people long reside. The happiness we have sought so long outside of ourselves, in situations, objects and relationships, turns out to be always present and available in the simple knowing of our own being as it truly is. The knowing of our own being shines in each of us as the experience ‘I am’ or ‘I am aware’, or simply the knowledge ‘I’. This obvious, familiar and intimate experience has no objective qualities and is, therefore, overlooked or ignored by the majority of people. This overlooking of our own being is the ultimate cause of unhappiness. What is the nature of the experience of being aware or awareness itself? The exploration of this question is the subject matter of this book and the essence of the Direct Path to peace and happiness. * * * The Essence of Meditation Series presents meditations on the essential, non-dual understanding that lies at the heart of all the great religious and spiritual traditions, compiled from contemplations led by Rupert Spira at his meetings and retreats. This simple, contemplative approach, which encourages a clear seeing of one’s experience rather than any kind of effort or discipline, leads the reader to an experiential understanding of their own essential being and the peace and fulfillment that are inherent within it.

Principia Amoris,John Mordechai Gottman,Routledge,2014-10-10,"Stereotypically, science and emotion are diametric opposites: one is cold and unfeeling, the other soft and nebulous; one is based on proven facts while the other is based on inexplicable feelings and “never the twain shall meet,” until now. John Gottman delves into the unquantifiable realm of love, armed with science and logic, and emerges with the knowledge that relationships can be not only understood, but also predicted as well. Based on research done at his Love Lab and other laboratories, Gottman has discovered that the future of love relationships can be predicted with a startling 91% success rate. These predictions can help couples to prevent disasters in their relationships, recognize the signs of a promising relationship, and perhaps more importantly, recognize the signs of a doomed one. Principia Amoris also introduces Love Equations, a mathematical modeling of relationships that helps understand predictions. Love Equations are powerful tools that can prevent relationship distress and heal ailing relationships. Readers learn about the various research and studies that were done to discover the science behind love, and are treated to a history of the people, ideas, and events that shaped our current understanding. They also learn about: • The “Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse” • 45 natural principles of love • 5 couple types • 5 recipes for good relationships • And much more! Just as science helped us to understand the physical world, it is helping us to understand the emotional world as well. Using the insights in this book, mental health professionals can meaningfully help their distressed clients, as well as better understand why a relationship is failing or succeeding. Appropriate for the curious non-mental health professional as well, Principia Amoris is a must-have on any bookshelf!",Psychology,457,N/A,0,en

The Semantics of Relationships,"R. Green, C.A. Bean, Sung Hyon Myaeng",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-04-18,"The genesis of this volume was the participation of the editors in an ACMlSIGIR (Association for Computing Machinery/Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval) workshop entitled ""Beyond Word Relations"" (Hetzler, 1997). This workshop examined a number of relationship types with significance for information retrieval beyond the conventional topic-matching relationship. From this shared participation came the idea for an edited volume on relationships, with chapters to be solicited from researchers and practitioners throughout the world. Ultimately, one volume became two volumes. The first volume, Relationships in the Organization of Knowledge (Bean & Green, 200 I), examines the role of relationships in knowledge organization theory and practice, with emphasis given to thesaural relationships and integration across systems, languages, cultures, and disciplines. This second volume examines relationships in a broader array of contexts. The two volumes should be seen as companions, each informing the other. As with the companion volume, we are especially grateful to the authors who willingly accepted challenges of space and time to produce chapters that summarize extensive bodies of research. The value of the volume clearly resides in the quality of the individual chapters. In naming this volume The Semantics of Relationships: An Interdisciplinary Perspective, we wanted to highlight the fact that relationships are not just empty connectives.

One of the goals is to highlight some examples of research that illustrate facets of the important boundary area between social and developmental psychology. The book opens with a chapter that deals with the broad issues of boundary areas in psychology, ending with specific consideration of the boundary between social and developmental psychology. This is followed by separate chapters that consider general propositions regarding the importance of integrating concepts and methods from social and developmental psychology in the study of social relationships; show how integrating social and developmental considerations can assist in the understanding of relationships between parents and children; and apply developmental and social concepts to identify and study some of the aspects of the marital relationship that may lead to its dissolution.

Romance and Sex in Adolescence and Emerging Adulthood,"Alan Booth, Ann C.

The text offers interdisciplinary expertise from scholars of psychology, social work, sociology, demography, economics, human development and family studies, and public policy. Adolescents and young adults today face very different choices about family formation than did their parents’ generation, given such societal changes as the rise in cohabitation, the increase in divorce rates, and families having fewer children. This book examines these demographic trends and provides a backdrop against which adolescents and emerging adults form and maintain romantic and sexual relationships. This book addresses such questions as: *What are the ways in which early family and peer relationships give rise to romantic relationships in the late adolescent and early adult years? *How do early romantic and sexual relationships influence individuals’ subsequent development and life choices, including family formation? *To what extent are current trends in romantic and sexual relationships in adolescence and emerging adulthood problematic for individuals, families, and communities, and what are the most effective ways to address these issues at the level of practice, program, and policy?

Bisexual and Gay Husbands,"Fritz Klein, Thomas R Schwartz",Routledge,2014-02-04,"What happens when married men face their gay/bisexual needs?This astonishing volume offers an intimate look into the lives and thoughts of bisexual men. Already married to women, these men are undeniably attracted to other men. Their struggle with conflicting needs, desires, and loyalties is not filtered through theories or evoked in brief interviews. It comes straight from their own keyboards. The stories told in Bisexual and Gay Husbands are taken from an Internet mailing list, which allows people to speak freely and in anonymity, yet also encourages the development of a tightly knit community. Men at all stages of the coming-out process share their experiences, their secrets, their pain, shame, anger, and hope.One man writes, “I have found the answer to my bisexual needs and am afraid to embrace it. I need help and advice to know what to do. What you people have done in your lives may hold the key to helping me decide on a course of action. I am either going to create a dream come true or hell on earth as I destroy my marriage. I can’t tell which, and of course you can’t either. But you CAN tell me how you are handling the problems I am facing.”Bisexual and Gay Husbands includes advice and information on the issues that touch these men most deeply, including: how do I tell my wife and kids? what does it mean to self-identify as bisexual or gay? what kinds of relationships do I want with men? can triads work? how do I deal with my children’s reaction? do I have to leave my wife? The insight, intelligence, and honesty revealed in Bisexual and Gay Husbands make it a riveting read, but it also has great clinical and historic value for therapists, sex theorists, and bisexual men and their families.",Family & Relationships,512,N/A,0,en

Encyclopedia of Adolescence,Roger J.R. Levesque,Springer Science & Business Media,2014-07-08,"The Encyclopedia of Adolescence breaks new ground as an important central resource for the study of adolescence. Comprehensive in breath and textbook in depth, the Encyclopedia of Adolescence – with entries presented in easy-to-access A to Z format – serves as a reference repository of knowledge in the field as well as a frequently updated conduit of new knowledge long before such information trickles down from research to standard textbooks. By making full use of Springer’s print and online flexibility, the Encyclopedia is at the forefront of efforts to advance the field by pushing and creating new boundaries and areas of study that further our understanding of adolescents and their place in society. Substantively, the Encyclopedia draws from four major areas of research relating to adolescence. The first broad area includes research relating to ""Self, Identity and Development in Adolescence"". This area covers research relating to identity, from early adolescence through emerging adulthood; basic aspects of development (e.g., biological, cognitive, social); and foundational developmental theories. In addition, this area focuses on various types of identity: gender, sexual, civic, moral, political, racial, spiritual, religious, and so forth. The second broad area centers on ""Adolescents’ Social and Personal Relationships"". This area of research examines the nature and influence of a variety of important relationships, including family, peer, friends, sexual and romantic as well as significant nonparental adults. The third area examines ""Adolescents in Social Institutions"". This area of research centers on the influence and nature of important institutions that serve as the socializing contexts for adolescents. These major institutions include schools, religious groups, justice systems, medical fields, cultural contexts, media, legal systems, economic structures, and youth organizations. ""Adolescent Mental Health"" constitutes the last major area of research. This broad area of research focuses on the wide variety of human thoughts, actions, and behaviors relating to mental health, from psychopathology to thriving. Major topic examples include deviance, violence, crime, pathology (DSM), normalcy, risk, victimization, disabilities, flow, and positive youth development.",Psychology,3161,N/A,0,en

The Relationship between Ethiopia and Sudan. With Particular References to South Sudan from 1950s to 2011,Fekede Sileshi,GRIN Verlag,2022-08-31,"Seminar paper from the year 2022 in the subject History - Africa, grade: A, , course: History, language: English, abstract: The main aim of this seminar paper is to discuss the Ethiopia-Sudan Relationship: With Particular References to South Sudan from the 1950s, when the first South Sudanese civil war began, to South Sudan's independence in 2011. Ethiopia and Sudan have a long historical relationship dating back to ancient times. Ethiopia's border with Sudan is the longest of its kind, and the two countries have a strong people-to-people relationship. The colonial border demarcation was carried out by colonial officials to advance their interests while disregarding the needs of the local people, which worsened tensions along the borderland. Various treaties signed during the colonial era defined the majority of the border between Sudan and Ethiopia, but clarity has been lacking. The two country's relations have fluctuated between cordial friendship and antagonistic confrontation. Due to ideological differences between the ruling elites, the relationship was characterized by one party interfering in the internal affairs of the other, and both began assisting rebels in their respective countries: Ethiopia supported the SPLA, and Khartoum also supported Eritrean and Tigrayan rebel movements within Ethiopia. Mutual mistrust, suspicion, and uncertainty have undermined good neighbourly relations for the majority of the time under consideration. The Nile River and its tributaries were exclusively allocated to Egypt and Sudan under a 1959 agreement, which denied any water rights to other riparian states, which is the main point of contention between Ethiopia, Sudan, and Egypt. Both superpowers used replacements as proxies in the Horn of Africa during the Cold War. Sudan became an important American client from 1976 until the Cold War's end, and Ethiopia became the largest recipient of Soviet foreign aid in 1979. After a long period of struggle, Southern Sudan held a referendum from the 9th to the 15th of January 2011 on whether it should remain a part of Sudan or become independent and with a majority of per cent voting in favour of independence. This seminar paper provides insights into the issues raised above, as well as others related to Ethiopia and Sudan's relationship: With Particular Reference to South Sudan between the aforementioned epochs.",History,32,N/A,0,en
Following the Master,Michael J. Wilkins,Zondervan,2010-08-03,"In the aftermath of the waves of discipleship programs that have swept over the church in the last 30 years, clergy, and laypersons alike are more confused than ever about what it means to be a disciple of Jesus Christ. What should a disciple of Jesus look and act like today? What is the relationship between discipleship and salvation, between discipleship and sanctification, between discipleship and ministry? How were disciples of Jesus different from other disciples in the ancient world? How did the early church carry out Jesus' agenda in ""making disciples of all the nations""? In Following the Master, Michael J. Wilkins addresses these and many other questions that perplex the church today- not by offering another discipleship program or manual but by presenting a comprehensive biblical theology of discipleship. Following the Master compares other forms of master-disciple relationships in existence in the ancient Judaism and Greco-Roman world, traces Jesus' steps as he called and developed disciples, and Mediterranean world as it followed Jesus' command to make disciples.

Relationship-based Social Work with Adults,"Heidi Dix, Dr. Sue Hollinrake, Jennifer Meade",Critical Publishing,2019-07-04,"There has been a resurgent interest in relationship-based practice and the Care Act 2014 recognises the significance of effective working relationships with service users and carers to ensure a person-centred approach and effective participation and co-production. The Care Act advocates a strengths-based, whole family approach to assessment, care and support planning. Relationship, putting the person at the centre of the process, lies at the heart of this approach. This book is a practice-based exploration of relationship-based practice for social work with adults that looks at underpinning theory, legislation and policy drivers, value perspectives and skills in practice. The first part of the book introduces relationship-based practice and theoretical concepts, such as psycho-social and psycho-dynamically informed approaches to practice which highlight the complexities of relationships, at conscious and unconscious levels, both from the service user/carer perspective and the professional's perspective, where reflection and use of self are key; it critically explores the legislation and policy context. A conceptual model called IDEAS is introduced which provides a framework for the second part of the book, by breaking down the discussion into relevant practice issues. Here theory, skills and values are applied through case examples to illustrate the efficacy of relationship-based practice across a range of practice settings in social work with adult service users and carers.",Social Science,235,N/A,0,en

Handbook of Family Theories,"Mark A. Fine, Frank D. Fincham",Routledge,2013-03-05,"Organized by content areas rather than by theory, this comprehensive, accessible handbook helps readers gain greater insight into how key theories have impacted today’s family research. Most competing books, organized by theory, do not provide a strong sense of the links between theory and research. Using the 2000 and 2010 decade-in-review issues of the Journal of Marriage and Family as a resource, the book addresses the most important topics impacting family studies research today. The introductory chapter, written by the editors, provides an overview of the role family theories have had on the field. This chapter is followed by 23 others on family-related content areas written by renowned scholars in the field. The book is organized around the most important domains in the field: parenting and parent-child relationships, romantic relationships, conflict and aggression, structural variation and transitions, demographic variations, and families and extra-familial institutions. Each of the contributors describes how theory has been used to generate new knowledge in the field and suggests future directions for how theory may be used to extend our knowledge base. The book helps readers acquire a working knowledge of the key family science theories, findings, and issues and understand how researchers make use of these theories in their empirical efforts. To maximize accessibility, each of the renowned contributors addresses a common set of issues in their chapter: • Introduction to the content area • Review of the key topics, issues, and findings • A description of each of the major theories used to study that particular content area • Limitations of the theories • Suggestions for better use of the theories and/or new theoretical advances • Conclusions about future theoretical developments. An ideal text for graduate and/or advanced undergraduate family theories courses, this book’s unique organization also lends itself to use in content-based family studies/science courses taught in family studies, human development, psychology, sociology, communication, education, and nursing. Due to its comprehensive and current approach, the book also appeals to scholars and researchers in these areas.",Psychology,514,N/A,0,en

The Oxford Handbook of Causal Reasoning,Michael Waldmann,Oxford University Press,2017-03-30,"Causal reasoning is one of our most central cognitive competencies, enabling us to adapt to our world. Causal knowledge allows us to predict future events, or diagnose the causes of observed facts. We plan actions and solve problems using knowledge about cause-effect relations. Although causal reasoning is a component of most of our cognitive functions, it has been neglected in cognitive psychology for many decades. The Oxford Handbook of Causal Reasoning offers a state-of-the-art review of the growing field, and its contribution to the world of cognitive science. The Handbook begins with an introduction of competing theories of causal learning and reasoning. In the next section, it presents research about basic cognitive functions involved in causal cognition, such as perception, categorization, argumentation, decision-making, and induction. The following section examines research on domains that embody causal relations, including intuitive physics, legal and moral reasoning, psychopathology, language, social cognition, and the roles of space and time. The final section presents research from neighboring fields that study developmental, phylogenetic, and cultural differences in causal cognition. The chapters, each written by renowned researchers in their field, fill in the gaps of many cognitive psychology textbooks, emphasizing the crucial role of causal structures in our everyday lives. This Handbook is an essential read for students and researchers of the cognitive sciences, including cognitive, developmental, social, comparative, and cross-cultural psychology; philosophy; methodology; statistics; artificial intelligence; and machine learning.",Psychology,769,N/A,0,en
Conceptualizing and Measuring Father Involvement,"Randal D. Day, Michael E.

The results shed new light on childhood development and question conventional wisdom by showing that beyond providing the more traditional economic support of the family, fathers do indeed matter when it comes to raising a child. Stemming from a series of workshops and publications sponsored by the Family and Child Well-Being Network, under the federal fatherhood initiative of the National Institute of Child Health and Development, this comprehensive volume focuses on ways of measuring the efficacy of father involvement in different scenarios, using different methods of assessment and different populations. In the process, new research strategies and new parental paradigms have been formulated to include paternal involvement. Moreover, this volume contains articles from a variety of influences while addressing the task of finding the missing pieces of the fatherhood construct that would work for new age, as well as traditional and minority fathers.

I Can See Clearly Now,Dr. Wayne W. Dyer,"Hay House, Inc",2015-02-24,"For many years, Dr. Wayne W. Dyer’s fans have wondered when he would write a memoir. Well, after four decades as a teacher of self-empowerment and the best-selling author of more than 40 books, Wayne has finally done just that! However, he has written it in a way that only he can—with a remarkable take-home message for his longtime followers and new readers alike—and the result is an exciting new twist on the old format. Rather than a plain old memoir, Wayne has gathered together quantum-moment recollections.In this revealing and engaging book, Wayne shares dozens of events from his life, from the time he was a little boy in Detroit up to present day. In unflinching detail, he relates his vivid impressions of encountering many forks in the road, taking readers with him into these formative experiences. Yet then he views the events from his current perspective, noting what lessons he ultimately learned, as well as how he has made the resulting wisdom available to millions via his lifelong dedication to service. As a reader, you will feel as if you are right there with Wayne, perusing his personal photo album and hearing about his family, his time in the service, how he writes his best-selling books, and so much more.In the process, you’ll be inspired to look back at your own life to see how everything you have experienced has led you to where you are right now. Wayne has discovered that there are no accidents. Although we may not be aware of who or what is""moving the checkers,"" life has a purpose, and each step of our journey has something to teach us. As he says, ""I wasn’t aware of all of the future implications that these early experiences were to offer me. Now, from a position of being able to see much more clearly, I know that every single encounter, every challenge, and every situation are all spectacular threads in the tapestry that represents and defines my life, and I am deeply grateful for all of it."" I Can See Clearly Now is an intimate look at an amazing teacher, but it also holds the key for seekers on a personal path of enlightenment.

To restore the same balance that characterizes everything in our universe, you have to take up the weighty thoughts so that they match up to your desires. The seasons reflect the overall harmony of life. For example, winter passes and the blossoms emerge. This is balanced by a need to have the trees rest, so autumn arrives on time and helps the trees ready themselves for another period of repose. This book is dedicated to the idea that we’re a vital component of this creative process and have within ourselves the wherewithal to create all that we want if we recognize and revise out-of-balance thoughts.",Self-Help,174,N/A,0,en

Development and Vulnerability in Close Relationships,"Gil G. Noam, Kurt W. Fischer",Psychology Press,2013-06-17,"How do people develop in their important relationships? How do two people come together to form a new, close relationship? How do relationships affect or determine who we are and who we become? These questions should be central to the study of mind and development, but most researchers neglect relationships and focus instead on analyses of individuals, as if people were basically alone, experiencing occasional fleeting moments with other people. Research based on this individualist assumption has dominated the behavioral and clinical sciences, but there are other voices, and they are growing. In this book, many of the scholars who are moving relationships and attachments back to the center of human development outline their central concepts, findings, and perspectives. People are fundamentally social, and relationships are part of the fabric of being human, forming an essential foundation that molds each person's mind and action. A mind does not reside in one person but in relationships and communities, composed of many people's interconnected minds, which mutually support and define each other. From the start and throughout life, each person develops strengths and vulnerabilities in important relationships in communities and cultures. Those relationships are so central to each person's activity and experience that without them, no scientific explanation can even begin to analyze mind and action. There is no mind without other people. There is no psychological vulnerability that does not involve others. The contributors to this book aim to establish a firm foundation for the role of relationships in human activity and health and to promote strong research by bringing together in one place most of the best research and theory on development and relationships. Their goal is to stimulate a more radical inclusion of relationships in mind, an ecological focus on the ways that relationships constitute action, feeling, and thought.",Psychology,376,N/A,0,en
"The Empowered Wife, Updated and Expanded Edition",Laura Doyle,"BenBella Books, Inc.",2017-03-28,"Can a wife single-handedly bring a boring or broken marriage back to life? This improved and expanded edition of Laura Doyle's acclaimed First, Kill All the Marriage Counselors features real-life success stories from empowered wives who have done just that—and provides a step-by-step guide to revitalizing your own marriage. Laura Doyle's marriage was in trouble, and couples counseling wasn't helping.

Weaving Relationships,Kathryn Anderson,Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press,2006-01-01,"Weaving Relationships tells the remarkable, little-known story of a movement that transcends barriers of geography, language, culture, and economic disparity. The story begins in the early 1980s, when 200,000 Maya men, women, and children crossed the Guatemalan border into Mexico, fleeing genocide by the Guatemalan army and seeking refuge. A decade later, many of the refugees returned to their homeland along with 140 Canadians, members of “Project Accompaniment”. The Canadians were there, by their side, to provide companionship and, more significantly, as an act of solidarity. Weaving Relationships describes the historical roots of this solidarity focusing on the Maya in Guatemala. It relates the story of “Project Accompaniment” and two of its founders in Canada, the Christian Task Force on Central America and the Maritimes-Guatemala “Breaking the Silence” Network. It reveals solidarity’s impact on the Canadians and Guatemalans whose lives have been changed by the experience of relationships across borders. It presents solidarity not as a work of charity apart from or “for” them but as a bond of mutuality, of friendship and common struggle with those who are marginalized, excluded, and impoverished in this world. This book speaks of a spirituality based on community and justice, and challenges the church to move beyond its preoccupation with its own survival to solidarity with those who are suffering. It is a book about hope in the face of death and despair.",Religion,345,N/A,0,en

Neale Donald Walsch on Relationships,Neale Donald Walsch,Hampton Roads Publishing,1999-10-01,"The bestselling author of the Conversations with God series discusses the purpose of relationships in our lives, and how we can improve them and ourselves. We are all involved in relationships. Indeed we are all in relationships with everything and everyone, all of the time. We have a relationship with ourselves, with our family, with our environment, with our work, with each other. Everything that we know and experience about ourselves, we understand within the context created by our relationships. For this reason, relationships are sacred—all relationships. And somewhere within the deepest reaches of our hearts and soul, we know it. That is why we yearn so for relationships—and for relationships of meaning. It is also, no doubt, why we have such trouble with them. At some level, we must be very clear how much is at stake. Yet it is possible to have joyful relationships. In Neale Donald Walsch on Relationships, the author examines the patterns that hinder our ability to build and maintain successful relationships. He teaches us to move beyond restrictive ways of relating. He also explores different types of relationships—with God, with self, with others—demonstrating how they all affect and enhance each other.

Geometrical Relationships of Macroscopic Nuclear Physics,"Rainer W. Hasse, William D. Myers",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The aim of this book is to provide a single reference source for the wealth of geometrical formulae and relationships that have proven useful in the descrip tion of atomic nuclei and nuclear processes. While many of the sections may be useful to students and instructors it is not a text book but rather a reference book for experimentalists and theoreticians working in this field. In addition the authors have avoided critical assessment of the material presented except, of course, by variations in emphasis. The whole field of macroscopic (or Liquid Drop Model) nuclear physics has its origins in such early works as [Weizsacker 35] and [Bohr 39]. It continued to grow because of its success in explaining collective nuclear excitations [Bohr 52] and fission (see the series of papers culminating in [Cohen 62]). These develop ments correspond to the first maximum in the histogram below, showing the distribution by year of the articles cited in our Bibliography. After the Liquid Drop Model had been worked out in some detail the development of the Struti nsky approach [Strutinsky 68] (which associates single particle contributions to the binding energy with the shape of the nucleus) gave new life to the field. The growth of interest in heavy-ion reaction studies has also contributed.",Science,148,N/A,0,en

The Importance of Connectedness in Student-Teacher Relationships,Irene García-Moya,Springer Nature,2020-05-15,"This book argues for the importance of connectedness in student-teacher relationships during adolescence and advocates a more holistic and proactive approach to wellbeing in education. Combining education, psychology and health promotion perspectives, the book begins by providing an overview of theoretical frameworks in the study of student-teacher relationships and makes the case that good relationships with teachers are essential to students’ well-being in school. The book then goes on to present the concept of connectedness and discusses the main challenges regarding its conceptualisation in school research. García-Moya draws on qualitative findings from the Teacher Connectedness Project to offer an in-depth examination of the central attributes of student-teacher connectedness, as well as of the links between connectedness and authority from both students’ and teachers’ perspectives. This innovative project uses a synergistic approach to investigate the role of teachers as potential significant adults in students’ lives. The final chapter offers a summary of the key practical implications for teachers and educators and makes recommendations for future research directions in this area. This book will be a valuable resource for researchers and educators alike, as well as for anyone interested in the ongoing concerns about student wellbeing in schools.",Psychology,120,N/A,0,en

Labor Relations,John W. Budd,McGraw-Hill/Irwin,2005,"Labor Relations: Striking a Balance, 1st Edition, by John Budd presents labor relations as a system for striking a balance between the employment relationship goals of efficiency, equity, and voice, and between the rights of labor and management. Budd's Labor Relations broadens the narrow process focus of existing labor relations texts by placing the discussion of contemporary U.S. processes into the context of underlying themes - what are the goals of labor relations, are those goals being fulfilled, and are reforms needed. This textbook replaces the tired paradigm of ""labor relations equals detailed work rules"" with the dynamic paradigm of ""labor relations equals balancing workplace goals and rights."" Labor law, union organizing, bargaining, dispute resolution, and contract administration are central topics, but these processes are not presented as self-evidently good. These topics are placed in the broader context of the goals of the employment relationship, conflicting rights, and the environment of the 21st Century. This broader context serves to make labor relations more engaging and relevant to students. It also allows instructors to raise important ""big picture"" ideas while covering the applied business functions and strategies of the existing processes..",Business & Economics,172,N/A,0,en
"New World Pholcid Spiders (Araneae, Pholcidae)",Bernhard A. Huber,N/A,2000,"New World pholcids are revised at the generic level, with an emphasis on South America. A total of 47 extant genera occur in the New World, 22 of which are newly described. A preliminary key to the genera of the New World is presented. Redescriptions are given for 11 genera and for 59 species, and 106 species are newly described. Three generic names and 14 specific names are newly synonymized ... A numerical cladistic analysis is performed using a matrix of 61 taxa (48 of them New World pholcids) and 61 morphological characters. The main results of the analysis are as follows: (1) Pholcids are strongly supported as a monophyletic group. (2) Phoicids are separated into the following clades, which are tentatively named to emphasize their character as a working hypothesis: ""ninetines,"" ""pholcines"" (Metagonia Simon and the Pholcus group sensu Huber), ""holocnemines"" (Holocnemus group sensu Timm, Artema Walckenaer, Physocyclus Simon, and Priscula Simon), and the ""New World clade."" Their interrelationships are not definitively resolved. (3) New World pholcids are an assemblage of representatives of all major clades within the family, but most genera are part of the New World clade, which is the only clade restricted to the New World. (4) A hypothesis concerning the evolutionary transformation of characters is given for 41 of the 54 traits scored that vary among pholcids.

In Sickness and in Health,Ben Mattlin,Beacon Press,2018-01-30,"A frank, humorous exploration of interabled dating, love, and marriage Ben Mattlin’s wife, ML, recalls falling in love with his confidence and sheer determination. On one of their earliest dates, he persuaded her to ride on his lap in his wheelchair on their way home from an Elvis Costello concert. Thirty years later, they still travel like this from time to time, undaunted by the curious stares following them down the street. But In Sickness and in Health is more than an “inspiring” story of how a man born with spinal muscular atrophy—a congenital and incurable neuromuscular condition—survived childhood, graduated from Harvard, married an able-bodied woman, built a family with two daughters and a cat and a turtle, established a successful career in journalism, and lived happily ever after. As Mattlin considers the many times his relationship has been met with surprise or speculation by outsiders—those who consider his wife a “saint” or him just plain “lucky” for finding love—he issues a challenge to readers: why should the idea of an “interabled” couple be regarded as either tragic or noble? Through conversations with more than a dozen other couples of varying abilities, ethnic backgrounds, and orientations, Mattlin sets out to understand whether these pairings are as unusual as onlookers seem to think. Reflecting on his own experience he wonders: How do people balance the stresses of personal-care help with the thrill of romance? Is it possible that the very things that appear to be insurmountable obstacles to a successful relationship—the financial burdens, the physical differences, the added element of an especially uncertain future—could be the building blocks of an enviable level of intimacy and communication that other couples could only dream of? We meet Shane Burcaw, a twenty-three-year-old writer, who offers a glimpse of his first forays into dating with a disability. There’s Rachelle Friedman, the “paralyzed bride,” as the media refers to her, and her husband, discussing the joys and challenges of a new marriage and a growing family. And Christina Crosby and her partner, Janet Jakobsen, reflect on how Crosby’s disabling accident called for them to renegotiate their roles and expectations in their long-term relationship. What emerges is a candid glimpse into the challenges and joys of interabled love—from the first blush of sexual awakening to commitment and marriage and through to widowhood.",Family & Relationships,258,N/A,0,en

Compatible and Incompatible Relationships,William Ickes,Springer,2011-10-14,"Several years ago, two of my colleagues and I had the opportunity to interview Fritz Heider-perhaps the most influential theorist in the field of social psychology (Harvey, Ickes, & Kidd, 1976). During our interview, Heider affirmed a belief that had guided his career since the 1920s, the belief that the study of human relationships is the most important task in which social scientists can engage. Although many social scientists would profess to share this belief, it is nonetheless true that the study of human relationships has been one of the most neglected tasks in the history of the social sciences-including psychology. What Heider found in the 1920s-that most psychologists acknowledged the importance of studying human relationships but at the same time tended to focus their own research on more ""tractable"" topics such as memory and cognition-is still very much evident in the 1980s. Even within the more specific domain of social psychology, a majority of researchers still choose to address those hybrid topics (""social cognition,"" ""social categorization and stereotyping,"" ""person memory,"" etc. ) that relate most directly to traditional areas of psychological research. Still other researchers, while choosing to study such important interpersonal phenomena as altruism, aggression, conflict, and interpersonal attraction, tend to focus so exclusively on these isolated and abstracted phenomena that they fail to provide a more inclusive view of the relationships in which these phenomena occur.",Psychology,388,N/A,0,en
Exploring Positive Relationships at Work,"Jane E. Dutton, Belle Rose Ragins",Routledge,2007,"Workplaces and work itself are increasingly interdependent, and relationships have become the means by which work occurs. As such, positive work relationships can enrich employee's lives, while conversely, the stress caused by corrosive work relationships adds to health care costs faced by organizations and can affect the personal lives of employees. Exploring Positive Relationships at Work is useful for both practical and theoretical reasons, offering a comprehensive and multidisciplinary understanding of how relationships enable people at work. It is designed to put the field of positive relationships in the workplace on the research map by uncovering the mechanism and dynamics of these relationships. The editors approach the topic from multiple levels, each level providing critical, valuable insights into the dynamic and generative process underlying positive relationships in organizations. These levels are arranged in five parts: *an introduction to positive relationships at work; *Individuals and Dyads; *Groups and Communities; *Organizations & Organizing; and *a conclusion pointing to the future direction of research on positive work relationships. This volume will appeal to academics and practitioners, as well as scholars and graduate students in organizational psychology, management, human resources, and inter-personal communications.",Business & Economics,421,N/A,0,en

Personality in Intimate Relationships,Luciano L'Abate,Springer Science & Business Media,2006-04-07,"Four decades of contributions to personality theory and family practice have earned Luciano L’Abate a worldwide reputation for therapeutic insights. Now he expands on his pathbreaking relational theory of personality to apply it to the twenty-first-century family in all its configurations. Personality in Intimate Relationships showcases L’Abate’s trademark elegant style and provocative ideas in his most accessible work to date. Based on Axes I and II of the DSM-IV, the book describes relationships along a readily identifiable continuum ranging from optimal functionality to severe pathology, linking the author’s conceptual framework to specific diagnostic strategies, therapeutic interventions, and prevention programs. L’Abate’s theory not only integrates individual and family theories and seemingly disparate schools of thought, but is also inclusive of nontraditional relationships—grandparent/grandchild dyads, adoptive families, same-sex couples, and others—that are often left out of the family literature. Among the key areas explored in the book: • Selfhood and self-differentiation • Confrontation and sharing of hurt feelings • Negotiating, bargaining, and problem-solving • Dealing with distance and closeness • Intimacy and the ability to love In addition, the reader is referred to complementary online appendices that supply helpful questionnaires, workbooks, and ideas for further applications. Personality in Intimate Relationships offers fresh perspective to all frontline practitioners as well as investigators in this area.

The book is structured in three parts: Love begins by examining how romantic love differs from other types of love, such as friendship and parental love. It asks which properties of love are essential, whether people have a choice in whom they love, and whether lovers have moral obligations to one another that differ from those they owe to others Sex demonstrates the difficulty in defining sex and the sexual, and examines what constitutes good and bad sex in terms of pleasure, 'naturalness', and moral permissibility.

Two complementary strategies are used: an exclusionary strategy and an inclusive strategy. The primary emphasis is on the translation of theory into a logical analytic strategy and the interpretation of results. The elaboration model is applied with case studies drawn from newly published research serving as prototypes for aligning theory and the data analytic plan used to test it. The second application of the elaboration model is in the form of original data analysis presented in two Analysis Journals that are integrated throughout the text and implement the full elaboration model. Using real data, not contrived examples, the text provides a step-by-step guide through the process of integrating theory with data analysis in order to arrive at meaningful answers to research questions.",Social Science,473,N/A,0,en

Although there are generic encyclopedias describing basic social science research methodologies in general, until now there has been no comprehensive A-to-Z reference work exploring methods specific to communication and media studies. Our entries, authored by key figures in the field, focus on special considerations when applied specifically to communication research, accompanied by engaging examples from the literature of communication, journalism, and media studies. Entries cover every step of the research process, from the creative development of research topics and questions to literature reviews, selection of best methods (whether quantitative, qualitative, or mixed) for analyzing research results and publishing research findings, whether in traditional media or via new media outlets. In addition to expected entries covering the basics of theories and methods traditionally used in communication research, other entries discuss important trends influencing the future of that research, including contemporary practical issues students will face in communication professions, the influences of globalization on research, use of new recording technologies in fieldwork, and the challenges and opportunities related to studying online multi-media environments. Email, texting, cellphone video, and blogging are shown not only as topics of research but also as means of collecting and analyzing data. Still other entries delve into considerations of accountability, copyright, confidentiality, data ownership and security, privacy, and other aspects of conducting an ethical research program. Features: 652 signed entries are contained in an authoritative work spanning four volumes available in choice of electronic or print formats.

Love and Society,Swen Seebach,Taylor & Francis,2017-04-21,"Why does love matter? Love and Society discusses the meaning and importance of love for contemporary society. Love is not only an emotion that occurs in our intimate relationships; it is a special emotion that allows us to relate to each other in a lasting fashion, to create out of our individual pasts a shared past, which enables us to project a shared future. Bringing together the idea of Simmel’s second order forms with theories of love, this insightful volume shows that the answer to why love is so central to society can be found in the social transformation of the last two centuries. It also explains how we can build our strongest social bonds on the fragility of an emotions thanks to the creation of ""special moments"" (love rituals) and ""intimate stories"" (love myths) that are central to the weaving of lasting social bonds. Going to the cinema, reading a book together or sharing songs are forms of weaving bonds of love and part of the cycle of love. But love is not only shared between two people; the desire and the search for love is something we share with almost all members of society. With rich empirical data, an analysis of love’s transformation in modernity, and a critical engagement with classical and contemporary theorists, this book provides a lively discussion on the meaning and importance of love for today’s society. It will be of interest to undergraduate and postgraduate students and postdoctoral researchers who are interested in fields such as Sociology of Emotions, Sociological Theory and Sociology of Morality.",Social Science,227,N/A,0,en
Multiple Regression,"Aki Roberts, John M.

Also, students preparing for more advanced courses can self-study the text to refresh and solidify their statistical background. Drawing on decades of teaching this material, the authors present the ideas in an approachable and nontechnical manner, with no expectation that readers have more than a standard introductory statistics course as background.

Statistical Signal Processing in Engineering,Umberto Spagnolini,John Wiley & Sons,2017-11-15,"A problem-solving approach to statistical signal processing for practicing engineers, technicians, and graduate students This book takes a pragmatic approach in solving a set of common problems engineers and technicians encounter when processing signals. In writing it, the author drew on his vast theoretical and practical experience in the field to provide a quick-solution manual for technicians and engineers, offering field-tested solutions to most problems engineers can encounter. At the same time, the book delineates the basic concepts and applied mathematics underlying each solution so that readers can go deeper into the theory to gain a better idea of the solution’s limitations and potential pitfalls, and thus tailor the best solution for the specific engineering application. Uniquely, Statistical Signal Processing in Engineering can also function as a textbook for engineering graduates and post-graduates. Dr. Spagnolini, who has had a quarter of a century of experience teaching graduate-level courses in digital and statistical signal processing methods, provides a detailed axiomatic presentation of the conceptual and mathematical foundations of statistical signal processing that will challenge students’ analytical skills and motivate them to develop new applications on their own, or better understand the motivation underlining the existing solutions. Throughout the book, some real-world examples demonstrate how powerful a tool statistical signal processing is in practice across a wide range of applications. Takes an interdisciplinary approach, integrating basic concepts and tools for statistical signal processing Informed by its author’s vast experience as both a practitioner and teacher Offers a hands-on approach to solving problems in statistical signal processing Covers a broad range of applications, including communication systems, machine learning, wavefield and array processing, remote sensing, image filtering and distributed computations Features numerous real-world examples from a wide range of applications showing the mathematical concepts involved in practice Includes MATLAB code of many of the experiments in the book Statistical Signal Processing in Engineering is an indispensable working resource for electrical engineers, especially those working in the information and communication technology (ICT) industry. It is also an ideal text for engineering students at large, applied mathematics post-graduates and advanced undergraduates in electrical engineering, applied statistics, and pure mathematics, studying statistical signal processing.",Technology & Engineering,606,N/A,0,en
Scaffolded Minds,Somogy Varga,MIT Press,2019-08-27,"A comprehensive account of cognitive scaffolding and its significance for understanding mental disorders. In Scaffolded Minds, Somogy Varga offers a novel account of cognitive scaffolding and its significance for understanding mental disorders. The book is part of the growing philosophical engagement with empirically informed philosophy of mind, which studies the interfaces between philosophy and cognitive science. Varga draws on two recent shifts within empirically informed philosophy of mind: the first, toward an intensified study of the embodied mind; and the second, toward a study of the disordered mind that acknowledges the convergence of the explanatory concerns of psychiatry and interdisciplinary inquiries into the mind. Varga sets out to accomplish a dual task: theoretical mapping of cognitive scaffolding; and the application/calibration of fine-grained philosophical distinctions to empirical research. He introduces the notion of actively scaffolded cognition (ASC) and offers a taxonomy that distinguishes between intrasomatic and extrasomatic scaffolding. He then shows that ASC offers a productive framework for considering certain characteristic features of mental disorders, focusing on altered bodily experience and social cognition deficits. With Cognitive Scaffolding, Varga aims to establish that shifting attention from mental symptoms to fine-grained sensorimotor aspects can lead to identifying diagnostic subtypes or even specific sensorimotor markers for early diagnosis.",Psychology,286,N/A,0,en

Thinking About Statistics,Jun Otsuka,Taylor & Francis,2022-12-30,"Simply stated, this book bridges the gap between statistics and philosophy. It does this by delineating the conceptual cores of various statistical methodologies (Bayesian/frequentist statistics, model selection, machine learning, causal inference, etc.) and drawing out their philosophical implications. Portraying statistical inference as an epistemic endeavor to justify hypotheses about a probabilistic model of a given empirical problem, the book explains the role of ontological, semantic, and epistemological assumptions that make such inductive inference possible. From this perspective, various statistical methodologies are characterized by their epistemological nature: Bayesian statistics by internalist epistemology, classical statistics by externalist epistemology, model selection by pragmatist epistemology, and deep learning by virtue epistemology. Another highlight of the book is its analysis of the ontological assumptions that underpin statistical reasoning, such as the uniformity of nature, natural kinds, real patterns, possible worlds, causal structures, etc. Moreover, recent developments in deep learning indicate that machines are carving out their own ""ontology"" (representations) from data, and better understanding this—a key objective of the book—is crucial for improving these machines’ performance and intelligibility. Key Features Without assuming any prior knowledge of statistics, discusses philosophical aspects of traditional as well as cutting-edge statistical methodologies. Draws parallels between various methods of statistics and philosophical epistemology, revealing previously ignored connections between the two disciplines. Written for students, researchers, and professionals in a wide range of fields, including philosophy, biology, medicine, statistics and other social sciences, and business.

Routledge Handbook of Research Methods in Military Studies,"Joseph Soeters, Patricia M. Shields, Sebastiaan Rietjens",Routledge,2014-06-27,"This volume offers an overview of the methodologies of research in the field of military studies. As an institution relying on individuals and resources provided by society, the military has been studied by scholars from a wide range of disciplines: political science, sociology, history, psychology, anthropology, economics and administrative studies. The methodological approaches in these disciplines vary from computational modelling of conflicts and surveys of military performance, to the qualitative study of military stories from the battlefield and veterans experiences. Rapidly developing technological facilities (more powerful hardware, more sophisticated software, digitalization of documents and pictures) render the methodologies in use more dynamic than ever. The Routledge Handbook of Research Methods in Military Studies offers a comprehensive and dynamic overview of these developments as they emerge in the many approaches to military studies. The chapters in this Handbook are divided over four parts: starting research, qualitative methods, quantitative methods, and finalizing a study, and every chapter starts with the description of a well-published study illustrating the methodological issues that will be dealt with in that particular chapter. Hence, this Handbook not only provides methodological know-how, but also offers a useful overview of military studies from a variety of research perspectives.

Cahn examines interpersonal relationship disengagement and reengagement by tapping the resources of social science literature. The result is a model for communication which seeks to achieve and maintain interpersonal understanding, while promoting communication behaviors that encourage growth of the individual and relationship satisfaction. The author's integrated approach combines three models of relationship development; namely, quality communication, recognition and availability of more desirable alternatives, and degree of personal investments.

Data and Reality,William Kent,Technics Publications,2012-01-01,"Let’s step back to the year 1978. Sony introduces hip portable music with the Walkman, Illinois Bell Company releases the first mobile phone, Space Invaders kicks off the video game craze, and William Kent writes Data and Reality. We have made amazing progress in the last four decades in terms of portable music, mobile communication, and entertainment, making devices such as the original Sony Walkman and suitcase-sized mobile phones museum pieces today. Yet remarkably, the book Data and Reality is just as relevant to the field of data management today as it was in 1978. Data and Reality gracefully weaves the disciplines of psychology and philosophy with data management to create timeless takeaways on how we perceive and manage information. Although databases and related technology have come a long way since 1978, the process of eliciting business requirements and how we think about information remains constant. This book will provide valuable insights whether you are a 1970s data-processing expert or a modern-day business analyst, data modeler, database administrator, or data architect. This third edition of Data and Reality differs substantially from the first and second editions. Data modeling thought leader Steve Hoberman has updated many of the original examples and references and added his commentary throughout the book, including key points at the end of each chapter. The important takeaways in this book are rich with insight yet presented in a conversational and easy-to-grasp writing style. Here are just a few of the issues this book tackles: • Has “business intelligence” replaced “artificial intelligence”? • Why is a map’s geographic landscape analogous to a data model’s information landscape? • Where do forward and reverse engineering fit in our thought process? • Why are we all becoming “data archeologists”? • What causes the communication chasm between the business professional and the information technology professional in most organizations, and how can the logical data model help bridge this chasm? • Why do we invest in hardware and software to solve business problems before determining what the business problems are in the first place? • What is the difference between oneness, sameness, and categories? • Why does context play a role in every design decision? • Why do the more important attributes become entities or relationships? • Why do symbols speak louder than words? • What’s the difference between a data modeler, a philosopher, and an artist? • Why is the 1975 dream of mapping all attributes still a dream today? • What influence does language have on our perception of reality? • Can we distinguish between naming and describing? From Graeme Simsion’s foreword: While such fundamental issues remain unrecognized and unanswered, Data and Reality, with its lucid and compelling elucidation of the questions, needs to remain in print. I read the book as a database administrator in 1980, as a researcher in 2002, and just recently as the manuscript for the present edition. On each occasion I found something more, and on each occasion I considered it the most important book I had read on data modeling. It has been on my recommended reading list forever. The first chapter in particular should be mandatory reading for anyone involved in data modeling. In publishing this new edition, Steve Hoberman has not only ensured that one of the key books in the data modeling canon remains in print, but has added his own comments and up-to-date examples, which are likely to be helpful to those who have come to data modeling more recently. Don’t do any more data modeling work until you’ve read it.",Computers,163,N/A,0,en
Deciphering Sociological Research,Gerry Rose,Bloomsbury Publishing,1982-06-10,"Sociological research methods are a key component of teaching and courses at all levels, yet courses often fail to catch light for lack of effective student books or provoke smouldering resentment from students at misplaced enthusiasm for recondite statistics. Gerry Rose's new book should go a long way to remedy these problems. It is a complete teaching course with a clear rationale and a distinctive approach to the topic, unblemished by epistemological or prescriptive polemic. Its method is to present through the analysis of twelve pieces of published research reprinted in the book the systematic deciphering of research in relation to the key issues of methodology. The first nine discursive chapters discuss the main research methods topics - including concepts and indicators, sampling, data analysis and the relationship of theory to evidence - balancing the problems of quantitative data with the treatment of qualitative data and fieldwork studies. The papers - shortened articles from British, US and Australian journals - are put through the methodological hoops and systematically compared and assessed. Additionally, each chapter is provided with a full set of exercises and the book also includes a glossary of terms. This straightforward and business-like book will be welcomed by all teachers and professional sociologists and also by social researchers who are concerned with examining or preparing research reports.

Our goal is to build an IFIP forum among the different Information Systems Communities of TC8 dealing with the increasing important area of Enterprise Information Systems. In this particular meeting the committee members intensively discussed the innovative and unique characteristics of Enterprise Information Systems as scientific sub-discipline. Hence, in this meeting it was decided by the TC8 members that the IFIP TC8 First International Conference on Research and Practical Issues of Enterprise Information Systems (CONFENIS 2006) would be held in April 2006 in Vienna, Austria. Dr. Li Xu (USA) and Dr. A Min Tjoa (IFIP TC8) were assigned to propose a concept for this conference in order to establish an IFIP platform for EIS researchers and practitioners in the field to share experience, and discussing opportunities and challenges. We are very pleased therefore to have this conference organised by the help of the Austrian Computer Society (OCG). OCG supports the idea of this conference due to the urgent need of research and dissemination of new techniques in this key area. We received 180 papers from more than 30 countries for CONFENIS and the Program Committee eventually selected xx papers or extended abstracts, making an acceptance rate of xx% of submitted papers. Each paper was thoroughly reviewed by at least two qualified reviewers.",Business & Economics,774,N/A,0,en

Practical Approaches to Causal Relationship Exploration,"Jiuyong Li, Lin Liu, Thuc Duy Le",Springer,2015-03-02,"This brief presents four practical methods to effectively explore causal relationships, which are often used for explanation, prediction and decision making in medicine, epidemiology, biology, economics, physics and social sciences. The first two methods apply conditional independence tests for causal discovery. The last two methods employ association rule mining for efficient causal hypothesis generation, and a partial association test and retrospective cohort study for validating the hypotheses. All four methods are innovative and effective in identifying potential causal relationships around a given target, and each has its own strength and weakness. For each method, a software tool is provided along with examples demonstrating its use. Practical Approaches to Causal Relationship Exploration is designed for researchers and practitioners working in the areas of artificial intelligence, machine learning, data mining, and biomedical research.

Geology of the Earthquake Source,"Åke Fagereng, Virginia G. Toy, Julie V. Rowland",Geological Society of London,2011,"Professor Richard (Rick) Sibson revolutionized structural geology by illustrating that fault rocks contain an integrated record of earthquakes. Fault-rock textures develop in response to geological and physical variables such as composition, environmental conditions (e.g. temperature and pressure), fluid presence and strain rate. These parameters also determine the rate- and state-variable frictional stability of a fault, the dominant mineral deformation mechanism and shear strength, and ultimately control the partitioning between seismic and aseismic deformation. This volume contains a collection of papers that address the geological record of earthquake faulting from field-based or theoretical perspectives.",Nature,354,N/A,0,en

The Moral Psychology of Love,"Arina Pismenny, Berit Brogaard",Rowman & Littlefield,2022-03-28,"Under what circumstances can love generate moral reasons for action? Are there morally appropriate ways to love? Can an occurrence of love or a failure to love constitute a moral failure? Is it better to love morally good people? This volume explores the moral dimensions of love through the lenses of political philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience. It attempts to discern how various social norms affect our experience and understanding of love, how love, relates to other affective states such as emotions and desires, and how love influences and is influenced by reason. What love is affects what love ought to be. Conversely, our ideas of what love ought to be partly determined by our conception of what love is.",Psychology,325,N/A,0,en

Medinfo,"Marius Fieschi, Enrico Coiera, Yu-Chan Jack Li",IOS Press,2004,"A fundamental challenge for medical informatics is to develop and apply better ways of understanding how information technologies and methods can help support the best care for every patient every day given available medical knowledge and resources. In order to provide the most effective healthcare possible, the activities of teams of health professionals have to be coordinated through well-designed processes centered on the needs of patients. For information systems to be accepted and used in such an environment, they must balance standardization based on shared medical knowledge with the flexibility required for customization to the individual patient. Developing innovative approaches to design and build evidence-based careflow management systems is essential for providing the knowledge management infrastructure of health care organizations that seeks to increase performance in delivering high quality care services by efficiently exploiting available resources. Parallel challenges arise in the organization of research at the biological and clinical levels, where the focus on systematically organizing and supporting processes of scientific inquiry by novel informatics methods and databases are in their very early stages. These Proceedings of Medinfo 2004 demonstrate the base of knowledge medical informatics professionals will collectively draw upon in the years ahead to meet these challenges and realize opportunities.",Medical,998,N/A,0,en
Qualitative Reasoning,Hannes Werthner,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The book provides a survey about the field of Qualitative Reasoning, it contrasts and classifies its approaches and puts them into a common framework. Qualitative Reasoning represents an approach of Artificial Intelligence to model dynamic systems, about which little information is available, and to derive statements about the potential behavior of these systems, putting emphasis on a causal explanation of the behavior. Both variables and relationships between variables are described by means of qualitative terms such as small and large or positive and negative. Since this approach also takes into consideration the way how humans reason about physical systems, it can be stated that Qualitative Reasoning participates in the creation of a cognitive theory of non-numerical process descriptions which can be mapped onto a digital computer. This approach can be used for simulation, diagnosis, design, structure identification and interpretation. Areas of application are physics, medicine, the field of ecology, process control, etc. In addition to the classification of existing methods, the book presents a new approach based on fuzzy sets. And the work relates Qualitative Reasoning with such fields of Expert Systems, System Theory and Cognitive Science.",Computers,188,N/A,0,en

Cause Effect Pairs in Machine Learning,"Isabelle Guyon, Alexander Statnikov, Berna Bakir Batu",Springer Nature,2019-10-22,"This book presents ground-breaking advances in the domain of causal structure learning. The problem of distinguishing cause from effect (“Does altitude cause a change in atmospheric pressure, or vice versa?”) is here cast as a binary classification problem, to be tackled by machine learning algorithms. Based on the results of the ChaLearn Cause-Effect Pairs Challenge, this book reveals that the joint distribution of two variables can be scrutinized by machine learning algorithms to reveal the possible existence of a “causal mechanism”, in the sense that the values of one variable may have been generated from the values of the other. This book provides both tutorial material on the state-of-the-art on cause-effect pairs and exposes the reader to more advanced material, with a collection of selected papers. Supplemental material includes videos, slides, and code which can be found on the workshop website.

Love Divine,Jordan Wessling,Oxford University Press,2020-06-02,"Love Divine provides a systematic account of the deep and rich love that God has for humans. While the associated theological territory is vast, the objective is to contend for a unified paradigm regarding fundamental issues pertaining to the God of love who deigns to share His life of love with any human willing to receive it. Realizing this objective includes clarifying and defending specific conclusions concerning how the doctrine of divine love should be approached, what God's love is, what role love plays in motivating God's creation and subsequent governance of humans, how God's love of humans factors into His emotional life, which humans it is that God loves in a saving manner, what the punitive wrath of God is and how it relates to God's love for humans, and how it might be possible for God to share the intra-trinitarian life of love with human beings. As the book unfolds, the chapters interlock and build upon one another in the effort to trace nodal issues related to God's love as it begins in Him and then spills out in the creation, redemption, and glorification of humanity—a kind of exitus-reditus structure that is driven by the unyielding love of God.",Religion,282,N/A,0,en

The Poet X,Elizabeth Acevedo,HarperCollins,2018-03-06,"Winner of the National Book Award for Young People’s Literature, the Michael L. Printz Award, and the Pura Belpré Award! Fans of Jacqueline Woodson, Meg Medina, and Jason Reynolds will fall hard for this astonishing New York Times-bestselling novel-in-verse by an award-winning slam poet, about an Afro-Latina heroine who tells her story with blazing words and powerful truth. Xiomara Batista feels unheard and unable to hide in her Harlem neighborhood. Ever since her body grew into curves, she has learned to let her fists and her fierceness do the talking. But Xiomara has plenty she wants to say, and she pours all her frustration and passion onto the pages of a leather notebook, reciting the words to herself like prayers—especially after she catches feelings for a boy in her bio class named Aman, who her family can never know about. With Mami’s determination to force her daughter to obey the laws of the church, Xiomara understands that her thoughts are best kept to herself. So when she is invited to join her school’s slam poetry club, she doesn’t know how she could ever attend without her mami finding out. But she still can’t stop thinking about performing her poems. Because in the face of a world that may not want to hear her, Xiomara refuses to be silent. “Crackles with energy and snaps with authenticity and voice.” —Justina Ireland, author of Dread Nation “An incredibly potent debut.” —Jason Reynolds, author of the National Book Award Finalist Ghost “Acevedo has amplified the voices of girls en el barrio who are equal parts goddess, saint, warrior, and hero.” —Ibi Zoboi, author of American Street This young adult novel, a selection of the Schomburg Center's Black Liberation Reading List, is an excellent choice for accelerated tween readers in grades 6 to 8.

Life Shift,Aleta St. James,Atria Books,2006-06-06,"Find your power, transform your obstacles, surrender to success Aleta St. James has spent the past twenty-five years as an emotional healer and life coach developing a system for creating deep and dramatic life changes with lasting results. In Life Shift, she shares the secret of how to bring enormous success and deep satisfaction into your life. In an effort to fully compete in a man's world, contemporary women have become alpha females. We rely on masculine traits -- the testosterone energies of action, focus, determination, and self-reliance -- to create success and achieve our goals. We are now coming to realize that while we have mastered these means for pursuing our dreams, we have neglected the equally valuable and complementary energies of magnetism, receptivity, and intuition -- the Magnetic Female. In Life Shift, Aleta presents her techniques for breaking through our emotional blocks and allowing our Magnetic Female and alpha energies to interact and harmonize with each other. She teaches skills that open the doors to a powerful cocreative relationship between these two forces within us and guides us to use these tools to identify our desires, engage our dreams, and realize our destinies. Using her renowned system, which integrates the teachings of primal therapy, Tibetan Buddhism, Hinduism, bioenergetics, and other life-enhancing practices and philosophies, Aleta shares with us all of the tools necessary to live our ideal lives. This Life-Shift Tool Kit incorporates techniques for realigning the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual bodies, inviting rather than pursuing success, recognizing the power of release, eliminating emotional blocks, and reorganizing energy centers within the body. Aleta also offers her expert techniques in regenerative organic breathing, physical and emotional release work, color healing, light therapy, focused reflections, power mantras, prayers and blessings, love baths, and support circles. Weaving together Aleta's own dramatic story of inspiration, success stories from her elite clientele, and lessons from her journeys to spiritual ""power spots,"" Life Shift teaches you how to transform feelings of failure, frustration, doubt, and loneliness into a creative power that becomes a magnetic force attracting joy, fulfillment, success, and love.",Self-Help,292,N/A,0,en

Sacred Cows,"Danielle Teller, Astro Teller",Diversion Books,2014-07-01,"A husband-and-wife doctor team offers fresh and startling perspective on one of our most cherished and misunderstood institutions. Drs. Astro and Danielle Teller know better than most that finding the right partner in life doesn’t always happen the first time around. Through their own divorces they learned how widely held cultural assumptions and misinformation that nobody thinks to question—what they refer to as “sacred cows”—create unnecessary heartache for people who are already suffering through a terrible time. Do you think, for example, that the divorce rate in the United States is rising? Or that children are harmed by divorce? Most people do, but it turns out that neither of these notions is supported by the data. Combining the rigor that has established them as leaders in their respective fields along with a dose of good-natured humor, the Tellers ask readers to take a fresh look at seven common sacred cows: the Holy Cow, the Expert Cow, the Selfish Cow, the Defective Cow, the Innocent Victim Cow, the One True Cow, and the Other Cow. This is not a book that is “for” marriage or “for” divorce, but “for” the freedom to decide how to live most honestly and happily either as part of a couple or a single person.",Family & Relationships,218,N/A,0,en

The Blood Trials,N. E. Davenport,HarperCollins,2022-04-05,"Blending fantasy and science fiction, N. E. Davenport’s fast-paced, action-packed debut kicks off a duology of loyalty and rebellion, in which a young Black woman must survive deadly trials in a racist and misogynistic society to become an elite warrior. It’s all about blood. The blood spilled between the Republic of Mareen and the armies of the Blood Emperor long ago. The blood gifts of Mareen’s deadliest enemies. The blood that runs through the elite War Houses of Mareen, the rulers of the Tribunal dedicated to keeping the republic alive. The blood of the former Legatus, Verne Amari, murdered. For his granddaughter, Ikenna, the only thing steady in her life was the man who had saved Mareen. The man who had trained her in secret, not just in martial skills, but in harnessing the blood gift that coursed through her. Who trained her to keep that a secret. But now there are too many secrets, and with her grandfather assassinated, Ikenna knows two things: that only someone on the Tribunal could have ordered his death, and that only a Praetorian Guard could have carried out that order. Bent on revenge as much as discovering the truth, Ikenna pledges herself to the Praetorian Trials—a brutal initiation that only a quarter of the aspirants survive. She subjects herself to the racism directed against her half-Khanaian heritage and the misogyny of a society that cherishes progeny over prodigy, all while hiding a power that—if found out—would subject her to execution…or worse. Ikenna is willing to risk it all because she needs to find out who murdered her grandfather…and then she needs to kill them. Mareen has been at peace for a long time… Ikenna joining the Praetorians is about to change all that. Magic and technology converge in the first part of this stunning debut duology, where loyalty to oneself—and one’s blood—is more important than anything.",Fiction,429,N/A,0,en

Childless by Marriage,Sue Fagalde Lick,N/A,2021-06,"First you marry a man who does not want children. He cheats and you divorce him. Then you marry the love of your life and find out he does not want to have children with you either. The three he has are more than enough. Although you always wanted to be a mother, you decide he is worth the sacrifice, expecting to have a long happy life together. But that's not what happens. This is the story of how a woman becomes childless by marriage and how it affects every aspect of her life. This is the book of my heart, the one I had to write. Ever since I realized I was not going to have children, I have felt recurring grief and an emptiness in my heart. I am different from most women, but I have found that I am not alone. There are many of us childless women, and I think it's important to share our stories about what it's like when you don't have children in a world where most girls grow up to become mothers. I hope this book offers comfort to those who are childless and understanding to those who are not. If it makes you smile here and there, even better.",Family & Relationships,300,N/A,0,en

Cardiovascular System Dynamics,"Jan Baan, Abraham Noordergraaf, Jeff Raines",MIT Press (MA),1978,"This book offers a novel approach to the study of the mammalian cardiovascular system. Instead of focusing on a particular part of the system or on a particular group of techniques, or approaching the system from a particular point of view, it stresses a balanced presentation of ideas: —all the major component parts of the system are discussed, as well as the behavior of the system as an integrated whole —both basic and clinical viewpoints are represented —both detailed analysis and comprehensive synthesis are offered. In addition, trends in modern instrumentation and the use of computers in improving patient care are important and recurrent themes. Spirited discussions of current controversies and philosophies highlight the presentations. The 62 papers in this volume were invited for a major international conference, held in April 1975, which marked the coming of age of this field and led to the founding of the Cardiovascular System Dynamics Society. The conference brought together outstanding researchers in the life sciences (biology, physiology, medicine) and the physical sciences (biophysics, bioengineering) in order to integrate their findings more intricately and to chart the present state and future directions of the field. Since the cardiovascular system has been one of the first areas to receive attention under the newly emerging symbiosis between engineering and medicine, the book also serves a useful secondary purpose as a model of what can be accomplished by such integrated effort. The papers are organized into 12 sections. The first 9 offer a tour of the cardiovascular system, with papers arranged within each section to lead the reader from theoretical to clinical viewpoints. Included are sections on cardiac muscle, coronary circulation, ventricular dynamics, systemic arterial tree, microcirculation, systemic veins, pulmonary vasculature, control mechanisms in specific vascular beds, and cardiovascular system control. The last 3 sections offer tutorial overviews of theoretical and experimental methods applied to the cardiovascular system and of cardiovascular instrumentation and computer analysis.",Medical,640,N/A,0,en

Rough,Rachel Thompson,Random House,2021-08-26,"**AS HEARD ON BBC RADIO 4'S WOMEN'S HOUR** Rough is a revolutionary non-fiction work exploring the narratives of sexual violence that we don't talk about. A bad sexual experience. A grey area. Not rape but... A violation . These are the terms we use to describe the experiences we don't have words for. The way we talk about topics such as sex, consent, assault aren't fit for purpose. Through powerful testimony from 50 women and non-binary people, this book shines a light on the sexual violence that takes place in our bedrooms and beyond, sometimes at the hands of people we know, trust, or even love. Rough investigates violations such as 'stealthing,' non-consensual choking, and non-consensual rough sex acts that our culture is only starting to recognise as sexual violence. The book explores the ways in which systems of oppression manifest in our sexual culture - from racist microaggressions, to fatphobic acts of aggression, and ableist dehumanising behaviour. An intersectional, sex-positive, kink-positive work, the book also examines how white supremacy, transphobia, biphobia, homophobia, and misogyny are driving forces behind sexual violence. Rough is an urgent, timely call for change to the systems that oppress us all. 'An incredible investigation into a frighteningly common part of our sexual experience,' Dr Fern Riddell 'Rough speaks to how many women often feel after sexual encounters ...This book is excellent and demonstrates just how valid those feelings are,' Adele Walton, founder of Humanitarian Hotgirl",Social Science,256,N/A,0,en

Joy 24 X 7,Jeetendra Jain explores Joy with Sadhguru,Jaico Publishing House,2008-01-01,"Joy 24x7 is a very simple but unusual exploration of Joy. There is no religion in this book. There are no rituals prescribed here. There is no deep meditation being described here and neither is there any mention to any spiritual practice. This is not a guidebook. This is not a “self-help” book. It is not going to give you “an instant formula for joy”. But it will surely make you explore your Joy for yourself in a very direct way. The simple, short snippets of daily lives connected with what Sadhguru has to say about Joy, will take you on a wonderful roller coaster ride on Joy with the Master himself. With Sadhguru’s incredible clarity of expression, his brilliant wit and sense of observation, his ability to bring the most profound aspect in a very simple and direct way, this book is for any human being who seeks to be Joyful. No matter who you are, what you are trying to do, Sadhguru’s words will touch a wonderful wave of Joy inside you and you will soon be restless to seek Joy 24x7.",Philosophy,109,5,1,en

"Love, Inc.",Laurie Essig,University of California Press,2019-02-05,"The notion of “happily ever after” has been ingrained in many of us since childhood—meet someone, date, have the big white wedding, and enjoy your well-deserved future. But why do we buy into this idea? Is love really all we need? Author Laurie Essig invites us to flip this concept of romance on its head and see it for what it really is—an ideology that we desperately cling to as a way to cope with the fact that we believe we cannot control or affect the societal, economic, and political structures around us. From climate change to nuclear war, white nationalism to the worship of wealth and conspicuous consumption—as the future becomes seemingly less secure, Americans turn away from the public sphere and find shelter in the private. Essig argues that when we do this, we allow romance to blind us to the real work that needs to be done—building global movements that inspire a change in government policies to address economic and social inequality.",Social Science,254,5,1,en

Judged by Love,Javan Kienzle,Andrews McMeel Publishing,2004-04,"In this era of war, mendacity, clerical and political scandal, and personal disillusion, I hoped that the example of Bill's love of the Church, his love of the priesthood, his love of people...and his love of the woman he married could show that life can be lived honestly, uprightly, fulfillingly...and with kindness and humor."" -Author Javan Kienzle Author William X. Kienzle touched readers, both on and off the page. His 24 Father Robert Koesler mysteries attracted an ever-growing following of faithful and new fans alike, while his status as a highly intelligent and thoughtful ex-priest sparked curiosity and interest in his unique perspective. When Bill died suddenly in December 2001 his readers were crushed, as were so many who knew him personally and professionally. After much reflection on his life, Bill's widow, Javan, chose to write his biography. Judged by Love is a loving but candid portrait of a deeply religious and spiritual person, one who dedicated his life to God by becoming a priest, then found himself separated from the priesthood he loved because of disagreements with its policies. While this is the individual story of Bill Kienzle from his youthful days in the seminary onward, it also serves as a reflection on the current examination of faith that much of the Catholic clergy and laity have experienced over the last 50 years. Complete with Bill and Javan's singular love story, Judged by Love is a moving tale of a remarkable man. Readers interested in religion and spiritual topics, as well as the faithful fans who purchased more than two million copies of Bill's hardcover and paperback mysteries, will be heartened and gratified by the chance to read about this extraordinary human being.",Biography & Autobiography,442,N/A,0,en

But in a world where dating is increasingly based on split-second decisions and geared toward casual relationships rather than marriage, it's easy for single people to feel discouraged, used, or unworthy of true love and lasting affection. Reality just never seems to match up with our (often wildly unrealistic) expectations. Jonathan ""JP"" Pokluda has counseled thousands of young singles through the pain and heartbreak of dating the world's way. Now he wants to dispel the myths, misconceptions, and fairy tales you've believed about dating and replace them with the truth from the One who invented marriage, created you to crave relationship, and is the very embodiment of true love. With plenty of true stories about relationships healed and love found, this practical book explains God's purposes for singleness, dating, and marriage and covers why you should date, who you should date, and how you should date. If you're ready to trade the world's way of dating for the way that actually works, it's time to begin dating well.",Religion,202,5,1,en

Unified Signal Theory,Gianfranco Cariolaro,Springer Science & Business Media,2011-04-23,"Unified Signal Theory is an indispensible textbook dealing with the theory of deterministic signals; a topic of fundamental interest to graduates and senior undergraduates in the areas of information engineering (telecommunications, control, systems theory and electronics), astronomy, oceanography, earth science, biology and medicine. The unified theory follows an innovative approach – that of combining all signal classes into just one. The fundamental signal operations (convolution, Fourier transform, linear systems, sampling and interpolation) are established simultaneously for all the signal classes. This unified approach avoids the repetition of similar concepts consequent on other approaches’ separate treatment of definitions and properties for each signal class. Modern wavelet ideas are developed in harmony with the rest of the text. Unified Signal Theory provides: • exercises and examples, to give the student practice; • solutions which are available for download and save the tutor time; and • a choice of two suggested reading paths depending on the level of the student, for an enhanced learning experience. The advantages of the unified approach are many: it permits a global vision of the topic, it is economical in teaching and learning, and it can be adjusted easily to fit new applications. This textbook presents the theory in five chapters, and goes on to demonstrate specific applications such as fast Fourier transform implementation, sampling and reconstructions of signals, and multicolor modulation systems, in a further six chapters. Mathematical concepts are introduced conceptually within the body of the book with more rigorous treatment being reserved for the appendices.",Technology & Engineering,932,N/A,0,en

Ethnopsychology,Rolando Díaz-Loving,Springer Nature,2019-10-08,"This book presents an overview of Mexican ethnopsychology, an original theoretical and methodological approach that seeks to complement the mainstream psychological science – based on universal principles, processes and constructs – with scientific methods to study the idiosyncratic features and behaviors typical of specific cultural groups. It proposes a historic-bio-psycho-socio-cultural theoretical model to describe research findings of social, psychological, collective and individual phenomena. Psychology is at a crossroads of years of research with stress on internal validity and little attention to contextual and cultural variables. It becomes fundamental to continue on the internal validity track but at the same time incorporate external validity issues. The growth of indigenous movements and data allows for a profound evaluation of the extents to which apparent universal phenomena are truly universal, and to what extent they are idiosyncratic manifestations of the cultures where the mainstream research is conducted. Mexican ethnopsychologists have been following this path for decades, since the pioneer work of Rogelio Díaz-Guerrero, but until now little has been published in English about this innovative theoretical approach. Ethnopsychology – Pieces from the Mexican Research Gallery fills this gap by presenting the international community an overview of Mexican ethnopsychology and thus providing a useful tool to behavioral, social and health scientists interested in understanding how culture shapes both collective and individual behaviors.",Psychology,197,N/A,0,en

The Variety of Values,Susan R. Wolf,"Oxford University Press, USA",2015,"For over thirty years Susan Wolf has been writing about moral and nonmoral values and the relation between them. This volume collects Wolf's most important essays on the topics of morality, love, and meaning, ranging from her classic essay ""Moral Saints"" to her most recent ""The Importance of Love."" Wolf's essays warn us against the common tendency to classify values in terms of a dichotomy that contrasts the personal, self-interested, or egoistic with the impersonal, altruistic or moral. On Wolf's view, this tendency ignores or distorts the significance of such values as love, beauty, and truth, and neglects the importance of meaningfulness as a dimension of the good life. These essays show us how a self-conscious recognition of the variety of values leads to new understandings of the point, the content, and the limits of morality and to new ways of thinking about happiness and well-being.",Philosophy,289,N/A,0,en

Consequences of this trend are an increase in: the size of software systems, the variability in software artifacts, and the importance of software in achieving the system-level properties. Software architecture provides the necessary abstractions for managing the resulting complexity. We here introduce the Third Working IEEFlIFIP Conference on Software Architecture, WICSA3. That it is already the third such conference is in itself a clear indication that software architecture continues to be an important topic in industrial software development and in software engineering research. However, becoming an established field does not mean that software architecture provides less opportunity for innovation and new directions. On the contrary, one can identify a number of interesting trends within software architecture research. The first trend is that the role of the software architecture in all phases of software development is more explicitly recognized. Whereas initially software architecture was primarily associated with the architecture design phase, we now see that the software architecture is treated explicitly during development, product derivation in software product lines, at run-time, and during system evolution. Software architecture as an artifact has been decoupled from a particular lifecycle phase.",Computers,234,N/A,0,en

The SAGE Encyclopedia of Communication Research Methods,Mike Allen,SAGE Publications,2017-04-11,"Communication research is evolving and changing in a world of online journals, open-access, and new ways of obtaining data and conducting experiments via the Internet. Although there are generic encyclopedias describing basic social science research methodologies in general, until now there has been no comprehensive A-to-Z reference work exploring methods specific to communication and media studies. Our entries, authored by key figures in the field, focus on special considerations when applied specifically to communication research, accompanied by engaging examples from the literature of communication, journalism, and media studies. Entries cover every step of the research process, from the creative development of research topics and questions to literature reviews, selection of best methods (whether quantitative, qualitative, or mixed) for analyzing research results and publishing research findings, whether in traditional media or via new media outlets. In addition to expected entries covering the basics of theories and methods traditionally used in communication research, other entries discuss important trends influencing the future of that research, including contemporary practical issues students will face in communication professions, the influences of globalization on research, use of new recording technologies in fieldwork, and the challenges and opportunities related to studying online multi-media environments. Email, texting, cellphone video, and blogging are shown not only as topics of research but also as means of collecting and analyzing data. Still other entries delve into considerations of accountability, copyright, confidentiality, data ownership and security, privacy, and other aspects of conducting an ethical research program. Features: 652 signed entries are contained in an authoritative work spanning four volumes available in choice of electronic or print formats. Although organized A-to-Z, front matter includes a Reader’s Guide grouping entries thematically to help students interested in a specific aspect of communication research to more easily locate directly related entries. Back matter includes a Chronology of the development of the field of communication research; a Resource Guide to classic books, journals, and associations; a Glossary introducing the terminology of the field; and a detailed Index.

Artificial Intelligence in Design ’98,"John S. Gero, Fay Sudweeks",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The development of computational models of design founded on the artificial intelligenceparadigm has provided an impetus for muchofcurrentdesign research. As artificial intelligence has matured and developed new approaches so the impact ofthese new approaches on design research has been felt. This can be seen in the wayconcepts from cognitive science has found theirway into artificial intelligence and hence into design research. And, also in the way in which agent-based systems arebeingincorporated into design systems. In design research there is an increasing blurring between notions drawn from artificial intelligence and those drawn from cognitive science. Whereas a number of years ago the focus was largely on applying artificial intelligence to designing as an activity, thus treating designing as a form ofproblem solving, today we are seeing a much wider variety ofconceptions of the role of artificial intelligence in helping to model and comprehend designing as a process. Thus, we see papers in this volume which have as their focus the development or implementationofframeworks for artificial intelligence in design - attempting to determine a unique locus for these ideas. We see papers which attempt to find foundations for the development of tools based on the artificial intelligence paradigm; often the foundations come from cognitive studiesofhuman designers.",Computers,664,N/A,0,en

Taking Care,David Smail,Routledge,2018-05-08,"Taking Care established the author as an important social and political analyst whose background happened to be in clinical psychology. In this work the author develops the analysis of mental illness, and psychology in general, in the contexts of society, power and interest. People's experience is embodied in the world in which they exist. Notwithstanding the claims of some, psychology cannot, in the same way that magic cannot, change the nature of that experience fundamentally. At best, psychotherapy might provide a degree of understanding about that limitation. The historical relationship between psychology and magic is examined. The socio-political and economic structures of the society in which we live have the greatest influence on mental health, as on many other matters. Therefore, the individuation of focus in psychology on personal relationships, happiness, and sexuality can significantly miss the point. We need to develop political and social structures that 'take care' of people, to enable them to have meaningful 'public' lives.",Psychology,240,N/A,0,en

Metabolic Ecology,"Richard M. Sibly, James H. Brown, Astrid Kodric-Brown",John Wiley & Sons,2012-03-26,"Metabolic Ecology Most of ecology is about metabolism, the ways that organisms use energy and materials. The energy requirements of individuals (their metabolic rates) vary predictably with their body size and temperature. Ecological interactions are exchanges of energy and materials between organisms and their environments. Therefore, metabolic rate affects ecological processes at all levels: individuals, populations, communities and ecosystems. Each chapter focuses on a different process, level of organization, or kind of organism. It lays a conceptual foundation and presents empirical examples. Together, the chapters provide an integrated framework that holds the promise for a unified theory of ecology. The book is intended to be accessible to upper-level undergraduates and graduate students, but also of interest to senior scientists. Its easy-to-read chapters and clear illustrations can be used in lecture and seminar courses.

Supernumerary Intelligence,"John W. Dickey, Ian A. Birdsall, G. Richard Larkin, Kwang Sik Kim",IAP,2015-02-01,"Much of our life is consumed looking for quantitative relationships. For example, How much more sleep do I need at night to make me feel better? How many calories do I need to eliminate to lose weight? How much larger does my budget on the job need to be for me to be more effective? All these quantitative questions are preceded, and depend on, qualitative questions. For example, before I decide how much extra sleep I need at night, I need to determine if extra sleep will actually make me feel better. In another example, I need to determine if a larger budget will make me more effective on the job, before I think about how much more money I will need. What elements influence job performance, and how do they interact? We spend much of our life trying to find answers to such quantitative and qualitative questions. We are, then, in search of a kind of intelligence that includes numbers but is also above and beyond them. We call it 'supernumerary' intelligence (SI). To aid our quest for SI, we use Quantitative CyberQuest (QCQ) and the Public Administration Genome Project (PAGP) as useful tools. QCQ is a philosophy as well as an analytic tool that helps in exploring the supernumerary. QCQ is particularly wellsuited for sorting out variables as well as their interrelations. It involves a combination of statistics, systems analysis, research methodology, qualitative research, and artificial intelligence. QCQ also provides a relatively easy to understand but still powerful set of tools and guidance mechanisms to pilot (the 'Cyber' part) users in their 'Quest' for supernumerary relationships.",Business & Economics,402,N/A,0,en
Handbook of Ethnic Conflict,"Dan Landis, Rosita D.

It is estimated that two-thirds of violent conflicts being fought each year in every part of the globe including North America are ethnic conflicts. Unlike traditional warfare, civilians comprise more than 80 percent of the casualties, and the economic and psychological impact on survivors is often so devastating that some experts believe that ethnic conflict is the most destabilizing force in the post-Cold War world. Although these conflicts also have political, economic, and other causes, the purpose of this volume is to develop a psychological understanding of ethnic warfare. More specifically, Handbook of Ethnopolitical Conflict explores the function of ethnic, religious, and national identities in intergroup conflict.

Causality in Sociological Research,Jakub Karpinski,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The general treatment of problems connected with the causal conditioning of phenomena has traditionally been the domain of philosophy, but when one examines the relationships taking place in the various fields, the study of such conditionings belongs to the empirical sciences. Sociology is no exception in that respect. In that discipline we note a certain paradox. Many problems connected with the causal conditioning of phenomena have been raised in sociology in relatively recent times, and that process marked its empirical or even so-called empiricist trend. That trend, labelled positivist, seems in this case to be in contradiction with a certain type of positivism. Those authors who describe positivism usually include the Humean tradition in its genealogy and, remembering Hume's criticism of the concept of cause, speak about positivism as about a trend which is inclined to treat lightly the study of causes and confines itself to the statements on co-occurrence of phenomena.",Social Science,191,N/A,0,en

Romance Writing,Lynne Pearce,Polity,2007-01-05,"Romance Writing explores the changing nature of both the romance genre and the discourse of romantic love from the seventeenth century to the present day. Indeed, it is one of the first studies to approach romantic love as both genre and discourse in more than sixty years. Faced with the challenge of writing a cultural history for what is commonly understood to be one of lifes most universal, a-historical and cross-cultural phenomena, Lynne Pearce has invoked the concept of the gift to calculate loves added value at different cultural/historical moments. Building upon those philosophical traditions which have argued for the powerfully transformative nature of romantic love, Pearce shows how in the history of literature lovers have utilized its spark to change not only themselves, but also their worlds, through acts of creativity and heroism. The gift of love ranges from the simple gift of a name in the seventeenth century, through notions of immortality, self-sacrifice and selfhood in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, through to the liberating temporal and spatial dislocations of the postmodern age. The opening chapter, The Alchemy of Love, also undertakes an in-depth engagement of the changing nature, and meaning, of romantic love.

Distributed Hydrologic Modeling Using GIS,Baxter E. Vieux,Springer,2016-08-19,"This book presents a unified approach for modeling hydrologic processes distributed in space and time using geographic information systems (GIS). This Third Edition focuses on the principles of implementing a distributed model using geospatial data to simulate hydrologic processes in urban, rural and peri-urban watersheds. The author describes fully distributed representations of hydrologic processes, where physics is the basis for modeling, and geospatial data forms the cornerstone of parameter and process representation. A physics-based approach involves conservation laws that govern the movement of water, ranging from precipitation over a river basin to flow in a river. Global geospatial data have become readily available in GIS format, and a modeling approach that can utilize this data for hydrology offers numerous possibilities. GIS data formats, spatial interpolation and resolution have important effects on the hydrologic simulation of the major hydrologic components of a watershed, and the book provides examples illustrating how to represent a watershed with spatially distributed data along with the many pitfalls inherent in such an undertaking. Since the First and Second Editions, software development and applications have created a richer set of examples, and a deeper understanding of how to perform distributed hydrologic analysis and prediction. This Third Edition describes the development of geospatial data for use in Vflo® physics-based distributed modeling.",Science,270,N/A,0,en

The Logic of Social Science,James Mahoney,Princeton University Press,2021-08-17,"""Mahoney's starting point is the problem of essentialism in social science. Essentialism--the belief that the members of a category possess hidden properties (""essences"") that make them members of the category and that endow them with a certain nature--is appropriate for scientific categories (""atoms"", for instance) but not for human ones (""revolutions,"" for instance). Despite this, much social science research takes place from within an essentialist orientation; those who reject this assumption goes so far in the other direction as to reject the idea of an external reality, independent of human beings, altogether. Mahoney proposes an alternative approach that aspires to bridge this enduring rift in the social sciences between those who take a scientific approach and assume that social science categories correspond to external reality (and thus believe that the methods used in the natural sciences are generally appropriate for the social sciences) and those who take a constructivist approach and believe that because the categories used to understand the social world are humanly-constructed, they cannot possibly follow the science of the natural world. As the name suggests, scientific constructivism brings in aspects of both views and attempts to unite them. Drawing from cognitive science, it focuses on using the rational parts of our brain machinery to overcome the limitations and deeply seated biases (such as essentialism) of our evolved minds. Specifically, Mahoney puts forth a ""set-theoretic analysis"" that focuses on ""sets"" of categories as they exist in the mind that are also subject to the mathematical logic of set-theory. He spends the first four chapters of the book establishing the foundations and methods for set-theoretic analysis, the next four chapters looking and how this analysis fits with the existing tools of social science, and the final four chapters focusing on how this approach can be used to study and understand cases""--",Political Science,416,N/A,0,en

Introduction to Tensor Analysis and the Calculus of Moving Surfaces,Pavel Grinfeld,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-09-24,"This textbook is distinguished from other texts on the subject by the depth of the presentation and the discussion of the calculus of moving surfaces, which is an extension of tensor calculus to deforming manifolds. Designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate students, this text invites its audience to take a fresh look at previously learned material through the prism of tensor calculus. Once the framework is mastered, the student is introduced to new material which includes differential geometry on manifolds, shape optimization, boundary perturbation and dynamic fluid film equations. The language of tensors, originally championed by Einstein, is as fundamental as the languages of calculus and linear algebra and is one that every technical scientist ought to speak. The tensor technique, invented at the turn of the 20th century, is now considered classical. Yet, as the author shows, it remains remarkably vital and relevant. The author’s skilled lecturing capabilities are evident by the inclusion of insightful examples and a plethora of exercises. A great deal of material is devoted to the geometric fundamentals, the mechanics of change of variables, the proper use of the tensor notation and the discussion of the interplay between algebra and geometry. The early chapters have many words and few equations. The definition of a tensor comes only in Chapter 6 – when the reader is ready for it. While this text maintains a consistent level of rigor, it takes great care to avoid formalizing the subject. The last part of the textbook is devoted to the Calculus of Moving Surfaces. It is the first textbook exposition of this important technique and is one of the gems of this text. A number of exciting applications of the calculus are presented including shape optimization, boundary perturbation of boundary value problems and dynamic fluid film equations developed by the author in recent years. Furthermore, the moving surfaces framework is used to offer new derivations of classical results such as the geodesic equation and the celebrated Gauss-Bonnet theorem.",Mathematics,303,N/A,0,en

Interpersonal Communication,Pamela J. Kalbfleisch,Psychology Press,2013-09-13,"Interpersonal relationships are the core of our societal system and have been since before the dawn of civilization. In today's world, friends, lovers, companions, and confidants make valuable contributions to our everyday lives. These are the relationships whose members are not automatically participants as a result of their birth and kin affiliations. The focus is on these relationships that must be forged from the sometimes indifferent, and sometimes hostile world. Yet, there is still much that is not known about how these relationships evolve, how partners communicate in on-going relationships, how people keep their relationships together, and how they cope when they fall apart. Primary to the focus of this book is the underlying theme of evolving interpersonal relationships from the initial encounter to the mature alliance. The contributors to this volume provide a contemporary perspective for the study of interpersonal relationships. Fresh areas of scholarly inquiry are presented and existing approaches are re-examined. Research in the introductory chapters breaks new ground, and appraises the ultimate question of what impact initial interactions have on further relational development. The mid-section of the volume concerns communication issues that confront the members of a relationship in process, focusing on how conflict and jealousy are communicated to a relational partner. This research considers relational development as well as obstacles and barriers to evolving relationships. The concluding chapters probe the question: Ultimately do all good things have to come to an end? Employing innovative techniques to examine maturing and disengaging relationships, the research presented here focuses on how interpersonal relationships become committed and mature.",Language Arts & Disciplines,323,N/A,0,en

The A to Z of Anglicanism,Colin Buchanan,Scarecrow Press,2009-08-04,"Anglicanism arguably originated in 1534 when Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy, which transferred papal power over the Church of England to the king.

"Space, Structure and Randomness","Michel Bilodeau, Fernand Meyer, Michel Schmitt",Springer Science & Business Media,2007-12-23,"Space, structure, and randomness: these are the three key concepts underlying Georges Matheron’s scientific work. He first encountered them at the beginning of his career when working as a mining engineer, and then they resurfaced in fields ranging from meteorology to microscopy. What could these radically different types of applications possibly have in common? First, in each one only a single realisation of the phenomenon is available for study, but its features repeat themselves in space; second, the sampling pattern is rarely regular, and finally there are problems of change of scale. This volume is divided in three sections on random sets, geostatistics and mathematical morphology. They reflect his professional interests and his search for underlying unity. Some readers may be surprised to find theoretical chapters mixed with applied ones. We have done this deliberately. GM always considered that the distinction between the theory and practice was purely academic. When GM tackled practical problems, he used his skill as a physicist to extract the salient features and to select variables which could be measured meaningfully and whose values could be estimated from the available data. Then he used his outstanding ability as a mathematician to solve the problems neatly and efficiently. It was his capacity to combine a physicist’s intuition with a mathematician’s analytical skills that allowed him to produce new and innovative solutions to difficult problems. The book should appeal to graduate students and researchers working in mathematics, probability, statistics, physics, spatial data analysis, and image analysis. In addition it will be of interest to those who enjoy discovering links between scientific disciplines that seem unrelated at first glance. In writing the book the contributors have tried to put GM’s ideas into perspective. During his working life, GM was a genuinely creative scientist. He developed innovative concepts whose usefulness goes far beyond the confines of the discipline for which they were originally designed. This is why his work remains as pertinent today as it was when it was first written.",Mathematics,402,N/A,0,en

Handbook of Research on Transforming Teachers’ Online Pedagogical Reasoning for Engaging K-12 Students in Virtual Learning,"Niess, Margaret L., Gillow-Wiles, Henry",IGI Global,2021-06-25,"The COVID-19 pandemic drastically transformed the classroom by keeping students and teachers apart for the sake of safety. As schools emptied, remote learning rapidly expanded through online services and video chatrooms. Unfortunately, this disrupted many students and teachers who were not accustomed to remote classrooms. This challenge has forced K-12 teachers to think differently about teaching. Unexpectedly and with little time to prepare, they have been confronted with redesigning their curriculum and instruction from face-to-face to online virtual classrooms to protect students from the COVID-19 virus while ensuring that these new online initiatives remain sustainable and useful in the post-pandemic world. As teachers learn to take advantage of the affordances and strengths of the multiple technologies available for virtual classroom instruction, their instruction both in online and face-to-face will impact what and how students learn in the 21st century. The Handbook of Research on Transforming Teachers’ Online Pedagogical Reasoning for Engaging K-12 Students in Virtual Learning examines the best practices and pedagogical reasoning for designing online strategies that work for K-12 virtual learning. The initial section provides foundational pedagogical ideas for constructing engaging virtual learning environments that leverage the unique strengths and opportunities while avoiding the weaknesses and threats of the online world. The following chapters present instructional strategies for multiple grade levels and content areas: best practices that work, clearly describing why they work, and the teachers’ pedagogical reasoning that supports online implementations. The chapters provide ways to think about teaching in virtual environments that can be used to guide instructional strategy choices and recognizes the fundamental differences between face-to-face and virtual environments as an essential design component. Covering such topics as K-12 classrooms, pedagogical reasoning, and virtual learning, this text is perfect for professors, teachers, students, educational designers and developers, instructional technology faculty, distance learning faculty, and researchers interested in the subject.",Education,664,N/A,0,en

Generators and Relations for Discrete Groups,"Harold S.M. Coxeter, William O. J. Moser",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-06-29,"When we began to consider the scope of this book, we envisaged a catalogue supplying at least one abstract definition for any finitely generated group that the reader might propose. But we soon realized that more or less arbitrary restrictions are necessary, because interesting groups are so numerous. For permutation groups of degree 8 or less (i.e.' .subgroups of es), the reader cannot do better than consult the tables of JosEPHINE BuRNS (1915), while keeping an eye open for misprints. Our own tables (on pages 134-142) deal with groups of low order, finite and infinite groups of congruent transformations, symmetric and alternating groups, linear fractional groups, and groups generated by reflections in real Euclidean space of any number of dimensions. The best substitute for a more extensive catalogue is the description (in Chapter 2) of a method whereby the reader can easily work out his own abstract definition for almost any given finite group. This method is sufficiently mechanical for the use of an electronic computer.",Mathematics,179,N/A,0,en
Repetition in Music,Adam Ockelford,Routledge,2017-07-05,"This monograph examines the place of repetition in perceived musical structure and in theories of music. Following a preface and introduction, there are four main chapters: 'Theory', 'Analysis', 'Metatheory and Meta-analysis', and 'Cognition and Metacognition'. Chapter 2 (Theory) sets out the principles underlying the creation and cognition of musical structure developed by the author in earlier studies, in the dual context of David Lewin's mathematically based theory of musical intervals and transformations and Gilles Fauconnier's concept of mental spaces (which was formulated in the context of cognitive science). Chapter 3 (Analysis) shows the theory in operation in relation to the first movement of Mozart's piano sonata K.333. It indicates how structural issues may be related to considerations of aesthetic response and musical 'worth' through comparison with J.C. Bach's Sonata op. 5 no. 3. Chapter 4 (Metatheory and Meta-analysis) uses the new theory to interrogate the propositions underpinning set theory and transformations, offering a psychomusicological critique and potential development of, for example, the work of Forte, Morris, Isaacson and Straus. This enables issues raised earlier in relation to the work of Lewin to be addressed. In conclusion, in Chapter 5 (Cognition and Metacognition), the matter of cognitive preferences and constraints is considered in relation to repetition in music, which permits a final investigation of different approaches to musical analysis to be undertaken. In summary, by synthesising the findings of diverse earlier work in the context of the new theory, it proves possible to move thinking forward on a number of fronts, and to indicate potential directions for future empirical and analytical developments.",Music,168,N/A,0,en

Modern Aspects of Electrochemistry,John Bockris,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This volume contains eight chapters covering a wide range of topics: ultrasonic vibration potentials, impedance measurements, photo electrochemical kinetics, chlorine production, electrochemical behavior of titanium, structural properties of membranes, bioelec troche mistry, and small-particle effects for electrocatalysis. Chapter 1, contributed by Zana and Yeager, discusses the little used but potentially important area of ultrasonic vibration potentials. The authors review the historical literature and the associated theoretical equations. They continue by discussing various aspects of the experimental technique and close with a review of the existing studies. They conclude by noting that vibra tion potentials may be useful for determining the effects of various agents on colloidal suspensions found in such important industries as paper production. Chapter 2 is a review of impedance techniques, written by Macdonald and McKubre. The authors include not only derivations of various impedance functions for electrochemical systems but also particularly useful discussions of instrumental methods. The authors close with an interesting claim: ""the distribution of current and potential within a porous battery or fuel-cell electrode and within 'flow-through' electrodes is best analyzed in terms of the frequency dispersion of the impedance.""

The A to Z of United States-Japan Relations,"John Van Sant, Peter Mauch, Yoneyuki Sugita",Scarecrow Press,2010-03-01,"The most important bilateral relationship in Asia since the end of World War II is assuredly between the United States and Japan. Despite the geographical and cultural differences between these two nations, as well as the bitterness leftover from the war, an amicable and prosperous relationship has developed between the two countries boasting the world's largest economies. As the 21st century progresses, the continuing goodwill between the U.S. and Japan is of the utmost importance, as the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific depends on their cooperation and efforts to contain destabilizing factors in the area.

The Domain Theory,"Alistair Sutcliffe, A.G. Sutcliffe",CRC Press,2002-03-01,"Is this book about patterns? Yes and no. It is about software reuse and representation of knowledge that can be reapplied in similar situations; however, it does not follow the classic Alexandine conventions of the patterns community--i.e. Problem- solution- forces- context- example, etc. Chapter 6 on claims comes close to classic patterns, and the whole book can be viewed as a patterns language of abstract models for software engineering and HCI. So what sort of patterns does it contain? Specifications, conceptual models, design advice, but sorry not code. Plenty of other C++ code pattern books (see PLOP series). Nearest relative in published patterns books are Fowler's (1995) Analysis Patterns: Reusable object models and Coad, North and Mayfield. What do you mean by a Domain Theory? Not domains in the abstract mathematical sense, but domains in the knowledge--natural language sense, close to the everyday meaning when we talk about the application domain of a computer system, such as car rental, satellite tracking, whatever. The book is an attempt to answer the question ' what are the abstractions behind car rental, satellite tracking' so good design solutions for those problems can be reused. I work in industry, so what's in it for me? A new way of looking at software reuse, ideas for organizing a software and knowledge reuse program, new processes for reusing knowledge in requirements analysis, conceptual modeling and software specification.

Headed 'SOME FALLACIES OF FORMAL LOGIC' it simply listed eleven little pieces of reasoning, all in ordinary English, and all absurd. I still have the sheet, and quote a couple of the arguments here to give the idea. • If you throw switch S and switch T, the motor will start. There fore, either if you throw switch S the motor will start, or, if you throw switch T the motor will start . • It is not the case that if John passes history he will graduate. Therefore, John will pass history. The disconcerting thing about these inferences is, of course, that under the customary truth-functional interpretation of and, or, not, and if-then, they are supposed to be valid. What, if anything, is wrong? At first I was not disturbed by the examples. Having at that time consider able personal commitment to rationality in general and formal logic in par ticular, I felt it my duty and found myself easily able (or so I thought) to explain away most of them.

Symmetry Relationships between Crystal Structures,"Ulrich Müller, Gemma de la Flor",Oxford University Press,2024-11-25,"In crystal chemistry and crystal physics, the relations between the symmetry groups (space groups) of crystalline solids are of particular importance. Part I of this book presents the necessary mathematical foundations and tools: the fundamentals of crystallography with special emphasis on symmetry, the theory of the crystallographic groups, and the formalisms of the needed crystallographic computations. Part II gives an insight into applications to problems in crystal chemistry. With the aid of numerous examples, it is shown how crystallographic group theory can be used to make evident the relationships between crystal structures, to set up a systematic order in the huge amount of known crystal structures, to predict crystal structures, to analyse phase transitions and topotactic chemical reactions in the solid state, to understand the formation of domains and twins in crystals, and to avoid errors in crystal structure determinations. Part III delves further into some specific topics, namely the isomorphic subgroups of space groups, the theory of phase transitions, and computer programs dedicated to crystallographic group theory.

"Gen Z, Explained","Roberta Katz, Sarah Ogilvie, Jane Shaw, Linda Woodhead",University of Chicago Press,2021-10-15,"An optimistic and nuanced portrait of a generation that has much to teach us about how to live and collaborate in our digital world. Born since the mid-1990s, members of Generation Z comprise the first generation never to know the world without the internet, and the most diverse generation yet. As Gen Z starts to emerge into adulthood and enter the workforce, what do we really know about them? And what can we learn from them? Gen Z, Explained is the authoritative portrait of this significant generation. It draws on extensive interviews that display this generation’s candor, surveys that explore their views and attitudes, and a vast database of their astonishingly inventive lexicon to build a comprehensive picture of their values, daily lives, and outlook. Gen Z emerges here as an extraordinarily thoughtful, promising, and perceptive generation that is sounding a warning to their elders about the world around them—a warning of a complexity and depth the “OK Boomer” phenomenon can only suggest. ? Much of the existing literature about Gen Z has been highly judgmental. In contrast, this book provides a deep and nuanced understanding of a generation facing a future of enormous challenges, from climate change to civil unrest. What’s more, they are facing this future head-on, relying on themselves and their peers to work collaboratively to solve these problems. As Gen Z, Explained shows, this group of young people is as compassionate and imaginative as any that has come before, and understanding the way they tackle problems may enable us to envision new kinds of solutions. This portrait of Gen Z is ultimately an optimistic one, suggesting they have something to teach all of us about how to live and thrive in this digital world.",History,275,N/A,0,en

MODERN CONTROL ENGINEERING,D. ROY CHOUDHURY,PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.,2005-01-01,"This book represents an attempt to organize and unify the diverse methods of analysis of feedback control systems and presents the fundamentals explicitly and clearly. The scope of the text is such that it can be used for a two-semester course in control systems at the level of undergraduate students in any of the various branches of engineering (electrical, aeronautical, mechanical, and chemical). Emphasis is on the development of basic theory. The text is easy to follow and contains many examples to reinforce the understanding of the theory. Several software programs have been developed in MATLAB platform for better understanding of design of control systems. Many varied problems are included at the end of each chapter. The basic principles and fundamental concepts of feedback control systems, using the conventional frequency domain and time-domain approaches, are presented in a clearly accessible form in the first portion (chapters 1 through 10). The later portion (chapters 11 through 14) provides a thorough understanding of concepts such as state space, controllability, and observability. Students are also acquainted with the techniques available for analysing discrete-data and nonlinear systems. The hallmark feature of this text is that it helps the reader gain a sound understanding of both modern and classical topics in control engineering.",Technology & Engineering,841,N/A,0,en
Collaborative Relationships in Construction,"Hedley Smyth, Stephen Pryke",John Wiley & Sons,2009-01-28,"The book collects the latest research on both contractual andconceptual collaborative practices in construction. It identifiescommon problems faced by the industry and draws out practicalimplications. Construction projects are increasingly run in ways thatundermine the traditional boundary of the firm and sometimes alsothe definition of the project coalition. This poses challenges forconstruction firms whose clients demand ever increasing performanceimprovements as well as those firms who want to improve theirstrategies for greater collaboration to give themselves competitiveadvantage. The editors identify three main themes: collaborativerelationships, operating both in frameworks and within networks ofcontacts, e.g. relational contracting in partnering, supply chainmanagement and other procurement-driven initiatives. The second theme is frameworks, both contractual frameworksbinding parties together over a series of contracts, and conceptualframeworks used to develop future performance improvement arisingfrom the proactive strategies of firms. The third theme is the network of relationships that supportsindividuals and firms within the project coalition in deliveringservices and adding value to improve performance. These networksdefine the investment and incentives supporting the inter-firm andintra-firm relationships, as well as the formal contractualconditions through which such incentives flow. Networks ofinformation exchange define the structure of the activity and helppredict organisational configurations for successful projectoutcomes.",Technology & Engineering,272,N/A,0,en
Spatial Awareness of Autonomous Embedded Systems,Clemens Holzmann,Springer Science & Business Media,2009-07-26,"Clemens Holzmann investigates the role of spatial contexts for autonomous embedded systems. The author presents concepts for recognizing, representing, and reasoning about qualitative spatial relations and their changes over time, as well as an appropriate architecture which has prototypically been implemented in a flexible software framework. His results show that the proposed concepts are suitable for developing spatially aware applications and that qualitatively abstracted relations can constitute an adequate basis for this purpose.",Computers,220,N/A,0,en
Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory,J.L. Krivine,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This book presents the classic relative consistency proofs in set theory that are obtained by the device of 'inner models'. Three examples of such models are investigated in Chapters VI, VII, and VIII; the most important of these, the class of constructible sets, leads to G6del's result that the axiom of choice and the continuum hypothesis are consistent with the rest of set theory [1]I. The text thus constitutes an introduction to the results of P. Cohen concerning the independence of these axioms [2], and to many other relative consistency proofs obtained later by Cohen's methods. Chapters I and II introduce the axioms of set theory, and develop such parts of the theory as are indispensable for every relative consistency proof; the method of recursive definition on the ordinals being an import ant case in point. Although, more or less deliberately, no proofs have been omitted, the development here will be found to require of the reader a certain facility in naive set theory and in the axiomatic method, such e as should be achieved, for example, in first year graduate work (2 cycle de mathernatiques).",Philosophy,108,N/A,0,en

New Approaches in Applied Musicology,"Adam Ockelford, Graham Welch",Routledge,2020-01-27,"This book presents four extended essays that are rooted in the growing interdisciplinary field of applied musicology, in which music theory – in particular, the zygonic conjecture – is used to inform thinking in the domains of music psychology, music education and music therapy research. It is essential reading for academics and postgraduate students working in these fields. The topics covered include a new study on the emergence of musical abilities in the early years, using the Sounds of Intent framework of musical development; an exploration of how the Sounds of Intent model can be extended to map how people with learning difficulties engage in creative multisensory activities; an investigation of the expectations generated on hearing a piece of music more than once evolve in cognition, using evidence from a musical savant; and a report on the effect on listeners of repeated exposure to a novel melody. Data are drawn from the findings of postgraduate and postdoctoral projects. It is hoped that this exciting new work will act as a catalyst in the emerging field of applied musicological research, and bring recognition to a group of new young academics.",Music,291,N/A,0,en

Analytic Freud,Michael Levine,Routledge,2002-03-11,"This is a timely and stimulating collection of essays on the importance of Freudian thought for analytic philosophy, investigating its impact on mind, ethics, sexuality, religion and epistemology. Marking a clear departure from the long-standing debate over whether Freudian thought is scientific or not, The Analytic Freud expands the framework of philosophical inquiry, demonstrating how fertile and mutually enriching the relationship between philosophy and psychoanalysis can be. The essays are divided into four clear sections, addressing the implications of Freud for philosophy of mind, ethics, sexuality and civilisation. The authors discuss the problems psychoanalysis poses for contemporary philosophy as well as what philosophy can learn from Freud's legacy and undeniable influence. For instance, The Analytic Freud discusses the problems presented by pyschoanalytic theories of the mind for the philosophy of language; the issues which current theories of mind and meaning raise for psychoanalytic accounts of emotion, metaphor, the will and self-deception; the question whether psychoanalytic theory is essential in understanding sexuality, love, humour and the tensions which arise out of personal relationships. The Analytic Freud is a critical and thorough examination of Freudian and post-Freudian theory, adding a welcome and significant dimension to the debate between psychoanalysis and contemporary philosophy.",Philosophy,333,N/A,0,en

Pseudo-Noun Incorporation and Differential Object Marking,Imke Driemel,Oxford University Press,2023-03-07,"This book provides a detailed cross-linguistic study of pseudo-noun incorporation, a phenomenon whereby an argument forms a 'closer than usual' relation with the verb. Imke Driemel draws on data from Tamil, Mongolian, Korean, Turkish, and German, and applies diagnostic tests across eleven noun types in each of the languages under consideration. What emerges is a coherent effect of pseudo-incorporated arguments that maps loss of case marking to obligatory narrow scope, lack of binding and control relations, and a potentially restricted movement pattern. The book provides a unifying theory that is able to capture all properties with a single assumption: pseudo-incorporation effects result from noun phrases that are made up of a nominal and a verbal category feature; implemented in a derivational framework, the nominal feature is active early in the derivation, being responsible for c-selection and nominal modification, while the verbal feature is active late and crucially derives the effects we have come to recognize as pseudo-noun incorporation. One important empirical contribution of this study stems from the observation that pseudo-incorporation does not have to be the only reason for optional case marking. Tamil and Korean provide evidence that only a subset of optionally case-marked noun types also show a correlation with scope, binding, control, and movement constraints. This insight enforces the conclusion that the same language can make use of both pseudo-noun incorporation and differential object marking.",Language Arts & Disciplines,369,N/A,0,en

We have a fairly good idea about el- tronic and hydrophobic parameters, but it is not easy to describe ste­ ric shapes of molecules without a large number of data. There are se­ veral cases of good QSAR's developed for rather large series of mole- 5 cules without steric parameters - for example see papers by Hansch , 6 or Franke , but the state of steric parameters is nevertheless one of the most important drawbacks, especially concerning the ability of en­ compassing, within a single QSAR, molecules of different shapes and stereoisomers.

My Voice,Angie Martinez,Penguin,2016-05-17,"THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Angie Martinez is the “Voice of New York.” Now, for the first time, she candidly recounts the story of her rise to become an internationally celebrated hip hop radio icon. In her current reign at Power 105.1 and for nearly two decades at New York’s Hot 97, Angie Martinez has had one of the highest rated radio shows in the country. After working her way up as an intern, she burst on the scene as a young female jock whose on-air “Battle of the Beats” segment broke records and became a platform for emerging artists like a young Jay Z. Angie quickly became known for intimate, high-profile interviews, mediating feuds between artists, and taking on the most controversial issues in hip hop. At age twenty-five, at the height of the East Coast/West Coast rap war, Angie was summoned by Tupac Shakur for what would be his last no-holds-barred interview—which has never aired in its entirety and which she’s never discussed in detail—until now. Angie shares stories from behind-the-scenes of her most controversial conversations, from onetime presidential hopeful Barack Obama to superstars like Mary J. Blige and Chris Brown, and describes her emotional, bittersweet final days at Hot 97 and the highly publicized move to Power 105.1. She also opens up about her personal life—from her roots in Washington Heights and her formative years being raised by a single mom in Brooklyn to exploring the lessons that shaped her into the woman she is today. From the Puerto Rican Day Parade to the White House—Angie is universally recognized as a powerful voice in the Latino and hip hop communities. My Voice gives an inside look at New York City’s one-of-a-kind urban radio culture, the changing faces of hip hop music, and Angie’s rise to become the Voice of New York.",Biography & Autobiography,290,N/A,0,en

"Gen Z, Explained","Roberta Katz, Sarah Ogilvie, Jane Shaw, Linda Woodhead",University of Chicago Press,2022-10-26,"An optimistic and nuanced portrait of a generation that has much to teach us about how to live and collaborate in our digital world. Born since the mid-1990s, members of Generation Z comprise the first generation never to know the world without the internet, and the most diverse generation yet. As Gen Z starts to emerge into adulthood and enter the workforce, what do we really know about them? And what can we learn from them? Gen Z, Explained is the authoritative portrait of this significant generation. It draws on extensive interviews that display this generation’s candor, surveys that explore their views and attitudes, and a vast database of their astonishingly inventive lexicon to build a comprehensive picture of their values, daily lives, and outlook. Gen Z emerges here as an extraordinarily thoughtful, promising, and perceptive generation that is sounding a warning to their elders about the world around them—a warning of a complexity and depth the “OK Boomer” phenomenon can only suggest. ​ Much of the existing literature about Gen Z has been highly judgmental. In contrast, this book provides a deep and nuanced understanding of a generation facing a future of enormous challenges, from climate change to civil unrest. What’s more, they are facing this future head-on, relying on themselves and their peers to work collaboratively to solve these problems. As Gen Z, Explained shows, this group of young people is as compassionate and imaginative as any that has come before, and understanding the way they tackle problems may enable us to envision new kinds of solutions. This portrait of Gen Z is ultimately an optimistic one, suggesting they have something to teach all of us about how to live and thrive in this digital world.",History,275,N/A,0,en

Savage Love,Dan Savage,N/A,2000,"Savage Love tells (almost) all anyone needs to know about sex. Brutally honest and scathingly funny, Dan's advice will inform and shock the curious reader. Savage has the last word on everything from STDs and fetishes, to fundamentalism and orgasms (multiple, premature and faked). He gives advice on how to get into, out of and off on a relationship, explains what straight boys should do with women's genitals and why straight girls dig gay boys. From the queer who knows best, the book sets out to tell it like it is. Don't like my advice? Don't ask for it. Don't like my column? Don't read it. Got better advice? Get your own f**cking advice column.",Love,278,5,1,en

Weaving an Otherwise,"Amanda Tachine, Z Nicolazzo",Taylor & Francis,2023-07-03,"Who (and what) are you bearing witness to (and for) through your research? When you witness, what claims are you making about who and what matters? What does your research forget, and does it do it on purpose?This book reconceptualizes qualitative research as an in-relations process, one that is centered on, fully concerned with, and lifts up those who have been and continue to be dispossessed, harmed, dehumanized, and erased because of white supremacy, settler colonialism, or other hegemonic world views.It prompts scholars to make connections between themselves as “researchers” and affect, ancestors, community, family and kinship, space and place, and the more than human beings with whom they are always already in community.What are the modes and ways of knowing through which we approach our research? How can the practice of research bring us closer to the peoples, places, more than human beings, histories, presents, and futures in which we are embedded and connected to? If we are the instruments of our research, then how must we be attentive to all of the affects and relations that make us who we are and what will become? These questions animate Weaving an Otherwise, providing a wellspring from which we think about our interconnections to the past, present, and future possibilities of research.After an opening chapter by the editors that explores the consequences and liberating opportunities of rejecting dominant qualitative methodologies that erase the voices of the subordinated and disdained, the contributors of nine chapters explore and enact approaches that uncover hidden connections and reveal unconscious value systems.",Education,124,N/A,0,en

Work's Intimacy,Melissa Gregg,John Wiley & Sons,2013-04-23,"This book provides a long-overdue account of online technology and its impact on the work and lifestyles of professional employees. It moves between the offices and homes of workers in the knew ""knowledge"" economy to provide intimate insight into the personal, family, and wider social tensions emerging in today’s rapidly changing work environment. Drawing on her extensive research, Gregg shows that new media technologies encourage and exacerbate an older tendency among salaried professionals to put work at the heart of daily concerns, often at the expense of other sources of intimacy and fulfillment. New media technologies from mobile phones to laptops and tablet computers, have been marketed as devices that give us the freedom to work where we want, when we want, but little attention has been paid to the consequences of this shift, which has seen work move out of the office and into cafés, trains, living rooms, dining rooms, and bedrooms. This professional ""presence bleed"" leads to work concerns impinging on the personal lives of employees in new and unforseen ways. This groundbreaking book explores how aspiring and established professionals each try to cope with the unprecedented intimacy of technologically-mediated work, and how its seductions seem poised to triumph over the few remaining relationships that may stand in its way.",Social Science,232,N/A,0,en

Gen Z @ Work,"David Stillman, Jonah Stillman",HarperCollins,2017-03-21,"A generations expert and author of When Generations Collide and The M-Factor teams up with his seventeen-year-old son to introduce the next influential demographic group to join the workforce—Generation Z—in this essential study, the first on the subject. They were born between between 1995 and 2012. At 72.8 million strong, Gen Z is about to make its presence known in the workplace in a major way—and employers need to understand the differences that set them apart. They’re radically different than the Millennials, and yet no one seems to be talking about them—until now. This generation has an entirely unique perspective on careers and how to succeed in the workforce. Based on the first national studies of Gen Z’s workplace attitudes; interviews with hundreds of CEOs, celebrities, and thought leaders on generational issues; cutting-edge case studies; and insights from Gen Zers themselves, Gen Z @ Work offers the knowledge today’s leaders need to get ahead of the next gaps in the workplace and how best to recruit, retain, motivate, and manage Gen Zers. Ahead of the curve, Gen Z @ Work is the first comprehensive, serious look at what the next generation of workers looks like, and what that means for the rest of us.",Business & Economics,205,N/A,0,en

The Patchwork City,Marco Z. Garrido,University of Chicago Press,2019-08-05,"In contemporary Manila, slums and squatter settlements are peppered throughout the city, often pushing right up against the walled enclaves of the privileged, creating the complex geopolitical pattern of Marco Z. Garrido’s “patchwork city.” Garrido documents the fragmentation of Manila into a mélange of spaces defined by class, particularly slums and upper- and middle-class enclaves. He then looks beyond urban fragmentation to delineate its effects on class relations and politics, arguing that the proliferation of these slums and enclaves and their subsequent proximity have intensified class relations. For enclave residents, the proximity of slums is a source of insecurity, compelling them to impose spatial boundaries on slum residents. For slum residents, the regular imposition of these boundaries creates a pervasive sense of discrimination. Class boundaries then sharpen along the housing divide, and the urban poor and middle class emerge not as labor and capital but as squatters and “villagers,” Manila’s name for subdivision residents. Garrido further examines the politicization of this divide with the case of the populist president Joseph Estrada, finding the two sides drawn into contention over not just the right to the city, but the nature of democracy itself. The Patchwork City illuminates how segregation, class relations, and democracy are all intensely connected. It makes clear, ultimately, that class as a social structure is as indispensable to the study of Manila—and of many other cities of the Global South—as race is to the study of American cities.",Social Science,287,N/A,0,en

The Leader in Me,Stephen R. Covey,Simon and Schuster,2012-12-11,"Children in today's world are inundated with information about who to be, what to do and how to live. But what if there was a way to teach children how to manage priorities, focus on goals and be a positive influence on the world around them? The Leader in Meis that programme. It's based on a hugely successful initiative carried out at the A.B. Combs Elementary School in North Carolina. To hear the parents of A. B Combs talk about the school is to be amazed. In 1999, the school debuted a programme that taught The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Peopleto a pilot group of students. The parents reported an incredible change in their children, who blossomed under the programme. By the end of the following year the average end-of-grade scores had leapt from 84 to 94. This book will launch the message onto a much larger platform. Stephen R. Covey takes the 7 Habits, that have already changed the lives of millions of people, and shows how children can use them as they develop. Those habits -- be proactive, begin with the end in mind, put first things first, think win-win, seek to understand and then to be understood, synergize, and sharpen the saw -- are critical skills to learn at a young age and bring incredible results, proving that it's never too early to teach someone how to live well.",Self-Help,218,2,2,en

Managing Generation Z,"Robin Paggi, Kat Clowes",Linden Publishing,2021-04-06,"Expert advice on attracting, training, managing, retaining, and succeeding with America's newest generation of hard-working, tech-savvy employees. A new generation is entering the American workforce—Gen Z, the age cohort born after 1996. Having grown up with smartphones, social media, emoji-speak, helicopter parenting, and no expectation of privacy, Gen Z has a unique culture and working style that can be baffling to their Millennial, Gen X, and Baby Boomer managers. In Managing Generation Z, Robin Paggi, a veteran HR manager, and Kat Clowes, an educational consultant who has worked with hundreds of Gen Z'ers, join forces to give employers and managers a practical, easy-to-understand guide to the new generation defining the future of work. Based on Clowes's in-depth knowledge of Gen Z habits and Paggi's real-world experience of how generational miscommunications can cause expensive personnel problems, Managing Generation Z gives managers at all levels a plan for getting quality work from Gen Z employees while avoiding cultural clashes at the office. Gen Z is highly educated, extraordinarily tech-savvy, eager to meet expectations, and loyal to employers, but many Gen Z workers have never been trained in the basics of professionalism, workplace communication, and the unwritten social rules older generations instinctively expect. Managing Generation Z teaches managers how to bridge the communication styles between Gen Z and older colleagues, how to train Gen Z staff to make work objectives clear, and how to evaluate and correct Gen Z employees so they will listen, accept, learn, and improve. Like having an expert HR manager at your fingertips, Managing Generation Z is essential reading for both front-line supervisors and C-level executives who want to get the most from the newest generation in the workforce.",Business & Economics,325,N/A,0,en

Misfit in Love,S. K. Ali,Salaam Reads / Simon & Schuster Books for Young Readers,2021-05-25,"In this fun and fresh sequel to Saints and Misfits, Janna hopes her brother’s wedding will be the perfect start to her own summer of love, but attractive new arrivals have her more confused than ever. Janna Yusuf is so excited for the weekend: her brother Muhammad’s getting married, and she’s reuniting with her mom, whom she’s missed the whole summer. And Nuah’s arriving for the weekend too. Sweet, constant Nuah. The last time she saw him, Janna wasn’t ready to reciprocate his feelings for her. But things are different now. She’s finished high school, ready for college…and ready for Nuah. It’s time for Janna’s (carefully planned) summer of love to begin—starting right at the wedding. But it wouldn’t be a wedding if everything went according to plan. Muhammad’s party choices aren’t in line with his fiancée’s taste at all, Janna’s dad is acting strange, and her mom is spending more time with an old friend (and maybe love interest?) than Janna. And Nuah’s treating her differently. Just when things couldn’t get more complicated, two newcomers—the dreamy Haytham and brooding Layth—have Janna more confused than ever about what her misfit heart really wants. Janna’s summer of love is turning out to be super crowded and painfully unpredictable.",Young Adult Fiction,320,N/A,0,en
