Engineering a Life,Krishan K. Bedi,Simon and Schuster,2018-04-03,"Included on BookBub’s ""The Most Exciting Memoirs Coming Out in 2018” list Krishan Bedi came to the United States in December of 1961 at the tender age of twenty. He had only $300 in his pocket, and he had made it out of his small village in India on sheer faith, determined to get education in the US. For him, there was no option but to succeed—so he began his new life in Knoxville, Tennessee, where he had to adapt to the culture shock not only of being in the US but a Punjabi man in the South in the 1960s. Engineering a Life is an examination of Bedi’s life, and how he has handled the plethora of curve balls thrown his way with determination, humor, and an unwavering faith that everything would work out. This is a book about values and faith and the importance of friendship, family, and hard work. It’s a story about achieving the American Dream, proving that no matter how thoroughly you map out your life’s journey, no matter how many blueprints you draw up, when you veer off the course you’ve plotted—as we all do, somehow, in the end—you end up where you’re supposed to be.",Biography & Autobiography,345,N/A,0,en

Structural Engineering: A Very Short Introduction,David Blockley,OUP Oxford,2014-09-25,"Have you ever wondered how it's possible to build a skyscraper, a big bridge, a jumbo jet, or a cruise liner? Everything has structure. Structure is the difference between a random pile of components and a fully functional object. Through structure the parts connect to make the whole. Natural structures vary from the very smallest part of an atom to the entire cosmology of the universe. Man-made structures include buildings, bridges, dams, ships, aeroplanes, rockets, trains, cars and fair-ground rides and all forms of artefacts, even large artistic sculptures. The wide range of different industries in which structural engineers work includes construction, transport, manufacturing, and aerospace. In this Very Short Introduction, David Blockley explores, in non-technical language, what structural engineering is all about, including examples ranging from the Shard in London and the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco to jumbo jets like the A380 and the Queen Elizabeth cruise liner. ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

Engineering a Safer World,Nancy G. Leveson,MIT Press,2012-01-13,"A new approach to safety, based on systems thinking, that is more effective, less costly, and easier to use than current techniques. Engineering has experienced a technological revolution, but the basic engineering techniques applied in safety and reliability engineering, created in a simpler, analog world, have changed very little over the years. In this groundbreaking book, Nancy Leveson proposes a new approach to safety—more suited to today's complex, sociotechnical, software-intensive world—based on modern systems thinking and systems theory. Revisiting and updating ideas pioneered by 1950s aerospace engineers in their System Safety concept, and testing her new model extensively on real-world examples, Leveson has created a new approach to safety that is more effective, less expensive, and easier to use than current techniques. Arguing that traditional models of causality are inadequate, Leveson presents a new, extended model of causation (Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes, or STAMP), then shows how the new model can be used to create techniques for system safety engineering, including accident analysis, hazard analysis, system design, safety in operations, and management of safety-critical systems. She applies the new techniques to real-world events including the friendly-fire loss of a U.S. Blackhawk helicopter in the first Gulf War; the Vioxx recall; the U.S. Navy SUBSAFE program; and the bacterial contamination of a public water supply in a Canadian town. Leveson's approach is relevant even beyond safety engineering, offering techniques for “reengineering” any large sociotechnical system to improve safety and manage risk.",Science,555,3,1,en

Holistic Engineering Education,"Domenico Grasso, Melody Burkins",Springer Science & Business Media,2010-03-01,"Holistic Engineering Education: Beyond Technology is a compilation of coordinated and focused essays from world leaders in the engineering profession who are dedicated to a transformation of engineering education and practice. The contributors define a new and holistic approach to education and practice that captures the creativity, interdisciplinarity, complexity, and adaptability required for the profession to grow and truly serve global needs. With few exceptions today, engineering students and professionals continue to receive a traditional, technically-based education and training using curriculum models developed for early 20th century manufacturing and machining. While this educational paradigm has served engineering well, helping engineers create awe-inspiring machines and technologies for society, the coursework and expectations of most engineering programs eschew breadth and intellectual exploration to focus on consistent technological precision and study. Why this dichotomy? While engineering will always need precise technological skill, the 21st century innovation economy demands a new professional perspective that recognizes the value of complex systems thinking, cross-disciplinary collaborations, economic and environmental impacts (sustainability), and effective communication to global and community leaders, thus enabling engineers to consider ""the whole patient"" of society's needs. The goal of this book is to inspire, lead, and guide this critically needed transformation of engineering education. ""Holistic Engineering Education: Beyond Technology points the way to a transformation of engineering education and practice that will be sufficiently robust, flexible, and systems-oriented to meet the grand challenges of the 21st century with their ever-increasing scale, complexity, and transdisciplinary nature."" -- Charles Vest, President, National Academy of Engineering; President Emeritus, MIT ""This collection of essays provides compelling arguments for the need of an engineering education that prepares engineers for the problems of the 21st century.

Inner Engineering A (D.I.Y) User Manual,A K Francis,A K Francis,2021-05-23,"Inner engineering is a subject which has always interested me throughout my life. I am lucky to have attended quite a few Inner Engineering sessions conducted by some organizations. Such seminars are normally conducted by religious organizations. Of late secular and professional organizations also conduct such seminars to boost overall health and well being. Hurt feelings are the result of most of the turmoil that we see around us today. Individuals have hurt feelings; communities have hurt feelings so do whole nations have hurt feelings. Hurt feelings are the result of some past events in which one of the persons involved or community involved have had to undergo public embarrassment. The public insult caused due to hurt feelings gives birth to a desire to take revenge. Individuals, communities and nations keep this desire for revenge for years. Due to this desire for revenge are born personal fights, revolts and wars. The great wars which humanity has waged were caused due to hurt feelings which the victim had gone through. Hence engineering is required at all levels be it at individual level, community level or national level. People have to be bold and forgive each other. National leaders should be bold enough to accept responsibility for the mistakes committed in the past by their leaders and submit a public apology. This is the only way forward. Nations have fought wars against each other due to misunderstandings and mistakes on the part of their ancestors. Because of this, even decades after world war two some nations still regard other nations as their rivals or enemies. Throughout the world we find border skirmishes between the armies of nations due to this rivalry carried forward from past wars. As examples I can mention the regular skirmishes between India and Pakistan on the L.O.C., The continuous skirmishes between the Israeli army and the Arabs in the Gaza Strip is another example of the result of hurt feelings between two nations. This article tries to delve into the subject of hurt feelings and the tragic events caused by them. If people and nations forgive each other then trillions of dollars that are spent with the intentions of inflicting harm to each other would be saved. Without hurt feelings the world would become a better place with abundance of resources for the betterment of society as a whole. I have written this small article without any bias towards or against people of any community and with a secular mental attitude. Hence I have preferred to name the supreme deity as just ‘God’ or Divinity. Circumstantial evidences are overwhelming that mind in conjunction with Divinity can really work wonders by engineering the mind and making available avenues for progress.","Body, Mind & Spirit",31,N/A,0,en

The Case Study Handbook,William Ellet,Harvard Business Review Press,2007-04-17,"If you're enrolled in an executive education or MBA program, you've probably encountered a powerful learning tool: the business case. But if you're like many people, you may find interpreting and writing about cases mystifying, challenging, or downright frustrating. In ""The Case Study Handbook"", William Ellet presents a potent new approach for analyzing, discussing, and writing about cases. Early chapters show how to classify cases according to the analytical task they require (solving a problem, making a decision, or forming an evaluation) and quickly establish a base of knowledge about a case. Strategies and templates, in addition to several sample Harvard Business School cases, help you apply the author's framework. Later in the book, Ellet shows how to write persuasive case-analytical essays based on the process laid out earlier. Extensive examples of effective and ineffective writing further reinforce your learning. The book also includes a chapter on how to talk about cases more effectively in class. Any current or prospective MBA or executive education student needs to read this book.",Business & Economics,281,N/A,0,en

Evolving Software Processes,"Arif Ali Khan, Dac-Nhuong Le",John Wiley & Sons,2022-01-05,"EVOLVING SOFTWARE PROCESSES The book provides basic building blocks of evolution in software processes, such as DevOps, scaling agile process in GSD, in order to lay a solid foundation for successful and sustainable future processes. One might argue that there are already many books that include descriptions of software processes. The answer is “yes, but.” Becoming acquainted with existing software processes is not enough. It is tremendously important to understand the evolution and advancement in software processes so that developers appropriately address the problems, applications, and environments to which they are applied. Providing basic knowledge for these important tasks is the main goal of this book. Industry is in search of software process management capabilities. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic emphasizes the industry’s need for software-specific process management capabilities. Most of today’s products and services are based to a significant degree on software and are the results of largescale development programs. The success of such programs heavily depends on process management capabilities, because they typically require the coordination of hundreds or thousands of developers across different disciplines. Additionally, software and system development are usually distributed across geographical, cultural and temporal boundaries, which make the process management activities more challenging in the current pandemic situation. This book presents an extremely comprehensive overview of the evolution in software processes and provides a platform for practitioners, researchers and students to discuss the studies used for managing aspects of the software process, including managerial, organizational, economic and technical. It provides an opportunity to present empirical evidence, as well as proposes new techniques, tools, frameworks and approaches to maximize the significance of software process management. Audience The book will be used by practitioners, researchers, software engineers, and those in software process management, DevOps, agile and global software development.",Computers,324,N/A,0,en

Dare to Invent the Future,Clapperton Chakanetsa Mavhunga,MIT Press,2023-11-21,"A rallying manifesto for the innovative problem-solving we need to build a better, more verdant, and sustainable planetary existence. Academics are letting Africa down. With all that we know, what do we have to show for it? Whose lives have been changed for the better by it? What have we done for and with our communities lately? In this provocative book—the first in a trilogy—Clapperton Chakanetsa Mavhunga argues that our critical thinkers must become actual thinker-doers. Taking its title from one of Thomas Sankara’s most inspirational speeches, Dare to Invent the Future looks for moments in Africa’s story where precedents of critical thought and knowledge in service of problem-solving are evident to inspire readers to dare to invent such a knowledge system. Mavhunga revisits insights from Edward Wilmot Blyden, Booker T. Washington, Aimé Césaire, Frantz Fanon, Amílcar Cabral, Julius Nyerere, and Thomas Sankara to illustrate how the academic disciplines have been, and could be, deployed in the service of and through problem-solving, building on what people are doing and know. At its core, he writes, knowledge in the service of and through problem-solving derives from reading the past for new questions, doing due diligence in the present, and contriving an anticipatory approach toward the future. Questioning the fundamental premises of Western and white knowledge production, especially regarding science and technology, Mavhunga proposes in this book refreshingly new approaches to thinking-doing that stem from African realities, in the hopes of inspiring a generation that will run toward, not away from, problems to solve them.",Technology & Engineering,389,N/A,0,en

The Engineering Project,Gene Moriarty,Penn State Press,2015-11-05,"We all live our daily lives surrounded by the products of technology that make what we do simpler, faster, and more efficient. These are benefits we often just take for granted. But at the same time, as these products disburden us of unwanted tasks that consumed much time and effort in earlier eras, many of them also leave us more disengaged from our natural and even human surroundings. It is the task of what Gene Moriarty calls focal engineering to create products that will achieve a balance between disburdenment and engagement: “How much disburdenment will be appropriate while still permitting an engagement that enriches one’s life, elevates the spirit, and calls forth a good life in a convivial society?” One of his examples of a focally engineered structure is the Golden Gate Bridge, which “draws people to it, enlivens and elevates the human spirit, and resonates with the world of its congenial setting. Humans, bridge, and world are in tune.” These values of engagement, enlivenment, and resonance are key to the normative approach Moriarty brings to the profession of engineering, which traditionally has focused mainly on technical measures of evaluation such as efficiency, productivity, objectivity, and precision. These measures, while important, look at the engineered product in a local and limited sense. But “from a broader perspective, what is locally benign may present serious moral problems,” undermining “social justice, environmental sustainability, and health and safety of affected parties.” It is this broader perspective that is championed by focal engineering, the subject of Part III of the book, which Moriarty contrasts with “modern” engineering in Part I and “pre-modern” engineering in Part II.",Science,226,N/A,0,en

As an innovator, do you feel confident that you can navigate obstacles and achieve success with your innovative project? The reality is that most innovation projects fail. The challenge in developing any new technology, application, or venture is that the innovator must be able to ""execute while also learning"". Innovation Engineering, developed and used at UC Berkeley, provides the tactical process, leadership, and behaviors necessary for successful innovation projects. Our validation tests have shown that teams which properly use Innovation Engineering accomplished their innovative projects approximately 4X faster than and with higher quality results. They also on-board new team members faster, they have much fewer unnecessary meetings, and they even report a more positive outlook on the project itself. Inter-woven between the chapters are real-life case studies with some of the world's most successful innovators to provide context, patterns, and playbooks that you can follow. Highly applied, and very realistic, Innovation Engineering builds on 30 years of technology innovation projects within large firms, advanced development labs, and new ventures at UC Berkeley, in Silicon Valley, and globally. If your goal is to create something new and have it successfully used in real life, this book is for you.",Business & Economics,236,N/A,0,en

Engineering Rules,"JoAnne Yates, Craig N. Murphy",Johns Hopkins University Press,2021-03-30,"The first global history of voluntary consensus standard setting. Finalist, Hagley Prize in Business History, The Hagley Museum and Library / The Business History Conference Private, voluntary standards shape almost everything we use, from screw threads to shipping containers to e-readers. They have been critical to every major change in the world economy for more than a century, including the rise of global manufacturing and the ubiquity of the internet. In Engineering Rules, JoAnne Yates and Craig N. Murphy trace the standard-setting system's evolution through time, revealing a process with an astonishingly pervasive, if rarely noticed, impact on all of our lives. This type of standard setting was established in the 1880s, when engineers aimed to prove their status as professionals by creating useful standards that would be widely adopted by manufacturers while satisfying corporate customers. Yates and Murphy explain how these engineers' processes provided a timely way to set desirable standards that would have taken much longer to emerge from the market and that governments were rarely willing to set. By the 1920s, the standardizers began to think of themselves as critical to global prosperity and world peace. After World War II, standardizers transcended Cold War divisions to create standards that made the global economy possible. Finally, Yates and Murphy reveal how, since 1990, a new generation of standardizers has focused on supporting the internet and web while applying the same standard-setting process to regulate the potential social and environmental harms of the increasingly global economy. Drawing on archival materials from three continents, Yates and Murphy describe the positive ideals that sparked the standardization movement, the ways its leaders tried to realize those ideals, and the challenges the movement faces today. Engineering Rules is a riveting global history of the people, processes, and organizations that created and maintain this nearly invisible infrastructure of today's economy, which is just as important as the state or the global market.",Technology & Engineering,439,N/A,0,en

Philosophy and Engineering: An Emerging Agenda,"Ibo van de Poel, David E. Goldberg",Springer Science & Business Media,2010-03-11,"Whereas science, technology, and medicine have all called forth dedicated philosophical investigations, a fourth major contributor to the technoscientific world in which we all live - that is, engineering - has been accorded almost none of the philosophical attention it deserves. This volume thus offers a first characterisation of this important new field, by some of the primary philosophers and ethicists interested in engineering and leading engineers interested in philosophical reflections. The volume deals with such questions as: What is engineering? In what respect does engineering differ from science? What ethical problems does engineering raise? By what ethical principles are engineers guided? How do engineers themselves conceive of their profession? What do they see as the main philosophical challenges confronting them in the 21st century? The authors respond to these and other questions from philosophical and engineering view points and so illustrate how together they can meet the challenges and realize the opportunities present in the necessary encounters between philosophy and engineering - encounters that are ever more important in an increasingly engineered world and its problematic futures.",Philosophy,360,3,1,en
Perspectives in Civil Engineering,Jeffrey S. Russell,ASCE Publications,2003-01-01,"This report contains 27 papers that serve as a testament to the state-of-the-art of civil engineering at the outset of the 21st century, as well as to commemorate the ASCE's Sesquicentennial. Written by the leading practitioners, educators, and researchers of civil engineering, each of these peer-reviewed papers explores a particular aspect of civil engineering knowledge and practice. Each paper explores the development of a particular civil engineering specialty, including milestones and future barriers, constraints, and opportunities. The papers celebrate the history, heritage, and accomplishments of the profession in all facets of practice, including construction facilities, special structures, engineering mechanics, surveying and mapping, irrigation and water quality, forensics, computing, materials, geotechnical engineering, hydraulic engineering, and transportation engineering. While each paper is unique, collectively they provide a snapshot of the profession while offering thoughtful predictions of likely developments in the years to come. Together the papers illuminate the mounting complexity facing civil engineering stemming from rapid growth in scientific knowledge, technological development, and human populations, especially in the last 50 years. An overarching theme is the need for systems-level approaches and consideration from undergraduate education through advanced engineering materials, processes, technologies, and design methods and tools. These papers speak to the need for civil engineers of all specialties to recognize and embrace the growing interconnectedness of the global infrastructure, economy, society, and the need to work for more sustainable, life-cycle-oriented solutions. While embracing the past and the present, the papers collected here clearly have an eye on the future needs of ASCE and the civil engineering profession.",Technology & Engineering,422,5,1,en

Changing the Face of Engineering,"John Brooks Slaughter, Yu Tao, Willie Pearson Jr.",JHU Press,2015-12-15,"How can academic institutions, corporations, and policymakers foster African American participation and advancement in engineering? For much of America’s history, African Americans were discouraged or aggressively prevented from becoming scientists and engineers. Those who did enter STEM fields found that their inventions and discoveries were often neither recognized nor valued. Even today, particularly in the field of engineering, the participation of African American men and women is shockingly low, and some evidence indicates that the situation might be getting worse. In Changing the Face of Engineering, twenty-four eminent scholars address the underrepresentation of African Americans in engineering from a wide variety of disciplinary and professional perspectives while proposing workable classroom solutions and public policy initiatives. They combine robust statistical analyses with personal narratives of African American engineers and STEM instructors who, by taking evidenced-based approaches, have found success in graduating African American engineers. Changing the Face of Engineering argues that the continued underrepresentation of African Americans in engineering impairs the ability of the United States to compete successfully in the global marketplace.

The Essential Engineer,Henry Petroski,Vintage,2011-03-08,"From the acclaimed author of The Pencil and To Engineer Is Human, The Essential Engineer is an eye-opening exploration of the ways in which science and engineering must work together to address our world’s most pressing issues, from dealing with climate change and the prevention of natural disasters to the development of efficient automobiles and the search for renewable energy sources. While the scientist may identify problems, it falls to the engineer to solve them. It is the inherent practicality of engineering, which takes into account structural, economic, environmental, and other factors that science often does not consider, that makes engineering vital to answering our most urgent concerns. Henry Petroski takes us inside the research, development, and debates surrounding the most critical challenges of our time, exploring the feasibility of biofuels, the progress of battery-operated cars, and the question of nuclear power. He gives us an in-depth investigation of the various options for renewable energy—among them solar, wind, tidal, and ethanol—explaining the benefits and risks of each. Will windmills soon populate our landscape the way they did in previous centuries? Will synthetic trees, said to be more efficient at absorbing harmful carbon dioxide than real trees, soon dot our prairies? Will we construct a “sunshade” in outer space to protect ourselves from dangerous rays? In many cases, the technology already exists. What’s needed is not so much invention as engineering. Just as the great achievements of centuries past—the steamship, the airplane, the moon landing—once seemed beyond reach, the solutions to the twenty-first century’s problems await only a similar coordination of science and engineering. Eloquently reasoned and written, The Essential Engineer identifies and illuminates these problems—and, above all, sets out a course for putting ideas into action.",Science,290,N/A,0,en

Domain Science and Engineering,Dines Bjørner,Springer Nature,2021-11-08,"In this book the author explains domain engineering and the underlying science, and he then shows how we can derive requirements prescriptions for computing systems from domain descriptions. A further motivation is to present domain descriptions, requirements prescriptions, and software design specifications as mathematical quantities. The author's maxim is that before software can be designed we must understand its requirements, and before requirements can be prescribed we must analyse and describe the domain for which the software is intended. He does this by focusing on what it takes to analyse and describe domains. By a domain we understand a rationally describable discrete dynamics segment of human activity, of natural and man-made artefacts, examples include road, rail and air transport, container terminal ports, manufacturing, trade, healthcare, and urban planning. The book addresses issues of seemingly large systems, not small algorithms, and it emphasizes descriptions as formal, mathematical quantities. This is the first thorough monograph treatment of the new software engineering phase of software development, one that precedes requirements engineering. It emphasizes a methodological approach by treating, in depth, analysis and description principles, techniques and tools.

Introduction to Development Engineering,"Temina Madon, Ashok J. Gadgil, Richard Anderson, Lorenzo Casaburi, Kenneth Lee, Arman Rezaee",Springer,2021-11-26,"This open access textbook introduces the emerging field of Development Engineering, its constituent theories, methods, and applications. It is both a teaching text for students and a resource for researchers and practitioners engaged in the design of technologies for low-resource communities. The scope is broad, ranging from the development of mobile applications for low-literacy users, to hardware and software solutions for providing electricity and water in remote settings. It is also highly interdisciplinary, drawing on methods and theory from the social sciences as well as engineering and the natural sciences. The opening section reviews the history of ""technology-for-development"" research, and presents a framework that formalizes this body of work and begins its transformation into an academic discipline. It identifies common challenges in development and explains the book's 'innovate, evaluate, scale' approach, integrating it with product development lifecycles. Each of the next six thematic sections focuses on a different sector: water, sanitation and health; governance; energy and resources; information; markets; and human capital. These thematic sections contain case studies from landmark research that directly integrates engineering innovation with technically rigorous methods from the social sciences. Each case study describes the design, evaluation, and/or scaling of a technology in the field and follows a single template, with common headings and questions, to create continuity and pedagogical consistency. Together, they highlight successful solutions to development challenges, while also analyzing the rarely discussed failures. The book concludes by reiterating the core principles of development engineering illustrated in the case studies and highlighting common challenges that engineers and scientists face in designing technology interventions to accelerate economic development. Development Engineering provides, for the first time, a coherent intellectual framework for attacking the challenges of poverty through the design of better technologies. It offers the rigorous discipline necessary to help channel the energy of a new generation of scientists and engineers studying and engaged in advancing social welfare and improving living conditions in low-resource communities.",,0,N/A,0,en

The Art of Doing Science and Engineering,Richard W. Hamming ,Stripe Press,2020-05-26,"A groundbreaking treatise by one of the great mathematicians of our time, who argues that highly effective thinking can be learned. What spurs on and inspires a great idea? Can we train ourselves to think in a way that will enable world-changing understandings and insights to emerge? Richard Hamming said we can, and first inspired a generation of engineers, scientists, and researchers in 1986 with ""You and Your Research,"" an electrifying sermon on why some scientists do great work, why most don't, why he did, and why you should, too. The Art of Doing Science and Engineering is the full expression of what ""You and Your Research"" outlined. It's a book about thinking; more specifically, a style of thinking by which great ideas are conceived. The book is filled with stories of great people performing mighty deeds––but they are not meant to simply be admired. Instead, they are to be aspired to, learned from, and surpassed. Hamming consistently returns to Shannon’s information theory, Einstein’s relativity, Grace Hopper’s work on high-level programming, Kaiser’s work on digital fillers, and his own error-correcting codes. He also recounts a number of his spectacular failures as clear examples of what to avoid. Originally published in 1996 and adapted from a course that Hamming taught at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, this edition includes an all-new foreword by designer, engineer, and founder of Dynamicland Bret Victor, and more than 70 redrawn graphs and charts. The Art of Doing Science and Engineering is a reminder that a childlike capacity for learning and creativity are accessible to everyone. Hamming was as much a teacher as a scientist, and having spent a lifetime forming and confirming a theory of great people, he prepares the next generation for even greater greatness.",Computers,327,N/A,0,en

Constructing a Bridge,Eda Kranakis,MIT Press,1997,"A historical look at styles of technological research and design. If it is true, as Tocqueville suggested, that social and class systems shape technology, research, and knowledge, then the effects should be visible both at the individual level and at the level of technical institutions and local environments. That is the central issue addressed in Constructing a Bridge, a tale of two cultures that investigates how national traditions shape technological communities and their institutions and become embedded in everyday engineering practice. Eda Kranakis first examines these issues in the work of two suspension bridge designers of the early nineteenth century: the American inventor James Finley and the French engineer Claude-Louis-Marie-Henri Navier. Finley--who was oriented toward the needs of rural, frontier communities--designed a bridge that could be easily reproduced and constructed by carpenters and blacksmiths. Navier--whose professional training and career reflected a tradition of monumental architecture and had linked him closely to the Parisian scientific community--designed an elegant, costly, and technically sophisticated structure to be built in an elite district of Paris. Charting the careers of these two technologists and tracing the stories of their bridges, Kranakis reveals how local environments can shape design goals, research practices, and design-to-construction processes. Kranakis then offers a broader look at the technological communities and institutions of nineteenth-century France and America and at their ties to technological practice. She shows how conditions that led to Finley's and Navier's distinct designs also fostered different systems of technical education as well as distinct ideologies and traditions of engineering research.The result of this two-tiered, comparative approach is a reorientation of a historiographic tradition initiated by Tocqueville (and explored more recently by Eugene Ferguson, John Kasson, and others) toward a finer-grained analysis of institutional and local environments as mediators between national traditions and individual styles of technological research and design.",Science,482,N/A,0,en

The numbers of black and Asian engineers recently have grown at a much faster rate than the number of Caucasian engineers. With a projected steady increase in engineering jobs and demographic shifts, this trend should continue. Yet, recent writings on the engineering profession have said little about career mobility beyond graduation. This book identifies and explores key issues determining whether minorities in the US will attain occupational equality with their Caucasian counterparts.

Systems Engineering,Derek K. Hitchins,John Wiley & Sons,2008-03-11,"This book conceives, presents and exemplifies a contemporary, general systems methodology that is straightforward and accessible, providing guidance in practical application, as well as explaining concept and theory. The book is presented both as a text for students, with topic assignments, and as a reference for practitioners, through case studies. Utilizing recent research and developments in systems science, methods and tools, Hitchins has developed a unified systems methodology, employable when tackling virtually any problem, from the small technological, to the global socioeconomic. Founded in the powerful ‘systems approach’, Hitchins’ systems methodology brings together both soft and hard system scientific methods into one methodological framework. This can be applied when addressing complex problems, issues and situations, and for creating robust, provable solutions, resolutions and dissolutions to those problems – supposing such to exist. This book details and explores: the systems approach, using theory and method to reveal systems engineering as applied systems science, bridging the gulf between Problem and Solution Spaces; a ‘universal’ Systems Methodology (including an extensive view of systems engineering, embracing both soft and hard systems) which encompasses all five stages of Hitchins’ 5-layer Systems Engineering Model (artifact, project, enterprise, industry and socio-economy); case studies illustrating how the systems methodology may be used to address a diverse range of situations and issues, including conceiving a new defense capability, proposing a feasible way to tackle global warming, tackling enterprise interventions, how and why things can go wrong, and many more. Systems Engineering will give an immeasurable advantage to managers, practitioners and consultants in a wide range of organizations and fields including police, defense, procurement, communications, transport, management, electrical, electronic, aerospace, requirements, software and computer engineering. It is an essential reference for researchers seeking ‘systems enlightenment’, including graduate students who require a comprehensive reference text on the subject, and also government departments and systems engineering institutions",Technology & Engineering,528,5,1,en

Structures or Why things don’t fall down,J. Gordon,Springer,2012-02-07,"I am very much aware that it is an act of extreme rashness to attempt to write an elementary book about structures. Indeed it is only when the subject is stripped of its mathematics that one begins to realize how difficult it is to pin down and describe those structural concepts which are often called' elementary'; by which I suppose we mean 'basic' or 'fundamental'. Some of the omis sions and oversimplifications are intentional but no doubt some of them are due to my own brute ignorance and lack of under standing of the subject. Although this volume is more or less a sequel to The New Science of Strong Materials it can be read as an entirely separate book in its own right. For this reason a certain amount of repetition has been unavoidable in the earlier chapters. I have to thank a great many people for factual information, suggestions and for stimulating and sometimes heated discussions. Among the living, my colleagues at Reading University have been generous with help, notably Professor W. D. Biggs (Professor of Building Technology), Dr Richard Chaplin, Dr Giorgio Jeronimidis, Dr Julian Vincent and Dr Henry Blyth; Professor Anthony Flew, Professor of Philosophy, made useful suggestions about the last chapter. I am also grateful to Mr John Bartlett, Consultant Neurosurgeon at the Brook Hospital. Professor T. P. Hughes of the University of the West Indies has been helpful about rockets and many other things besides. My secretary, Mrs Jean Collins, was a great help in times of trouble. Mrs Nethercot of Vogue was kind to me about dressmaking. Mr Gerald Leach and also many of the editorial staff of Penguins have exercised their accustomed patience and helpfulness. Among the dead, l owe a great deal to Dr Mark Pryor - lately of Trinity College, Cambridge - especially for discussions about biomechanics which extended over a period of nearly thirty years. Lastly, for reasons which must surely be obvious, l owe a humble oblation to Herodotus, once a citizen of Halicamassus.",Technology & Engineering,0,N/A,0,en

Adverse Effects of Vaccines,"Institute of Medicine, Board on Population Health and Public Health Practice, Committee to Review Adverse Effects of Vaccines",National Academies Press,2012-04-26,"In 1900, for every 1,000 babies born in the United States, 100 would die before their first birthday, often due to infectious diseases. Today, vaccines exist for many viral and bacterial diseases. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, passed in 1986, was intended to bolster vaccine research and development through the federal coordination of vaccine initiatives and to provide relief to vaccine manufacturers facing financial burdens. The legislation also intended to address concerns about the safety of vaccines by instituting a compensation program, setting up a passive surveillance system for vaccine adverse events, and by providing information to consumers. A key component of the legislation required the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to collaborate with the Institute of Medicine to assess concerns about the safety of vaccines and potential adverse events, especially in children. Adverse Effects of Vaccines reviews the epidemiological, clinical, and biological evidence regarding adverse health events associated with specific vaccines covered by the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), including the varicella zoster vaccine, influenza vaccines, the hepatitis B vaccine, and the human papillomavirus vaccine, among others. For each possible adverse event, the report reviews peer-reviewed primary studies, summarizes their findings, and evaluates the epidemiological, clinical, and biological evidence. It finds that while no vaccine is 100 percent safe, very few adverse events are shown to be caused by vaccines. In addition, the evidence shows that vaccines do not cause several conditions. For example, the MMR vaccine is not associated with autism or childhood diabetes. Also, the DTaP vaccine is not associated with diabetes and the influenza vaccine given as a shot does not exacerbate asthma. Adverse Effects of Vaccines will be of special interest to the National Vaccine Program Office, the VICP, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, vaccine safety researchers and manufacturers, parents, caregivers, and health professionals in the private and public sectors.",Medical,894,N/A,0,en

Power Engineering,"Viorel Badescu, George Cristian Lazaroiu, Linda Barelli",CRC Press,2018-12-07,"Traditionally, power engineering has been a subfield of energy engineering and electrical engineering which deals with the generation, transmission, distribution and utilization of electric power and the electrical devices connected to such systems including generators, motors and transformers. Implicitly this perception is associated with the generation of power in large hydraulic, thermal and nuclear plants and distributed consumption. Faced with the climate change phenomena, humanity has had to now contend with changes in attitudes in respect of environment protection and depletion of classical energy resources. These have had consequences in the power production sector, already faced with negative public opinions on nuclear energy and favorable perception of renewable energy resources and about distributed power generation. The objective of this edited book is to review all these changes and to present solutions for future power generation. Future energy systems must factor in the changes and developments in technology like improvements of natural gas combined cycles and clean coal technologies, carbon dioxide capture and storage, advancements in nuclear reactors and hydropower, renewable energy engineering, power-to-gas conversion and fuel cells, energy crops, new energy vectors biomass-hydrogen, thermal energy storage, new storage systems diffusion, modern substations, high voltage engineering equipment and compatibility, HVDC transmission with FACTS, advanced optimization in a liberalized market environment, active grids and smart grids, power system resilience, power quality and cost of supply, plug-in electric vehicles, smart metering, control and communication technologies, new key actors as prosumers, smart cities. The emerging research will enhance the security of energy systems, safety in operation, protection of environment, improve energy efficiency, reliability and sustainability. The book reviews current literature in the advances, innovative options and solutions in power engineering.

Cloud Computing for Science and Engineering,"Ian Foster, Dennis B. Gannon",MIT Press,2017-09-29,"A guide to cloud computing for students, scientists, and engineers, with advice and many hands-on examples. The emergence of powerful, always-on cloud utilities has transformed how consumers interact with information technology, enabling video streaming, intelligent personal assistants, and the sharing of content. Businesses, too, have benefited from the cloud, outsourcing much of their information technology to cloud services. Science, however, has not fully exploited the advantages of the cloud. Could scientific discovery be accelerated if mundane chores were automated and outsourced to the cloud? Leading computer scientists Ian Foster and Dennis Gannon argue that it can, and in this book offer a guide to cloud computing for students, scientists, and engineers, with advice and many hands-on examples. The book surveys the technology that underpins the cloud, new approaches to technical problems enabled by the cloud, and the concepts required to integrate cloud services into scientific work. It covers managing data in the cloud, and how to program these services; computing in the cloud, from deploying single virtual machines or containers to supporting basic interactive science experiments to gathering clusters of machines to do data analytics; using the cloud as a platform for automating analysis procedures, machine learning, and analyzing streaming data; building your own cloud with open source software; and cloud security. The book is accompanied by a website, Cloud4SciEng.org, that provides a variety of supplementary material, including exercises, lecture slides, and other resources helpful to readers and instructors.",Computers,391,N/A,0,en

Engineering In Time: The Systematics Of Engineering History And Its Contemporary Context,"Brian W Baetz, Rudi R Volti, Archie A Harms",World Scientific Publishing Company,2004-06-14,"Engineering represents an ordered activity of creative design and inventive manufacture of ingenious devices. Its practitioners have thereby stimulated individuals, enlivened communities, enriched civilizations, and contributed to the shaping of cultures.The authors of this innovative text develop a systematic framework for engineering in time, making extensive use of adaptive heterogeneous progressions. When combined with considerations of feedback, feedforward, recursion, and branching, an evolving and comprehensive characterization of engineering becomes evident. It is in this blending of chronology, emerging theory, and professional practice that engineering finds its foundational role in innovative design, device reliability, intellectual property, technology risks, public safety, professional ethics, material accounting, and other recurring themes relevant to contemporary engineering. Engineering clearly emerges as a complex and increasingly important profession.The authors introduce concepts and methods — including a critical definition of engineering -and selectively adapt symbolic-mathematical relations.

Experimentation in Software Engineering,"Claes Wohlin, Per Runeson, Martin Höst, Magnus C. Ohlsson, Björn Regnell, Anders Wesslén",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-06-16,"Like other sciences and engineering disciplines, software engineering requires a cycle of model building, experimentation, and learning. Experiments are valuable tools for all software engineers who are involved in evaluating and choosing between different methods, techniques, languages and tools. The purpose of Experimentation in Software Engineering is to introduce students, teachers, researchers, and practitioners to empirical studies in software engineering, using controlled experiments. The introduction to experimentation is provided through a process perspective, and the focus is on the steps that we have to go through to perform an experiment. The book is divided into three parts. The first part provides a background of theories and methods used in experimentation. Part II then devotes one chapter to each of the five experiment steps: scoping, planning, execution, analysis, and result presentation. Part III completes the presentation with two examples. Assignments and statistical material are provided in appendixes. Overall the book provides indispensable information regarding empirical studies in particular for experiments, but also for case studies, systematic literature reviews, and surveys. It is a revision of the authors’ book, which was published in 2000. In addition, substantial new material, e.g. concerning systematic literature reviews and case study research, is introduced. The book is self-contained and it is suitable as a course book in undergraduate or graduate studies where the need for empirical studies in software engineering is stressed. Exercises and assignments are included to combine the more theoretical material with practical aspects. Researchers will also benefit from the book, learning more about how to conduct empirical studies, and likewise practitioners may use it as a “cookbook” when evaluating new methods or techniques before implementing them in their organization.",Computers,249,N/A,0,en

Engineering Emergence,"Larry B. Rainey, Mo Jamshidi",CRC Press,2018-09-03,"This book examines the nature of emergence in context of man-made (i.e. engineered) systems, in general, and system of systems engineering applications, specifically. It investigates emergence to interrogate or explore the domain space from a modeling and simulation perspective to facilitate understanding, detection, classification, prediction, control, and visualization of the phenomenon. Written by leading international experts, the text is the first to address emergence from an engineering perspective. ""System engineering has a long and proud tradition of establishing the integrative view of systems. The field, however, has not always embraced and assimilated well the lessons and implications from research on complex adaptive systems. As the editors’ note, there have been no texts on Engineering Emergence: Principles and Applications. It is therefore especially useful to have this new, edited book that pulls together so many of the key elements, ranging from the theoretical to the practical, and tapping into advances in methods, tools, and ways to study system complexity. Drs. Rainey and Jamshidi are to be congratulated both for their vision of the book and their success in recruiting contributors with so much to say. Most notable, however, is that this is a book with engineering at its core. It uses modeling and simulation as the language in which to express principles and insights in ways that include tight thinking and rigor despite dealing with notably untidy and often surprising phenomena."" — Paul K. Davis, RAND and Frederick S. Pardee RAND Graduate School The first chapter is an introduction and overview to the text. The book provides 12 chapters that have a theoretical foundation for this subject.

Engineering Analysis,Merle C. Potter,Springer,2018-05-28,"The purpose of this book is to introduce undergraduate students of engineering and the physical sciences to applied mathematics often essential to the successful solutions of practical problems. The topics selected are a review of Differential Equations, Laplace Transforms, Matrices and Determinants, Vector Analysis, Partial Differential Equations, Complex Variables, and Numerical Methods. The style of presentation is such that the step-by-step derivations may be followed by the reader with minimum assistance. Liberal use of approximately 160 examples and 1000 homework problems serves to aid students in their study. This book presents mathematical topics using derivations (similar to the technique used in engineering textbooks) rather than theorems and proofs typically found in textbooks written by mathematicians. Engineering Analysis is uniquely qualified to help apply mathematics to physical applications (spring-mass systems, electrical circuits, conduction, diffusion, etc.), in a manner as efficient and understandable as possible. This book was written to provide for an additional mathematics course after differential equations, to permit several topics to be introduced in one semester, and to make the material comprehensible to undergraduates.The book comes with an Instructor Solutions Manual, available on request, that provides solutions to all problems and also a Student Solutions Manual that provides solutions to select problems (the answers to which are given at the back of the book).",Technology & Engineering,444,N/A,0,en
"Teaching Engineering, Second Edition","Phillip C. Wankat, Frank S. Oreovicz",Purdue University Press,2015-01-15,"The majority of professors have never had a formal course in education, and the most common method for learning how to teach is on-the-job training. This represents a challenge for disciplines with ever more complex subject matter, and a lost opportunity when new active learning approaches to education are yielding dramatic improvements in student learning and retention. This book aims to cover all aspects of teaching engineering and other technical subjects. It presents both practical matters and educational theories in a format useful for both new and experienced teachers. It is organized to start with specific, practical teaching applications and then leads to psychological and educational theories. The ""practical orientation"" section explains how to develop objectives and then use them to enhance student learning, and the ""theoretical orientation"" section discusses the theoretical basis for learning/teaching and its impact on students. Written mainly for PhD students and professors in all areas of engineering, the book may be used as a text for graduate-level classes and professional workshops or by professionals who wish to read it on their own. Although the focus is engineering education, most of this book will be useful to teachers in other disciplines. Teaching is a complex human activity, so it is impossible to develop a formula that guarantees it will be excellent. However, the methods in this book will help all professors become good teachers while spending less time preparing for the classroom. This is a new edition of the well-received volume published by McGraw-Hill in 1993. It includes an entirely revised section on the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) and new sections on the characteristics of great teachers, different active learning methods, the application of technology in the classroom (from clickers to intelligent tutorial systems), and how people learn.",Education,494,N/A,0,en
The Existential Pleasures of Engineering,Samuel C. Florman,Macmillan + ORM,1996-02-15,"A classic examination of how engineers think and feel about their profession and its philosophy. “A useful read for engineers given to self-scrutiny, and a stimulating one for the layman interested in the ancient schism between machines and men’s souls.” —Time Humans have always sought to change their environment, building houses, monuments, temples, and roads. In the process, they have remade the fabric of the world into newly functional objects that are also works of art to be admired. Now as engineering plays an increasingly important role in the world while coming under attack for all manner of sins, one must wonder about the nature of the engineering experience in our time. In this, the second edition of his popular Existential Pleasures of Engineering, Samuel Florman perceptively explores how engineers think and feel about their profession. Dispelling the myth that engineering is cold and passionless, Florman celebrates it as something vital and alive. He views engineering as a response to some of our deepest impulses, rich in spiritual and sensual rewards. Opposing the “antitechnology” stance, Florman brilliantly emerges with a more practical, creative, and fun philosophy of engineering that boasts pride in his craft. First published in 1976, this classic book is essential reading for anyone curious about what wonders we have wrought. “Gracefully written . . . refreshing and highly infectious enthusiasm . . . imaginatively engineered.” —The New York Times Book Review",Technology & Engineering,271,N/A,0,en

To address this problem, we must improve the underlying strategies and techniques used to create our systems. Specifically, we must build security in from the start, rather than append it as an afterthought. That's the point of Secure Coding in C and C++. In careful detail, this book shows software developers how to build high-quality systems that are less vulnerable to costly and even catastrophic attack. It's a book that every developer should read before the start of any serious project."" --Frank Abagnale, author, lecturer, and leading consultant on fraud prevention and secure documents Learn the Root Causes of Software Vulnerabilities and How to Avoid Them Commonly exploited software vulnerabilities are usually caused by avoidable software defects. Having analyzed nearly 18,000 vulnerability reports over the past ten years, the CERT/Coordination Center (CERT/CC) has determined that a relatively small number of root causes account for most of them. This book identifies and explains these causes and shows the steps that can be taken to prevent exploitation. Moreover, this book encourages programmers to adopt security best practices and develop a security mindset that can help protect software from tomorrow's attacks, not just today's. Drawing on the CERT/CC's reports and conclusions, Robert Seacord systematically identifies the program errors most likely to lead to security breaches, shows how they can be exploited, reviews the potential consequences, and presents secure alternatives. Coverage includes technical detail on how to Improve the overall security of any C/C++ application Thwart buffer overflows and stack-smashing attacks that exploit insecure string manipulation logic Avoid vulnerabilities and security flaws resulting from the incorrect use of dynamic memory management functions Eliminate integer-related problems: integer overflows, sign errors, and truncation errors Correctly use formatted output functions without introducing format-string vulnerabilities Avoid I/O vulnerabilities, including race conditions Secure Coding in C and C++ presents hundreds of examples of secure code, insecure code, and exploits, implemented for Windows and Linux.

Engineering in Pre-college Settings,"Şenay Purzer, Johannes Strobel, Monica E. Cardella",Purdue University Press,2014,"In science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education in pre-college, engineering is not the silent ""e"" anymore. There is an accelerated interest in teaching engineering in all grade levels. Structured engineering programs are emerging in schools as well as in out-of-school settings. Over the last ten years, the number of states in the US including engineering in their K-12 standards has tripled, and this trend will continue to grow with the adoption of the Next Generation Science Standards. The interest in pre-college engineering education stems from three different motivations. First, from a workforce pipeline or pathway perspective, researchers and practitioners are interested in understanding precursors, influential and motivational factors, and the progression of engineering thinking. Second, from a general societal perspective, technological literacy and understanding of the role of engineering and technology is becoming increasingly important for the general populace, and it is more imperative to foster this understanding from a younger age. Third, from a STEM integration and education perspective, engineering processes are used as a context to teach science and math concepts. This book addresses each of these motivations and the diverse means used to engage with them.Designed to be a source of background and inspiration for researchers and practitioners alike, this volume includes contributions on policy, synthesis studies, and research studies to catalyze and inform current efforts to improve pre-college engineering education.

Learning from Nature How to Design New Implantable Biomaterials: From Biomineralization Fundamentals to Biomimetic Materials and Processing Routes,"Rui L. Reis, S. Weiner",Springer Science & Business Media,2005-12-29,"The development of materials for any replacement or regeneration application should be based on the thorough understanding of the structure to be substituted. This is true in many fields, but particularly exigent in substitution and regeneration medicine. The demands upon the material properties largely depend on the site of application and the function it has to restore. Ideally, a replacement material should mimic the living tissue from a mechanical, chemical, biological and functional point of view. Of course this is much easier to write down than to implement in clinical practice. Mineralized tissues such as bones, tooth and shells have attracted, in the last few years, considerable interest as natural anisotropic composite structures with adequate mechanical properties. In fact, Nature is and will continue to be the best materials scientist ever. Who better than nature can design complex structures and control the intricate phenomena (processing routes) that lead to the final shape and structure (from the macro to the nano level) of living creatures? Who can combine biological and physico-chemical mechanisms in such a way that can build ideal structure-properties relationships? Who, else than Nature, can really design smart structural components that respond in-situ to exterior stimulus, being able of adapting constantly their microstructure and correspondent properties? In the described philosophy line, mineralized tissues and biomineralization processes are ideal examples to learn-from for the materials scientist of the future.",Technology & Engineering,240,N/A,0,en

Companies in all domains identify that software de?nes the competitive edge of their products. These developments require us to constantly search for new approaches to increase the productivity and quality of our software - velopment and to decrease the cost of software maintenance. Generative and component-based technologies hold considerablepromise with respect to achi- ing these goals. GCSE 2001 constituted another important step forward and provided a platform for academic and industrial researchers to exchange ideas. These proceedings represent the third conference on generative and com- nent-based software engineering. The conference originated as a special track on generative programming from the Smalltalk and Java in Industry and - ucation Conference (STJA), organized by the working group “Generative and Component-Based Software Engineering” of the “Gesellschaft fur ̈ Informatik” FG 2.1.9 “Object-Oriented Software Engineering.” However, the conference has evolved substantially since then, with its own, independent stature, invited speakers, and, most importantly, a stable and growing community. This year’s conference attracted 43 submissions from all over the world, - dicating the broad, international interest in the research ?eld. Based on careful review by the program committee, 14 papers were selected for presentation. I would like to thank the members of the program committee, all renowned - perts, for their dedication in preparing thorough reviews of the submissions.",Computers,186,N/A,0,en

Impossible Engineering,Chandra Mukerji,Princeton University Press,2021-11-09,"The Canal du Midi, which threads through southwestern France and links the Atlantic to the Mediterranean, was an astonishing feat of seventeenth-century engineering--in fact, it was technically impossible according to the standards of its day. Impossible Engineering takes an insightful and entertaining look at the mystery of its success as well as the canal's surprising political significance. The waterway was a marvel that connected modern state power to human control of nature just as surely as it linked the ocean to the sea. The Canal du Midi is typically characterized as the achievement of Pierre-Paul Riquet, a tax farmer and entrepreneur for the canal. Yet Chandra Mukerji argues that it was a product of collective intelligence, depending on peasant women and artisans--unrecognized heirs to Roman traditions of engineering--who came to labor on the waterway in collaboration with military and academic supervisors. Ironically, while Louis XIV and his treasury minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert used propaganda to present France as a new Rome, the Canal du Midi was being constructed with unrecognized classical methods. Still, the result was politically potent. As Mukerji shows, the project took land and power from local nobles, using water itself as a silent agent of the state to disrupt traditions of local life that had served regional elites. Impossible Engineering opens a surprising window into the world of seventeenth-century France and illuminates a singular work of engineering undertaken to empower the state through technical conquest of nature.",Technology & Engineering,328,N/A,0,en

The Integration of Process Design and Control,"Panos Seferlis, Michael C. Georgiadis",Elsevier,2004-05-06,"Traditionally, process design and control system design are performed sequentially. It is only recently displayed that a simultaneous approach to the design and control leads to significant economic benefits and improved dynamic performance during plant operation. Extensive research in issues such as 'interactions of design and control', 'analysis and design of plant wide control systems', 'integrated methods for design and control' has resulted in impressive advances and significant new technologies that have enriched the variety of instruments available for the design engineer in her endeavour to design and operate new processes. The field of integrated process design and control has reached a maturity level that mingles the best from process knowledge and understanding and control theory on one side, with the best from numerical analysis and optimisation on the other. Direct implementation of integrated methods should soon become the mainstream design procedure. Within this context 'The Integration of Process Design and Control', bringing together the developments in a variety of topics related to the integrated design and control, will be a real asset for design engineers, practitioners and researchers. Although the individual chapters reach a depth of analysis close to the frontier of current research status, the structure of the book and the autonomous nature of the chapters make the book suitable for a newcomer in the area. The book comprises four distinct parts: Part A: Process characterization and controllability analysisPart B: Integrated process design and control ⊣ MethodsPart C: Plant wide interactions of design and controlPart D: Integrated process design and control ⊣ Extensions By the end of the book, the reader will have developed a commanding comprehension of the main aspects of integrated design and control, the ability to critically assess the key characteristics and elements related to the interactions between design and control and the capacity to implement the new technology in practice. * This book brings together the latest developments in a variety of topics related to integrated design and control.* It is a valuable asset for design engineers, practitioners and researchers.* The structure of the book and the nature of its chapters also make it suitable for a newcomer to the field.",Technology & Engineering,655,N/A,0,en

The CERT C Secure Coding Standard,Robert C. Seacord,Pearson Education,2008-10-14,"“I’m an enthusiastic supporter of the CERT Secure Coding Initiative. Programmers have lots of sources of advice on correctness, clarity, maintainability, performance, and even safety. Advice on how specific language features affect security has been missing. The CERT ® C Secure Coding Standard fills this need.” –Randy Meyers, Chairman of ANSI C “For years we have relied upon the CERT/CC to publish advisories documenting an endless stream of security problems. Now CERT has embodied the advice of leading technical experts to give programmers and managers the practical guidance needed to avoid those problems in new applications and to help secure legacy systems. Well done!” –Dr. Thomas Plum, founder of Plum Hall, Inc. “Connectivity has sharply increased the need for secure, hacker-safe applications. By combining this CERT standard with other safety guidelines, customers gain all-round protection and approach the goal of zero-defect software.” –Chris Tapp, Field Applications Engineer, LDRA Ltd. “I’ve found this standard to be an indispensable collection of expert information on exactly how modern software systems fail in practice. It is the perfect place to start for establishing internal secure coding guidelines. You won’t find this information elsewhere, and, when it comes to software security, what you don’t know is often exactly what hurts you.” –John McDonald, coauthor of The Art of Software Security Assessment Software security has major implications for the operations and assets of organizations, as well as for the welfare of individuals. To create secure software, developers must know where the dangers lie. Secure programming in C can be more difficult than even many experienced programmers believe. This book is an essential desktop reference documenting the first official release of The CERT® C Secure Coding Standard. The standard itemizes those coding errors that are the root causes of software vulnerabilities in C and prioritizes them by severity, likelihood of exploitation, and remediation costs. Each guideline provides examples of insecure code as well as secure, alternative implementations. If uniformly applied, these guidelines will eliminate the critical coding errors that lead to buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, integer overflow, and other common software vulnerabilities.",Computers,814,N/A,0,en

This a great book for them to learn what they are getting into. Engineering offers a life full of fun, excitement, and job satisfaction. However, getting through all the difficult technical courses, dealing with professors who don't know how to talk on a student's level, and the normal hoops of college life can make the path to becoming an engineer quite challenging. I hope to provide readers with an insight to what to expect as an engineering student. Readers can also expect a few tricks of the trade to help them not only survive, but help them thrive as an engineering student. There are hordes of books for students that strive to be medical doctors or lawyers, but there is a lack of literature for the student who wants to become an engineer.

Up until now all such dictionaries were containing terms pertaining directly to electrical engineering plus the terminology used in its off-sheets which have evolved into separate disci plines, such as communications, electronics, automation etc. Foremost, however, this Diction ary represents the terminology of electrical engineering, while the branches are represented by their basic terms only. Given the relative small volume (about 8000 terms), the authors tried to reflect the most important terms in such areas as the cirquit theory, electric and magnetic measurements, ele ctric power generation, transmission and distribution, as well as the industrial and domestic consumption of electric power. The Dictionary also contains many terms relevant to high voltage technology, electrical machines and apparatus, electric drive, as well as to the elements and structures of aerial and cable transmission lines. In selecting English terms, the authors were trying to reflect both their British and Ameri can versions, although they did not attempt to present all terminological synonyms of this kind.

3-D Engineering,Vicki  May,Nomad Press,2015-11-16,"How did somebody come up with the idea for bridges, skyscrapers, helicopters, and nightlights? How did people figure out how to build them? In 3D Engineering: Design and Build Your Own Prototypes, young readers tackle real-life engineering problems by figuring out real-life solutions. Kids apply science and math skills to create prototypes for bridges, instruments, alarms, and more. Prototypes are preliminary models used by engineers—and kids—to evaluate ideas and to better understand how things work. Engineering design starts with an idea. How do we get to the other side of the river? How do we travel long distances in short times? Using a structured engineering design process, kids learn how to brainstorm, build a prototype, test a prototype, evaluate, and re-design. Projects include designing a cardboard chair to understand the stiffness of structural systems and designing and building a set of pan pipes to experiment with pitch and volume. Creating prototypes is a key step in the engineering design process and prototyping early in the design process generally results in better processes and products. 3D Engineering gives kids a chance to figure out many different prototypes, empowering them to discover the mechanics of the world we know.",Juvenile Nonfiction,129,N/A,0,en

Foundation Engineering for Expansive Soils,"John D. Nelson, Kuo Chieh Chao, Daniel D. Overton, Erik J. Nelson",John Wiley & Sons,2015-02-10,"Your guide to the design and construction of foundations on expansive soils Foundation Engineering for Expansive Soils fills a significant gap in the current literature by presenting coverage of the design and construction of foundations for expansive soils. Written by an expert author team with nearly 70 years of combined industry experience, this important new work is the only modern guide to the subject, describing proven methods for identifying and analyzing expansive soils and developing foundation designs appropriate for specific locations. Expansive soils are found worldwide and are the leading cause of damage to structural roads. The primary problem that arises with regard to expansive soils is that deformations are significantly greater than in non-expansive soils and the size and direction of the deformations are difficult to predict. Now, Foundation Engineering for Expansive Soils gives engineers and contractors coverage of this subject from a design perspective, rather than a theoretical one. Plus, they'll have access to case studies covering the design and construction of foundations on expansive salts from both commercial and residential projects. Provides a succinct introduction to the basics of expansive soils and their threats Includes information on both shallow and deep foundation design Profiles soil remediation techniques, backed-up with numerous case studies Covers the most commonly used laboratory tests and site investigation techniques used for establishing the physical properties of expansive soils If you're a practicing civil engineer, geotechnical engineer or contractor, geologist, structural engineer, or an upper-level undergraduate or graduate student of one of these disciplines, Foundation Engineering for Expansive Soils is a must-have addition to your library of resources.",Technology & Engineering,416,N/A,0,en

Women and Ideas in Engineering,"Laura D. Hahn, Angela S. Wolters",University of Illinois Press,2018-07-20,"The increasing presence of women within engineering programs is one of today's most dramatic developments in higher education. Long before, however, a group of talented and determined women carved out new paths in the College of Engineering at the University of Illinois. Laura D. Hahn and Angela S. Wolters bring to light the compelling hidden stories of these pioneering figures. When Mary Louisa Page became the College's first female graduate in 1879, she also was the first American woman ever awarded a degree in architecture. Bobbie Johnson's insistence on ""a real engineering job"" put her on a path to the Apollo and Skylab programs. Grace Wilson, one of the College's first female faculty members, taught and mentored a generation of women. Their stories and many others illuminate the forgotten history of women in engineering. At the same time, the authors offer insights into the experiences of today's women from the College -- a glimpse of a brighter future, one where more women in STEM fields apply their tireless dedication to the innovations that shape a better tomorrow.",Technology & Engineering,0,N/A,0,en

Intelligent Systems for Engineering,Ram D. Sriram,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"When men of knowledge impart this knowledge, I do not mean they will convince your reason. I mean they will awaken in you the faith that it is so. - Sri Krishna, Bhagavadgita BACKGROUND The use of computers has led to significant productivity increases in the en gineering industry. Most ofthe computer-aided engineering applications were . restricted to algorithmic computations, such as finite element programs and circuit analysis programs. However, a number ofproblems encountered in en gineering are not amenable to purely algorithmic solutions. These problems are often ill-structured; the term ill-structured problems is used here to de note problems that do not have a clearly defined algorithmic solution. An experienced engineer deals with these ill-structured problems using his/her judgment and experience. The knowledge-based systems (KBS) technology, which emerged out of research in artificial intelligence (AI), offers a method ologyto solve these ill-structuredengineering problems. The emergenceofthe KBS technology can be viewed as the knowledge revolution: other important events that led to increased productivity are the industrial revolution (17th century); the invention of the transistor and associated developments (first half of the 20th century); and the world-wide web (towards the end of the 20th century). Kurzweil, in a lecture at M.

Statistics and Data Analysis for Financial Engineering,"David Ruppert, David S. Matteson",Springer,2015-04-21,"The new edition of this influential textbook, geared towards graduate or advanced undergraduate students, teaches the statistics necessary for financial engineering. In doing so, it illustrates concepts using financial markets and economic data, R Labs with real-data exercises, and graphical and analytic methods for modeling and diagnosing modeling errors. These methods are critical because financial engineers now have access to enormous quantities of data. To make use of this data, the powerful methods in this book for working with quantitative information, particularly about volatility and risks, are essential. Strengths of this fully-revised edition include major additions to the R code and the advanced topics covered. Individual chapters cover, among other topics, multivariate distributions, copulas, Bayesian computations, risk management, and cointegration. Suggested prerequisites are basic knowledge of statistics and probability, matrices and linear algebra, and calculus. There is an appendix on probability, statistics and linear algebra. Practicing financial engineers will also find this book of interest.",Business & Economics,736,N/A,0,en
Discontinuity Analysis for Rock Engineering,S.D. Priest,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Engineers wishing to build structures on or in rock use the discipline known as rock mechanics. This discipline emerged as a subject in its own right about thirty five years ago, and has developed rapidly ever since. However, rock mechanics is still based to a large extent on analytical techniques that were originally formulated for the mechanical design of structures made from man made materials. The single most important distinction between man-made materials and the natural material rock is that rock contains fractures, of many kinds on many scales; and because the fractures - of whatever kin- represent breaks in the mechanical continuum, they are collectively termed 'discontinuities' . An understanding of the mechanical influence of these discontinuities is essential to all rock engineers. Most of the world is made of rock, and most of the rock near the surface is fractured. The fractures dominate the rock mass geometry, deformation modulus, strength, failure behaviour, permeability, and even the local magnitudes and directions of the in situ stress field. Clearly, an understanding of the presence and mechanics of the discontinuities, both singly and in the rock mass context, is therefore of paramount importance to civil, mining and petroleum engineers. Bearing this in mind, it is surprising that until now there has been no book dedicated specifically to the subject of discontinuity analysis in rock engineering.",Science,490,N/A,0,en

Structural Adhesive Joints in Engineering,R. D.

The advan tages and disadvantages of bonding are given, together with a sufficient understanding of the necessary mechanics and chemistry to enable the designer to make a sound engineering judgement in any particular case. The stresses in joints are discussed extensively so that the engineer can get sufficient philosophy or feel for them, or can delve more deeply into the mathematics to obtain quantitative solutions even with elasto plastic behaviour. A critical description is given of standard methods of testing adhesives, both destructively and non-destructively. The essen tial chemistry of adhesives and the importance of surface preparation are described and guidance is given for adhesive selection by me ans of check lists. For many applications, there will not be a unique adhesive which alone is suitable, and factors such as cost, convenience, produc tion considerations or familiarity may be decisive. A list of applications is given as examples. The authors wish to increase the confidence of engineers using adhesive bonding in load-bearing applications by the information and experience presented. With increasing experience of adhesives en gineering, design will become more elegant as weH as more fitted to its products.",Science,317,N/A,0,en

"Bounded Noises in Physics, Biology, and Engineering",Alberto d'Onofrio,Birkhäuser,2016-08-23,"​​Since the parameters in dynamical systems of biological interest are inherently positive and bounded, bounded noises are a natural way to model the realistic stochastic fluctuations of a biological system that are caused by its interaction with the external world. Bounded Noises in Physics, Biology, and Engineering is the first contributed volume devoted to the modeling of bounded noises in theoretical and applied statistical mechanics, quantitative biology, and mathematical physics. It gives an overview of the current state-of-the-art and is intended to stimulate further research. The volume is organized in four parts. The first part presents the main kinds of bounded noises and their applications in theoretical physics. The theory of bounded stochastic processes is intimately linked to its applications to mathematical and statistical physics, and it would be difficult and unnatural to separate the theory from its physical applications. The second is devoted to framing bounded noises in the theory of random dynamical systems and random bifurcations, while the third is devoted to applications of bounded stochastic processes in biology, one of the major areas of potential applications of this subject. The final part concerns the application of bounded stochastic processes in mechanical and structural engineering, the area where the renewed interest for non-Gaussian bounded noises started. Pure mathematicians working on stochastic calculus will find here a rich source of problems that are challenging from the point of view of contemporary nonlinear analysis. Bounded Noises in Physics, Biology, and Engineering is intended for scientists working on stochastic processes with an interest in both fundamental issues and applications. It will appeal to a broad range of applied mathematicians, mathematical biologists, physicists, engineers, and researchers in other fields interested in complexity theory. It is accessible to anyone with a working knowledge of stochastic modeling, from advanced undergraduates to senior researchers.",Mathematics,0,N/A,0,en
Ecological Engineering Design,"Marty D. Matlock, Robert A. Morgan",John Wiley & Sons,2011-02-16,"Ecologically-sensitive building and landscape design is a broad, intrinsically interdisciplinary field. Existing books independently cover narrow aspects of ecological design in depth (hydrology, ecosystems, soils, flora and fauna, etc.), but none of these books can boast of the integrated approach taken by this one. Drawing on the experience of the authors, this book begins to define explicit design methods for integrating consideration of ecosystem processes and services into every facet of land use design, management, and policy. The approach is to provide a prescriptive approach to ecosystem design based upon ecological engineering principles and practices. This book will include a novel collection of design methods for the non-built and built environments, linking landscape design explicitly to ecosystem services.",Technology & Engineering,354,N/A,0,en

With a focus on investigations associated with insurance industry claims, the book describes methodologies for performing insurance-related investigations including the causation and origin of damage to residential and commercial structures and/or unhealthy interior environments and adverse effects on the occupants of these structures. Edited by an industry expert with more than 30 years of experience, and authors with more than 100 years of experience in the field, the book takes the technical aspects of engineering and scientific principles and applies them to real-world issues in a non-technical manner. It provides readers with the experiences, investigation methodologies, and investigation protocols used in, and derived from completing thousands of forensic engineering investigations. It begins with providing a baseline methodology for completing forensic investigations and closes with advice on testifying as an expert witness. Much of what must be known in this field is not learned in school, but is based upon experience since recognizing the cause of a building system failure requires a blending of skills from the white collar and blue collar worlds. Such knowledge can be vital since failures (e.g., water entry) often result from construction activities completed out of sequence..

Engineering the Revolution,Ken Alder,University of Chicago Press,2010-04-15,"Engineering the Revolution documents the forging of a new relationship between technology and politics in Revolutionary France, and the inauguration of a distinctively modern form of the “technological life.” Here, Ken Alder rewrites the history of the eighteenth century as the total history of one particular artifact—the gun—by offering a novel and historical account of how material artifacts emerge as the outcome of political struggle. By expanding the “political” to include conflict over material objects, this volume rethinks the nature of engineering rationality, the origins of mass production, the rise of meritocracy, and our interpretation of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution.",Technology & Engineering,494,N/A,0,en

The History of the Theory of Structures,Karl-Eugen Kurrer,John Wiley & Sons,2018-07-23,"Zehn Jahre nach der 1. Auflage in englischer Sprache legt der Autor sein Buch The History of the Theory of Structures in wesentlich erweiterter Form vor, nunmehr mit dem Untertitel Searching for Equilibrium. Mit dem vorliegenden Buch lädt der Verfasser seine Leser zur Suche nach dem Gleichgewicht von Tragwerken auf Zeitreisen ein. Die Zeitreisen setzen mit der Entstehung der Statik und Festigkeitslehre eines Leonardo und Galilei ein und erreichen ihren ersten Höhepunkt mit den baustatischen Theorien über den Balken, Erddruck und das Gewölbe von Coulomb am Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts. Im folgenden Jahrhundert formiert sich die Baustatik mit Navier, Culmann, Maxwell, Rankine, Mohr, Castigliano und Müller-Breslau zu einer technikwissenschaftlichen Grundlagendisziplin, die im 20. Jahrhundert in Gestalt der modernen Strukturmechanik bei der Herausbildung der konstruktiven Sprache des Stahl-, Stahlbeton-, Flugzeug-, Automobil- und des Schiffbaus eine tragende Rolle spielt. Dabei setzt der Autor den inhaltlichen Schwerpunkt auf die Formierung und Entwicklung moderner numerischer Ingenieurmethoden wie der Finite-Elemente-Methode und beschreibt ihre disziplinäre Integration in der Computational Mechanics. Kurze, durch historische Skizzen unterstützte Einblicke in gängige Berechnungsverfahren erleichtern den Zugang zur Geschichte der Strukturmechanik und Erddrucktheorie vom heutigen Stand der Ingenieurpraxis und stellen einen auch einen wichtigen Beitrag zur Ingenieurpädagogik dar. Dem Autor gelingt es, die Unterschiedlichkeit der Akteure hinsichtlich ihres technisch-wissenschaftlichen Profils und ihrer Persönlichkeit plastisch zu schildern und das Verständnis für den gesellschaftlichen Kontext zu erzeugen. So werden in 260 Kurzbiografien die subjektive Dimension der Baustatik und der Strukturmechanik von der frühen Neuzeit bis heute entfaltet. Dabei werden die wesentlichen Beiträge der Protagonisten der Baustatik besprochen und in die nachfolgende Bibliografie integriert. Berücksichtigt wurden nicht nur Bauingenieure und Architekten, sondern auch Mathematiker, Physiker, Maschinenbauer sowie Flugzeug- und Schiffbauer. Neben den bekannten Persönlichkeiten der Baustatik, wie Coulomb, Culmann, Maxwell, Mohr, Müller-Breslau, Navier, Rankine, Saint-Venant, Timoshenko und Westergaard, wurden u. a. auch G. Green, A. N. Krylov, G. Li, A. J. S. Pippard, W. Prager, H. A. Schade, A. W. Skempton, C. A. Truesdell, J. A. L. Waddell und H. Wagner berücksichtigt. Den Wegbereitern der Moderne in der Baustatik J. H. Argyris, R. W. Clough, Th. v. Kármán, M. J. Turner und O. C. Zienkiewicz wurden umfangreiche Biografien gewidmet. Eine ca. 4500 Titel umfassende Bibliografie rundet das Werk ab. Neue Inhalte der 2. Auflage sind: Erddrucktheorie, Traglastverfahren, historische Lehrbuchanalyse, Stahlbrückenbau, Leichtbau, Platten- und Schalentheorie, Greensche Funktion, Computerstatik, FEM, Computergestützte Graphostatik und Historische Technikwissenschaft. Gegenüber der 1., englischen Ausgabe wurde der Seitenumfang um 50 % auf nunmehr etwas über 1200 Druckseiten gesteigert. Das vorliegende Buch ist die erste zusammenfassende historische Gesamtdarstellung der Baustatik vom 16. Jahrhundert bis heute. Über die Reihe edition Bautechnikgeschichte: Mit erstaunlicher Dynamik hat sich die Bautechnikgeschichte in den vergangenen Jahrzehnten zu einer höchst lebendigen, international vernetzten und viel beachteten eigenständigen Disziplin entwickelt. Auch wenn die nationalen Forschungszugänge unterschiedliche Akzente setzen, eint sie doch das Bewusstsein, dass gerade die inhaltliche und methodische Vielfalt und das damit verbundene synthetische Potenzial die Stärke des neuen Forschungsfeldes ausmachen. Bautechnikgeschichte erschließt neue Formen des Verstehens von Bauen zwischen Ingenieurwesen und Architektur, zwischen Bau- und Kunst-, Technik- und Wissenschaftsgeschichte. Mit der edition Bautechnikgeschichte erhält die neue Disziplin erstmals einen Ort für die Publikation wichtiger Arbeiten auf angemessenem Niveau in hochwertiger Gestaltung. Die Bücher erscheinen in deutscher oder englischer Sprache. Beide Hauptrichtungen der Bautechnikgeschichte, der eher konstruktionsgeschichtlich und der eher theoriegeschichtlich geleitete Zugang, finden Berücksichtigung; das Spektrum der Bände reicht von Überblickswerken über Monographien zu Einzelaspekten oder -bauten bis hin zu Biographien bedeutender Ingenieurpersönlichkeiten.

Communications Engineering,"Richard Chia Tung Lee, Mao-Ching Chiu, Jung-Shan Lin",John Wiley & Sons,2008-04-15,"Communications technologies increasingly pervade our everyday lives, yet the underlying principles are a mystery to most. Even among engineers and technicians, understanding of this complex subject remains limited. However, there is undeniably a growing need for all technology disciplines to gain intimate awareness of how their fields are affected by a more densely networked world. The computer science field in particular is profoundly affected by the growing dominance of communications, and computer scientists must increasingly engage with electrical engineering concepts. Yet communications technology is often perceived as a challenging subject with a steep learning curve. To address this need, the authors have transformed classroom-tested materials into this accessible textbook to give readers an intimate understanding of fundamental communications concepts. Readers are introduced to the key essentials, and each selected topic is discussed in detail to promote mastery. Engineers and computer scientists will gain an understanding of concepts that can be readily applied to their respective fields, as well as provide the foundation for more advanced study of communications. Provides a thorough grounding in the basics by focusing on select key concepts Clarifies comprehension of the subject via detailed explanation and illustration Helps develop an intuitive sense of both digital and analog principles Introduces key broadcasting, wireless and wired systems Helps bridge the knowledge gap between software and electrical engineering Requires only basic calculus and trigonometry skills Classroom tested in undergraduate CS and EE programs Communications Engineering by Lee, Chiu, and Lin will give advanced undergraduates in computer science and beginning students of electrical engineering a rounded understanding of communications technologies.

Engineering Money,"Richard Hill, George Solt",John Wiley & Sons,2011-02-14,"There are many text books about engineering design and some include project evaluation techniques. There are text books on accounting methods and yet others on business management. This book does not aim to replace these specialized texts but brings together the elements of these subjects that young engineers working in industry – particularly the construction industry and its customers – need to understand. Most engineers learn about money the hard way: by experience in the workplace. The authors having done this themselves recognized the gap in engineers’ education and set out to bridge it. This book is based on a 1996 course George Solt pioneered for final-year engineering undergraduates. The book is written in an approachable style and gives young engineers as well as mature engineers an insight into the way engineering businesses run, the importance of capital and the problems of cash flow.",Technology & Engineering,196,1,1,en

Engineering the Eternal City,Pamela O. Long,University of Chicago Press,2018-11-20,"Between the catastrophic flood of the Tiber River in 1557 and the death of the “engineering pope” Sixtus V in 1590, the city of Rome was transformed by intense activity involving building construction and engineering projects of all kinds. Using hundreds of archival documents and primary sources, Engineering the Eternal City explores the processes and people involved in these infrastructure projects—sewers, bridge repair, flood prevention, aqueduct construction, the building of new, straight streets, and even the relocation of immensely heavy ancient Egyptian obelisks that Roman emperors had carried to the city centuries before. This portrait of an early modern Rome examines the many conflicts, failures, and successes that shaped the city, as decision-makers tried to control not only Rome’s structures and infrastructures but also the people who lived there. Taking up visual images of the city created during the same period—most importantly in maps and urban representations, this book shows how in a time before the development of modern professionalism and modern bureaucracies, there was far more wide-ranging conversation among people of various backgrounds on issues of engineering and infrastructure than there is in our own times. Physicians, civic leaders, jurists, cardinals, popes, and clerics engaged with painters, sculptors, architects, printers, and other practitioners as they discussed, argued, and completed the projects that remade Rome.",History,382,N/A,0,en

Signals and Systems,"Fawwaz Ulaby, Andrew E Yagle",N/A,2024-05,"[From the Preface] This is a signals and systems textbook with a difference: Engineering applications of signals and systems are integrated into the presentation as equal partners with concepts and mathematical models, instead of just presenting the concepts and models and leaving the student to wonder how it all relates to engineering. The first six chapters of this textbook cover the usual basic concepts of continuous-time signals and systems, including the Laplace and Fourier transforms. Chapters 7 and 8 present the discrete-time version of Chapters 1-6, emphasizing the similarities and analogies, and often using continuous-time results to derive discrete-time results. The two chapters serve to introduce the reader to the world of discrete-time signals and systems. Concepts highlighted in Chapters 1-8 include: compensator feedback configuration (Ch. 4); energy spectral density, group delay, expanded coverage of exponential Fourier series (Ch. 5); filtering of images, Hilbert transform, single-sideband (SSB), zero and first-order hold interpolation (Ch. 6); the Cooley-Tukey FFT (Ch. 7); bilateral z-transform and use for non-minimum-phase deconvolution (Ch. 8). Chapter 9 covers the usual concepts of discrete-time signal processing, including data windows, FIR and IIR filter design, multirate signal processing, and auto-correlation and crosscorrelation. It also includes some nontraditional concepts, including spectrograms, application of multirate signal processing, and the musical circle of fifths to audio signal processing, and some biomedical applications of autocorrelation and cross-correlation. Chapter 10 covers image processing, discrete-time wavelets (including the Smith-Barnwell condition and the Haar and Daubechies discrete-time wavelet expansions), and an introduction to compressed sensing. This is the first sophomore-junior level textbook the authors are aware of that allows students to apply compressed sensing concepts. Applications include: image denoising using 2-D filtering; image denoising using thresholding and shrinkage of image wavelet transforms; image deconvolution using Wiener filters; ""valid"" image deconvolution using ISTA; image inpainting; tomography and the projection-slice theorem, and image reconstruction from partial knowledge of 2-D DFT values. Problems allow students to apply these techniques to actual images and learn by doing, not by only reading.",Technology & Engineering,0,N/A,0,en

Fluid Mechanics for Engineers,Meinhard T. Schobeiri,Springer Science & Business Media,2010-03-27,"The contents of this book covers the material required in the Fluid Mechanics Graduate Core Course (MEEN-621) and in Advanced Fluid Mechanics, a Ph. D-level elective course (MEEN-622), both of which I have been teaching at Texas A&M University for the past two decades. While there are numerous undergraduate fluid mechanics texts on the market for engineering students and instructors to choose from, there are only limited texts that comprehensively address the particular needs of graduate engineering fluid mechanics courses. To complement the lecture materials, the instructors more often recommend several texts, each of which treats special topics of fluid mechanics. This circumstance and the need to have a textbook that covers the materials needed in the above courses gave the impetus to provide the graduate engineering community with a coherent textbook that comprehensively addresses their needs for an advanced fluid mechanics text. Although this text book is primarily aimed at mechanical engineering students, it is equally suitable for aerospace engineering, civil engineering, other engineering disciplines, and especially those practicing professionals who perform CFD-simulation on a routine basis and would like to know more about the underlying physics of the commercial codes they use. Furthermore, it is suitable for self study, provided that the reader has a sufficient knowledge of calculus and differential equations.

Engineering the F-4 Phantom II,Glenn E. Bugos,US Naval Institute Press,1996,"Conceived in 1953 in a chickenwire-covered cubicle known as the advanced design cage at McDonnell Aircraft, the F-4 Phantom II fighter-bomber was produced for 25 years, serving a full workload in Vietnam for the Navy, Marines, and Air Force, and surviving through the 1990s in the air arms of eleven nations. While most case studies of modern aircraft focus on the many ways the military-industrial complex goes wrong, this trenchant, invigorating study looks deeper at how those who built the complex intended it to work. Step by step the reader discovers how the relationships among parts, systems, procedures, economies, and missions were shaped by relationships among people - scientists, engineers, testers, program managers, subcontractors, military strategists, pilots and corporate leaders. Drawing on exhaustive research, including interviews with key players, the author makes a major advance in the burgeoning body of literature on technology management by showing how McDonnell worked through the problems of technical integration that plagued defense engineering in the 1960s and 1970s and led to programs full of ""complexity"". It is as much a study of how aircraft manufacturers and military officers went about their business as it is a life-and-times history of an important aircraft.",History,272,N/A,0,en
Fundamentals of Engineering Plasticity,William F. Hosford,Cambridge University Press,2013-07-22,"William Hosford's book is ideal for those involved in designing sheet metal forming processes. Knowledge of plasticity is essential for the computer simulation of metal forming processes and understanding the advances in plasticity theory is key to formulating sound analyses. The author makes the subject simple by avoiding notations used by specialists in mechanics. R. Hill's authoritative book, Mathematical Theory of Plasticity (1950), presented a comprehensive treatment of continuum plasticity theory up to that time; much of the treatment in this book covers the same ground, but focuses on more practical topics. Hosford has included recent developments in continuum theory, including a newer treatment of anisotropy that has resulted from calculations of yielding based on crystallography, analysis of the role of defects, and forming limit diagrams.

Engineering Victory,Thomas F. Army Jr.,JHU Press,2016-06-01,"Superior engineering skills among Union soldiers helped ensure victory in the Civil War. Engineering Victory brings a fresh approach to the question of why the North prevailed in the Civil War. Historian Thomas F. Army, Jr., identifies strength in engineering—not superior military strategy or industrial advantage—as the critical determining factor in the war’s outcome. Army finds that Union soldiers were able to apply scientific ingenuity and innovation to complex problems in a way that Confederate soldiers simply could not match. Skilled Free State engineers who were trained during the antebellum period benefited from basic educational reforms, the spread of informal educational practices, and a culture that encouraged learning and innovation. During the war, their rapid construction and repair of roads, railways, and bridges allowed Northern troops to pass quickly through the forbidding terrain of the South as retreating and maneuvering Confederates struggled to cut supply lines and stop the Yankees from pressing any advantage. By presenting detailed case studies from both theaters of the war, Army clearly demonstrates how the soldiers’ education, training, and talents spelled the difference between success and failure, victory and defeat. He also reveals massive logistical operations as critical in determining the war’s outcome.",History,384,N/A,0,en

Mechanobiology Handbook,Jiro Nagatomi,CRC Press,2011-03-15,"Mechanobiology—the study of the effects of mechanical environments on the biological processes of cells—has evolved from traditional biomechanics via the incorporation of strong elements of molecular and cell biology. Currently, a broad range of organ systems are being studied by surgeons, physicians, basic scientists, and engineers. These mechanobiologists aim to create new therapies and further biological understanding by quantifying the mechanical environment of cells and the molecular mechanisms of mechanically induced pathological conditions. To achieve these goals, investigators must be familiar with both the basic concepts of mechanics and the modern tools of cellular/molecular biology. Unfortunately, current literature contains numerous studies that misuse standard mechanical estimations and terminology, or fail to implement appropriate molecular analyses. Therefore, the Mechanobiology Handbook not only presents cutting-edge research findings across various fields and organ systems, but also provides the elementary chapters on mechanics and molecular analysis techniques to encourage cross-field understanding and appropriate planning. Aided by the continuous advancement of research tools in both mechanics and biology, more sophisticated experiments and analyses are possible—thus fueling the growth of the field of mechanobiology. Considering the complexity of the mechanics and the biology of the human body, most of the world of biomechanics remains to be studied. Since the field is still developing, the Mechanobiology Handbook does not force one unified theory, but brings out many different viewpoints and approaches to stimulate further research questions.",Medical,566,N/A,0,en

A Framework for K-12 Science Education,"National Research Council, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Board on Science Education, Committee on a Conceptual Framework for New K-12 Science Education Standards",National Academies Press,2012-02-28,"Science, engineering, and technology permeate nearly every facet of modern life and hold the key to solving many of humanity's most pressing current and future challenges. The United States' position in the global economy is declining, in part because U.S. workers lack fundamental knowledge in these fields. To address the critical issues of U.S. competitiveness and to better prepare the workforce, A Framework for K-12 Science Education proposes a new approach to K-12 science education that will capture students' interest and provide them with the necessary foundational knowledge in the field. A Framework for K-12 Science Education outlines a broad set of expectations for students in science and engineering in grades K-12. These expectations will inform the development of new standards for K-12 science education and, subsequently, revisions to curriculum, instruction, assessment, and professional development for educators. This book identifies three dimensions that convey the core ideas and practices around which science and engineering education in these grades should be built. These three dimensions are: crosscutting concepts that unify the study of science through their common application across science and engineering; scientific and engineering practices; and disciplinary core ideas in the physical sciences, life sciences, and earth and space sciences and for engineering, technology, and the applications of science. The overarching goal is for all high school graduates to have sufficient knowledge of science and engineering to engage in public discussions on science-related issues, be careful consumers of scientific and technical information, and enter the careers of their choice. A Framework for K-12 Science Education is the first step in a process that can inform state-level decisions and achieve a research-grounded basis for improving science instruction and learning across the country. The book will guide standards developers, teachers, curriculum designers, assessment developers, state and district science administrators, and educators who teach science in informal environments.",Education,400,N/A,0,en

Ontology Engineering,"Elisa Kendall, Deborah McGuinness",Springer Nature,2022-05-31,"Ontologies have become increasingly important as the use of knowledge graphs, machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and the amount of data generated on a daily basis has exploded. As of 2014, 90% of the data in the digital universe was generated in the two years prior, and the volume of data was projected to grow from 3.2 zettabytes to 40 zettabytes in the next six years. The very real issues that government, research, and commercial organizations are facing in order to sift through this amount of information to support decision-making alone mandate increasing automation. Yet, the data profiling, NLP, and learning algorithms that are ground-zero for data integration, manipulation, and search provide less than satisfactory results unless they utilize terms with unambiguous semantics, such as those found in ontologies and well-formed rule sets. Ontologies can provide a rich ""schema"" for the knowledge graphs underlying these technologies as well as the terminological and semantic basis for dramatic improvements in results. Many ontology projects fail, however, due at least in part to a lack of discipline in the development process. This book, motivated by the Ontology 101 tutorial given for many years at what was originally the Semantic Technology Conference (SemTech) and then later from a semester-long university class, is designed to provide the foundations for ontology engineering.

Engineer of Revolutionary Russia,Anthony Heywood,Routledge,2016-05-13,"This book is the first substantial study in any language of one of revolutionary Russia's most distinguished and controversial engineers - Iurii Vladimirovich Lomonosov (1876-1952). Not only does it provide an outline of his remarkable life and career, it also explores the relationship between science, technology and transport that developed in late tsarist and early Soviet Russia. Lomonosov's importance extends well beyond his scientific and engineering achievements thanks to the rich variety and public prominence of his professional and political activities. His generation - Lenin's generation - was inevitably at the forefront of Russian life from the 1910s to the 1930s, and Lomonosov took his place there as one of the country's best known and ultimately notorious engineers. As well as an innovative engineer who campaigned to enhance the role of science, he played a major role in shaping and administering the Russian railways, and undertook several diplomatic and scientific missions to the West during the early years of the Revolution. Falling from political favour during an assignment in Germany (1923-1927), he achieved notoriety in Russia as a 'non-returner' by apparently declining to return home. Thereby escaping probable arrest and execution, he began a new life abroad (1927-1952) which included a research post at the California Institute of Technology in 1929-1930, collaborative projects with the famous physicist P.L. Kapitsa in Cambridge, a long-time association with the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in London, and work for the British War Office during the Second World War. From Marxist revolutionary to American academic, this study reveals Lomonosov's extraordinary life. Drawing on a wide variety of official Russian sources, as well as Lomonosov's own diaries and memoirs, a vivid portrait of his life is presented, offering a better understanding of how science, technology and politics interacted in early-twentieth-century Russia.",Technology & Engineering,456,N/A,0,en
Treatise on Geomorphology,,Academic Press,2013-02-27,"The changing focus and approach of geomorphic research suggests that the time is opportune for a summary of the state of discipline. The number of peer-reviewed papers published in geomorphic journals has grown steadily for more than two decades and, more importantly, the diversity of authors with respect to geographic location and disciplinary background (geography, geology, ecology, civil engineering, computer science, geographic information science, and others) has expanded dramatically. As more good minds are drawn to geomorphology, and the breadth of the peer-reviewed literature grows, an effective summary of contemporary geomorphic knowledge becomes increasingly difficult. The fourteen volumes of this Treatise on Geomorphology will provide an important reference for users from undergraduate students looking for term paper topics, to graduate students starting a literature review for their thesis work, and professionals seeking a concise summary of a particular topic. Information on the historical development of diverse topics within geomorphology provides context for ongoing research; discussion of research strategies, equipment, and field methods, laboratory experiments, and numerical simulations reflect the multiple approaches to understanding Earth’s surfaces; and summaries of outstanding research questions highlight future challenges and suggest productive new avenues for research. Our future ability to adapt to geomorphic changes in the critical zone very much hinges upon how well landform scientists comprehend the dynamics of Earth’s diverse surfaces. This Treatise on Geomorphology provides a useful synthesis of the state of the discipline, as well as highlighting productive research directions, that Educators and students/researchers will find useful. Geomorphology has advanced greatly in the last 10 years to become a very interdisciplinary field. Undergraduate students looking for term paper topics, to graduate students starting a literature review for their thesis work, and professionals seeking a concise summary of a particular topic will find the answers they need in this broad reference work which has been designed and written to accommodate their diverse backgrounds and levels of understanding Editor-in-Chief, Prof. J.

Systems Engineering and Artificial Intelligence,"William F. Lawless, Ranjeev Mittu, Donald A. Sofge, Thomas Shortell, Thomas A. McDermott",Springer Nature,2021-11-02,"This book provides a broad overview of the benefits from a Systems Engineering design philosophy in architecting complex systems composed of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and humans situated in chaotic environments. The major topics include emergence, verification and validation of systems using AI/ML and human systems integration to develop robust and effective human-machine teams—where the machines may have varying degrees of autonomy due to the sophistication of their embedded AI/ML. The chapters not only describe what has been learned, but also raise questions that must be answered to further advance the general Science of Autonomy. The science of how humans and machines operate as a team requires insights from, among others, disciplines such as the social sciences, national and international jurisprudence, ethics and policy, and sociology and psychology. The social sciences inform how context is constructed, how trust is affected when humans and machines depend upon each other and how human-machine teams need a shared language of explanation. National and international jurisprudence determine legal responsibilities of non-trivial human-machine failures, ethical standards shape global policy, and sociology provides a basis for understanding team norms across cultures. Insights from psychology may help us to understand the negative impact on humans if AI/ML based machines begin to outperform their human teammates and consequently diminish their value or importance. This book invites professionals and the curious alike to witness a new frontier open as the Science of Autonomy emerges.",Computers,566,N/A,0,en
Effective Methods for Software Engineering,Boyd L. Summers,CRC Press,2020-07-28,"Software is important because it is used by a great many people in companies and institutions. This book presents engineering methods for designing and building software. Based on the author’s experience in software engineering as a programmer in the defense and aerospace industries, this book explains how to ensure a software that is programmed operates according to its requirements. It also shows how to develop, operate, and maintain software engineering capabilities by instilling an engineering discipline to support programming, design, builds, and delivery to customers. This book helps software engineers to: Understand the basic concepts, standards, and requirements of software engineering. Select the appropriate programming and design techniques. Effectively use software engineering tools and applications. Create specifications to comply with the software standards and requirements. Utilize various methods and techniques to identify defects. Manage changes to standards and requirements. Besides providing a technical view, this book discusses the moral and ethical responsibility of software engineers to ensure that the software they design and program does not cause serious problems. Software engineers tend to be concerned with the technical elegance of their software products and tools, whereas customers tend to be concerned only with whether a software product meets their needs and is easy and ready to use. This book looks at these two sides of software development and the challenges they present for software engineering. A critical understanding of software engineering empowers developers to choose the right methods for achieving effective results. Effective Methods for Software Engineering guides software programmers and developers to develop this critical understanding that is so crucial in today’s software-dependent society.",Computers,290,N/A,0,en

Clean Coal Engineering Technology,Bruce G. Miller,Elsevier,2010-11-15,"Concern over the effects of airborne pollution, green house gases, and the impact of global warming has become a worldwide issue that transcends international boundaries, politics, and social responsibility. The 2nd Edition of Coal Energy Systems: Clean Coal Technology describes a new generation of energy processes that sharply reduce air emissions and other pollutants from coal-burning power plants. Coal is the dirtiest of all fossil fuels. When burned, it produces emissions that contribute to global warming, create acid rain, and pollute water. With all of the interest and research surrounding nuclear energy, hydropower, and biofuels, many think that coal is finally on its way out. However, coal generates half of the electricity in the United States and throughout the world today. It will likely continue to do so as long as it's cheap and plentiful [Source: Energy Information Administration]. Coal provides stability in price and availability, will continue to be a major source of electricity generation, will be the major source of hydrogen for the coming hydrogen economy, and has the potential to become an important source of liquid fuels. Conservation and renewable/sustainable energy are important in the overall energy picture, but will play a lesser role in helping us satisfy our energy demands today. Dramatically updated to meet the needs of an ever changing energy market, Coal Energy Systems, 2nd Edition is a single source covering policy and the engineering involved in implementing that policy. The book addresses many coal-related subjects of interest ranging from the chemistry of coal and the future engineering anatomy of a coal fired plant to the cutting edge clean coal technologies being researched and utilized today. A 50% update over the first edition, this new book contains new chapters on processes such as CO2 capture and sequestration, Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) systems, Pulverized-Coal Power Plants and Carbon Emission Trading. Existing materials on worldwide coal distribution and quantities, technical and policy issues regarding the use of coal, technologies used and under development for utilizing coal to produce heat, electricity, and chemicals with low environmental impact, vision for utilizing coal well into the 21st century, and the security coal presents. - Clean Liquids and Gaseous Fuels from Coal for Electric Power - Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) systems - Pulverized-Coal Power Plants - Advanced Coal-Based Power Plants - Fluidized-Bed Combustion Technology - CO2 capture and sequestration",Technology & Engineering,697,N/A,0,en

Artificial Intelligence for Accurate Analysis and Detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder,"Kautish, Sandeep, Dhiman, Gaurav",IGI Global,2021-06-25,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is known as a neuro-disorder in which a person may face problems in interaction and communication with people, amongst other challenges. As per medical experts, ASD can be diagnosed at any stage or age but is often noticeable within the first two years of life. If caught early enough, therapies and services can be provided at this early stage instead of waiting until it is too late. ASD occurrences appear to have increased over the last couple of years leading to the need for more research in the field. It is crucial to provide researchers and clinicians with the most up-to-date information on the clinical features, etiopathogenesis, and therapeutic strategies for patients as well as to shed light on the other psychiatric conditions often associated with ASD. In addition, it is equally important to understand how to detect ASD in individuals for accurate diagnosing and early detection. Artificial Intelligence for Accurate Analysis and Detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder discusses the early detection and diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder enabled by artificial intelligence technologies, applications, and therapies. This book will focus on the early diagnosis of ASD through artificial intelligence, such as deep learning and machine learning algorithms, for confirming diagnosis or suggesting the need for further evaluation of individuals. The chapters will also discuss the use of artificial intelligence technologies, such as medical robots, for enhancing the communication skills and the social and emotional skills of children who have been diagnosed with ASD. This book is ideally intended for IT specialists, data scientists, academicians, scholars, researchers, policymakers, medical practitioners, and students interested in how artificial intelligence is impacting the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorder.",Psychology,224,N/A,0,en

In the past, such comparisons were made in nominal terms, or by using exchange rates across countries, ignoring differences in price levels and thus distorting the results. Great progress has been made in interspatial comparisons in the past thirty years, but descriptions and discussions of the new measures have been scattered in unpublished or inaccessible papers. International and Interarea Comparisons of Income, Output, and Prices includes discussions of developments in the United Nations International Comparison Program, the largest effort in this field, and in the ICOP program on the production side, including efforts in both to extend the comparisons to the formerly planned economies. Other papers in this volume explore new programs on interspatial comparisons within the United States.

Synchronous Ethernet and IEEE 1588 in Telecoms,"Jean-Loup Ferrant, Mike Gilson, Sébastien Jobert, Michael Mayer, Laurent Montini, Michel Ouellette, Silvana Rodrigues, Stefano Ruffini",John Wiley & Sons,2013-06-12,"This book addresses the multiple technical aspects of the distribution of synchronization in new generation telecommunication networks, focusing in particular on synchronous Ethernet and IEEE1588 technologies. Many packet network engineers struggle with understanding the challenges that precise synchronization distribution can impose on networks. The usual “why”, “when” and particularly “how” can cause problems for many engineers. In parallel to this, some other markets have identical synchronization requirements, but with their own design requirements, generating further questions. This book attempts to respond to the different questions by providing background technical information. Invaluable information on state of-the-art packet network synchronization and timing architectures is provided, as well as an unbiased view on the synchronization technologies that have been internationally standardized over recent years, with the aim of providing the average reader (who is not skilled in the art) with a better understanding of this topic. The book focuses specifically on synchronous Ethernet and IEEE 1588 PTP-based technologies, both key developments in the world of synchronization over the last 10 years. The authors address the needs of engineers and technical managers who are struggling with the subject of synchronization and provide an engineering reference for those that need to consider synchronization in NGN.

Engineering Project Appraisal,"Martin Rogers, Aidan Duffy",John Wiley & Sons,2012-07-03,"In most cases of civil engineering development, a range of alternative schemes meeting project goals are feasible, so some form of evaluation must be carried out to select the most appropriate to take forward. Evaluation criteria usually include the economic, environmental and social contexts of a project as well as the engineering challenges, so engineers must be familiar with the processes and tools used. The second edition of Engineering Project Appraisal equips students with the understanding and analytical tools to carry out effective appraisals of alternative development schemes, using both economic and non-economic criteria. The building blocks of economic appraisal are covered early, leading to techniques such as net present worth, internal rate of return and annual worth. Cost Benefit Analysis is dealt with in detail, together with related methods such as Cost Effectiveness and the Goal Achievement Matrix. The text also details three multi-criteria models which have proved useful in the evaluation of proposals in the transportation, solid waste, energy and water resources fields: the Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) Model, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique and Concordance Analysis. There is a full discussion dealing with risk and uncertainty in these models. With many worked examples and case studies, Engineering Project Appraisal is an essential text for both undergraduate and postgraduate students on professional civil engineering courses, and it is expected that students on planning and construction management courses will find it a valuable addition to their reading.",Technology & Engineering,396,N/A,0,en

Engineering of Glacial Deposits,Barry G. Clarke,CRC Press,2017-07-14,"At some time 30% of the world’s land mass was covered by glaciers leaving substantial deposits of glacial soils under major conurbations in Europe, North and South America, New Zealand, Europe and Russia. For instance, 60% of the UK has been affected, leaving significant glacial deposits under major conurbations where two thirds of the population live. Glacial soils are composite soils with significant variations in composition and properties and are recognised as challenging soils to deal with. Understanding the environment in which they were formed and how this affects their behaviour are critical because they do not always conform to classic theories of soil mechanics. This book is aimed at designers and contractors working in the construction and extractive industries to help them mitigate construction hazards on, with or in glacial deposits. These soils increase risks to critical infrastructure which, in the UK includes the majority of the road and rail network, coastal defences such as the fastest eroding coastline in Europe and most of the water supply reservoirs. It brings together many years of experience of research into the behaviour of glacial deposits drawing upon published and unpublished case studies from industry. It draws on recent developments in understanding of the geological processes and the impact they have upon the engineering properties, construction processes and performance of geotechnical structures. Unlike other books on glaciation it brings together all the relevant disciplines in earth sciences and engineering to make it directly relevant to the construction industry.",Architecture,549,N/A,0,en

Computational Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Science Using Python,Ryan McClarren,Academic Press,2017-10-19,"Computational Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Science Using Python provides the necessary knowledge users need to embed more modern computing techniques into current practices, while also helping practitioners replace Fortran-based implementations with higher level languages. The book is especially unique in the market with its implementation of Python into nuclear engineering methods, seeking to do so by first teaching the basics of Python, then going through different techniques to solve systems of equations, and finally applying that knowledge to solve problems specific to nuclear engineering. Along with examples of code and end-of-chapter problems, the book is an asset to novice programmers in nuclear engineering and radiological sciences, teaching them how to analyze complex systems using modern computational techniques. For decades, the paradigm in engineering education, in particular, nuclear engineering, has been to teach Fortran along with numerical methods for solving engineering problems. This has been slowly changing as new codes have been written utilizing modern languages, such as Python, thus resulting in a greater need for the development of more modern computational skills and techniques in nuclear engineering. - Offers numerical methods as a tool to solve specific problems in nuclear engineering - Provides examples on how to simulate different problems and produce graphs using Python - Supplies accompanying codes and data on a companion website, along with solutions to end-of-chapter problems",Technology & Engineering,462,N/A,0,en

Introduction to Quality Engineering,"Genichi Taguchi, Genʼichi Taguchi",Organization,1986,"From the Back Cover: Introduction to Quality Engineering is the first book with specific in-depth methods that places the responsibility of quality on everyone associated with the marketing, engineering and manufacturing of a product, and turns them all into Quality Control specialists. The book quantifies the loss due to lack of quality of a performance characteristic by directly relating it to its deviation from target performance, and shows efficient experimental and analytical techniques to minimize it. Unlike other books on quality and industrial experimentation which treat the subject specialty in a localized manner, this book encompasses all major activities of an industry, and links them together with a common objective of reducing quality loss. Chapters of the book progress smoothly and build upon the previous chapters. Each chapter introduces the subject matter, then a real life case study follows and ends with question and answer session between Dr. Taguchi and the student in a typical class. The techniques shown are powerful but easy to apply, and does not require statistical background or any other prerequisites; thus, the subject can be taught to engineers in an industry or in engineering schools.",Business & Economics,210,5,1,en

Ethical Hacking,Daniel G. Graham,No Starch Press,2021-11-02,"A hands-on guide to hacking computer systems from the ground up, from capturing traffic to crafting sneaky, successful trojans. A crash course in modern hacking techniques, Ethical Hacking is already being used to prepare the next generation of offensive security experts. In its many hands-on labs, you’ll explore crucial skills for any aspiring penetration tester, security researcher, or malware analyst. You’ll begin with the basics: capturing a victim’s network traffic with an ARP spoofing attack and then viewing it in Wireshark. From there, you’ll deploy reverse shells that let you remotely run commands on a victim’s computer, encrypt files by writing your own ransomware in Python, and fake emails like the ones used in phishing attacks. In advanced chapters, you’ll learn how to fuzz for new vulnerabilities, craft trojans and rootkits, exploit websites with SQL injection, and escalate your privileges to extract credentials, which you’ll use to traverse a private network. You’ll work with a wide range of professional penetration testing tools—and learn to write your own tools in Python—as you practice tasks like: Deploying the Metasploit framework’s reverse shells and embedding them in innocent-seeming files Capturing passwords in a corporate Windows network using Mimikatz Scanning (almost) every device on the internet to find potential victims Installing Linux rootkits that modify a victim’s operating system Performing advanced Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks that execute sophisticated JavaScript payloads Along the way, you’ll gain a foundation in the relevant computing technologies. Discover how advanced fuzzers work behind the scenes, learn how internet traffic gets encrypted, explore the inner mechanisms of nation-state malware like Drovorub, and much more. Developed with feedback from cybersecurity students, Ethical Hacking addresses contemporary issues in the field not often covered in other books and will prepare you for a career in penetration testing.

Wind Wizard,Siobhan Roberts,Princeton University Press,2012-11-25,"How the father of wind engineering helped make the world's most amazing buildings and bridges possible With Wind Wizard, Siobhan Roberts brings us the story of Alan Davenport (1932-2009), the father of modern wind engineering, who investigated how wind navigates the obstacle course of the earth's natural and built environments—and how, when not properly heeded, wind causes buildings and bridges to teeter unduly, sway with abandon, and even collapse. In 1964, Davenport received a confidential telephone call from two engineers requesting tests on a pair of towers that promised to be the tallest in the world. His resulting wind studies on New York's World Trade Center advanced the art and science of wind engineering with one pioneering innovation after another. Establishing the first dedicated ""boundary layer"" wind tunnel laboratory for civil engineering structures, Davenport enabled the study of the atmospheric region from the earth's surface to three thousand feet, where the air churns with turbulent eddies, the average wind speed increasing with height. The boundary layer wind tunnel mimics these windy marbled striations in order to test models of buildings and bridges that inevitably face the wind when built. Over the years, Davenport's revolutionary lab investigated and improved the wind-worthiness of the world's greatest structures, including the Sears Tower, the John Hancock Tower, Shanghai's World Financial Center, the CN Tower, the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge, the Sunshine Skyway, and the proposed crossing for the Strait of Messina, linking Sicily with mainland Italy. Chronicling Davenport's innovations by analyzing select projects, this popular-science book gives an illuminating behind-the-scenes view into the practice of wind engineering, and insight into Davenport's steadfast belief that there is neither a structure too tall nor too long, as long as it is supported by sound wind science.

Ethical Reasoning in Big Data,"Jeff Collmann, Sorin Adam Matei",Springer,2016-04-22,"This book springs from a multidisciplinary, multi-organizational, and multi-sector conversation about the privacy and ethical implications of research in human affairs using big data. The need to cultivate and enlist the public’s trust in the abilities of particular scientists and scientific institutions constitutes one of this book’s major themes. The advent of the Internet, the mass digitization of research information, and social media brought about, among many other things, the ability to harvest – sometimes implicitly – a wealth of human genomic, biological, behavioral, economic, political, and social data for the purposes of scientific research as well as commerce, government affairs, and social interaction. What type of ethical dilemmas did such changes generate? How should scientists collect, manipulate, and disseminate this information? The effects of this revolution and its ethical implications are wide-ranging. This book includes the opinions of myriad investigators, practitioners, and stakeholders in big data on human beings who also routinely reflect on the privacy and ethical issues of this phenomenon. Dedicated to the practice of ethical reasoning and reflection in action, the book offers a range of observations, lessons learned, reasoning tools, and suggestions for institutional practice to promote responsible big data research on human affairs. It caters to a broad audience of educators, researchers, and practitioners. Educators can use the volume in courses related to big data handling and processing. Researchers can use it for designing new methods of collecting, processing, and disseminating big data, whether in raw form or as analysis results. Lastly, practitioners can use it to steer future tools or procedures for handling big data. As this topic represents an area of great interest that still remains largely undeveloped, this book is sure to attract significant interest by filling an obvious gap in currently available literature.",Computers,194,N/A,0,en

Wave Propagation,"James H. Williams, Jr.",MIT Press,2019-12-31,"An engineering-oriented introduction to wave propagation by an award-winning MIT professor, with highly accessible expositions and mathematical details—many classical but others not heretofore published. A wave is a traveling disturbance or oscillation—intentional or unintentional—that usually transfers energy without a net displacement of the medium in which the energy travels. Wave propagation is any of the means by which a wave travels. This book offers an engineering-oriented introduction to wave propagation that focuses on wave propagation in one-dimensional models that are anchored by the classical wave equation. The text is written in a style that is highly accessible to undergraduates, featuring extended and repetitive expositions and displaying and explaining mathematical and physical details—many classical but others not heretofore published. The formulations are devised to provide analytical foundations for studying more advanced topics of wave propagation. After a precalculus summary of rudimentary wave propagation and an introduction of the classical wave equation, the book presents solutions for the models of systems that are dimensionally infinite, semi-infinite, and finite. Chapters typically begin with a vignette based on some aspect of wave propagation, drawing on a diverse range of topics. The book provides more than two hundred end-of-chapter problems (supplying answers to most problems requiring a numerical result or brief analytical expression). Appendixes cover equations of motion for strings, rods, and circular shafts; shear beams; and electric transmission lines.",Technology & Engineering,449,N/A,0,en

Microelectronics Education,"B. Courtois, N. Guillemot, G. Kamarinos, G. Stéhelin",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-03-09,"This is the third edition of the European Workshop on Microelectronics Education (EWME). A steady-state regime has now been reached. An international community of university teachers is constituted; they exchange their experience and their pedagogical tools. They discuss the best ways to transfer the rapidly changing techniques to their students, and to introduce them to the new physical and mathematical concepts and models for the innovative techniques, devices, circuits and design methods. The number of abstracts submitted to EWME 2000 (about one hundred) enabled the scientific committee to proceed to a clear selection. EWME is a European meeting. Indeed, authors from 20 different European countries contribute to this volume. Nevertheless, the participation of authors from Brazil, Canada, China, New Zealand, and USA, shows that the workshop gradually attains an international dimension. th The 20 century can be characterized as the ""century of electron"". The electron, as an elementary particle, was discovered by J.J. Thomson in 1897, and was rapidly used to transfer energy and information. Thanks to electron, universe and micro-cosmos could be explored. Electron became the omnipotent and omnipresent, almost immaterial, angel of our W orId. This was made possible thanks to electronics and, for the last 30 years, to microelectronics.

Plant Innate Immunity Signals and Signaling Systems,P. Vidhyasekaran,Springer Nature,2020-04-15,"The volume III of the book presents the ways and means to manipulate the signals and signaling system to enhance the expression of plant innate immunity for crop disease management. It also describes bioengineering approaches to develop transgenic plants expressing enhanced disease resistance using plant immunity signaling genes. It also discusses recent commercial development of biotechnological products to manipulate plant innate immunity for crop disease management. Engineering durable nonspecific resistance to phytopathogens is one of the ultimate goals of plant breeding. However, most of the attempts to reach this goal fail as a result of rapid changes in pathogen populations and the sheer diversity of pathogen infection mechanisms. Recently several bioengineering and molecular manipulation technologies have been developed to activate the ‘sleeping’ plant innate immune system, which has potential to detect and suppress the development of a wide range of plant pathogens in economically important crop plants. Enhancing disease resistance through altered regulation of plant immunity signaling systems would be durable and publicly acceptable. Strategies for activation and improvement of plant immunity aim at enhancing host’s capability of recognizing invading pathogens, boosting the executive arsenal of plant immunity, and interfering with virulence strategies employed by microbial pathogens. Major advances in our understanding of the molecular basis of plant immunity and of microbial infection strategies have opened new ways for engineering durable resistance in crop plants.",Science,276,N/A,0,en

Chronicles of Mechanical Engineering in the United States,"Thomas H. Fehring, Terry S. Reynolds",American Society of Mechanical Engineers,2021-06,"One of the leading contributors of historical articles to ME over the past fifty years was Fritz Hirschfeld. In preparation for the United States' bicentennial year in 1976, the editors of Mechanical Engineering contracted with engineer-historian Hirschfeld for a series of articles on the county's early engineering history. Just a few years later, as the Society was nearing its centennial in 1880, the editors again turned to Hirschfeld and asked him to write a series of articles about the founding of ASME and important early mechanical engineers. Hirschfeld's articles, collected here, provide the foundation for the early portion of this volume. Building upon Hirschfeld's foundation, we selected a wide assortment of other articles about aspects of mechanical engineering history in the United States from the Revolutionary War until recent times. We largely limited our selections to those articles published in Mechanical Engineering magazine during the last fifty years (i.e., 1971-2021). Even for this period, the volume does not include all such articles due to limitations in length and editorial judgments. For instance, some articles duplicated coverage of specific events or innovations. In such cases we picked what we deemed the best, or most comprehensive of overlapping articles. We also decided to focus this volume on the history of mechanical engineering in America. We thus excluded articles on historical developments largely occurring outside the United States. At some future time, we may ""harvest"" both pre-1971 ME articles and unselected post-1971 articles, as well as articles focusing on non-American mechanical engineering achievements, for a separate collection or collections. Of the more than seventy articles collected in this volume, well over ninety per cent were drawn from issues of ME published during the past fifty years. Five pieces, however, were drawn from outside that chronological limit or from other sources. We have, for example, included a 1933 biographical article from ME about American engineer George H. Corliss. Corliss's innovations in the design and manufacture of steam engines and related devices helped establish the United States as a major player in the manufacture of prime movers. Corliss was considered by his contemporaries to be such a significant figure in mechanical engineering circles in the United States that we elected to include him. He was, after all, asked to serve as the first president of ASME-an offer which he declined. A second exception is another biographical article, one on Edwin Reynolds, a significant steam engine designer. It was authored by Thomas Fehring, one of the editors of this volume. Reynolds worked for a time for the Corliss Steam Engine Company, as did other notable American engineers such as Erasmus Darwin Leavitt (second president of ASME) and Alexander L. Holley (one of the founders of the Society), before moving to Allis-Chalmers. Reynolds made significant improvements in steam engine design. He was president of ASME in 1902-03, and three of his steam engines have been designated as Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmarks by the Society.",Technology & Engineering,426,N/A,0,en

Killed by a Traffic Engineer,Wes Marshall,Island Press,2024-06-04,"Fixing the carnage on our roadways requires a change in mindset and a dramatic transformation of transportation. This goes for traffic engineers in particular because they are still the ones in charge of our streets. In Killed by a Traffic Engineer, civil engineering professor Wes Marshall shines a spotlight on how little science there is behind the way that our streets are engineered, which leaves safety as an afterthought. While traffic engineers are not trying to cause deliberate harm to anyone, he explains, they are guilty of creating a transportation system whose designs remain largely based on plausible, but unproven, conjecture. Killed by a Traffic Engineer is ultimately hopeful about what is possible once we shift our thinking and demand streets engineered for the safety of people, both outside and inside of cars. It will make you look at your city and streets--and traffic engineers--in a new light and inspire you to take action.",Technology & Engineering,426,N/A,0,en

American Locomotives,John H. White,N/A,1997,"In 1835, there were 175 steam locomotives in service in the United States. By 1900, that number had increased to 37,663. In this newly revised and expanded edition of his classic work, renowned railroad historian John H. White, Jr., chronicles the explosive growth and development of the steam locomotive in America -- from the first British imports to the New York elevated locomotives of the 1880s -- and adds more than fifty new pages of superb illustrations and text. Beginning with the early era of locomotive design, White describes the background and methods of the first American builders, the special requirements of American railroads, construction materials, locomotive types, performance, and costs. He then turns to the development of individual components: boilers and running gears, headlights and cowcatchers, sandboxes, bells, and whistles. Throughout, remarkably detailed scale drawings -- many reproduced from the original working drawings -- illustrate design features and modifications. For this new edition, White offers eleven new detailed and comprehensive case histories of individual locomotives, beginning with the 1843 La Junta. Each case history provides a wealth of historical background, mechanical information, and engineering analysis. White also includes a special section that updates and annotates the information found in the original edition. This beautifully complete and authoritative history stands as a landmark in its field. Now in a new edition, it will continue to delight railroad enthusiasts, model builders, historians of technology, and anyone with an interest in American railroads. From reviews of the first edition: ""An outstanding engineering andpublishing masterpiece."" -- Journal of American History ""The definitive reference work on the technical development of the early locomotive."" -- Business History Review ""White does a splendid job... through the combined use of narrative and over 230 highly detailed, sharp and clear pictures and drawings."" -- Civil War History",Locomotives,0,N/A,0,en

H-infinity Engineering and Amplifier Optimization,Jefferey C. Allen,Birkhäuser,2004-08-09,"H-infinity engineering continues to establish itself as a discipline of applied mathematics. As such, this extensively illustrated monograph makes a significant application of H-infinity theory to electronic amplifier design, demonstrating how recent developments in H-infinity engineering equip amplifier designers with new tools and avenues for research. The presentation, at the interface of applied mathematics and engineering, emphasizes how to (1) compute the best possible performance available from any matching circuits; (2) benchmark existing matching solutions; and (3) generalize results to multiple amplifiers. As the monograph develops, many research directions are pointed out for both disciplines. The physical meaning of a mathematical problem is made explicit for the mathematician, while circuit problems are presented in the H-infinity framework for the engineer. A final chapter organizes these research topics into a collection of open problems ranging from electrical engineering, numerical implementations, and generalizations to H-infinity theory.",Science,249,N/A,0,en
Chronicles of Mechanical Engineering in the United States,"Thomas H Fehring, Terry S Reynolds",N/A,2021-06,"One of the leading contributors of historical articles to ME over the past fifty years was Fritz Hirschfeld. In preparation for the United States' bicentennial year in 1976, the editors of Mechanical Engineering contracted with engineer-historian Hirschfeld for a series of articles on the county's early engineering history. Just a few years later, as the Society was nearing its centennial in 1880, the editors again turned to Hirschfeld and asked him to write a series of articles about the founding of ASME and important early mechanical engineers. Hirschfeld's articles, collected here, provide the foundation for the early portion of this volume. Building upon Hirschfeld's foundation, we selected a wide assortment of other articles about aspects of mechanical engineering history in the United States from the Revolutionary War until recent times. We largely limited our selections to those articles published in Mechanical Engineering magazine during the last fifty years (i.e., 1971-2021). Even for this period, the volume does not include all such articles due to limitations in length and editorial judgments. For instance, some articles duplicated coverage of specific events or innovations. In such cases we picked what we deemed the best, or most comprehensive of overlapping articles. We also decided to focus this volume on the history of mechanical engineering in America. We thus excluded articles on historical developments largely occurring outside the United States. At some future time, we may ""harvest"" both pre-1971 ME articles and unselected post-1971 articles, as well as articles focusing on non-American mechanical engineering achievements, for a separate collection or collections. Of the more than seventy articles collected in this volume, well over ninety per cent were drawn from issues of ME published during the past fifty years. Five pieces, however, were drawn from outside that chronological limit or from other sources. We have, for example, included a 1933 biographical article from ME about American engineer George H. Corliss. Corliss's innovations in the design and manufacture of steam engines and related devices helped establish the United States as a major player in the manufacture of prime movers. Corliss was considered by his contemporaries to be such a significant figure in mechanical engineering circles in the United States that we elected to include him. He was, after all, asked to serve as the first president of ASME-an offer which he declined. A second exception is another biographical article, one on Edwin Reynolds, a significant steam engine designer. It was authored by Thomas Fehring, one of the editors of this volume. Reynolds worked for a time for the Corliss Steam Engine Company, as did other notable American engineers such as Erasmus Darwin Leavitt (second president of ASME) and Alexander L. Holley (one of the founders of the Society), before moving to Allis-Chalmers. Reynolds made significant improvements in steam engine design. He was president of ASME in 1902-03, and three of his steam engines have been designated as Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmarks by the Society.",,424,N/A,0,en

Electromagnetic Fields and Waves,Magdy F. Iskander,N/A,2013,"The latest edition of Electromagnetic Fields and Waves retains an authoritative, balanced approach, in-depth coverage, extensive analysis, and use of computational techniques to provide a complete understanding of electromagnetic important to all electrical engineering students. An essential feature of this innovative text is the early introduction of Maxwell's equations, together with the quantifying experimental observations made by the pioneers who discovered electromagnetics. This approach directly links the mathematical relations in Maxwell's equations to real experiments and facilitates a fundamental understanding of wave propagation and use in modern practical applications, especially in today's wireless world. New and expanded topics include the conceptual relationship between Coulomb's law and Gauss's law for calculating electric fields, the relationship between Biot-Savart's and Ampere's laws and their use in calculating magnetic fields from current sources, the development of Faraday's law from experimental observations, and a comprehensive discussion and analysis of the displacement current term that unified the laws of electromagnetism. The text also includes sections on computational techniques in electromagnetics and applications in electrostatics, in transmission lines, and in wire antenna designs. The antennas chapter has been substantially broadened in scope; it now can be used as a stand-alone text in an introductory antennas course. Advantageous pedagogical features appear in every chapter: examples that illustrate key topics and ask the reader to render a solution to a question or problem posed; an abundant number of detailed figures and diagrams, enabling a visual interpretation of the developed mathematical equations; and multiple review questions and problems designed to strengthen and accelerate the learning process. Helpful material is included in six appendices, including answers to selected problems. Unlike other introductory texts, Electromagnetic Fields and Waves does not bog readers down with equations and mathematical relations. Instead, it focuses on the fundamental understanding and exciting applications of electromagnetics.

The Engines of Our Ingenuity,John H. Lienhard,"Oxford University Press, USA",2000,"Millions of people have listened to John H. Lienhard's radio program ""The Engines of Our Ingenuity."" In this fascinating book, Lienhard gathers his reflections on the nature of technology, culture, and human inventiveness. The book brims with insightful observations. Lienhard writes that the history of technology is a history of us--we are the machines we create. Thus farming dramatically changed the rhythms of human life and redirected history. War seldom fuels invention--radar, jets, and the digital computer all emerged before World War II began. And the medieval Church was a driving force behind the growth of Western technology--Cistercian monasteries were virtual factories, whose water wheels cut wood, forged iron, and crushed olives. Lienhard illustrates his themes through inventors, mathematicians, and engineers--with stories of the canoe, the DC-3, the Hoover Dam, the diode, and the sewing machine. We gain new insight as to who we are, through the familiar machines and technologies that are central to our lives.",History,282,N/A,0,en

Plant Protoplasts and Genetic Engineering I,Y. P. S. Bajaj,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Isolated protoplasts are a unique tool for genetic manipulation of plants. Since the discovery of a method for the enzymatic isolation of pro-· toplasts by Professor E. C. Cocking in 1960, tremendous progress has been made in this very fascinating area of research. I have witnessed the struggle in the 1960's and early 1970's, when obtaining a clean prepara tion of protoplasts was considered an achievement. I also shared the pioneering excitement and enthusiasm in this field during the 2nd Inter national Congress of Plant Tissue Culture held at Strasbourg in 1970, where Dr. I. Thkebe of Japan presented his work on the induction of division in tobacco protoplasts. This was followed by my participation in three international conferences devoted to plant protoplasts held in 1972 in Salamanca (Spain) and Versailles (France), and then in 1975 in Nottingham (England). The enthusiasm shown by plant scientists at these meetings was ample proof of the bright future of protoplast technology, and it became evident that protoplasts would playa major role in plant biotechnology, especially in genetic engineering. Since then we have never looked back, and now the methods for isolation, fusion, and culture, as well as regeneration of somatic hybrids, have become routine laboratory procedures for most plant species. Currently the focus is on cereal and tree protoplasts. In order to bring about any genetic manipulation through fusion, in corporation of DNA, and transformation, the regeneration of the entire plant through manipulation of protoplasts is a prerequisite.",Technology & Engineering,461,N/A,0,en

The Making of an Expert Engineer,James Trevelyan,CRC Press,2014-09-22,"This book sets out the principles of engineering practice, knowledge that has come to light through more than a decade of research by the author and his students studying engineers at work. Until now, this knowledge has been almost entirely unwritten, passed on invisibly from one generation of engineers to the next, what engineers refer to as “experience”. This is a book for all engineers. It distils the knowledge of many experts in one volume. The book will help engineers enjoy a more satisfying and rewarding career and provide more valuable results for their employers and clients. The book focuses on issues often seen as “non-technical” in the world of engineering, yet it shows how these issues are thoroughly technical. Engineering firms traditionally have sought expert advice on these aspects from management schools, often regarding these aspects of engineering practice as something to do with psychology or organisational behaviour. The results are normally disappointing because management schools and psychologists have limited insight and understanding of the technical dimensions in engineering work. Little if any of the material in this book can be obtained from management texts or courses. Management schools have avoided the technical dimension of workplace practices and that is precisely what characterises engineering practice. The technical dimension infuses almost every aspect of an engineer’s working day and cannot be avoided. That’s why this book is so necessary: there has not yet been any authoritative source or guidance to bridge the gap between inanimate technical issues and organisational behaviour. This book fills this gap in our knowledge, is based on rigorous research, and yet is written in a style which is accessible for a wide audience.",Technology & Engineering,614,N/A,0,en

Reflections,Alan Slavich,Page Publishing Inc,2022-11-29,"Reflections of a Businessman is a look at business effectiveness from an employee's perspective versus the teachings in a traditional business school. There are many successful businesses in the world today, and there are also many unsuccessful businesses in the world today. What are the things that separate the successful business from the unsuccessful business? Obviously there is more than one answer to that question, but employee participation and contribution can greatly affect the performance of the business. First of all, a business must be profitable to stay in business, and the economic structure of the company must be sound if the business is to succeed. Part of the economic structure of the company is the cost of producing the product and the cost of selling the product. The efficiency of the operations within the company has a dynamic effect on these costs. A large part of the productivity of an organization is affected by the employee's attitude and performance on the job, and these postures can be affected dramatically by a supervisor. This book analyzes and views the effectiveness of management on the productivity of the workforce. Over fifty-five years in the business world provided the experience of a wide variety of supervisory styles within three different companies and provided insight into the effectiveness of the various management styles. This book is a look at the various management styles that one person observed after all those years in the business world and documents what was learned from each experience. This experience was then analyzed and was used to develop a profile of what constitutes a successful business model. The model was then used to create a high involvement organization with resultant world-class credentials.",Business & Economics,108,N/A,0,en

Remove. Replace. Restart,Christian Greiser,BoD – Books on Demand,2023-09-28,"Have you ever had the feeling that you're treading water professionally; that you're coming up against limits in terms of what you can achieve? If so, says Christian Greiser, it might be high time to take some time out. Careers progress through distinct phases: we climb the career ladder, we change direction or set up a business and, eventually, we retire. As different as these phases are, so too are the rules of success that govern them. If we are to keep succeeding, we must mentally 'shift gears' and realign ourselves accordingly along the way. We must take an honest and sometimes challenging look at our own character: understanding the inner driving forces behind our previous successes, questioning our patterns of behaviour and discarding the behaviours that no longer serve us. In this way, we can accomplish the transition to the next phase of our life and career and come back stronger than before. Passionate 'career technician' Christian Greiser is here to help us do just that. In this humorously written new book, he draws on insights from his many years of experience as an executive coach and incorporates research findings, case studies and exercises to show how we can reset our mental attitude and achieve success and fulfilment in the next phase.",Business & Economics,217,N/A,0,en

Somatic Embryogenesis and Synthetic Seed I,Professor Dr. Y. P. S. Bajaj,Springer Science & Business Media,1995-05-16,"While working in the laboratory of Professor Dr. Jacob Reinert at the Freie Universitat Berlin (1974-1976), I had the opportunity to become deeply involved in studying the intricacies of the fascinating phenomenon of somatic embryogenesis in plant cells and protoplasts. In numerous stimu lating discussions with Professor Reinert on this subject, I was fully convinced that somatic embryogenesis would become one of the most important areas of study, not only regarding basic and fundamental aspects, but also for its application in crop improvement. During the last decade, we have witnessed tremendous interest and achievements in the use of somatic embryos for the production of synthetic seeds, for micro propagation, genetic transformation, cryopreservation, and conservation of germplasm. The en masse production of somatic embryos in the bioreactors has facilitated some of these studies. Somatic embryos have now been induced in more than 300 plant species belonging to a wide range offamilies. It was therefore felt that a compilation ofliterature/state of the art on this subject was necessary. Thus, two volumes on Somatic Embryo genesis and Synthetic Seed have been compiled, which contain 65 chapters contributed by International experts. Somatic Embryogenesis and Synthetic Seed I comprises 31 chapters, arranged in 3 sections: Section I Commitment of the cell to somatic embryogenesis; early events; anatomy; molecular basis; gene expression; role of polyamines; machine vision analysis of somatic embryos. Section II Applications of somatic embryos; technology of synthetic seed; fluid drilling; micropropagation; genetic transfor mation through somatic embryos; cryopreservation.",Technology & Engineering,504,1,1,en
New Developments in Pathways Towards Diversity and Inclusion in STEM: A United States Perspective,"Alexander Gates, Juan Gilbert, Chris Botanga, Kim Nguyen, Bonita London",Frontiers Media SA,2022-10-17,"The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program of the US National Science Foundation has been a primary force for raising the success and graduation of minority students in STEM for 30 years. Increasing the number of underrepresented students earning baccalaureate degrees, and entering graduate school in STEM is the goal of LSAMP. This goal has been nearly achieved through the formation of alliances of degree granting institutions of higher learning, varying from community colleges to major research institutions. Currently there are 59 alliances including more than 400 institutions. LSAMP is responsible for more than 650,000 bachelor’s degrees earned by minority students in STEM. The papers for this Research Topic should focus on the use of LSAMP activities, programs and collaborations to develop pathways to success and graduation of STEM majors from minority groups that underrepresented in STEM. These pathways can include any segment from pre-college through graduate school. Areas of special interest include mentoring, research experiences, transitions between levels and novel approaches for retention. The studies should be research based and rigorous. They can be pure research studies, curriculum and design or literature reviews but they must be at a cutting edge level and be subject to detailed review and assessment.",Education,273,N/A,0,en

Somatic Hybridization in Crop Improvement I,Y. P. S. Bajaj,Springer Science & Business Media,1994-11-04,"Fantasies and dreams have their rightful place in science, and sometimes they turn into reality. Regeneration of hybrid plants through protoplast fusion is one such dream come true. In the early 1970s I shared the pioneering excitement in the field of protoplast technology at the Second International Congress of Plant Tissue Culture held in Strasbourg, France. Subsequently, I participated in three international conferences devoted to plant protoplasts, in Salamanca, Spain (1972), Versailles, France (1972), and Nottingham, England (1975). At Versailles Dr. P.S. Carlson presented his work on the successful regeneration of somatic hybrids between Nicotiana glauca and Nicotiana langsdorfii. The enthusi- asm shown by the participants was sufficient indication of the bright future of somatic hybridization. On my return from Versailles, I gathered my thoughts and prepared a concept paper on Potentials of Protoplast Culture Work in Agriculture which was published in Euphytica (Bajaj 1974). The studies on protoplast fusion and somatic hybridization then gained momentum and active work started in many laboratories. Very significant work was done by Melchers et al. (1978) who obtained a somatic hybrid between potato and tomato, calling it ""Pomato"".",Technology & Engineering,564,N/A,0,en

Minority Student Retention,Alan Seidman,Routledge,2019-05-23,"Student retention continues to be a vexing problem for all colleges and universities. In spite of the money spent on creating programs and services to help retain students until they achieve their academic and personal goals, and graduate, the figures have not improved over time. This is particularly true for minority students, who have a greater attrition rate than majority students. Demographic information shows that the minority population in the United States is growing at a faster rate than the majority. It is imperative that educational institutions find ways to help improve retention rates for all students but particularly minority students. Retention rates should not differ appreciably among different racial/ethnic groups.""The Journal of College Student Retention: Research, Theory and Practice"" is the only scholarly, peer-reviewed journal devoted solely to college student retention. It has published many articles on minority student retention, and this topic continues to garner much attention. This book is a compilation of the very best of these articles, selected on the basis of reviews by a cadre of experts in the education field. The articles discuss African American, Latino/Latina, Asian and Asian Pacific, Native American, and biracial students, and institutional commitments to retaining a diverse student population. For those interested in this vital area, the collection will teach and inspire them to achieve greater heights and pay additional attention to retaining minority students in our colleges and universities.",Psychology,218,N/A,0,en

The Future of Engineering,"Albrecht Fritzsche, Sascha Julian Oks",Springer,2018-07-02,"In a world permeated by digital technology, engineering is involved in every aspect of human life. Engineers address a wider range of design problems than ever before, raising new questions and challenges regarding their work, as boundaries between engineering, management, politics, education and art disappear in the face of comprehensive socio-technical systems. It is therefore necessary to review our understanding of engineering practice, expertise and responsibility. This book advances the idea that the future of engineering will not be driven by a static view of a closed discipline, but rather will result from a continuous dialogue between different stakeholders involved in the design and application of technical artefacts. Based on papers presented at the 2016 conference of the forum for Philosophy, Engineering and Technology (fPET) in Nuremberg, Germany, the book features contributions by philosophers, engineers and managers from academia and industry, who discuss current and upcoming issues in engineering from a wide variety of different perspectives. They cover topics such as problem solving strategies and value-sensitive design, experimentation and simulation, engineering knowledge and education, interdisciplinary collaboration, sustainability, risk and privacy. The different contributions in combination draw a comprehensive picture of efforts worldwide to come to terms with engineering, its foundations in philosophy, the ethical problems it causes, and its effect on the ongoing development of society.",Philosophy,300,N/A,0,en

The System Concept and Its Application to Engineering,Erik W. Aslaksen,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-09-07,"Systems engineering is a mandatory approach in some industries, and is gaining wider acceptance for complex projects in general. However, under the imperative of delivering these projects on time and within budget, the focus has been mainly on the management aspects, with less attention to improving the core engineering activity – design. This book addresses the application of the system concept to design in several ways: by developing a deeper understanding of the system concept, by defining design and its characteristics within the process of engineering, and by applying the system concept to the early stage of design, where it has the greatest impact. A central theme of the book is that the purpose of engineering is to be useful in meeting the needs of society, and that therefore the ultimate measure of the benefit of applying the system concept should be the extent to which it advances the achievement of that purpose. Consequently, any consistent, top-down development of the functionality required of a solution to the problem of meeting a defined need must proceed from such a measure, and it is agued that a generalised form of Return on Investment is an appropriate measure. A theoretical framework for the development of functionality based on this measure and utilising the system concept is presented, together with some examples and practical guidelines.",Technology & Engineering,267,N/A,0,en
Effective Inquiry for Innovative Engineering Design,Ozgur Eris,Springer Science & Business Media,2004-01-31,"Effective Inquiry for Innovative Engineering Design presents empirical evidence for this claim. It demonstrates a unique attribute of design thinking by identifying and characterizing a class of questions called ""Generative Design Questions"". These questions are frequently asked by designers in dialog. Their use constitutes a fundamental cognitive mechanism in design thinking. Their discovery stems from another finding of the work: a conceptual duality between questions and decisions that is engraved deep within the design process. This duality challenges a view that treats designing as decision making. Decisions form the tip of the iceberg; Questions keep it afloat: Can an effective decision making process be performed without having high quality information? Can high quality information be acquired and generated without performing an effective inquiry process? The answer to both questions is no, and underscores the importance of our quest to better understand the role of inquiry in design.",Business & Economics,170,N/A,0,en

Information Management for Engineering Design,Randy H. Katz,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Computer-aided design syst,ems have become a big business. Advances in technology have made it commercially feasible to place a powerful engineering workstation on every designer's desk. A major selling point for these workstations is the computer aided design software they provide, rather than the actual hardware. The trade magazines are full of advertisements promising full menu design systems, complete with an integrated database (preferably ""relational""). What does it all mean? This book focuses on the critical issues of managing the information about a large design project. While undeniably one of the most important areas of CAD, it is also one of the least understood. Merely glueing a database system to a set of existing tools is not a solution. Several additional system components must be built to create a true design management system. These are described in this book. The book has been written from the viewpoint of how and when to apply database technology to the problems encountered by builders of computer-aided design systems. Design systems provide an excellent environment for discovering how far we can generalize the existing database concepts for non-commercial applications. This has emerged as a major new challenge for database system research. We have attem pted to avoid a ""database egocentric"" view by pointing out where existing database technology is inappropriate for design systems, at least given the current state of the database art.

Reformers have sought to achieve either greater government accountability through majoritarian arrangements or wider parliamentary diversity through proportional formula. Underlying the normative debates are important claims about the impact and consequences of electoral reform for political representation and voting behavior. The study compares and evaluates two broad schools of thought, each offering contracting expectations. One popular approach claims that formal rules define electoral incentives facing parties, politicians and citizens. By changing these rules, rational choice institutionalism claims that we have the capacity to shape political behavior. Alternative cultural modernization theories differ in their emphasis on the primary motors driving human behavior, their expectations about the pace of change, and also their assumptions about the ability of formal institutional rules to alter, rather than adapt to, deeply embedded and habitual social norms and patterns of human behavior.",Political Science,384,5,1,en

Hire Honesty,Bill McConnell,Archway Publishing,2016-11-04,"If you want good employees, you need to know which quality makes them good. What makes some workers show up on time, perform admirably, work enthusiastically, get along with coworkers, and make conscientious decisions? That supreme quality is honesty, and its the character equivalent of the good-worker gene. In Hire Honesty, author Bill McConnell explains how good-worker genes affect the productivity, compatibility, and profitability of your business. Then he provides details and specific methods for screening, selecting, and managing employees so they will become and remain productive and contented in their jobs. He describes the tools needed for effective interviewing and hiring and he shows employers how to use them. Employers will learn about: honesty as the foundation of exceptional job performance; good-worker genes; managed conversations; all-about-you interviews; and trust as the principle motivator for honest workers. McConnell, who spent twenty-eight years as CEO of Patusan Trading Company, a wholesaler and importer of oriental rugs, and five years as general manager of Triple Creek Ranch, named the worlds top-ranked luxury hotel in 2014, developed and implemented the techniques of Hire Honesty in settings as diverse as remote Himalayan villages and elite American resorts.

Early Engineering Learning,"Lyn English, Tamara Moore",Springer,2018-06-15,"This book addresses engineering learning in early childhood, spanning ages 3 to 8 years. It explores why engineering experiences are important in young children's overall development and how engineering is a core component of early STEM learning, including how engineering education links and supports children's existing experiences in science, mathematics, and design and technology, both before school and in the early school years. Promoting STEM education across the school years is a key goal of many nations, with the realization that building STEM skills required by societies takes time and needs to begin as early as possible. Despite calls from national and international organisations, the inclusion of engineering-based learning within elementary and primary school programs remains limited in many countries. Engineering experiences for young children in the pre-school or early school years has received almost no attention, even though young children can be considered natural engineers. This book addresses this void by exposing what we know about engineering for young learners, including their capabilities for solving engineering-based problems and the (few) existing programs that are capitalising on their potential.",Education,287,N/A,0,en

An Introduction to the Philosophy of Engineering,Bocong Li,N/A,2021,"This book is the first academic work on the philosophy of engineering in China that reflects two decades of research. It puts forward a new thesis, namely that the core maxim in the philosophy of engineering is ""I create, therefore I am,"" which is radically different from the Cartesian maxim: ""I think, therefore I am."" In addition, the book offers the first detailed portrait of the roots and evolution of the philosophy of engineering in China. The book begins by discussing the triptych thesis of science, technology and engineering, which argues that there are a number of important distinctions between the three, e.g. scientific activities are chiefly based on discovery, while technological activities center on invention, and engineering activities focus on creation. Considering the latest developments in the philosophy of engineering, the author also analyzes engineering communities, engineering practice and a micro-meso-macro framework. In subsequent chapters, the author separately analyzes the three stages of engineering activities: planning, operating and using artifacts. In the closing chapter, two views on the philosophy of engineering (as a new subdiscipline of philosophy and as a philosophy in its own right) are briefly explained.",,0,N/A,0,en

Centering Humanism in STEM Education,"Bryan Dewsbury, Susannah McGowan, Sheila S.

This poses problems particularly when science permeates every aspect of contemporary American life. Institutions’ repeated failures to disrupt systemic oppression in STEM has led to a mostly white, cisgender, and male scientific workforce replete with implicit and/or explicit biases. Education holds one pathway to disrupt systemic linkages of STEM oppression from society to the classroom. Maintaining views on science as inherently objective isolates it from the world in which it is performed. STEM education must move beyond the transactional approaches to transformative environments manifesting respect for students’ social and educational capital. We must create a STEM environment in which students with marginalized identities feel respected, listened to, and valued. We must assist students in understanding how their positionality, privilege, and power both historically and currently impacts their meaning making and understanding of STEM.",Education,337,N/A,0,en

"Smart Stimuli-responsive Biomaterials for Programmed Drug Delivery, 2nd edition","Seyed Morteza Naghib, Ali Maleki, Yasser Zare ,  Kyong Rhee",Frontiers Media SA,2024-08-29,"Most drugs are toxic to cells that often kill healthy cells and establish several side effects. Conventional chemotherapy cargoes are not tumor-specific and commonly their nature leads to significant toxic effects on healthy tissues. Therefore, several drug delivery systems (DDSs) were developed to amend the therapeutic properties of drugs and made them safer and more effective. Local drug delivery which decreases systemic drug exposure, is an important approach for maximal efficacy, high levels of patient compliance, and fewer side effects. Smart drug delivery systems (SDDSs) have gained much attention and paved the way for more effective treatment of patients. SDDSs with stimuli-responsive characteristics are determined as the process that the payloads are not released before reaching the target site. This triggered release occurs due to the variations in the nano/microcarrier chemistry and structure, in response to endogenous and/or exogenous stimulus, establishing the release of the cargoes to the exact place. Responsive and smart materials/biomaterials are responsive/sensitive to signals originating from physiological systems, or to abnormalities originating from pathological defects, that can interact with or be triggered by the biological environments, and are interesting in drug delivery platforms/devices for developing next-generation accurate medicines. In exogenous-triggered delivery, drug/gene release is controlled by external stimulus, which can be controlled exactly. Different exogenous triggers have been reported, such as light, magnetic field, temperature, electrical field, and ultrasound. The endogenous triggers such as pH, redox, enzyme concentration, and bio-molecules are related to the disease's pathological characteristics. Disease pathological characteristics are key parameters as physiological triggers for designing programmed delivery devices that may be used for the non-invasive and effective treatment of a wide range of pathological conditions such as cancer, infections, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune disorders, stroke, and chronic wounds, and degenerative diseases. Endogenously triggered drug release is the same as exogenously triggered drug release, which can lead to enhanced release of therapeutic molecules at the target place in its therapeutic concentration, reducing local toxicity and side effects, reducing the need for repeat administrations, and increasing patient compliance. Here, we focused on smart endogenous and exogenous stimuli-responsive biomaterials for programmed drug delivery. The conventional drug delivery systems are not without any limitations and challenges. One of the most important challenges is related to their degradability or insufficient biocompatibility of most materials which are used in smart delivery system. Another challenge is related to the using of 2D in vitro models or in vivo animal studies to evaluate the performance of these systems, and there is a poor relation between such results and human clinical trials. Thus, these incompatibilities can lead to the failing of the numerous smart systems in clinical studies. In this special issue, we focus on smart multi-responsive drug delivery systems that can address some challenges and drawbacks. Research paper, commutation (letter), mini-review and review are acceptable for publications in this special issue. Main topics: 1- Smart exogenous-triggered delivery systems 2- Smart endogenous-triggered delivery systems 3- Multi-responsive targeted vehicles 4- Stimuli-responsive niosomes and liposomes 5- Multifunctional biomaterials for cancer treatment 6- Smart 3D and 4D scaffolds for localized delivery systems",Science,131,N/A,0,en

In recent years, the development of multifunctional nanomaterials has provided a new diagnosis and treatment platform to combat cancer. Polymer-inorganic nanomaterials with novel structures such as bowl-shaped/Janus/core-shell have drawn much attention owing to their diversity in composition or asymmetry in structure. More importantly, imparting unique optical, electrical, and magnetic properties to these nanocomposites can further extend their function repertoire. However, to fulfill this vision, fundamental understandings regarding strategies of precise synthesis, mechanisms of structure formation, in vivo synergistic effects in bioapplications, and biosafety of these materials are needed. Besides, nanomaterials with novel structures are well positioned for imaging-guided cancer theranostic. On one hand, nanomaterials themselves are suitable for imaging because of their intrinsic properties such as fluorescent or magnetic properties. On the other hand, nanomaterials can serve as functional platforms that integrate various therapeutic modalities including photothermal therapy, chemodynamic/ion-interference therapy, photodynamic therapy, and cuproptosis to efficiently kill cancer cells. This Research Topic aims at collecting works about synthesis, and biomedical applications of polymer/mesoporous inorganic nanomaterials, especially in the aspect of novel synthetic approaches for fabricating nanomaterials with unique structures. Additionally, we hope that in-depth research articles on this topic can provide insights into the mechanism of nanomaterials acting in cancer diagnosis and therapy. These include the mechanisms of customized drug load/release and synergistic effects in theranostics of these materials. Meanwhile, elucidations of key proteins’ roles in cancer development are also anticipated. Lastly, we hope that this topic can brew new ideas for the adaption of nanomaterials as platforms that allow for multimodal therapeutic modalities. The current Research Topic centers on the design, precise synthesis, and biomedical applications of nanomaterials.

Research in Novel Materials,Rafiqul Islam,Nova Science Publishers,2013,"The most important first premise in science is that mass can be neither created nor destroyed. It is also becoming clear that natural laws dictate that mass be connected to energy. In effect, mass-balance provides the only governing equation that is both necessary and sufficient. Clearly, this compels a paradigm shift in scientific study. If a process is engineered in violation of natural principles of material production, the balance will be irreversibly disturbed, and the outcome of such a violated process both unpredictable and harmful to future generations. The post-Renaissance mode of technology development is based on an analogous corollary principle of mass production. This is an approach characterised by an excessive focus on quantity to the detriment of establishing or upholding definitive criteria as to quality. In order to make mass-produced materials acceptable to the consumer, non-scientific means have been used to cover up true properties of both materials and energy. As a result, today technologies ranging from photovoltaic electricity to genetically-modified crop production to mass-produced pharmaceutical products are considered to be in harmony with nature.On the other hand, herbal medicine is dismissed as quackery and direct solar energy usage as pseudo-science. Nobel Laureates, such as the prize-winning chemist Robert Curl, have not shied from pronouncing this development mode a technological disaster.",Materials,0,N/A,0,en

Principles of Tissue Engineering,"Robert Lanza, Robert Langer, Joseph P. Vacanti",Elsevier,2000-05-16,"The opportunity that tissue engineering provides for medicine is extraordinary. In the United States alone, over half-a-trillion dollars are spent each year to care for patients who suffer from tissue loss or dysfunction. Although numerous books and reviews have been written on tissue engineering, none has been as comprehensive in its defining of the field. Principles of Tissue Engineering combines in one volume the prerequisites for a general understanding of tissue growth and development, the tools and theoretical information needed to design tissues and organs, as well as a presentation of applications of tissue engineering to diseases affecting specific organ systems. The first edition of the book, published in 1997, is the definite reference in the field. Since that time, however, the discipline has grown tremendously, and few experts would have been able to predict the explosion in our knowledge of gene expression, cell growth and differentiation, the variety of stem cells, new polymers and materials that are now available, or even the successful introduction of the first tissue-engineered products into the marketplace. There was a need for a new edition, and this need has been met with a product that defines and captures the sense of excitement, understanding and anticipation that has followed from the evolution of this fascinating and important field.Key Features* Provides vast, detailed analysis of research on all of the major systems of the human body, e.g., skin, muscle, cardiovascular, hematopoietic, and nerves* Essential to anyone working in the field* Educates and directs both the novice and advanced researcher* Provides vast, detailed analysis of research with all of the major systems of the human body, e.g. skin, muscle, cardiovascular, hematopoietic, and nerves* Has new chapters written by leaders in the latest areas of research, such as fetal tissue engineering and the universal cell* Considered the definitive reference in the field* List of contributors reads like a ""who's who"" of tissue engineering, and includes Robert Langer, Joseph Vacanti, Charles Vacanti, Robert Nerem, A.

"Novel Engineering, K-8","Elissa Milto, Merredith Portsmore, Jessica Watkins, Mary McCormick, Morgan Hynes",National Science Teachers Association,2020,"""Picture your students designing a hearing aid for the main character in El Deafo-and then disguising it as a fashion accessory. Or imagine them helping the shipwrecked Swiss Family Robinson build a structure to keep them cool under the hot sun. Novel Engineering shows how your students can use anything from a picture book to a novel to a historical text as the basis for an engineering design challenge. This innovative resource will have your students pulling information from literature to identify a problem. Then, using details from the story, they'll apply the engineering design process to develop functional solutions for their ""clients""-the book's characters. Novel Engineering provides you with plenty of practical guidance for integrating engineering and English language arts (ELA), including a thorough introduction to the concept and detailed implementation advice. But the book comes to life through five in-depth case studies featuring the use of novels, a biography, and a nonfiction historical text. In addition to demonstrating Novel Engineering projects in the classroom, the case studies let you practice thinking about what your own students' work could look like and how you would respond. You'll see that this approach doesn't require books outside your existing ELA or social studies curriculum or a specific building-materials kit. You'll also see that Novel Engineering can help you engage students in a powerful new way. As the authors write, ""We have been encouraged by the excitement that students and teachers have shown for their work during Novel Engineering units. ... Students have taken ownership of their learning and are able to navigate the steps of the engineering design process, creating functional solutions to problems they have identified in texts.""""--",Science,0,N/A,0,en

This book is intended for the undergraduate novice who is being introduced to software requirements engineering. It is a hard subject for which there is no formulaic approach and for which it is sometimes difficult to motivate students who are unaware of the problems involved and therefore the need to study the subject. It therefore begins with small, relatively simple, case studies and builds on these to provide the opportunities to scale up this expertise to large industrial projects. The book will be in three parts: the first provides a guide to all the important requirements engineering toppics; the second gives more detail on useful techniques (for problem definition and modelling); the third contain the complete case studies, extracts from which are used in parts one and two. Requirements Engineering is a jargon-filled subject, so a comprehensive glossary is provided as well as definitions within the text.",Computers,430,N/A,0,en

Teaching K-12 Science and Engineering During a Crisis,"National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Board on Science Education, Jennifer Self",National Academies Press,2020-12-29,"The COVID-19 pandemic is resulting in widespread and ongoing changes to how the K-12 education system functions, including disruptions to science teaching and learning environments. Students and teachers are all figuring out how to do schooling differently, and districts and states are working overtime to reimagine systems and processes. This is difficult and stressful work in the middle of the already stressful and sometimes traumatic backdrop of the global pandemic. In addition, students with disabilities, students of color, immigrants, English learners, and students from under-resourced communities have been disproportionately affected, both by the pandemic itself and by the resulting instructional shifts. Teaching K-12 Science and Engineering During a Crisis aims to describe what high quality science and engineering education can look like in a time of great uncertainty and to support practitioners as they work toward their goals. This book includes guidance for science and engineering practitioners - with an emphasis on the needs of district science supervisors, curriculum leads, and instructional coaches. Teaching K-12 Science and Engineering During a Crisis will help K-12 science and engineering teachers adapt learning experiences as needed to support students and their families dealing with ongoing changes to instructional and home environments and at the same time provide high quality in those experiences.",Education,135,N/A,0,en
Standards for K-12 Engineering Education?,"National Research Council, Committee on Standards for K-12 Engineering Education",National Academies Press,2010-10-28,"The goal of this study was to assess the value and feasibility of developing and implementing content standards for engineering education at the K-12 level. Content standards have been developed for three disciplines in STEM education-science, technology, and mathematic-but not for engineering. To date, a small but growing number of K-12 students are being exposed to engineering-related materials, and limited but intriguing evidence suggests that engineering education can stimulate interest and improve learning in mathematics and science as well as improve understanding of engineering and technology. Given this background, a reasonable question is whether standards would improve the quality and increase the amount of teaching and learning of engineering in K-12 education. The book concludes that, although it is theoretically possible to develop standards for K-12 engineering education, it would be extremely difficult to ensure their usefulness and effective implementation. This conclusion is supported by the following findings: (1) there is relatively limited experience with K-12 engineering education in U.S. elementary and secondary schools, (2) there is not at present a critical mass of teachers qualified to deliver engineering instruction, (3) evidence regarding the impact of standards-based educational reforms on student learning in other subjects, such as mathematics and science, is inconclusive, and (4) there are significant barriers to introducing stand-alone standards for an entirely new content area in a curriculum already burdened with learning goals in more established domains of study.",Education,160,N/A,0,en

Successful K-12 STEM Education,"National Research Council, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Board on Testing and Assessment, Board on Science Education, Committee on Highly Successful Schools or Programs for K-12 STEM Education",National Academies Press,2011-06-22,"Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are cultural achievements that reflect our humanity, power our economy, and constitute fundamental aspects of our lives as citizens, consumers, parents, and members of the workforce. Providing all students with access to quality education in the STEM disciplines is important to our nation's competitiveness. However, it is challenging to identify the most successful schools and approaches in the STEM disciplines because success is defined in many ways and can occur in many different types of schools and settings. In addition, it is difficult to determine whether the success of a school's students is caused by actions the school takes or simply related to the population of students in the school. Successful K-12 STEM Education defines a framework for understanding ""success"" in K-12 STEM education. The book focuses its analysis on the science and mathematics parts of STEM and outlines criteria for identifying effective STEM schools and programs. Because a school's success should be defined by and measured relative to its goals, the book identifies three important goals that share certain elements, including learning STEM content and practices, developing positive dispositions toward STEM, and preparing students to be lifelong learners. A successful STEM program would increase the number of students who ultimately pursue advanced degrees and careers in STEM fields, enhance the STEM-capable workforce, and boost STEM literacy for all students. It is also critical to broaden the participation of women and minorities in STEM fields. Successful K-12 STEM Education examines the vast landscape of K-12 STEM education by considering different school models, highlighting research on effective STEM education practices, and identifying some conditions that promote and limit school- and student-level success in STEM. The book also looks at where further work is needed to develop appropriate data sources. The book will serve as a guide to policy makers; decision makers at the school and district levels; local, state, and federal government agencies; curriculum developers; educators; and parent and education advocacy groups.",Education,44,N/A,0,en

Story Engineering,Larry Brooks,Penguin,2011-01-27,"What makes a good story or a screenplay great? The vast majority of writers begin the storytelling process with only a partial understanding where to begin. Some labor their entire lives without ever learning that successful stories are as dependent upon good engineering as they are artistry. But the truth is, unless you are master of the form, function and criteria of successful storytelling, sitting down and pounding out a first draft without planning is an ineffective way to begin. Story Engineering starts with the criteria and the architecture of storytelling, the engineering and design of a story--and uses it as the basis for narrative. The greatest potential of any story is found in the way six specific aspects of storytelling combine and empower each other on the page. When rendered artfully, they become a sum in excess of their parts. You'll learn to wrap your head around the big pictures of storytelling at a professional level through a new approach that shows how to combine these six core competencies which include: • Four elemental competencies of concept, character, theme, and story structure (plot) • Two executional competencies of scene construction and writing voice The true magic of storytelling happens when these six core competencies work together in perfect harmony.

Handbook of Research on Transforming Teachers’ Online Pedagogical Reasoning for Engaging K-12 Students in Virtual Learning,"Niess, Margaret L., Gillow-Wiles, Henry",IGI Global,2021-06-25,"The COVID-19 pandemic drastically transformed the classroom by keeping students and teachers apart for the sake of safety. As schools emptied, remote learning rapidly expanded through online services and video chatrooms. Unfortunately, this disrupted many students and teachers who were not accustomed to remote classrooms. This challenge has forced K-12 teachers to think differently about teaching. Unexpectedly and with little time to prepare, they have been confronted with redesigning their curriculum and instruction from face-to-face to online virtual classrooms to protect students from the COVID-19 virus while ensuring that these new online initiatives remain sustainable and useful in the post-pandemic world. As teachers learn to take advantage of the affordances and strengths of the multiple technologies available for virtual classroom instruction, their instruction both in online and face-to-face will impact what and how students learn in the 21st century. The Handbook of Research on Transforming Teachers’ Online Pedagogical Reasoning for Engaging K-12 Students in Virtual Learning examines the best practices and pedagogical reasoning for designing online strategies that work for K-12 virtual learning. The initial section provides foundational pedagogical ideas for constructing engaging virtual learning environments that leverage the unique strengths and opportunities while avoiding the weaknesses and threats of the online world. The following chapters present instructional strategies for multiple grade levels and content areas: best practices that work, clearly describing why they work, and the teachers’ pedagogical reasoning that supports online implementations. The chapters provide ways to think about teaching in virtual environments that can be used to guide instructional strategy choices and recognizes the fundamental differences between face-to-face and virtual environments as an essential design component. Covering such topics as K-12 classrooms, pedagogical reasoning, and virtual learning, this text is perfect for professors, teachers, students, educational designers and developers, instructional technology faculty, distance learning faculty, and researchers interested in the subject.",Education,664,N/A,0,en

Advances on bond in concrete,FIB – International Federation for Structural Concrete,FIB - International Federation for Structural Concrete,2022-12-01,"Structural behavior of reinforced concrete elements strongly depends on the interaction between the reinforcing bars and the surrounding concrete, which is generally referred as “bond in concrete”. In service conditions, the reinforcement-to-concrete bond governs deformability through the tension stiffening of concrete surrounding the bar as well the crack development and crack width. At Ultimate Limit State, bond governs anchorage and lap splices behavior as well as structural ductility. When plain (smooth) bars were used, the steel-to-concrete bond was mainly associated with “chemical adhesion/friction” that is related to the surface roughness of the rebar. As steel strengths increased the need to enhance interaction between steel and the surrounding concrete was recognized, and square twisted rebars, indented rebars or, later on, ribbed rebars came into the market, the latter being the type of deformed bar most commonly adopted since the 1960/70s. When ribbed rebars became widely used, several research studies started worldwide for better understanding the interaction between ribs and the surrounding concrete. Researchers evidenced the development of micro-cracks (due to the wedge action of the ribs) towards the external face of the structural element. If confinement is provided by the concrete cover, by transverse reinforcement or by an external transverse pressure, the full-anchorage capacity is guaranteed and a pull-out failure occurs, with crushing of concrete between the ribs. On the contrary, with lesser confining action, a splitting failure of bond occurs; the latter may provoke a brittle failure of the lap splice or, in some cases, of anchorages. However, after many years of research studies on bond-related topics, there are still several open issues. In fact, new materials entered into the market, as concrete with recycled aggregates or fibre reinforced concrete; the latter, having a kind of distributed reinforcement into the matrix (the fibres), provides a better confinement to the wedge action of the ribs. In addition, concrete and steel strength continuously increased over the years, causing changes in the bond behavior due to differences in mechanical properties of materials but also to the different concrete composition at the interface with the steel rebar causing a different bond behavior. Moreover, the lower water/cement ratio of these high-strength concrete makes the bleeding phenomena less evident, changing the concrete porosity in the upper layers of the structural element and thus making the current casting position parameters no-longer reliable. Finally, concrete with recycled aggregates are becoming more important in a market that is looking forward to a circular economy. As such, all the experimental results and database that allowed the calibration of bond rules now present in building codes for conventional concrete, may be not be representative of these new types of materials nowadays adopted in practice. Furthermore, after more than 50 years of service life, structural elements may not satisfy the current safety requirements for several reasons, including material degradation (with particular reference to steel corrosion) or increased loads, by also considering the seismic actions that were non considered by building codes at the time of the original design. The structural assessment of existing structures requires proper conceptual models and new approaches for evaluating the reliability of existing structures by also considering the remaining expected service life. In addition, specific rules for older materials, as plain smooth bars, should be revised for a better assessment of old structures. Last, but not least, interventions in existing structures may require new technologies now available such as post-installed rebars. While many advances have been achieved, there remain areas where a better understanding of bond and its mechanisms are required, and where further work is required to incorporate this understanding into safe and economic rules to guide construction and maintenance of existing infrastructures. These aspects were widely discussed within the technical community, particularly in the fib Task Group 2.5 and in the ACI 408 Committee dealing with bond and anchorage issues. Furthermore, special opportunities for discussing bond developments were represented by the International Conferences on ‘Bond in Concrete’ held each decade since 1982 as well as by joint workshops organized by fib TG2.5 and ACI 408. Within this technical collaboration, this Bulletin was conceived, and, thus, it collects selected papers presented at the joint fib-ACI Convention Session on Bond in Concrete held in Detroit (USA) in 2017. The bulletin is based on four main Sections concerning: - General aspects of bond - Anchorages and laps of bars and prestressing tendons - Bond under severe conditions - Degradation of bond for corrosion - Bond in new types of concrete The main aim of the Bulletin is to shed some new lights on the advances in understanding and application of bond related issues achieved over the last few years, and identify the challenges and priorities to be addressed in the next years. Another important aspect of the bulletin is to provide practical information from research findings.",Technology & Engineering,326,N/A,0,en

E - Learning Modules,Dan Ryan,AuthorHouse,2012-06-20,"The term e-Learning is a neologism for CSCL systems that came about during the emergence of website e-learning modules. From an e-learning perspective, conventional e-learning systems were then based on instructional packets, which were delivered to students using assignments. Assignments were evaluated by the instructor. In contrast, the new e-learning places increased emphasis on social learning and use of social software such as blogs, wikis, podcasts and virtual worlds such as Second Life. This phenomenon has also been referred to as Long Tail Learning . E-learning by contrast to e-learning systems not based on CSCL, assumes that knowledge (as meaning and understanding) is socially constructed. Learning takes place through conversations about content and grounded interaction about problems and actions. Advocates of social learning claim that one of the best ways to learn something is to teach it to others. However, it should be noted that many early online courses, such as those developed by Murray Turoff and Starr Roxanne Hiltz in the 1970s and 80s at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, courses at the University of Guelph in Canada, the British Open University, and the online distance courses at the University of British Columbia (where Web CT, now incorporated into Blackboard Inc. was first developed), have always made heavy use of online discussion between students. Also, from the start, practitioners such as Harasim in 1995, have put heavy emphasis on the use of learning networks for knowledge construction, long before the term e-learning, let alone CSCL, was even considered. There is also an increased use of virtual classrooms (online presentations delivered live) as an online learning platform and classroom for a diverse set of education providers such as Minnesota State Colleges and Universities and Sachem, MN, School District. In addition to virtual classroom environments, social networks have become an important part of e-learning. Social networks have been used to foster online learning communities around subjects as diverse as test preparation and language education. Mobile Assisted Language Learning (MALL) is a term used to describe using handheld computers or cell phones to assist in language learning. Some feel, however, that schools have not caught up with the social networking trends. Few traditional educators promote social networking unless they are communicating with their own colleagues. DLR Associates consulting group first became interested in e-learning modules at the annual Distance Learning Conference held at the University of Maine. I decided to offer e-learning services, since we were already evolved with computer-assisted education techniques. DLR Associates had been involved with CAE since computers were first used in engineering education. It was our hope a trend could be started towards blended learning services, where computer-based activities were integrated with practical or classroom-based situations.

Chemical and Bioprocess Engineering,"Ricardo Simpson, Sudhir K. Sastry",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-12-04,"The goal of this textbook is to provide first-year engineering students with a firm grounding in the fundamentals of chemical and bioprocess engineering. However, instead of being a general overview of the two topics, Fundamentals of Chemical and Bioprocess Engineering will identify and focus on specific areas in which attaining a solid competency is desired. This strategy is the direct result of studies showing that broad-based courses at the freshman level often leave students grappling with a lot of material, which results in a low rate of retention. Specifically, strong emphasis will be placed on the topic of material balances, with the intent that students exiting a course based upon this textbook will be significantly higher on Bloom’s Taxonomy (knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis and synthesis, evaluation, creation) relating to material balances.

Fundamentals of Food Process Engineering,Romeo T. Toledo,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Ten years after the publication of the first edition of Fundamentals of Food Process Engineering, there have been significant changes in both food science education and the food industry itself. Students now in the food science curric ulum are generally better prepared mathematically than their counterparts two decades ago. The food science curriculum in most schools in the United States has split into science and business options, with students in the science option following the Institute of Food Technologists' minimum requirements. The minimum requirements include the food engineering course, thus students en rolled in food engineering are generally better than average, and can be chal lenged with more rigor in the course material. The food industry itself has changed. Traditionally, the food industry has been primarily involved in the canning and freezing of agricultural commodi ties, and a company's operations generally remain within a single commodity. Now, the industry is becoming more diversified, with many companies involved in operations involving more than one type of commodity. A number of for mulated food products are now made where the commodity connection becomes obscure. The ability to solve problems is a valued asset in a technologist, and often, solving problems involves nothing more than applying principles learned in other areas to the problem at hand. A principle that may have been commonly used with one commodity may also be applied to another commodity to produce unique products.",Technology & Engineering,615,N/A,0,en

Structural Engineering and Geomechanics - Volume 1,Sashi K. Kunnath,EOLSS Publications,2020-06-22,"An understanding of dynamic effects on structures is critical to minimize losses from earthquakes and other hazards. These three books provide an overview of essential topics in structural and geotechnical engineering with an additional focus on related topics in earthquake engineering to enable readers gain such an understanding. One of the ultimate objectives of these books is to provide readers with insights into seismic analysis and design. However, in order to accomplish that objective, background material on structural and geotechnical engineering is necessary. Hence the first two sections of the book provide this background material followed by selected topics in earthquake engineering. The material is organized into three major parts. The first section covers topics in structural engineering. Beginning with fundamental mechanics of materials, the book includes chapters on linear and nonlinear analysis as well as topics on modeling of structures from different perspectives. In addition to traditional design of structural systems, introductions to important concepts in structural reliability and structural stability are discussed. Also covered are subjects of recent interest, viz., blast and impact effects on structures as well as the use of fiber reinforced polymer composites in structural applications. Given the growing interest in urban renewal, an interesting chapter on restoration of historic cities is also included. The second part of the book covers topics in geotechnical engineering, covering both shallow and deep foundations and issues and procedures for geotechnical modeling.

Long-Range Dependence and Sea Level Forecasting,"Ali Ercan, M. Levent Kavvas, Rovshan K. Abbasov",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-08-30,"​This study shows that the Caspian Sea level time series possess long range dependence even after removing linear trends, based on analyses of the Hurst statistic, the sample autocorrelation functions, and the periodogram of the series. Forecasting performance of ARMA, ARIMA, ARFIMA and Trend Line-ARFIMA (TL-ARFIMA) combination models are investigated. The forecast confidence bands and the forecast updating methodology, provided for ARIMA models in the literature, are modified for the ARFIMA models. Sample autocorrelation functions are utilized to estimate the differencing lengths of the ARFIMA models. The confidence bands of the forecasts are estimated using the probability densities of the residuals without assuming a known distribution. There are no long-term sea level records for the region of Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysia’s Sabah-Sarawak northern region of Borneo Island. In such cases the Global Climate Model (GCM) projections for the 21st century can be downscaled to the Malaysia region by means of regression techniques, utilizing the short records of satellite altimeters in this region against the GCM projections during a mutual observation period. This book will be useful for engineers and researchers working in the areas of applied statistics, climate change, sea level change, time series analysis, applied earth sciences, and nonlinear dynamics.",Mathematics,54,N/A,0,en

A Framework for K-12 Science Education,"National Research Council, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Board on Science Education, Committee on a Conceptual Framework for New K-12 Science Education Standards",National Academies Press,2012-03-28,"Science, engineering, and technology permeate nearly every facet of modern life and hold the key to solving many of humanity's most pressing current and future challenges. The United States' position in the global economy is declining, in part because U.S. workers lack fundamental knowledge in these fields. To address the critical issues of U.S. competitiveness and to better prepare the workforce, A Framework for K-12 Science Education proposes a new approach to K-12 science education that will capture students' interest and provide them with the necessary foundational knowledge in the field. A Framework for K-12 Science Education outlines a broad set of expectations for students in science and engineering in grades K-12. These expectations will inform the development of new standards for K-12 science education and, subsequently, revisions to curriculum, instruction, assessment, and professional development for educators. This book identifies three dimensions that convey the core ideas and practices around which science and engineering education in these grades should be built. These three dimensions are: crosscutting concepts that unify the study of science through their common application across science and engineering; scientific and engineering practices; and disciplinary core ideas in the physical sciences, life sciences, and earth and space sciences and for engineering, technology, and the applications of science. The overarching goal is for all high school graduates to have sufficient knowledge of science and engineering to engage in public discussions on science-related issues, be careful consumers of scientific and technical information, and enter the careers of their choice. A Framework for K-12 Science Education is the first step in a process that can inform state-level decisions and achieve a research-grounded basis for improving science instruction and learning across the country. The book will guide standards developers, teachers, curriculum designers, assessment developers, state and district science administrators, and educators who teach science in informal environments.",Education,400,N/A,0,en

English Learners in STEM Subjects,"National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Board on Children, Youth, and Families, Board on Science Education, Committee on Supporting English Learners in STEM Subjects",National Academies Press,2019-01-28,"The imperative that all students, including English learners (ELs), achieve high academic standards and have opportunities to participate in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning has become even more urgent and complex given shifts in science and mathematics standards. As a group, these students are underrepresented in STEM fields in college and in the workforce at a time when the demand for workers and professionals in STEM fields is unmet and increasing. However, English learners bring a wealth of resources to STEM learning, including knowledge and interest in STEM-related content that is born out of their experiences in their homes and communities, home languages, variation in discourse practices, and, in some cases, experiences with schooling in other countries. English Learners in STEM Subjects: Transforming Classrooms, Schools, and Lives examines the research on ELs' learning, teaching, and assessment in STEM subjects and provides guidance on how to improve learning outcomes in STEM for these students.

Successful K-12 STEM Education,"National Research Council, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Board on Testing and Assessment, Board on Science Education, Committee on Highly Successful Schools or Programs for K-12 STEM Education",National Academies Press,2011-07-22,"Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are cultural achievements that reflect our humanity, power our economy, and constitute fundamental aspects of our lives as citizens, consumers, parents, and members of the workforce. Providing all students with access to quality education in the STEM disciplines is important to our nation's competitiveness. However, it is challenging to identify the most successful schools and approaches in the STEM disciplines because success is defined in many ways and can occur in many different types of schools and settings. In addition, it is difficult to determine whether the success of a school's students is caused by actions the school takes or simply related to the population of students in the school. Successful K-12 STEM Education defines a framework for understanding ""success"" in K-12 STEM education. The book focuses its analysis on the science and mathematics parts of STEM and outlines criteria for identifying effective STEM schools and programs. Because a school's success should be defined by and measured relative to its goals, the book identifies three important goals that share certain elements, including learning STEM content and practices, developing positive dispositions toward STEM, and preparing students to be lifelong learners. A successful STEM program would increase the number of students who ultimately pursue advanced degrees and careers in STEM fields, enhance the STEM-capable workforce, and boost STEM literacy for all students. It is also critical to broaden the participation of women and minorities in STEM fields. Successful K-12 STEM Education examines the vast landscape of K-12 STEM education by considering different school models, highlighting research on effective STEM education practices, and identifying some conditions that promote and limit school- and student-level success in STEM. The book also looks at where further work is needed to develop appropriate data sources. The book will serve as a guide to policy makers; decision makers at the school and district levels; local, state, and federal government agencies; curriculum developers; educators; and parent and education advocacy groups.",Education,44,N/A,0,en

Multiphase Microfluidics: The Diffuse Interface Model,Roberto Mauri,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-05-31,"Diffuse interface (D.I.) model for muliphase flows.- Phase separation of viscous ternary liquid mixtures.- Dewetting and decomposing films of simple and complex liquids.- Phase-field models. Multiphase flows are typically described assuming that the different phases are separated by a sharp interface, with appropriate boundary conditions. This approach breaks down whenever the lengthscale of the phenomenon that is being studied is comparable with the real interface thickness, as it happens, for example, in the coalescence and breakup of bubbles and drops, the wetting and dewetting of solid surfaces and, in general, im micro-devices. The diffuse interface model resolves these problems by assuming that all quantities can vary continuously, so that interfaces have a non-zero thickness, i.e. they are ""diffuse"". The contributions in this book review the theory and describe some relevant applications of the diffuse interface model for one-component, two-phase fluids and for liquid binary mixtures, to model multiphase flows in confined geometries.",Science,181,N/A,0,en

Benchmarks for Science Literacy,American Association for the Advancement of Science,Oxford University Press,1994-01-06,"Published to glowing praise in 1990, Science for All Americans defined the science-literate American--describing the knowledge, skills, and attitudes all students should retain from their learning experience--and offered a series of recommendations for reforming our system of education in science, mathematics, and technology. Benchmarks for Science Literacy takes this one step further. Created in close consultation with a cross-section of American teachers, administrators, and scientists, Benchmarks elaborates on the recommendations to provide guidelines for what all students should know and be able to do in science, mathematics, and technology by the end of grades 2, 5, 8, and 12. These grade levels offer reasonable checkpoints for student progress toward science literacy, but do not suggest a rigid formula for teaching. Benchmarks is not a proposed curriculum, nor is it a plan for one: it is a tool educators can use as they design curricula that fit their student's needs and meet the goals first outlined in Science for All Americans. Far from pressing for a single educational program, Project 2061 advocates a reform strategy that will lead to more curriculum diversity than is common today. IBenchmarks emerged from the work of six diverse school-district teams who were asked to rethink the K-12 curriculum and outline alternative ways of achieving science literacy for all students. These teams based their work on published research and the continuing advice of prominent educators, as well as their own teaching experience. Focusing on the understanding and interconnection of key concepts rather than rote memorization of terms and isolated facts, Benchmarks advocates building a lasting understanding of science and related fields. In a culture increasingly pervaded by science, mathematics, and technology, science literacy require habits of mind that will enable citizens to understand the world around them, make some sense of new technologies as they emerge and grow, and deal sensibly with problems that involve evidence, numbers, patterns, logical arguments, and technology--as well as the relationship of these disciplines to the arts, humanities, and vocational sciences--making science literacy relevant to all students, regardless of their career paths. If Americans are to participate in a world shaped by modern science and mathematics, a world where technological know-how will offer the keys to economic and political stability in the twenty-first century, education in these areas must become one of the nation's highest priorities. Together with Science for All Americans, Benchmarks for Science Literacy offers a bold new agenda for the future of science education in this country, one that is certain to prepare our children for life in the twenty-first century.",Education,443,4,1,en
Technically Speaking,"National Research Council, National Academy of Engineering, Committee on Technological Literacy",National Academies Press,2002-04-13,"Cell phones . . . airbags . . . genetically modified food . . . the Internet. These are all emblems of modern life. You might ask what we would do without them. But an even more interesting question might be what would we do if we had to actually explain how they worked? The United States is riding a whirlwind of technological change. To be sure, there have been periods, such as the late 1800s, when new inventions appeared in society at a comparable rate. But the pace of change today, and its social, economic, and other impacts, are as significant and far reaching as at any other time in history. And it seems that the faster we embrace new technologies, the less we're able to understand them. What is the long-term effect of this galloping technological revolution? In today's new world, it is nothing less than a matter of responsible citizenship to grasp the nature and implications of technology. Technically Speaking provides a blueprint for bringing us all up to speed on the role of technology in our society, including understanding such distinctions as technology versus science and technological literacy versus technical competence. It clearly and decisively explains what it means to be a technologically-literate citizen. The book goes on to explore the context of technological literacyâ€""the social, historical, political, and educational environments. This readable overview highlights specific issues of concern: the state of technological studies in K-12 schools, the reach of the Internet into our homes and lives, and the crucial role of technology in today's economy and workforce. Three case studies of current issuesâ€""car airbags, genetically modified foods, and the California energy crisisâ€""illustrate why ordinary citizens need to understand technology to make responsible decisions. This fascinating book from the National Academy of Engineering is enjoyable to read and filled with contemporary examples. It will be important to anyone interested in understanding how the world around them works.",Medical,171,N/A,0,en

Engineering Systems,"Olivier L. De Weck, Daniel Roos, Christopher L. Magee",MIT Press,2011-10-21,"An overview of engineering systems that describes the new challenges posed for twenty-first-century engineers by today's highly complex sociotechnical systems. Engineering, for much of the twentieth century, was mainly about artifacts and inventions. Now, it's increasingly about complex systems. As the airplane taxis to the gate, you access the Internet and check email with your PDA, linking the communication and transportation systems. At home, you recharge your plug-in hybrid vehicle, linking transportation to the electricity grid. Today's large-scale, highly complex sociotechnical systems converge, interact, and depend on each other in ways engineers of old could barely have imagined. As scale, scope, and complexity increase, engineers consider technical and social issues together in a highly integrated way as they design flexible, adaptable, robust systems that can be easily modified and reconfigured to satisfy changing requirements and new technological opportunities. Engineering Systems offers a comprehensive examination of such systems and the associated emerging field of study. Through scholarly discussion, concrete examples, and history, the authors consider the engineer's changing role, new ways to model and analyze these systems, the impacts on engineering education, and the future challenges of meeting human needs through the technologically enabled systems of today and tomorrow.",Science,231,N/A,0,en

The New Technocracy,"Esmark, Anders",Bristol University Press,2020-04-08,"Setting a new benchmark for studies of technocracy, this book shows that a solution to the challenge of populism will depend as much on a technocratic retreat as democratic innovation. Esmark examines the development since the 1980s of a new 'post-industrial' technocratic regime and its complicity in the populist backlash against politics and political elites that is visible today. The new technocracy – a combination of network governance, risk management and performance management – has, the author argues, abandoned the overtly anti-democratic sentiments of its industrial predecessor and proclaimed a new partnership with democracy. The rise of populism, however, is a clear sign that the inherent problems of this partnership have been exposed and that technocracy posing as democracy will only serve to exacerbate existing problems.",Political Science,300,N/A,0,en

So soll u. a. die Energieeffizienz in dem Maße gesteigert werden, dass bis zum Jahr 2050 nur noch die Hälfte des Primärenergieverbrauchs im Vergleich zum Jahr 2008 benötigt wird. In Deutschland leben rund 75 % der Menschen in Städten. Daher sind Städte und Agglomerationen besondere Lebens-, Wirtschafts- und Kulturräume. Als solche verlangen sie nach einem zukunftsfähigen Energiesystem und müssen in hohem Maße energieeffizient ausgestaltet sein. Besonders relevant für die Steigerung der Energieeffizienz ist der Gebäudesektor: In den Wohn- und Nichtwohngebäuden bundesweit entstehen rund 35 % des Endenergieverbrauchs, etwa drei Viertel davon in Form von Wärme. Die von der Bundesregierung beschlossene Energiewende, also der Umbau der deutschen Energieversorgung auf Basis hoher Effizienz und mit weitgehender Nutzung erneuerbarer Energien, kann deshalb nur gelingen, wenn diese Wende nicht nur im Strom-, sondern auch im Wärmemarkt umgesetzt wird (sogenannte ""Wärmewende""). Mit Blick auf das energie- und klimapolitische Ziel eines nahezu klimaneutralen Gebäudebestands bis zum Jahr 2050 sind neben einer gesteigerten Energieeffizienz die erneuerbaren Energien in weit größerem Maße in den Wärmesektor zu integrieren.

Engineering Systems,"Olivier L. De Weck, Daniel Roos, Christopher L. Magee",MIT Press,2011,"An overview of engineering systems that describes the new challenges posed for twenty-first-century engineers by today's highly complex sociotechnical systems. Engineering, for much of the twentieth century, was mainly about artifacts and inventions. Now, it's increasingly about complex systems. As the airplane taxis to the gate, you access the Internet and check email with your PDA, linking the communication and transportation systems. At home, you recharge your plug-in hybrid vehicle, linking transportation to the electricity grid. Today's large-scale, highly complex sociotechnical systems converge, interact, and depend on each other in ways engineers of old could barely have imagined. As scale, scope, and complexity increase, engineers consider technical and social issues together in a highly integrated way as they design flexible, adaptable, robust systems that can be easily modified and reconfigured to satisfy changing requirements and new technological opportunities. Engineering Systems offers a comprehensive examination of such systems and the associated emerging field of study. Through scholarly discussion, concrete examples, and history, the authors consider the engineer's changing role, new ways to model and analyze these systems, the impacts on engineering education, and the future challenges of meeting human needs through the technologically enabled systems of today and tomorrow.",Science,231,N/A,0,en

Gardner: L Gardner and Sons Ltd,Graham Edge,Old Pond Publishing,2019-10,"This book by historical transport expert Graham Edge is a comprehensive study of a Manchester company whose name became revered in over forty countries. It traces the story from the origins of the firm in 1868 until it ceased engine production almost 130 years later. In 1929 L Gardner and Sons Ltd perfected a small high-speed, direct injection diesel engine, the world's first for an engine of its size. The company soon developed this into the first purpose-built automotive engine of its type. This renowned Gardner LW series was also revolutionary in its use of lightweight aluminium alloys. Because diesel fuel was more economical than petroleum spirit for most of the last century, and especially in the 1930s, Gardner's was able to capitalise on a huge and growing market. Their diesel engines went on to gain an unrivalled reputation for reliability and economy in buses, coaches, lorries, rail, shipping and industrial installations. Their heyday was probably from the end of the Second World War to the early 1960s, a time when their order book was always full. As well as telling the story of the company's engineering achievements (and setbacks), the author also brings to life some of the personalities involved, not least the members of the Gardner family. Although they were 'engineers par excellence', some of the 'could be quite irascible ' By the 1970s Gardners were being left behind by changes in the transport market and also faced damaging industrial relations. In 1977 they became part of the Hawker Siddeley group. This is a reprint of a book first published in 2002 and revised in 2006. Graham Edge was able to draw on knowledge freely provided by former sales director Dion Houghton. The superb photographs are mainly from the archives of Dion Houghton and Paul Gardner, the great-grandson of the founder.

With Six Sigma, we are solving problems and improving processes using as a basis one of the most powerful tools of human development: the scientific method. For the analysis of data, Six Sigma requires the use of statistical software, being R an Open Source option that fulfills this requirement. R is a software system that includes a programming language widely used in academic and research departments. Nowadays, it is becoming a real alternative within corporate environments. The aim of this book is to show how R can be used as the software tool in the development of Six Sigma projects. The book includes a gentle introduction to Six Sigma and a variety of examples showing how to use R within real situations. It has been conceived as a self contained piece.

"Principles of Marketing Engineering, 2nd Edition","Gary L. Lilien, Arvind Rangaswamy, Arnaud De Bruyn",DecisionPro,2013,"The 21st century business environment demands more analysis and rigor in marketing decision making. Increasingly, marketing decision making resembles design engineering-putting together concepts, data, analyses, and simulations to learn about the marketplace and to design effective marketing plans. While many view traditional marketing as art and some view it as science, the new marketing increasingly looks like engineering (that is, combining art and science to solve specific problems). Marketing Engineering is the systematic approach to harness data and knowledge to drive effective marketing decision making and implementation through a technology-enabled and model-supported decision process. (For more information on Excel-based models that support these concepts, visit DecisionPro.biz.) We have designed this book primarily for the business school student or marketing manager, who, with minimal background and technical training, must understand and employ the basic tools and models associated with Marketing Engineering. We offer an accessible overview of the most widely used marketing engineering concepts and tools and show how they drive the collection of the right data and information to perform the right analyses to make better marketing plans, better product designs, and better marketing decisions. What's New In the 2nd Edition While much has changed in the nearly five years since the first edition of Principles of Marketing Engineering was published, much has remained the same. Hence, we have not changed the basic structure or contents of the book. We have, however Updated the examples and references. Added new content on customer lifetime value and customer valuation methods. Added several new pricing models. Added new material on ""reverse perceptual mapping"" to describe some exciting enhancements to our Marketing Engineering for Excel software.

Thermodynamics: Basic Principles and Engineering Applications,Alan M. Whitman,Springer Nature,2019-12-04,"This textbook is for a one semester introductory course in thermodynamics, primarily for use in a mechanical or aerospace engineering program, although it could also be used in an engineering science curriculum. The book contains a section on the geometry of curves and surfaces, in order to review those parts of calculus that are needed in thermodynamics for interpolation and in discussing thermodynamic equations of state of simple substances. It presents the First Law of Thermodynamics as an equation for the time rate of change of system energy, the same way that Newton’s Law of Motion, an equation for the time rate of change of system momentum, is presented in Dynamics. Moreover, this emphasis illustrates the importance of the equation to the study of heat transfer and fluid mechanics. New thermodynamic properties, such as internal energy and entropy, are introduced with a motivating discussion rather than by abstract postulation, and connection is made with kinetic theory. Thermodynamic properties of the vaporizable liquids needed for the solution of practical thermodynamic problems (e.g. water and various refrigerants) are presented in a unique tabular format that is both simple to understand and easy to use. All theoretical discussions throughout the book are accompanied by worked examples illustrating their use in practical devices. These examples of the solution of various kinds of thermodynamic problems are all structured in exactly the same way in order to make, as a result of the repetitions, the solution of new problems easier for students to follow, and ultimately, to produce themselves. Many additional problems are provided, half of them with answers, for students to do on their own.",Science,328,N/A,0,en

Misconceiving Merit,"Mary Blair-Loy, Erin A. Cech",University of Chicago Press,2022-06-16,"An incisive study showing how cultural ideas of merit in academic science produce unfair and unequal outcomes. In Misconceiving Merit, sociologists Mary Blair-Loy and Erin A. Cech uncover the cultural foundations of a paradox. On one hand, academic science, engineering, and math revere meritocracy, a system that recognizes and rewards those with the greatest talent and dedication. At the same time, women and some racial and sexual minorities remain underrepresented and often feel unwelcome and devalued in STEM. How can academic science, which so highly values meritocracy and objectivity, produce these unequal outcomes? Blair-Loy and Cech studied more than five hundred STEM professors at a top research university to reveal how unequal and unfair outcomes can emerge alongside commitments to objectivity and excellence. The authors find that academic STEM harbors dominant cultural beliefs that not only perpetuate the mistreatment of scientists from underrepresented groups but hinder innovation. Underrepresented groups are often seen as less fully embodying merit compared to equally productive white and Asian heterosexual men, and the negative consequences of this misjudgment persist regardless of professors’ actual academic productivity. Misconceiving Merit is filled with insights for higher education administrators working toward greater equity as well as for scientists and engineers striving to change entrenched patterns of inequality in STEM.",Education,259,N/A,0,en

Global Engineering Project Management,M. Kemal Atesmen,CRC Press,2008-04-15,"Imagine the dynamics of an international engineering project such as this one: a U.S. group designs, prototypes, and qualifies disk drive heads; wafers for the drive heads are manufactured in the U.S. and sent to Malaysia for subassembly; a South Korean firm assembles these components; the final product, a fully automated disk drive, is completed in Japan. In addition to the global complexities of the project, there are a host of issues in leading the project team spread across continents. Global Engineering Project Management aligns real-world experiences in managing global projects with practical project management principles. The author demonstrates how to anticipate issues, covering everything from start-up planning and supply management to cost containment, post-project evaluation and protecting intellectual property. He explores technologies, virtual teams, traditions, economics, politics, and legal issues in the context of international projects, as well as compares the differences with domestic projects. He also highlights the complications of international bidding, the extra time and effort needed for multi-national team formation and management, and often overlooked project closure tasks. As the world goes global, engineering projects increasingly involve multiple countries, each having unique politics, cultures, and standards that all add layers of complexity to project management. These variables multiply fast and consequently a project manager's responsibilities multiply faster. Examining these challenges from start to finish, the book provides practical advice on how to navigate the issues unique to global engineering project management.",Business & Economics,170,N/A,0,en

Introduction to Impact Engineering,M. Macaulay,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"We are all familiar with impact. Lesser impacts such as hammering a nail, cracking an egg or stubbing a toe are part of everyday life. More violent impacts such as those caused by car crashes or bullets are fortunately less common but are still well enough known to be taken for granted. Very violent impacts such as meteorites striking the earth are outside our personal experience but we are aware of them. Despite this, impacts remain mysterious. They occur too quickly for us to follow what is happening and the evidence they leave behind is often ambiguous. Over the last thirty years improvements in high speed instrumen tation and developments in computing have made them more comprehensible and an increasing amount of attention is being paid to the subject which is an area of expanding scientific and engineering research. A multi-disciplinary approach is not yet established and information is scattered in many places and expressed in a variety of jargons. In applied mathematics, impacts have provided interesting theoretical problems with elegant solutions but it has been difficult to check results experimentally. Impacts can change the behaviour of materials but similar changes can sometimes be produced in other ways and the underlying mechanisms are not clear. Empirical solutions to engineering problems have worked reasonably well but it is hard to know what to do if things go wrong.",Science,283,N/A,0,en

Oryx and Crake,Margaret Atwood,Vintage Canada,2010-07-27,"A stunning and provocative new novel by the internationally celebrated author of The Blind Assassin, winner of the Booker Prize. Margaret Atwood’s new novel is so utterly compelling, so prescient, so relevant, so terrifyingly-all-too-likely-to-be-true, that readers may find their view of the world forever changed after reading it. This is Margaret Atwood at the absolute peak of her powers. For readers of Oryx and Crake, nothing will ever look the same again. The narrator of Atwood's riveting novel calls himself Snowman. When the story opens, he is sleeping in a tree, wearing an old bedsheet, mourning the loss of his beloved Oryx and his best friend Crake, and slowly starving to death. He searches for supplies in a wasteland where insects proliferate and pigoons and wolvogs ravage the pleeblands, where ordinary people once lived, and the Compounds that sheltered the extraordinary. As he tries to piece together what has taken place, the narrative shifts to decades earlier. How did everything fall apart so quickly? Why is he left with nothing but his haunting memories? Alone except for the green-eyed Children of Crake, who think of him as a kind of monster, he explores the answers to these questions in the double journey he takes - into his own past, and back to Crake's high-tech bubble-dome, where the Paradice Project unfolded and the world came to grief. With breathtaking command of her shocking material, and with her customary sharp wit and dark humour, Atwood projects us into an outlandish yet wholly believable realm populated by characters who will continue to inhabit our dreams long after the last chapter.",Fiction,420,4.5,2,en

Introduction to the Foundations of Applied Mathematics,Mark H. Holmes,Springer Science & Business Media,2009-06-18,"FOAM. This acronym has been used for over ?fty years at Rensselaer to designate an upper-division course entitled, Foundations of Applied Ma- ematics. This course was started by George Handelman in 1956, when he came to Rensselaer from the Carnegie Institute of Technology. His objective was to closely integrate mathematical and physical reasoning, and in the p- cess enable students to obtain a qualitative understanding of the world we live in. FOAM was soon taken over by a young faculty member, Lee Segel. About this time a similar course, Introduction to Applied Mathematics, was introduced by Chia-Ch’iao Lin at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Together Lin and Segel, with help from Handelman, produced one of the landmark textbooks in applied mathematics, Mathematics Applied to - terministic Problems in the Natural Sciences. This was originally published in 1974, and republished in 1988 by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, in their Classics Series. This textbook comes from the author teaching FOAM over the last few years. In this sense, it is an updated version of the Lin and Segel textbook.",Mathematics,477,N/A,0,en

The power of the A3 report, however, derives not from the report itself, but rather from the development of the culture and mindset required for the implementation of the A3 system. In Understanding A3 Thinking, the authors first show that the A3 report is an effective tool when it is implemented in conjunction with a PDCA-based management philosophy. Toyota views A3 Reports as just one piece in their PDCA management approach. Second, the authors show that the process leading to the development and management of A3 reports is at least as important as the reports themselves, because of the deep learning and professional development that occurs in the process. And finally, the authors provide a number of examples as well as some very practical advice on how to write and review A3 reports.",Business & Economics,186,5,2,en

Blind Landings,Erik M. Conway,JHU Press,2006-11-04,"When darkness falls, storms rage, fog settles, or lights fail, pilots are forced to make ""instrument landings,"" relying on technology and training to guide them through typically the most dangerous part of any flight. In this original study, Erik M. Conway recounts one of the most important stories in aviation history: the evolution of aircraft landing aids that make landing safe and routine in almost all weather conditions. Discussing technologies such as the Loth leader-cable system, the American National Bureau of Standards system, and, its descendants, the Instrument Landing System, the MIT-Army-Sperry Gyroscope microwave blind landing system, and the MIT Radiation Lab's radar-based Ground Controlled Approach system, Conway interweaves technological change, training innovation, and pilots' experiences to examine the evolution of blind landing technologies. He shows how systems originally intended to produce routine, all-weather blind landings gradually developed into routine instrument-guided approaches. Even so, after two decades of development and experience, pilots still did not want to place the most critical phase of flight, the landing, entirely in technology's invisible hand. By the end of World War II, the very concept of landing blind therefore had disappeared from the trade literature, a victim of human limitations.",Technology & Engineering,268,N/A,0,en

Building Mobile Apps at Scale,Gergely Orosz,N/A,2021-04-06,"While there is a lot of appreciation for backend and distributed systems challenges, there tends to be less empathy for why mobile development is hard when done at scale. This book collects challenges engineers face when building iOS and Android apps at scale, and common ways to tackle these. By scale, we mean having numbers of users in the millions and being built by large engineering teams. For mobile engineers, this book is a blueprint for modern app engineering approaches. For non-mobile engineers and managers, it is a resource with which to build empathy and appreciation for the complexity of world-class mobile engineering. The book covers iOS and Android mobile app challenges on these dimensions: Challenges due to the unique nature of mobile applications compared to the web, and to the backend. App complexity challenges. How do you deal with increasingly complicated navigation patterns? What about non-deterministic event combinations? How do you localize across several languages, and how do you scale your automated and manual tests? Challenges due to large engineering teams. The larger the mobile team, the more challenging it becomes to ensure a consistent architecture. If your company builds multiple apps, how do you balance not rewriting everything from scratch while moving at a fast pace, over waiting on ""centralized"" teams? Cross-platform approaches. The tooling to build mobile apps keeps changing. New languages, frameworks, and approaches that all promise to address the pain points of mobile engineering keep appearing. But which approach should you choose? Flutter, React Native, Cordova? Native apps? Reuse business logic written in Kotlin, C#, C++ or other languages?

An Engineer Imagines,Peter Rice,Batsford Books,2024-03-14,"The long-awaited reissue of the autobiography of Peter Rice, one of the main structural engineers behind the Sydney Opera House, the Pompidou Centre, the Menil Collection and Lloyd's of London. 'I am an engineer. Often people will call me an 'architect engineer' as a compliment. It is meant to signify a quality of engineer who is more imaginative and design-orientated than a normal engineer... To call an engineer an 'architect engineer' because he comes up with unusual or original solutions is essentially to misunderstand the role of the engineer in society.' An Engineer Imagines is a rare look into the professional creativity and philosophy of Peter Rice, who was widely acclaimed as the greatest structural engineer of his generation. He was a man who, in Renzo Piano's words, could design structures 'like a pianist who can play with his eyes shut'. Working with many of the world's greatest architects on buildings that became icons of contemporary architecture, he brought a uniquely poetic feeling to his work. Joining Ove Arup & Partners in 1956, Rice had heard that 'it was a place where an oddball could fit in.' Taking on Arup's theory of Total Design to heart, Rice writes about the role of the engineer in society, and how he himself applied his creativity to various projects. He admits he became an engineer by accident, tentatively feeling his way through a career without a natural instinct. But as he takes you through each of his projects, one-by-one, you can trace his development from graduate to veteran. Written in clear and poetic language, Rice's autobiography is perfect for those who want to better understand postwar buildings, our concrete environment, or are budding students of engineering and architecture.",Architecture,469,N/A,0,en

Given the near incomprehensible enormity of the universe, it appears almost inevitable that humankind will one day find a planet that appears to be much like the Earth. This discovery will no doubt reignite the lure of interplanetary travel. Will we be up to the task? And, given our limited resources, biological constraints, and the general hostility of space, what shape should we expect such expeditions to take? In Robots in Space, Roger Launius and Howard McCurdy tackle these questions with rigorous scholarship and disciplined imagination, jumping comfortably among the worlds of rocketry, engineering, public policy, and science fantasy to expound upon the possibilities and improbabilities involved in trekking across the Milky Way and beyond. They survey the literature—fictional as well as academic studies—and outline the progress of space programs in the United States and other nations.

Principles of Financial Engineering,Salih N. Neftci,Academic Press,2008-12-09,"Principles of Financial Engineering, Second Edition, is a highly acclaimed text on the fast-paced and complex subject of financial engineering. This updated edition describes the ""engineering"" elements of financial engineering instead of the mathematics underlying it. It shows you how to use financial tools to accomplish a goal rather than describing the tools themselves. It lays emphasis on the engineering aspects of derivatives (how to create them) rather than their pricing (how they act) in relation to other instruments, the financial markets, and financial market practices. This volume explains ways to create financial tools and how the tools work together to achieve specific goals. Applications are illustrated using real-world examples. It presents three new chapters on financial engineering in topics ranging from commodity markets to financial engineering applications in hedge fund strategies, correlation swaps, structural models of default, capital structure arbitrage, contingent convertibles, and how to incorporate counterparty risk into derivatives pricing. Poised midway between intuition, actual events, and financial mathematics, this book can be used to solve problems in risk management, taxation, regulation, and above all, pricing. This latest edition of Principles of Financial Engineering is ideal for financial engineers, quantitative analysts in banks and investment houses, and other financial industry professionals. It is also highly recommended to graduate students in financial engineering and financial mathematics programs. - The Second Edition presents 5 new chapters on structured product engineering, credit markets and instruments, and principle protection techniques, among other topics - Additions, clarifications, and illustrations throughout the volume show these instruments at work instead of explaining how they should act - The Solutions Manual enhances the text by presenting additional cases and solutions to exercises",Mathematics,697,N/A,0,en

STEM in the Technopolis: The Power of STEM Education in Regional Technology Policy,"Cliff Zintgraff, Sang C. Suh, Bruce Kellison, Paul E. Resta",Springer Nature,2020-05-27,"This book addresses how forward-thinking local communities are integrating pre-college STEM education, STEM pedagogy, industry clusters, college programs, and local, state and national policies to improve educational experiences, drive local development, gain competitive advantage for the communities, and lead students to rewarding careers. This book consists of three sections: foundational principles, city/regional case studies from across the globe, and state and national context. The authors explore the hypothesis that when pre-college STEM education is integrated with city and regional development, regions can drive a virtuous cycle of education, economic development, and quality of life. Why should pre-college STEM education be included in regional technology policy? When local leaders talk about regional policy, they usually talk about how government, universities and industry should work together. This relationship is important, but what about the hundreds of millions of pre-college students, taught by tens of millions of teachers, supported by hundreds of thousands of volunteers, who deliver STEM education around the world? Leaders in the communities featured in STEM in the Technopolis have recognized the need to prepare students at an early age, and the power of real-world connections in the process. The authors advocate for this approach to be expanded. They describe how STEM pedagogy, priority industry clusters, cross-sector collaboration, and the local incarnations of global development challenges can be made to work together for the good of all citizens in local communities. This book will be of interest to government policymakers, school administrators, industry executives, and non-profit executives.

Reliability Modelling and Optimization of Warm Standby Systems,"Rui Peng, Qingqing Zhai, Jun Yang",Springer Nature,2021-05-02,"This book introduces the reliability modelling and optimization of warm standby systems. Warm standby is an attractive redundancy technique, as it consumes less energy than hot standby and switches into the active state faster than cold standby. Since a warm standby component experiences different failure rates in the standby state and active state, the reliability evaluation is challenging and the existing works are only restricted to very special cases. By adapting the decision diagrams, this book proposes the methodology to evaluate the reliability of different types of warm standby systems and studies the reliability optimization. Compared with existing works, the proposed methods allow the system to have an arbitrary number of components and allow the failure time distribution of components to observe arbitrary distributions. From this book, the readers can not only learn how to evaluate and optimize the reliability of warm standby systems but also use the methods to study the reliability of other complex systems.",Technology & Engineering,171,N/A,0,en

Knowledge in Risk Assessment and Management,"Terje Aven, Enrico Zio",John Wiley & Sons,2017-12-19,"Exciting new developments in risk assessment and management Risk assessment and management is fundamentally founded on the knowledge available on the system or process under consideration. While this may be self-evident to the laymen, thought leaders within the risk community have come to recognize and emphasize the need to explicitly incorporate knowledge (K) in a systematic, rigorous, and transparent framework for describing and modeling risk. Featuring contributions by an international team of researchers and respected practitioners in the field, this book explores the latest developments in the ongoing effort to use risk assessment as a means for characterizing knowledge and/or lack of knowledge about a system or process of interest. By offering a fresh perspective on risk assessment and management, the book represents a significant contribution to the development of a sturdier foundation for the practice of risk assessment and for risk-informed decision making. How should K be described and evaluated in risk assessment? How can it be reflected and taken into account in formulating risk management strategies? With the help of numerous case studies and real-world examples, this book answers these and other critical questions at the heart of modern risk assessment, while identifying many practical challenges associated with this explicit framework. This book, written by international scholars and leaders in the field, and edited to make coverage both conceptually advanced and highly accessible: Offers a systematic, rigorous and transparent perspective and framework on risk assessment and management, explicitly strengthening the links between knowledge and risk Clearly and concisely introduces the key risk concepts at the foundation of risk assessment and management Features numerous cases and real-world examples, many of which focused on various engineering applications across an array of industries Knowledge of Risk Assessment and Management is a must-read for risk assessment and management professionals, as well as graduate students, researchers and educators in the field.

Food Mixing,P. J. Cullen,John Wiley & Sons,2009-07-21,"The mixing of liquids, solids and gases is one of the most commonunit operations in the food industry. Mixing increases thehomogeneity of a system by reducing non-uniformity or gradients incomposition, properties or temperature. Secondary objectives ofmixing include control of rates of heat and mass transfer,reactions and structural changes. In food processing applications,additional mixing challenges include sanitary design, complexrheology, desire for continuous processing and the effects ofmixing on final product texture and sensory profiles. Mixing ensures delivery of a product with constant properties. Forexample, consumers expect all containers of soups, breakfastcereals, fruit mixes, etc to contain the same amount of eachingredient. If mixing fails to achieve the requiredproduct yield, quality, organoleptic or functional attributes,production costs may increase significantly. This volume brings together essential information on theprinciples and applications of mixing within food processing. Whilethere are a number of creditable references covering generalmixing, such publications tend to be aimed at the chemical industryand so topics specific to food applications are often neglected.Chapters address the underlying principles of mixing, equipmentdesign, novel monitoring techniques and the numerical techniquesavailable to advance the scientific understanding of food mixing.Food mixing applications are described in detail. The book will be useful for engineers and scientists who need tospecify and select mixing equipment for specific processingapplications and will assist with the identification and solving ofthe wide range of mixing problems that occur in the food,pharmaceutical and bioprocessing industries. It will also be ofinterest to those who teach, study and research food science andfood engineering.",Technology & Engineering,304,N/A,0,en

Handbook of STEM Faculty Development,"Sandra M. Linder, Cindy M. Lee, Shannon K Stefl, Karen A. High",IAP,2022-12-01,"Faculty in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines face intensifying pressures in the 21st century, including multiple roles as educator, researcher, and entrepreneur. In addition to continuously increasing teaching and service expectations, faculty are engaged in substantive research that requires securing external funding, mentoring other faculty and graduate students, and disseminating this work in a broad range of scholarly outlets. Societal needs of their expertise include discovery, innovation, and workforce development. It is critical to provide STEM faculty with the professional development to support their complex roles and to base this development on evidence derived from research. This edited handbook provides STEM stakeholders with an opportunity to share studies and/or experiences that explore STEM faculty development (FD) in higher education settings. More specifically, we include work that examines faculty development planning, techniques/models, experiences, and outcomes focused on supporting the teaching, research, service, and leadership responsibilities of STEM faculty. The Handbook is suited for researchers and practitioners in STEM, STEM Education, Mathematics, Science, Technology, and Engineering disciplines. It is also suited towards faculty developers, higher education administrators, funding agencies, industry leaders, and the STEM community at large. This handbook is organized around three constructs (INPUTS, MECHANISMS, and OUTPUTS). The STEM faculty development inputs construct focuses on topics related to the characteristics of faculty members and institutions that serve as barriers or supports to the adoption and implementation of holistic STEM faculty development programs. Questions addressed in the handbook around this topic include: What barriers/supports exist for STEM faculty? How are these barriers/supports being addressed through STEM FD? How do contexts (e.g., economic, political, historical) influence faculty/administrative needs related to STEM FD? How do demographics (e.g., gender, ethnicity, age, family background) influence faculty/administrative needs related to STEM FD? The STEM faculty development mechanisms construct focuses on topics related to the actual implementation of STEM faculty development and we consider the potential models or structures of STEM faculty development that are currently in place or conceptualized in theory. Questions addressed in the handbook around this topic include: What are the processes for developing models of STEM FD? What are effective models of STEM FD? How is effectiveness determined? What roles do stakeholders (e.g., faculty, administration, consultants) play within STEM FD mechanisms? The STEM faculty development outputs construct focuses on how to best understand the influence of STEM faculty development on outcomes such as productivity, teacher quality, and identity in relation to faculty development. Questions addressed in the handbook around this topic include: How has STEM FD influenced higher education practices and settings? What are appropriate output measures and how are they used in practice? What collaborations emerge from STEM FD? How does STEM FD affect other STEM stakeholders (e.g. students, administration, business, community)? The aim for this handbook was to examine the multifaceted demands of faculty roles, and together with members of the STEM education community, envision pathways through which universities and individuals may support STEM colleagues, regardless of their experience or rank, to enjoy long and satisfying careers. Our hope is for these chapters to aid readers in deep reflection on challenges faculty face, to contemplate adaptations of models presented, and to draw inspiration for creating or engaging in new professional development programs. Chapters across this handbook highlight a variety of institutional contexts from 2-year technical colleges, to teaching-focused institutions, in addition to research-centric settings. Some chapters focus primarily on teaching and learning practices and offer models for improving STEM instruction. Others focus on barriers that emerge for STEM faculty when trying to engage in development experiences. There are chapters that examine tenure structures in relation to faculty development and how STEM FD efforts could support research endeavors. Mentorship and leadership models are also addressed along with a focus on equity issues that permeate higher education and impact STEM FD. It is our sincere hope that this Handbook sparks increased discourse and continued explorations related to STEM FD, and in particular, the intentional focus of faculty development initiatives to extend to the many facets of academic life.",Education,416,N/A,0,en

Principles of Financial Engineering,"Robert Kosowski, Salih N. Neftci",Academic Press,2014-11-26,"Principles of Financial Engineering, Third Edition, is a highly acclaimed text on the fast-paced and complex subject of financial engineering. This updated edition describes the ""engineering"" elements of financial engineering instead of the mathematics underlying it. It shows how to use financial tools to accomplish a goal rather than describing the tools themselves. It lays emphasis on the engineering aspects of derivatives (how to create them) rather than their pricing (how they act) in relation to other instruments, the financial markets, and financial market practices. This volume explains ways to create financial tools and how the tools work together to achieve specific goals. Applications are illustrated using real-world examples. It presents three new chapters on financial engineering in topics ranging from commodity markets to financial engineering applications in hedge fund strategies, correlation swaps, structural models of default, capital structure arbitrage, contingent convertibles, and how to incorporate counterparty risk into derivatives pricing. Poised midway between intuition, actual events, and financial mathematics, this book can be used to solve problems in risk management, taxation, regulation, and above all, pricing. A solutions manual enhances the text by presenting additional cases and solutions to exercises. This latest edition of Principles of Financial Engineering is ideal for financial engineers, quantitative analysts in banks and investment houses, and other financial industry professionals. It is also highly recommended to graduate students in financial engineering and financial mathematics programs. - The Third Edition presents three new chapters on financial engineering in commodity markets, financial engineering applications in hedge fund strategies, correlation swaps, structural models of default, capital structure arbitrage, contingent convertibles and how to incorporate counterparty risk into derivatives pricing, among other topics - Additions, clarifications, and illustrations throughout the volume show these instruments at work instead of explaining how they should act - The solutions manual enhances the text by presenting additional cases and solutions to exercises",Business & Economics,893,N/A,0,en

Electrets In Engineering,"Vladimir N. Kestelman, Leonid S. Pinchuk, Victor A. Goldade",Springer Science & Business Media,2000-08-31,"Recently a new sphere in materials science· has formed which subject is structure and properties of electret materials used in engineering, medicine, biotechnology and other branches. It is characterized by specific methods of experimental investigations based on recording charge transfer, polarization and depolarization of dielectrics and involves original techniques and physico-mathematical aids where notions that exist at the interface of several natural and technical sciences are concentrated. It embraces a vast area of applications mainly in engineering, instrument making, electronics, medical technique, biotechnology, and etc., has a specialized technological base for electric polarization of dielectrics composed of uncommon technological methods, equipment and instrumentation. Apparently, future fundamental investigations in the domain of electret materials science are to be developed at the interface of computer of dielectrics. Elaboration of a simulation, physics and physical chemistry model for electric polarization of solid media with uneven charge density distribution, complicated by surface phenomena, outer electromagnetic, heat, chemical and other effects, presents a grave methodological problem. The simulation of structures in which polarization follows diffusion mechanism of chemically active molecules or their fragments, and the development of calculation methods for polarized charge relaxation and regularities of dielectric nonlinear properties, are the most urgent objectives of current research. Success in bioelectret effect studies is anticipated to result in profound widening of natural science knowledge.",Technology & Engineering,300,2,1,en

Countering Cyber Sabotage,"Andrew A. Bochman, Sarah Freeman",CRC Press,2021-01-20,"Countering Cyber Sabotage: Introducing Consequence-Driven, Cyber-Informed Engineering (CCE) introduces a new methodology to help critical infrastructure owners, operators and their security practitioners make demonstrable improvements in securing their most important functions and processes. Current best practice approaches to cyber defense struggle to stop targeted attackers from creating potentially catastrophic results. From a national security perspective, it is not just the damage to the military, the economy, or essential critical infrastructure companies that is a concern. It is the cumulative, downstream effects from potential regional blackouts, military mission kills, transportation stoppages, water delivery or treatment issues, and so on. CCE is a validation that engineering first principles can be applied to the most important cybersecurity challenges and in so doing, protect organizations in ways current approaches do not. The most pressing threat is cyber-enabled sabotage, and CCE begins with the assumption that well-resourced, adaptive adversaries are already in and have been for some time, undetected and perhaps undetectable. Chapter 1 recaps the current and near-future states of digital technologies in critical infrastructure and the implications of our near-total dependence on them. Chapters 2 and 3 describe the origins of the methodology and set the stage for the more in-depth examination that follows. Chapter 4 describes how to prepare for an engagement, and chapters 5-8 address each of the four phases. The CCE phase chapters take the reader on a more granular walkthrough of the methodology with examples from the field, phase objectives, and the steps to take in each phase. Concluding chapter 9 covers training options and looks towards a future where these concepts are scaled more broadly.",Political Science,240,N/A,0,en

The Next 500 Years,Christopher E. Mason,MIT Press,2021-04-20,"Introducing a 10-phase, 500-year vision for the future of space exploration, genetic engineering, and the human species—on Earth and on other planets. As the only species aware that life on Earth has an expiration date, we have a moral duty to land on, to live on, and to extend life to other planets. Inevitably, life on Earth will come to an end, whether by climate disaster, or by cataclysmic war—or when the sun runs out of fuel in a few billion years. To avoid extinction, will we have to find a new home planet, perhaps even a new solar system, to inhabit? In this provocative and fascinating book, Christopher Mason argues that we have a moral duty to do just that. Because we are the only species aware that life on Earth has an expiration date, we have a responsibility to act as the shepherd of lifeforms—not only for our species but for all species on which we depend and for those still to come (by accidental or designed evolution). Mason argues that the same capacity for ingenuity that has enabled us to build rockets and land on other planets can be applied to redesigning biology so that we can sustainably inhabit those planets. And he lays out a 500-year plan for undertaking the massively ambitious project of reengineering human genetics for life in other worlds.",Science,302,N/A,0,en

Discovering Design,"Richard Buchanan, Victor Margolin",University of Chicago Press,1995-04-15,"Discovering Design reflects the growing recognition that the design of the everyday world deserves attention not only as a professional practice but as a subject of social, cultural, and philosophic investigation. Victor Margolin, cofounder and an editor of the journal Design Issues, and Richard Buchanan, also an editor of the journal, bring together eleven essays by scholars in fields ranging from psychology, sociology, and political theory to technology studies, rhetoric, and philosophy. The essayists share the editors' concern, first made clear in Margolin's Design Discourse: History, Theory, Criticism, with the the development of design studies as a field of interdisciplinary research. The contributors (Gianfranco Zaccai, Albert Borgmann, Richard Buchanan, Augusto Morello, Tufan Orel, Nigel Cross, Victor Margolin, Langdon Winner, Carl Mitcham, Tony Fry, and Ezio Manzini) focus on three broad themes that form a sequence of fundamental issues: how to shape design as a subject matter, how to distinguish the activity of designing in the complex world of action, and how to address the basic questions of value and responsibility that persistently arise in the discussion and practice of design. The editors' introduction provides a useful overview of these questions and offers a multidisciplinary framework for design studies. The essays discuss such topics as the relation of aesthetics to technology, the place of design in social action, the role of the consumer in design decisions, and the need for ethical practice in contemporary design. Manzini's concluding essay shows how the issue of ethics should connect responsible behavior to decisions made every day in the manufacture of objects.",Art,282,5,1,en

Design Meets Disability,Graham Pullin,MIT Press,2011-09-30,"How design for disabled people and mainstream design could inspire, provoke, and radically change each other. Eyeglasses have been transformed from medical necessity to fashion accessory. This revolution has come about through embracing the design culture of the fashion industry. Why shouldn't design sensibilities also be applied to hearing aids, prosthetic limbs, and communication aids? In return, disability can provoke radical new directions in mainstream design. Charles and Ray Eames's iconic furniture was inspired by a molded plywood leg splint that they designed for injured and disabled servicemen. Designers today could be similarly inspired by disability. In Design Meets Disability, Graham Pullin shows us how design and disability can inspire each other. In the Eameses' work there was a healthy tension between cut-to-the-chase problem solving and more playful explorations. Pullin offers examples of how design can meet disability today. Why, he asks, shouldn't hearing aids be as fashionable as eyewear? What new forms of braille signage might proliferate if designers kept both sighted and visually impaired people in mind? Can simple designs avoid the need for complicated accessibility features? Can such emerging design methods as “experience prototyping” and “critical design” complement clinical trials? Pullin also presents a series of interviews with leading designers about specific disability design projects, including stepstools for people with restricted growth, prosthetic legs (and whether they can be both honest and beautifully designed), and text-to-speech technology with tone of voice. When design meets disability, the diversity of complementary, even contradictory, approaches can enrich each field.",Design,364,N/A,0,en

"Biomedical Engineering Principles, Second Edition","Arthur B. Ritter, Vikki Hazelwood, Antonio Valdevit, Alfred N. Ascione",CRC Press,2011-05-24,"Current demand in biomedical sciences emphasizes the understanding of basic mechanisms and problem solving rather than rigid empiricism and factual recall. Knowledge of the basic laws of mass and momentum transport as well as model development and validation, biomedical signal processing, biomechanics, and capstone design have indispensable roles in the engineering analysis of physiological processes. To this end, an introductory, multidisciplinary text is a must to provide the necessary foundation for beginning biomedical students. Assuming no more than a passing acquaintance with molecular biology, physiology, biochemistry, and signal processing, Biomedical Engineering Principles, Second Edition provides just such a solid, accessible grounding to this rapidly advancing field. Acknowledging the vast range of backgrounds and prior education from which the biomedical field draws, the organization of this book lends itself to a tailored course specific to the experience and interests of the student. Divided into four sections, the book begins with systems physiology, transport processes, cell physiology, and the cardiovascular system. Part I covers systems analysis, biological data, and modeling and simulation in experimental design, applying concepts of diffusion, and facilitated and active transport. Part II presents biomedical signal processing, reviewing frequency, periodic functions, and Fourier series as well as signal acquisition and processing techniques.

Desert Edens,Philipp Lehmann,Princeton University Press,2022-10-25,"How technological advances and colonial fears inspired utopian geoengineering projects during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries From the 1870s to the mid-twentieth century, European explorers, climatologists, colonial officials, and planners were avidly interested in large-scale projects that might actively alter the climate. Uncovering this history, Desert Edens looks at how arid environments and an increasing anxiety about climate in the colonial world shaped this upsurge in ideas about climate engineering. From notions about the transformation of deserts into forests to Nazi plans to influence the climates of war-torn areas, Philipp Lehmann puts the early climate change debate in its environmental, intellectual, and political context, and considers the ways this legacy reverberates in the present climate crisis. Lehmann examines some of the most ambitious climate-engineering projects to emerge in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Confronted with the Sahara in the 1870s, the French developed concepts for a flooding project that would lead to the creation of a man-made Sahara Sea. In the 1920s, German architect Herman Sörgel proposed damming the Mediterranean in order to geoengineer an Afro-European continent called “Atlantropa,” which would fit the needs of European settlers. Nazi designs were formulated to counteract the desertification of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Despite ideological and technical differences, these projects all incorporated and developed climate change theories and vocabulary. They also combined expressions of an extreme environmental pessimism with a powerful technological optimism that continue to shape the contemporary moment. Focusing on the intellectual roots, intended effects, and impact of early measures to modify the climate, Desert Edens investigates how the technological imagination can be inspired by pressing fears about the environment and civilization.",Business & Economics,256,N/A,0,en

Engineers for Change,Matthew Wisnioski,MIT Press,2012-10-19,"An account of conflicts within engineering in the 1960s that helped shape our dominant contemporary understanding of technological change as the driver of history. In the late 1960s an eclectic group of engineers joined the antiwar and civil rights activists of the time in agitating for change. The engineers were fighting to remake their profession, challenging their fellow engineers to embrace a more humane vision of technology. In Engineers for Change, Matthew Wisnioski offers an account of this conflict within engineering, linking it to deep-seated assumptions about technology and American life. The postwar period in America saw a near-utopian belief in technology's beneficence. Beginning in the mid-1960s, however, society—influenced by the antitechnology writings of such thinkers as Jacques Ellul and Lewis Mumford—began to view technology in a more negative light. Engineers themselves were seen as conformist organization men propping up the military-industrial complex. A dissident minority of engineers offered critiques of their profession that appropriated concepts from technology's critics. These dissidents were criticized in turn by conservatives who regarded them as countercultural Luddites. And yet, as Wisnioski shows, the radical minority spurred the professional elite to promote a new understanding of technology as a rapidly accelerating force that our institutions are ill-equipped to handle. The negative consequences of technology spring from its very nature—and not from engineering's failures. “Sociotechnologists” were recruited to help society adjust to its technology. Wisnioski argues that in responding to the challenges posed by critics within their profession, engineers in the 1960s helped shape our dominant contemporary understanding of technological change as the driver of history.",Technology & Engineering,305,N/A,0,en
Arthur Morgan,Aaron D. Purcell,Univ. of Tennessee Press,2014-11-28,"On May 19, 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt announced the appointment of Arthur Morgan (1879-1975), a water-control engineer and college president from Ohio as the chairman of the newly created Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). With the eyes of the nation focused on the reform and recovery promised by the New Deal, Morgan remained in the national spotlight for much of the 1930s in this thoughtful biography Aaron D. Purcell re-assesses Morgan's long life and career and provides the first detailed account of his post-TVA activities. As Purcell demonstrates, Morgan embraced an alternative types of Progressive Era reform that was rooted in nineteenth-century socialism, an overlooked strain in American political thought. Purcell Pinpoints Morgan's reading of Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward while a teenager as a watershed moment in the development of his vision for building modern American society. He recounts Morgan's early successes as an engineer budding Progressive-leader, and educational reformer his presidency of Antioch College, and his revolutionary but contentious tenure at the TVA After his dismissal from the TVA Morgan eventually published over a dozen books, including a biography of Bellamy, while supporting community-building efforts across the globe, Morgan retained many of his late-nineteenth century beliefs, including eugenics, as part of his societal vision. His authoritarian administrative style and moral rigidity limited his ability of attract large numbers to his community-based vision. By presenting Morgan's life and career within the context of the larger social and cultural events of his day, this revealing biographical study offers new insight into the achievements and motivations of an important but historically neglected American reformer.

Engineering Synthetic Metabolons: From Metabolic Modelling to Rational Design of Biosynthetic Devices," Lars M. Voll, Zoran Nikoloski",Frontiers Media SA,2016-07-19,"The discipline of Synthetic Biology has recently emerged at the interface of biology and engineering. The definition of Synthetic Biology has been dynamic over time ever since, which exemplifies that the field is rapidly moving and comprises a broad range of research areas. In the frame of this Research Topic, we focus on Synthetic Biology approaches that aim at rearranging biological parts/ entities in order to generate novel biochemical functions with inherent metabolic activity. This Research Topic encompasses Pathway Engineering in living systems as well as the in vitro assembly of biomolecules into nano- and microscale bioreactors. Both, the engineering of metabolic pathways in vivo, as well as the conceptualization of bioreactors in vitro, require rational design of assembled synthetic pathways and depend on careful selection of individual biological functions and their optimization. Mathematical modelling has proven to be a powerful tool in predicting metabolic flux in living and artificial systems, although modelling approaches have to cope with a limitation in experimentally verified, reliable input variables. This Research Topic puts special emphasis on the vital role of modelling approaches for Synthetic Biology, i.e. the predictive power of mathematical simulations for (i) the manipulation of existing pathways and (ii) the establishment of novel pathways in vivo as well as (iii) the translation of model predictions into the design of synthetic assemblies.",Biotechnology,132,N/A,0,en

Routledge Handbook of the Influence Industry,"Emma L. Briant, Vian Bakir",Taylor & Francis,2024-10-14,"This Handbook provides the first comprehensive examination of the influence industry and how it operates worldwide across different domains. The rapid evolution of emerging technologies and data-driven persuasive practices has been linked to the spread of misleading content in domestic and foreign influence campaigns. This has prompted worldwide public and policy discussions about disinformation and how to curb its spread. However, less attention has been paid to the increasingly data-driven commercial industry taking advantage of the opportunities these new technologies afford. The handbook uses the term ‘influence’ here to include not only messaging and public relations (PR), which fell within the traditional focus of propaganda studies, but to consider the infrastructure and actors behind an advanced array of capabilities that can be used in a coordinated way to affect an audience’s emotions, ideas and behaviors in order to advance a state or non-state actor’s objectives – increasingly based on data-driven profiling. The volume fills a gap in scholarship exploring the recent technical, political and economic development of this industry, surveying the extent of different technologies and services offered to clients worldwide across multiple domains (commercial, political, national security and government). The chapters are divided into three thematic sections and evaluate Influence Industry practices, aims and effectiveness across audiences; business practices and economics; and democratic structures and human rights.

Effective Inquiry for Innovative Engineering Design,Ozgur Eris,Springer Science & Business Media,2011-06-27,"Effective Inquiry for Innovative Engineering Design presents empirical evidence for this claim. It demonstrates a unique attribute of design thinking by identifying and characterizing a class of questions called ""Generative Design Questions"". These questions are frequently asked by designers in dialog. Their use constitutes a fundamental cognitive mechanism in design thinking. Their discovery stems from another finding of the work: a conceptual duality between questions and decisions that is engraved deep within the design process. This duality challenges a view that treats designing as decision making. Decisions form the tip of the iceberg; Questions keep it afloat: Can an effective decision making process be performed without having high quality information? Can high quality information be acquired and generated without performing an effective inquiry process? The answer to both questions is no, and underscores the importance of our quest to better understand the role of inquiry in design.",Technology & Engineering,160,N/A,0,en

The Ethical Engineer,Robert McGinn,Princeton University Press,2018-02-13,"An exploration of the ethics of practical engineering through analyses of eighteen rich case studies The Ethical Engineer explores ethical issues that arise in engineering practice, from technology transfer to privacy protection to whistle-blowing. Presenting key ethics concepts and real-life examples of engineering work, Robert McGinn illuminates the ethical dimension of engineering practice and helps students and professionals determine engineers’ context-specific ethical responsibilities. McGinn highlights the “ethics gap” in contemporary engineering—the disconnect between the meager exposure to ethical issues in engineering education and the ethical challenges frequently faced by engineers. He elaborates four “fundamental ethical responsibilities of engineers” (FEREs) and uses them to shed light on the ethical dimensions of diverse case studies, including ones from emerging engineering fields. The cases range from the Union Carbide pesticide plant disaster in India to the Google Street View project. After examining the extent to which the actions of engineers in the cases align with the FEREs, McGinn recapitulates key ideas used in analyzing the cases and spells out the main lessons they suggest. He identifies technical, social, and personal factors that induce or press engineers to engage in misconduct and discusses organizational, legal, and individual resources available to those interested in ethically responsible engineering practice. Combining probing analysis and nuanced ethical evaluation of engineering conduct in its social and technical contexts, The Ethical Engineer will be invaluable to engineering students and professionals. Meets the need for engineering-related ethics study Elaborates four fundamental ethical responsibilities of engineers Discusses diverse, global cases of ethical issues in established and emerging engineering fields Identifies resources and options for ethically responsible engineering practice Provides discussion questions for each case",Technology & Engineering,352,N/A,0,en

The Analogue Alternative,James S. Small,Routledge,2013-06-17,"We are in the midst of a digital revolution - until recently, the majority of appliances used in everyday life have been developed with analogue technology. Now, either at home or out and about, we are surrounded by digital technology such as digital 'film', audio systems, computers and telephones. From the late 1940s until the 1970s, analogue technology was a genuine alternative to digital, and the two competing technologies ran parallel with each other. During this period, a community of engineers, scientists, academics and businessmen continued to develop and promote the analogue computer. At the height of the Cold War, this community and its technology met with considerable success in meeting the urgent demand for high speed computing for use in the design and simulation of rockets, aircraft and manned space vehicles. The Analogue Alternative tracks the development, commercialisation and ultimate decline of the electronic analogue computer in the USA and Britain. It examines the roles played by technical, economic and cultural factors in the competition between the alternative technologies, but more importantly, James Small demonstrates that non-technical factors, such as the role of 'military enterprise' and the working practices of analogue engineers, have been the most crucial in analogue's demise.^l This book will be of interest to students of the history and sociology of science and technology, particularly computing. It will also be relevant to those interested in technical change and innovation, and the study of scientific cultures.",Computers,340,N/A,0,en

"Software Architecture: System Design, Development and Maintenance","Jan Bosch, Morven Gentleman, Christine Hofmeister, Juha Kuusela",Springer,2013-06-29,"For more and more systems, software has moved from a peripheral to a central role, replacing mechanical parts and hardware and giving the product a competitive edge. Consequences of this trend are an increase in: the size of software systems, the variability in software artifacts, and the importance of software in achieving the system-level properties. Software architecture provides the necessary abstractions for managing the resulting complexity. We here introduce the Third Working IEEFlIFIP Conference on Software Architecture, WICSA3. That it is already the third such conference is in itself a clear indication that software architecture continues to be an important topic in industrial software development and in software engineering research. However, becoming an established field does not mean that software architecture provides less opportunity for innovation and new directions. On the contrary, one can identify a number of interesting trends within software architecture research. The first trend is that the role of the software architecture in all phases of software development is more explicitly recognized. Whereas initially software architecture was primarily associated with the architecture design phase, we now see that the software architecture is treated explicitly during development, product derivation in software product lines, at run-time, and during system evolution. Software architecture as an artifact has been decoupled from a particular lifecycle phase.",Computers,234,N/A,0,en

In the book only the most important concepts are presented. Each book chapter is an introduction to computer laboratory and is accompanied by complete laboratory exercises and ready-to-go Matlab programs with figures and comments (available at the book webpage and running also in GNU Octave 5.2 with free software packages), showing all or most details of relevant algorithms. Students are tasked to understand programs, modify them, and apply presented concepts to recorded real RF signal or simulated received signals, with modelled transmission condition and hardware imperfections. Teaching is done by showing examples and their modifications to different real-world telecommunication-like applications. The book consists of three parts: introduction to DSP (spectral analysis and digital filtering), introduction to DSP advanced topics (multi-rate, adaptive, model-based and multimedia - speech, audio, video - signal analysis and processing) and introduction to software-defined modern telecommunication systems (SDR technology, analog and digital modulations, single- and multi-carrier systems, channel estimation and correction as well as synchronization issues). Many real signals are processed in the book, in the first part – mainly speech and audio, while in the second part – mainly RF recordings taken from RTL-SDR USB stick and ADALM-PLUTO module, for example captured IQ data of VOR avionics signal, classical FM radio with RDS, digital DAB/DAB+ radio and 4G-LTE digital telephony. Additionally, modelling and simulation of some transmission scenarios are tested in software in the book, in particular TETRA, ADSL and 5G signals.​ Provides an introduction to digital signal processing and software-based digital communication; Presents a transition from digital signal processing to software-defined telecommunication; Features a suite of pedagogical materials including a laboratory test-bed and computer exercises/experiments​​.",Technology & Engineering,874,N/A,0,en
Metal Fatigue in Engineering,"Henry O. Fuchs, Ralph I. Stephens",N/A,1980-06-20,"Applied Optimal Design Mechanical and Structural Systems Edward J. Haug & Jasbir S. Arora This computer-aided design text presents and illustrates techniques for optimizing the design of a wide variety of mechanical and structural systems through the use of nonlinear programming and optimal control theory. A state space method is adopted that incorporates the system model as an integral part of the design formulations. Step-by-step numerical algorithms are given for each method of optimal design. Basic properties of the equations of mechanics are used to carry out design sensitivity analysis and optimization, with numerical efficiency and generality that is in most cases an order of magnitude faster in digital computation than applications using standard nonlinear programming methods. 1979 Optimum Design of Mechanical Elements, 2nd Ed. Ray C. Johnson The two basic optimization techniques, the method of optimal design (MOD) and automated optimal design (AOD), discussed in this valuable work can be applied to the optimal design of mechanical elements commonly found in machinery, mechanisms, mechanical assemblages, products, and structures. The many illustrative examples used to explicate these techniques include such topics as tensile bars, torsion bars, shafts in combined loading, helical and spur gears, helical springs, and hydrostatic journal bearings. The author covers curve fitting, equation simplification, material properties, and failure theories, as well as the effects of manufacturing errors on product performance and the need for a factor of safety in design work. 1980 Globally Optimal Design Douglass J. Wilde Here are new analytic optimization procedures effective where numerical methods either take too long or do not provide correct answers. This book uses mathematics sparingly, proving only results generated by examples. It defines simple design methods guaranteed to give the global, rather than any local, optimum through computations easy enough to be done on a manual calculator. The author confronts realistic situations: determining critical constraints; dealing with negative contributions; handling power function; tackling logarithmic and exponential nonlinearities; coping with standard sizes and indivisible components; and resolving conflicting objectives and logical restrictions. Special mathematical structures are exposed and used to solve design problems. 1978",Technology & Engineering,354,N/A,0,en

The Nature of Chaos in Business,"Kiberley A. Webb, J. Garrett Ralls Jr.",Routledge,2009-11-03,"Market globalization is changing the way companies do business. It is now necessary for businesses to use mergers, joint ventures, and research consortia if they want to stay competitive and increase returns. The problem is that venturing into such partnerships has a substantial failure rate. In many cases, failure is due to poor preparation, inability to manage conflict, and simply being overwhelmed by the complexity of the partnership issues. The Nature of Chaos in Business offers answers to why such partnerships fail and how successful partnerships can be fostered through the complexity and supposed chaos of the situation. Based on models of complexity formulated and studied at the esteemed Santa Fe Institute, this guide demonstrates how complexity in business, as in nature, eventually falls into patterns. Through the recognition and use of these patterns, today's businesses can leverage each other's strengths into powerful alliances. The Nature of Chaos in Business is a fascinating, cutting-edge treatise on the application of complexity theory in business. The ""war stories"" throughout the book offer insight and wisdom from the real-life experiences of some of the world's largest, high-profile corporations and individuals.",Business & Economics,218,N/A,0,en

Intelligent Energy Field Manufacturing,Wenwu Zhang,CRC Press,2018-10-03,"Edited by prominent researchers and with contributions from experts in their individual areas, Intelligent Energy Field Manufacturing: Interdisciplinary Process Innovations explores a new philosophy of engineering. An in-depth introduction to Intelligent Energy Field Manufacturing (EFM), this book explores a fresh engineering methodology that not only integrates but goes beyond methodologies such as Design for Six Sigma, Lean Manufacturing, Concurrent Engineering, TRIZ, green and sustainable manufacturing, and more. This book gives a systematic introduction to classic non-mechanical manufacturing processes as well as offering big pictures of some technical frontiers in modern engineering. The book suggests that any manufacturing process is actually a process of injecting human intelligence into the interaction between material and the various energy fields in order to transfer the material into desired configurations. It discusses technological innovation, dynamic M-PIE flows, the generalities of energy fields, logic functional materials and intelligence, the open scheme of intelligent EFM implementation, and the principles of intelligent EFM. The book takes a highly interdisciplinary approach that includes research frontiers such as micro/nano fabrication, high strain rate processes, laser shock forming, materials science and engineering, bioengineering, etc., in addition to a detailed treatment of the so called ""non-traditional"" manufacturing processes, which covers waterjet machining, laser material processing, ultrasonic material processing, EDM/ECM, etc. Filled with illustrative pictures, figures, and tables that make technical materials more absorbable, the book cuts across multiple engineering disciplines. The majority of books in this area report the facts of proven knowledge, while the behind-the-scenes thinking is usually neglected. This book examines the big picture of manufacturing in depth before diving into the deta",Technology & Engineering,729,N/A,0,en

Electromagnetic Sources and Electromagnetic Fields,Gaobiao Xiao,Springer Nature,2024-01-16,"This book presents a modified spherical harmonic expansion method in which the electromagnetic fields and their sources are expanded with the same set of spherical vector basis functions in a similar procedure. Explicit expressions for the electromagnetic fields, potentials, energies, and the related Green’s functions are derived for the spherical modes in both frequency domain and time domain. Based on the formulation, the relationships between the electromagnetic sources, the electromagnetic far fields, and the electromagnetic near fields are clearly revealed. In particular, a nonuniform transmission line model is developed for intuitively characterizing the total radiation process. The introduction of the cutoff radius and the cutoff mode degree provides a simple reference for determining the numbers of degrees of freedom of the fields associated with sources in a bounded region. Based on the theory, an efficient hybrid method for synthesizing antenna arrays with complex footprints is proposed and demonstrated with several numerical examples. Effective algorithms are also developed for reconstructing the radiating part of the current sources. This book is intended for researchers, engineers, and graduate students who are interested in studying the energy transfer in electromagnetic radiation, synthesis and measurement of antenna arrays, and applications of inverse electromagnetic source problems.",Technology & Engineering,347,N/A,0,en
Solar power satellites.,,DIANE Publishing,N/A,"During energy crisis at the end of the Sixties, a new idea to exploit solar energy arose: Solar Power Satellites. These satellites need a huge surface to collect enough solar energy to be beamed on Earth by means of a microwave power transfer system. Different concepts appeared during last forty years and a lot of studies addressing the SPS economical feasibility have been published. In this work a particular concept is considered, the JAXA Reference Concept 2003. It is a formation flying SPS, composed by two reflectors and a central array panel. The objective of the work is to study two major problems this concept presents. Due to its dimensions, the satellite orbit will suffer from important orbital perturbations and since formation flying satellites need a tight orbit control, the first task is to derive an analytical approximation to perform relative perturbed orbit propagation for formation flying satellite. This objective is pursued starting from a H. Schaub’s formulation in which formation flying satellites unperturbed orbit is described by means of an approximated relation function of orbital element differences. This formulation is merged with another approach, developed in a previous work, which gives, analytically, orbital parameters variation when a perturbation acts on the spacecraft. The result is a very interesting algorithm, able to perform the assigned task with a relative error lower than 3% over one simulated orbit. The second objective concerns structural control. It is not possible to consider these huge satellites as rigid bodies, first natural frequencies will be certainly excited during operations. So that, the second task is the study of actuator placement optimization for flexible satellites, very useful for tight pointing requirements. A FEM model is developed modeling the SPS as a frame of beams and a global controllability index is obtained combining modal controllability and component cost analysis. The maximization of this parameter,",,297,N/A,0,en

ITER: The Giant Fusion Reactor,Michel Claessens,Springer Nature,2019-10-17,"This book provides for the first time an insider’s view into ITER, the biggest fusion reactor in the world, which is currently being constructed in southern France. Aimed at bringing the “energy of the stars” to earth, ITER is funded by the major economic powers (China, the EU, India, Japan, Korea, Russia and the US). Often presented as a “nuclear but green” energy source, fusion could play an important role in the future electricity supply. But as delays accumulate and budgets continue to grow, ITER is currently a star partially obscured by clouds. Will ITER save humanity by providing a clean, safe and limitless source of energy, or is it merely a political showcase of cutting-edge technology? Is ITER merely an ambitious research project and partly a PR initiative driven by some politically connected scientists? In any case, ITER has already helped spur on rival projects in the US, Canada and the UK. This book offers readers a behind-the-scenes look at this controversial project, which France snatched from Japan, and introduces them to a world of superlatives: with the largest magnets in the world, the biggest cryogenic plant and tremendous computing power, ITER is one of the most fascinating, and most international, scientific and technological endeavours of our time.",Technology & Engineering,229,N/A,0,en

Pragmatic Evaluation of Software Architectures,"Jens Knodel, Matthias Naab",Springer,2016-06-07,"Thorough and continuous architecting is the key to overall success in software engineering, and architecture evaluation is a crucial part of it. This book presents a pragmatic architecture evaluation approach and insights gained from its application in more than 75 projects with industrial customers in the past decade. It presents context factors, empirical data, and example cases, as well as lessons learned on mitigating the risk of change through architecture evaluation. By providing comprehensive answers to more than 100 typical questions and discussing more than 60 frequent mistakes and lessons learned, the book allows readers to not only learn how to conduct architecture evaluations and interpret its results, but also to become aware of risks such as false conclusions, manipulating data, and unsound lines of argument. It equips readers to become confident in assessing quantitative measurement results and recognize when it is better to rely on qualitative expertise. The target readership includes both practitioners and researchers. By demonstrating its impact and providing clear guidelines, data, and examples, it encourages practitioners to conduct architecture evaluations. At the same time, it offers researchers insights into industrial architecture evaluations, which serve as the basis for guiding research in this area and will inspire future research directions.",Computers,170,N/A,0,en

Urban Engineering for Sustainability,Sybil Derrible,MIT Press,2019-12-03,"A textbook that introduces integrated, sustainable design of urban infrastructures, drawing on civil engineering, environmental engineering, urban planning, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer science. This textbook introduces urban infrastructure from an engineering perspective, with an emphasis on sustainability. Bringing together both fundamental principles and practical knowledge from civil engineering, environmental engineering, urban planning, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer science, the book transcends disciplinary boundaries by viewing urban infrastructures as integrated networks. The text devotes a chapter to each of five engineering systems—electricity, water, transportation, buildings, and solid waste—covering such topics as fundamentals, demand, management, technology, and analytical models. Other chapters present a formal definition of sustainability; discuss population forecasting techniques; offer a history of urban planning, from the Neolithic era to Kevin Lynch and Jane Jacobs; define and discuss urban metabolism and infrastructure integration, reviewing system interdependencies; and describe approaches to urban design that draw on complexity theory, algorithmic models, and machine learning. Throughout, a hypothetical city state, Civitas, is used to explain and illustrate the concepts covered. Each chapter includes working examples and problem sets. An appendix offers tables, diagrams, and conversion factors. The book can be used in advanced undergraduate and graduate courses in civil engineering and as a reference for practitioners. It can also be helpful in preparation for the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) and Principles and Practice of Engineering (PE) exams.",Political Science,657,N/A,0,en

To Err Is Human,"Institute of Medicine, Committee on Quality of Health Care in America",National Academies Press,2000-03-01,"Experts estimate that as many as 98,000 people die in any given year from medical errors that occur in hospitals. That's more than die from motor vehicle accidents, breast cancer, or AIDSâ€""three causes that receive far more public attention. Indeed, more people die annually from medication errors than from workplace injuries. Add the financial cost to the human tragedy, and medical error easily rises to the top ranks of urgent, widespread public problems. To Err Is Human breaks the silence that has surrounded medical errors and their consequenceâ€""but not by pointing fingers at caring health care professionals who make honest mistakes. After all, to err is human. Instead, this book sets forth a national agendaâ€""with state and local implicationsâ€""for reducing medical errors and improving patient safety through the design of a safer health system. This volume reveals the often startling statistics of medical error and the disparity between the incidence of error and public perception of it, given many patients' expectations that the medical profession always performs perfectly. A careful examination is made of how the surrounding forces of legislation, regulation, and market activity influence the quality of care provided by health care organizations and then looks at their handling of medical mistakes. Using a detailed case study, the book reviews the current understanding of why these mistakes happen. A key theme is that legitimate liability concerns discourage reporting of errorsâ€""which begs the question, ""How can we learn from our mistakes?"" Balancing regulatory versus market-based initiatives and public versus private efforts, the Institute of Medicine presents wide-ranging recommendations for improving patient safety, in the areas of leadership, improved data collection and analysis, and development of effective systems at the level of direct patient care. To Err Is Human asserts that the problem is not bad people in health careâ€""it is that good people are working in bad systems that need to be made safer. Comprehensive and straightforward, this book offers a clear prescription for raising the level of patient safety in American health care. It also explains how patients themselves can influence the quality of care that they receive once they check into the hospital. This book will be vitally important to federal, state, and local health policy makers and regulators, health professional licensing officials, hospital administrators, medical educators and students, health caregivers, health journalists, patient advocatesâ€""as well as patients themselves.

The ASQ CQE Study Guide,"Connie M. Borror, Sarah E. Burke",Quality Press,2015-12-17,"This book is primarily meant to aid those taking the ASQ Certified Quality Engineer (CQE) exam and is best used in conjunction with The Certified Quality Engineer Handbook. Section 1 provides 380 practice questions organized by the seven parts of the 2015 Body of Knowledge (BOK). Section 2 gives the reader 205 additional practice questions from each of the seven parts, in a randomized order. For every question in both sections, detailed solutions are provided that explain why each answer is the correct one and also which section of the BOK the question corresponds to so that any further study needed can be focused on specific sections. A secondary audience is those taking exams for ASQ certifications whose BOKs have some crossover with the CQE. Namely, the Certified Six Sigma Black Belt (CSSBB), Certified Six Sigma Green Belt (CSSGB), Certified Reliability Engineer (CRE), and Certified Quality Inspector (CQI). Using this guide in studying for any of these exams would be extremely useful, particularly for the statistics portions of the BOKs. Unlike other resources on the market, all these questions and solutions were developed specifically to address the 2015 CQE Body of Knowledge and help those studying for it, including taking into account the proper depth of knowledge and required levels of cognition.

Hitler's American Model,James Q. Whitman,Princeton University Press,2017-02-14,"How American race law provided a blueprint for Nazi Germany Nazism triumphed in Germany during the high era of Jim Crow laws in the United States. Did the American regime of racial oppression in any way inspire the Nazis? The unsettling answer is yes. In Hitler's American Model, James Whitman presents a detailed investigation of the American impact on the notorious Nuremberg Laws, the centerpiece anti-Jewish legislation of the Nazi regime. Contrary to those who have insisted that there was no meaningful connection between American and German racial repression, Whitman demonstrates that the Nazis took a real, sustained, significant, and revealing interest in American race policies. As Whitman shows, the Nuremberg Laws were crafted in an atmosphere of considerable attention to the precedents American race laws had to offer. German praise for American practices, already found in Hitler's Mein Kampf, was continuous throughout the early 1930s, and the most radical Nazi lawyers were eager advocates of the use of American models. But while Jim Crow segregation was one aspect of American law that appealed to Nazi radicals, it was not the most consequential one. Rather, both American citizenship and antimiscegenation laws proved directly relevant to the two principal Nuremberg Laws—the Citizenship Law and the Blood Law. Whitman looks at the ultimate, ugly irony that when Nazis rejected American practices, it was sometimes not because they found them too enlightened, but too harsh. Indelibly linking American race laws to the shaping of Nazi policies in Germany, Hitler's American Model upends understandings of America's influence on racist practices in the wider world.",History,223,N/A,0,en

Machine Learning and Big Data with kdb+/q,"Jan Novotny, Paul A. Bilokon, Aris Galiotos, Frederic Deleze",John Wiley & Sons,2019-12-31,"Upgrade your programming language to more effectively handle high-frequency data Machine Learning and Big Data with KDB+/Q offers quants, programmers and algorithmic traders a practical entry into the powerful but non-intuitive kdb+ database and q programming language. Ideally designed to handle the speed and volume of high-frequency financial data at sell- and buy-side institutions, these tools have become the de facto standard; this book provides the foundational knowledge practitioners need to work effectively with this rapidly-evolving approach to analytical trading. The discussion follows the natural progression of working strategy development to allow hands-on learning in a familiar sphere, illustrating the contrast of efficiency and capability between the q language and other programming approaches. Rather than an all-encompassing “bible”-type reference, this book is designed with a focus on real-world practicality to help you quickly get up to speed and become productive with the language. Understand why kdb+/q is the ideal solution for high-frequency data Delve into “meat” of q programming to solve practical economic problems Perform everyday operations including basic regressions, cointegration, volatility estimation, modelling and more Learn advanced techniques from market impact and microstructure analyses to machine learning techniques including neural networks The kdb+ database and its underlying programming language q offer unprecedented speed and capability. As trading algorithms and financial models grow ever more complex against the markets they seek to predict, they encompass an ever-larger swath of data – more variables, more metrics, more responsiveness and altogether more “moving parts.” Traditional programming languages are increasingly failing to accommodate the growing speed and volume of data, and lack the necessary flexibility that cutting-edge financial modelling demands. Machine Learning and Big Data with KDB+/Q opens up the technology and flattens the learning curve to help you quickly adopt a more effective set of tools.",Business & Economics,640,N/A,0,en

The book provides empirical research on undergraduate teaching and learning in the sciences, explores the extent to which this research currently influences undergraduate instruction, and identifies the intellectual and material resources required to further develop DBER. Discipline-Based Education Research provides guidance for future DBER research. In addition, the findings and recommendations of this report may invite, if not assist, post-secondary institutions to increase interest and research activity in DBER and improve its quality and usefulness across all natural science disciples, as well as guide instruction and assessment across natural science courses to improve student learning. The book brings greater focus to issues of student attrition in the natural sciences that are related to the quality of instruction. Discipline-Based Education Research will be of interest to educators, policy makers, researchers, scholars, decision makers in universities, government agencies, curriculum developers, research sponsors, and education advocacy groups.",Education,282,N/A,0,en

Project Azorian,"Norman C Polmar, Michael White",Naval Institute Press,2012-09-15,"In early August 1974, despite incredible risks and after six years of secret preparations, the CIA attempted to salvage the sunken Soviet ballistic missile submarine K-129 from the depths of the North Pacific Ocean. The audacious effort was undertaken with the cover of an undersea mining operation sponsored by eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes. “Azorian”—incorrectly identified as Project Jennifer by the press—was the most ambitious ocean engineering endeavor attempted by man. Following the accidental sinking of a Soviet missile submarine in March 1968, U.S. intelligence agencies were able to determine the precise location and to develop a means of raising the submarine from a depth of 16,400 feet. The remarkable salvage effort of the K-129, which contained nuclear-armed torpedoes and one nuclear tipped missile as well as crypto equipment, was conducted with Soviet naval ships a few hundred yards from the lift ship, the Hughes Glomar Explorer. The book is based, in part, on the research for Michael White’ documentary film Azorian: The Raising of the K-129, released in late 2009. The research for the book and the documentary forced the CIA to issue a brief report on Project Azorian in early 2010, with one-third of the document redacted.",Political Science,276,5,1,en

Back Analysis in Rock Engineering,Shunsuke Sakurai,CRC Press,2017-09-01,"This book provides practicing engineers working in the field of design, construction and monitoring of rock structures such as tunnels and slopes with technical information on how to design, how to excavate and how to monitor the structures during their construction. Based on the long-term engineering experiences of the author, field measurements together with back analyses are presented as the most powerful tools in rock engineering practice. One of the purposes of field measurements is to assess the stability of the rock structures during their construction. However, field measurement results are only numbers unless they are quantitatively interpreted, a process in which back analyses play an important role. The author has developed both the concepts of “critical strain” and of the “anisotropic parameter” of rocks, which can make it possible not only to assess the stability of the structures during their construction, but also to verify the validity of design parameters by the back analysis of field measurement results during the constructions. Based on the back analysis results, the design parameters used at a design stage could be modified if necessary. This procedure is called an “Observational method”, a concept that is entirely different from that of other structures such as bridges and buildings. It is noted that in general, technical books written for practicing engineers mainly focus on empirical approaches which are based on engineers’ experiences. In this book, however, no empirical approaches will be described, instead, all the approaches are based on simple rock mechanics theory. This book is the first to describe an observational method in rock engineering practice, which implies that the potential readers of this book must be practicing engineers working on rock engineering projects.",Technology & Engineering,354,N/A,0,en

To Engineer is Human,Henry Petroski,St. Martin's Press,2018-10-16,"“Though ours is an age of high technology, the essence of what engineering is and what engineers do is not common knowledge. Even the most elementary of principles upon which great bridges, jumbo jets, or super computers are built are alien concepts to many. This is so in part because engineering as a human endeavor is not yet integrated into our culture and intellectual tradition. And while educators are currently wrestling with the problem of introducing technology into conventional academic curricula, thus better preparing today’s students for life in a world increasingly technological, there is as yet no consensus as to how technological literacy can best be achieved. "" I believe, and I argue in this essay, that the ideas of engineering are in fact in our bones and part of our human nature and experience. Furthermore, I believe that an understanding and an appreciation of engineers and engineering can be gotten without an engineering or technical education. Thus I hope that the technologically uninitiated will come to read what I have written as an introduction to technology.

Vehicle Dynamics and Control,Rajesh Rajamani,Springer Science & Business Media,2011-12-21,"Vehicle Dynamics and Control provides a comprehensive coverage of vehicle control systems and the dynamic models used in the development of these control systems. The control system applications covered in the book include cruise control, adaptive cruise control, ABS, automated lane keeping, automated highway systems, yaw stability control, engine control, passive, active and semi-active suspensions, tire-road friction coefficient estimation, rollover prevention, and hybrid electric vehicles. In developing the dynamic model for each application, an effort is made to both keep the model simple enough for control system design but at the same time rich enough to capture the essential features of the dynamics. A special effort has been made to explain the several different tire models commonly used in literature and to interpret them physically. In the second edition of the book, chapters on roll dynamics, rollover prevention and hybrid electric vehicles have been added, and the chapter on electronic stability control has been enhanced. The use of feedback control systems on automobiles is growing rapidly. This book is intended to serve as a useful resource to researchers who work on the development of such control systems, both in the automotive industry and at universities.

The Tower of Pisa,"J.B. Burland, M.B. Jamiolkowski, N. Squeglia, C. Viggiani",CRC Press,2020-08-26,"The Leaning Tower of Pisa is known worldwide for its five-degree lean. The Tower is the Campanile of the Cathedral, which together with the Baptistry and Cemetery form a breath-taking collection of monuments which are regarded as supreme examples of early Renaissance Romanesque architecture. In March 1990 the Tower was closed to the public as it was declared unsafe and close to collapse. A Commission was set up by the Italian Government with the task of developing and implementing stabilization measures. This book begins with a brief description of the history of the Tower and its construction. The reader is then introduced to the huge challenges faced by the Commission in designing and implementing appropriate stabilization measures whilst at the same time satisfying the demanding requirements of conserving a world heritage monument. In particular, two historical studies are described which proved to be most valuable in arriving at suitable stabilization measures. The first was a deduction of the history of inclination of the tower during and subsequent to construction. The results of this study were used to calibrate a sophisticated numerical model of the tower and the underlying very soft ground which proved vital in evaluating the effectiveness of various stabilization schemes. The second study was of measurements of movement made since 1911. This latter study revealed an unexpected mechanism of foundation movement which proved crucial in developing the temporary and permanent stabilization measures and which resulted in the Tower being re-opened to the public in June 2001. The book will appeal to both professionals and students in the fields of Architecture and Civil Engineering. It will also interest specialised audiences of geotechnical engineers and conservation architects. It may also be of wider interest to anyone planning to visit Pisa or who is intrigued as to what caused the Tower to lean and how it was stabilized.",Technology & Engineering,86,N/A,0,en

Silica and Clay Dispersed Polymer Nanocomposites,Md Rezaur Rahman,Woodhead Publishing,2018-06-13,"The production of 'polymer nanocomposites' has recently gained considerable attention from both the academic and industrial community, especially in the area of nanoscience. This is mainly due to their enhanced improvements in physico-mechanical, thermal and barrier properties compared to micro and more conventional composites. Their nanoscale dimensions, biodegradable character, cost-effectiveness and sustainability have constituted a stimulus for this increasing interest. Currently there is no limit to the possibility of applications. However, despite all this progress, it is still difficult to achieve uniform dispersion between the filler and the matrix, as agglomerations form far too easily and the production of polymer nanocomposites with high mechanical and thermal properties is still limited. The authors of this proposed book, are of the opinion, that with the increase in scientific publications and the rapid progress in processing possibilities to produce nanocomposites based on various nanoscale fillers (silica/clay), a book that collects all of these scientific findings in one place would be timely and of great interest to both students and scientific researchers, who are concerned with the production, and application of nanocomposites as new innovative materials. The authors aim is to present the latest research findings on the fabrication, properties and applications of nanofillers as reinforcement in polymer nanocomposites.

In the Foreword to the First Edition, I noted the need for people in all facets of the food processing industry to consider those variables of design of particular importance in engineering for the food processing field. In addition to recognizing the many variables involved in the biological food product being handled from production to consumption, the engi neer must oftentimes adapt equations developed for non-biological materials. As more and more research is done, those equations are appropriately modified to be more accurate or new equations are developed specifically for designing to process foods. This Edition updates equations used. This book serves a very important need in acquainting engineers and technologists, particularly those with a math ematics and physics background, with the information necessary to provide a more efficient design to accomplish the objectives. Of prime importance, at present and in the future, is to design for efficient use of energy. Now, it is often economical to put considerably more money into first costs for an efficient design than previously, when energy costs were a much smaller proportion of the total cost of process engineering.",Science,441,N/A,0,en

Reaction Engineering Principles,Himadri Roy Ghatak,CRC Press,2018-09-03,"Chemical reaction engineering is at the core of chemical engineering education. Unfortunately, the subject can be intimidating to students, because it requires a heavy dose of mathematics. These mathematics, unless suitably explained in the context of the physical phenomenon, can confuse rather than enlighten students. Bearing this in mind, Reaction Engineering Principles is written primarily from a student’s perspective. It is the culmination of the author’s more than twenty years of experience teaching chemical reaction engineering. The textbook begins by covering the basic building blocks of the subject—stoichiometry, kinetics, and thermodynamics—ensuring students gain a good grasp of the essential concepts before venturing into the world of reactors. The design and performance evaluation of reactors are conveniently grouped into chapters based on an increasing degree of difficulty. Accordingly, isothermal reactors—batch and ideal flow types—are addressed first, followed by non-isothermal reactor operation, non-ideal flow in reactors, and some special reactor types. For better comprehension, detailed derivations are provided for all important mathematical equations. Narrative of the physical context in which the formulae work adds to the clarity of thought. The use of mathematical formulae is elaborated upon in the form of problem solving steps followed by worked examples. Effects of parameters, changing trends, and comparisons between different situations are presented graphically. Self-practice exercises are included at the end of each chapter.",Science,336,N/A,0,en

The Ghost of the Executed Engineer,Loren Graham,Harvard University Press,1996-02-01,"Stalin ordered his execution, but here Peter Palchinsky has the last word. As if rising from an uneasy grave, Palchinsky’s ghost leads us through the miasma of Soviet technology and industry, pointing out the mistakes he condemned in his time, the corruption and collapse he predicted, the ultimate price paid for silencing those who were not afraid to speak out. The story of this visionary engineer’s life and work, as Loren Graham relates it, is also the story of the Soviet Union’s industrial promise and failure. We meet Palchinsky in pre-Revolutionary Russia, immersed in protests against the miserable lot of laborers in the tsarist state, protests destined to echo ironically during the Soviet worker’s paradise. Exiled from the country, pardoned and welcomed back at the outbreak of World War I, the engineer joined the ranks of the Revolutionary government, only to find it no more open to criticism than the previous regime. His turbulent career offers us a window on debates over industrialization. Graham highlights the harsh irrationalities built into the Soviet system—the world’s most inefficient steel mill in Magnitogorsk, the gigantic and ill-conceived hydroelectric plant on the Dnieper River, the infamously cruel and mislocated construction of the White Sea Canal. Time and again, we see the effects of policies that ignore not only the workers’ and consumers’ needs but also sound management and engineering precepts. And we see Palchinsky’s criticism and advice, persistently given, consistently ignored, continue to haunt the Soviet Union right up to its dissolution in 1991. The story of a man whose gifts and character set him in the path of history, The Ghost of the Executed Engineer is also a cautionary tale about the fate of an engineering that disregards social and human issues.",Technology & Engineering,168,N/A,0,en

Fatal Flight,Bill Hammack,N/A,2017-12-16,"Fatal Flight brings vividly to life the year of operation of R.101, the last great British airship--a luxury liner three and a half times the length of a 747 jet, with a spacious lounge, a dining room that seated fifty, glass-walled promenade decks, and a smoking room. The British expected R.101 to spearhead a fleet of imperial airships that would dominate the skies as British naval ships, a century earlier, had ruled the seas. The dream ended when, on its demonstration flight to India, R.101 crashed in France, tragically killing nearly all aboard. Combining meticulous research with superb storytelling, Fatal Flight guides us from the moment the great airship emerged from its giant shed--nearly the largest building in the British Empire--to soar on its first flight, to its last fateful voyage. The full story behind R.101 shows that, although it was a failure, it was nevertheless a supremely imaginative human creation. The technical achievement of creating R.101 reveals the beauty, majesty, and, of course, the sorrow of the human experience. The narrative follows First Officer Noel Atherstone and his crew from the ship's first test flight in 1929 to its fiery crash on October 5, 1930. It reveals in graphic detail the heroic actions of Atherstone as he battled tremendous obstacles. He fought political pressures to hurry the ship into the air, fended off Britain's most feted airship pilot, who used his influence to take command of the ship and nearly crashed it, and, a scant two months before departing for India, guided the rebuilding of the ship to correct its faulty design. After this tragic accident, Britain abandoned airships, but R.101 flew again, its scrap melted down and sold to the Zeppelin Company, who used it to create LZ 129, an airship even more mighty than R.101--and better known as the Hindenburg. Set against the backdrop of the British Empire at the height of its power in the early twentieth century, Fatal Flight portrays an extraordinary age in technology, fueled by humankind's obsession with flight",Aircraft accidents,324,N/A,0,en

Data Driven System Engineering,James Wen,James Wen,2022-02-04,"This book provides full scope of automotive ECU development activities including cybersecurity and safety plus SOTIF. Every computing system has two, and only two attributes: Data Value and Data timing, which represent fully the system functionalities from the system external behavior point of view. The data driven system engineering is the approach to develop the system by focusing on the two attributes mentioned above, in which, the data values are derived by the system operation concept design, and the data timing is derived by the system latency design. Based on which, this book provides a full range of system and software engineering development activities: Requirement Elicitation Requirement Engineering System and Software Architecture Design System Operation Concept Design System and Software Structure Design Electronic Architect Design Functionality Allocation Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) Safety Cybersecurity (full compliant with UN ECE 155/156) System and software Verification System and Software Integration and Verification System and Software Black Box Verification each of which has its own clearly defined scope and approach, which is different from the conventional development, in some cases even different from some ISO standards, for example: Safety Development: the safety requirements for every part in a vehicle are cascaded from the vehicle safety requirements, which is different from the Concept Phase in the Part 3 of ISO 26262, and the functional safety development will be fully covered by (1) Reliability (2) Availability (3) Quality. Error Detection and Protection: there are only two types of errors to be detected in a computing system: Data Value error and Data Timing error, to detect which, there are only two aspects to be considered: (1) input data (2) middle data and output data in addition to the platform error detection. The approaches of detection and protection include (1) data transfer protocol check, (2) data range and reasonable value check, (3) execution time check and control. FMEA: this book provides the optimized approach by following the data relationships between the input data, middle data and output data, which will be both inductive and deductive, and re-use the system operation concept that is built at the system development first phase, to make the development efficient. Cybersecurity: this book provides the full solution to cover the UN ECE 155 by implementing three aspects: (1) Trusted contents in the ECU (2) Authenticated access to the ECU (3) Authenticated communication with the ECU. Requirement Engineering: This book makes the goal and scope of requirement engineering in the computing system development specific, accurate and measurable by defining the scope as: the requirement engineering is to use the computer executable information to describe the system under development which consists only two types of information: Signal and Test Case, and defining the requirement quality measurement as: (1) Signals, either input or output signals, shall be computer readable. (2) Test cases shall be executable in the system. System Architecture Design: The goal of system architecture design is to provide the platform that transfers and transforms the input signal to become the required output signal via some middle data. This book introduces the following system functional modulizations based on the AUTOSAR that satisfies a generic automotive ECU structure: (1) Feature Function (2) Diagnostic Service (3) Cybersecurity Function (4) Serial Signal Manager (5) Application Mode Manager (6) AUTOSAR, and based on the characteristics of those functions, the book provides the approach to design the electronic architecture and allocate the functions to the architecture.",Computers,258,N/A,0,en

Principles of Financial Engineering,Salih N. Neftci,Academic Press,2004-04-19,"Presents a fresh introduction to financial engineering. This book offers links between intuition and underlying mathematics and a mixture of market insights and mathematical materials. It also includes end-of-chapter exercises and case studies. Bestselling author Salih Neftci presents a fresh, original, informative, and up-to-date introduction to financial engineering. The book offers clear links between intuition and underlying mathematics and an outstanding mixture of market insights and mathematical materials. Also included are end-of-chapter exercises and case studies. In a market characterized by the existence of large pools of liquid funds willing to go anywhere, anytime in search of a few points of advantage, there are new risks. Lacking experience with these new risks, firms, governmental entities, and other investors have been surprised by unexpected and often disastrous financial losses. Managers and analysts seeking to employ these new instruments and strategies to make pricing, hedging, trading, and portfolio management decisions require a mature understanding of theoretical finance and sophisticated mathematical and computer modeling skills. Important and useful because it analyzes financial assets and derivatives from the financial engineering perspective, this book offers a different approach than the existing finance literature in financial asset and derivative analysis. Seeking not to introduce financial instruments but instead to describe the methods of synthetically creating assets in static and in dynamic environments and to show how to use them, his book complements all currently available textbooks. It emphasizes developing methods that can be used in order to solve risk management, taxation, regulation, and above all, pricing problems. This perspective forms the basis of practical risk management. It will be useful for anyone learning about practical elements of financial engineering. Exercises and case studies at end of each chapter and on-line Solutions Manual are provided. It explains issues involved in day-to-day life of traders, using language other than mathematics. It offers careful and concise analysis of the LIBOR market model and of volatility engineering problems.",Business & Economics,571,4.5,2,en

Systems Engineering,"Reinhard Haberfellner, Olivier de Weck, Ernst Fricke, Siegfried Vössner",Springer,2019-06-06,"This translation brings a landmark systems engineering (SE) book to English-speaking audiences for the first time since its original publication in 1972. For decades the SE concept championed by this book has helped engineers solve a wide variety of issues by emphasizing a top-down approach. Moving from the general to the specific, this SE concept has situated itself as uniquely appealing to both highly trained experts and anybody managing a complex project. Until now, this SE concept has only been available to German speakers. By shedding the overtly technical approach adopted by many other SE methods, this book can be used as a problem-solving guide in a great variety of disciplines, engineering and otherwise. By segmenting the book into separate parts that build upon each other, the SE concept’s accessibility is reinforced. The basic principles of SE, problem solving, and systems design are helpfully introduced in the first three parts. Once the fundamentals are presented, specific case studies are covered in the fourth part to display potential applications. Then part five offers further suggestions on how to effectively practice SE principles; for example, it not only points out frequent stumbling blocks, but also the specific points at which they may appear. In the final part, a wealth of different methods and tools, such as optimization techniques, are given to help maximize the potential use of this SE concept. Engineers and engineering students from all disciplines will find this book extremely helpful in solving complex problems. Because of its practicable lessons in problem-solving, any professional facing a complex project will also find much to learn from this volume.",Science,481,N/A,0,en

The book argues that what continued to operate throughout these tumultuous eras were engineering networks of technology. Constructed at first for colonial development under Japan, these networks transformed into channels of overseas development aid that constituted the Cold War system in Asia. Through highlighting how these networks helped shape Asia's contemporary economic landscape, Engineering Asia challenges dominant narratives in Western scholarship of an 'economic miracle' in Japan and South Korea, and the 'Asian Tigers' of Southeast Asia.

Lean Engineering,"Don T. Phillips, J. T. Black",Virtualbookworm.com Publishing,2013-08,"Modern Manufacturing Methodologies have undergone three different evolutionary stages over the past 200 years. Before there were modern manufacturing plants, the world only knew skilled craftsmen who labored as individuals in very small groups to produce goods and services. The first factory evolution came about when James Watt invented the steam engine. Metal cutting, forming and assembly machines were co-located near streams or rivers forming what we now call the Job Shop or the American Armory System. The second factory evolution began when Henry Ford introduced the first modern assembly line using interchangeable parts and standardized manufacturing procedures. This gave rise to the modern flow shop, which reached its zenith during WWII. In the late 1970s, the third industrial evolution began when Taiichi Ohno and the Toyota Motor Company introduced what we now call Lean Manufacturing...and the world came. Over the last 40 years, all forms of manufacturing and service systems have embraced the concepts of Lean Thinking and proved its superiority to traditional manufacturing and service systems design. This book defines and characterizes a new breed of Manufacturing Engineer which we call the Lean Engineer. The Lean Engineer has roots in traditional Industrial engineering, but is also well trained in six-sigma methodologies and understands lean to green factory design principles. However, Lean Engineering transcends and redefines the classic Industrial engineer. Principles of Lean systems design, U-shaped Lean manufacturing cells, Linked Cell Manufacturing System design and Mixed Model final assembly lines are unique Lean Engineering strategies. This book attempts to define for the first time a new manufacturing engineering discipline called the Lean Engineer. This book: Introduces Lean System Design principles Demonstrates the conversion of traditional manufacturing lines into U-shaped Lean Cells Contrasts push versus pull manufacturing strategies Covers Balancing, Leveling and System synchronization Demonstrates Value Stream Mapping and the 7-Lean analysis tools Provides an introduction to Queuing Network Analysis for single and multiple product flows ....and many more Principles which define the Lean Engineer",Education,672,N/A,0,en

Investigating and harnessing T-cell functions with engineered immune receptors and their ligands,Bruno Laugel,Frontiers Media SA,2015-01-22,"T-cells are an essential component of the immune system that provide protection against pathogen infections and cancer and are involved in the aetiology of numerous autoimmune and autoinflammatory pathologies. Their importance in disease, the relative ease to isolate, expand and manipulate them ex vivo have put T-cells at the forefront of basic and translational research in immunology. Decades of study have shed some light on the unique way T-cells integrate extrinsic environmental cues influencing an activation program triggered by interactions between peptide-MHC complexes and the antigen-recognition machinery constituted of clonally distributed T-cell receptors and their co-receptor CD4 or CD8. The manipulation of these molecular determinants in cellular systems or as recombinant proteins has considerably enhanced our ability to understand antigen-specific T-cell activation, to monitor ongoing T-cell responses and to exploit T-cells for therapy. Even though these principles have given numerous insights in the biology of CD8+ T-cells that translate into promising therapeutic prospects, as illustrated by recent breakthroughs in cancer therapy, they have proven more challenging to apply to CD4+ T-cells. This Research Topic aims to provide a comprehensive view of the recent insights provided by the use of engineered antigen receptors and their ligands on T-cell activation and how they have been or could be harnessed to design efficient immunotherapies.",Immunologic diseases.

Lymph Node T Cell Dynamics and Novel Strategies for HIV Cure,"Constantinos Petrovas, Vijayakumar Velu",Frontiers Media SA,2019-02-11,"Currently, more than 36 million people are infected with HIV. Although the introduction of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) has led to substantial advances in the clinical management of HIV infected individuals, HAART cannot completely eliminate the virus. This is because CD4 T helper cells, harboring the virus, remain dormant reservoirs. These reservoirs are difficult to measure and are present even in HAART-treated HIV infected individuals with undetectable levels of HIV in the blood. A growing body of studies has revealed follicular helper (Tfh) CD4 T cells, a highly differentiated CD4 T cell population localized in immunologically sanctuary sites (follicle/germinal center), as a major reservoir of HIV. The present Frontiers in Immunology eBook compiles 16 timely review articles focusing on the dynamics of major follicular immune cell types in HIV/SIV infection and their potential role for disease pathogenesis and the viral persistence in the lymph node. This eBook provides a comprehensive presentation of recent published work on lymph node and especially Tfh cell dynamics in HIV infection and we hope that it will be useful for our further understanding of how such dynamics affect the interplay between virus and host as well as for the discovery of novel therapeutic targets in the fight against HIV.",,186,N/A,0,en

"Race, Rigor, and Selectivity in U. S. Engineering",Amy E. Slaton,Harvard University Press,2010-06-01,"Despite the educational and professional advances made by minorities in recent decades, African Americans remain woefully underrepresented in the fields of science, technology, mathematics, and engineering. Even at its peak, in 2000, African American representation in engineering careers reached only 5.7 percent, while blacks made up 15 percent of the U.S. population. Some forty-five years after the Civil Rights Act sought to eliminate racial differences in education and employment, what do we make of an occupational pattern that perpetually follows the lines of race? Race, Rigor, and Selectivity in U.S. Engineering pursues this question and its ramifications through historical case studies. Focusing on engineering programs in three settings--in Maryland, Illinois, and Texas, from the 1940s through the 1990s--Amy E. Slaton examines efforts to expand black opportunities in engineering as well as obstacles to those reforms. Her study reveals aspects of admissions criteria and curricular emphases that work against proportionate black involvement in many engineering programs. Slaton exposes the negative impact of conservative ideologies in engineering, and of specific institutional processes--ideas and practices that are as limiting for the field of engineering as they are for the goal of greater racial parity in the profession.",Technology & Engineering,302,N/A,0,en

Gene Therapy of Cancer,"Edmund C. Lattime, Stanton L. Gerson",Academic Press,2013-08-28,"Gene therapy as a treatment for cancer is at a critical point in its evolution. Exciting new developments in gene targeting and vector technology, coupled with results from the first generation of preclinical and clinical studies have led to the design and testing of new therapeutic approaches. The Third Edition of Gene Therapy of Cancer provides crucial updates on the basic and applied sciences of gene therapy. It offers a comprehensive assessment of the field including the areas of suicide gene therapy, oncogene and suppressor gene targeting, immunotherapy, drug resistance gene therapy, and the genetic modification of stem cells. Researchers at all levels of development, from basic laboratory investigators to clinical practitioners, will find this book to be instructive. Cancer gene therapy, like cancer therapy in general, is evolving rapidly, testing new concepts, targets and pathways, evoking new technologies, and passing new regulatory hurdles. Its essence, however, has not changed: the hope and challenges of returning altered genes to normal, using targeted gene expression to alter the function of both tumor and microenvironment, and in some cases normal cells, and delivering functionally important genes to specific cell types to increase sensitivity to killing or to protect normal cells from cancer therapies. In some instances, gene therapy for cancer forms a continuum from gene repair through the use of molecularly modified cells; the use of viral and non-viral vector based gene delivery to both tumor and tumor microenvironment; the use of viral and gene based vaccines; and development of new gene-based therapeutics. The unique mechanistically chosen vector platforms are at the heart of this technology because they allow for direct and selective cell death and transient to sustained delivery of vaccine molecules or molecules that affect the microenvironment, vasculature, or the immune response. - Explains the underlying cancer biology necessary for understanding proposed therapeutic approaches - Presents in-depth description of targeting systems and treatment strategies - Covers the breadth of gene therapy approaches including immunotherapeutic, drug resistance,oncolytic viruses, as well as regulatory perspectives from both the NCI and FDA",Medical,554,N/A,0,en

A Case for Climate Engineering,David Keith,MIT Press,2013-09-20,"A leading scientist argues that we must consider deploying climate engineering technology to slow the pace of global warming. Climate engineering—which could slow the pace of global warming by injecting reflective particles into the upper atmosphere—has emerged in recent years as an extremely controversial technology. And for good reason: it carries unknown risks and it may undermine commitments to conserving energy. Some critics also view it as an immoral human breach of the natural world. The latter objection, David Keith argues in A Scientist's Case for Climate Engineering, is groundless; we have been using technology to alter our environment for years. But he agrees that there are large issues at stake. A leading scientist long concerned about climate change, Keith offers no naïve proposal for an easy fix to what is perhaps the most challenging question of our time; climate engineering is no silver bullet. But he argues that after decades during which very little progress has been made in reducing carbon emissions we must put this technology on the table and consider it responsibly. That doesn't mean we will deploy it, and it doesn't mean that we can abandon efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But we must understand fully what research needs to be done and how the technology might be designed and used. This book provides a clear and accessible overview of what the costs and risks might be, and how climate engineering might fit into a larger program for managing climate change.",Science,224,N/A,0,en

The Taxobook,Marjorie M.K. Hlava,Springer Nature,2022-06-01,"This book is the third of a three-part series on taxonomies, and covers putting your taxonomy into use in as many ways as possible to maximize retrieval for your users. Chapter 1 suggests several items to research and consider before you start your implementation and integration process. It explores the different pieces of software that you will need for your system and what features to look for in each. Chapter 2 launches with a discussion of how taxonomy terms can be used within a workflow, connecting two—or more—taxonomies, and intelligent coordination of platforms and taxonomies. Microsoft SharePoint is a widely used and popular program, and I consider their use of taxonomies in this chapter. Following that is a discussion of taxonomies and semantic integration and then the relationship between indexing and the hierarchy of a taxonomy. Chapter 3 (“How is a Taxonomy Connected to Search?”) provides discussions and examples of putting taxonomies into use in practical applications. It discusses displaying content based on search, how taxonomy is connected to search, using a taxonomy to guide a searcher, tools for search, including search engines, crawlers and spiders, and search software, the parts of a search-capable system, and then how to assemble that search-capable system. This chapter also examines how to measure quality in search, the different kinds of search, and theories on search from several famous theoreticians—two from the 18th and 19th centuries, and two contemporary. Following that is a section on inverted files, parsing, discovery, and clustering. While you probably don’t need a comprehensive understanding of these concepts to build a solid, workable system, enough information is provided for the reader to see how they fit into the overall scheme. This chapter concludes with a look at faceted search and some possibilities for search interfaces. Chapter 4, “Implementing a Taxonomy in a Database or on a Website,” starts where many content systems really should—with the authors, or at least the people who create the content. This chapter discusses matching up various groups of related data to form connections, data visualization and text analytics, and mobile and e-commerce applications for taxonomies. Finally, Chapter 5 presents some educated guesses about the future of knowledge organization. Table of Contents: List of Figures / Preface / Acknowledgments / On Your Mark, Get Ready .... WAIT!

Autoimmuno-Anti-Tumour Immunity (AATI) – Understanding the Immune Responses against “Self” & “Altered-self”,Fang-Ping Huang,Frontiers Media SA,2017-05-16,"The brief description of tumours being “wounds that do not heal” by Dr Harold F. Dworak nearly three decades ago (N Engl J Med 1986) has provided not only a vivid illustration of neoplastic diseases in general but also, in retrospect conceptually, a plausible immunological definition of cancers. Based on our current understanding in the field, it could have even a multi-dimensional meaning attached with. This relates to several important issues which need to be addressed further, i.e. in terms of a close link between chronic inflammation and tumourigenesis widely observed; clinical and experimental evidence of immunity against tumours versus the highly immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment being associated; and their underlying immunological mechanisms, oncogenic basis, as well as the true causal relationship in question. Recent findings from studies into the pathogenesis of autoimmunity and, more importantly, the mechanisms which protect against it, have offered some new insights for our understanding in this direction. Chronic or persistent autoimmune-like inflammatory conditions are evidently associated with tumor development. The important question is about their true causal relationship. Chronic or persistent inflammation has been shown to contribute directly to tumour development by triggering neoplastic transformation and production of inflammatory mediators which could promote cancer cell survival, proliferation and invasion. On the other hand, tumours are mutated self-tissue cells to which the host immune system is largely tolerized otherwise. Although the mutations may give rise to the expression of tumour-specific antigens (TSA) or tumour-associated antigens (TAA), most of these TSAs/TAAs are found to be poor immunogens. The ongoing inflammatory conditions may therefore reflect a desperate attempt of the host immune system to mount anti-tumour responses, though ineffectively, being a consequence of the continuous yet largely futile triggering by those poorly immunogenic TSAs/TAAs. Furthermore, during autoimmune or overtly persistent immunological responses, many regulatory mechanisms are triggered in the host in attempts to limit the ongoing harmful inflammatory reactions. Such a negative feedback regulation is known to be crucial in preventing normal individuals from immune-mediated diseases. As a result of the negative feedback loop, however, an excessive production of anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive molecules followed by the exhaustion of the immune effector cells may instead lower the ability of the host immune system to mount specific anti-tumor responses, allowing the escape of tumour or mutated cells from immunosurveillance. This may also help to explain why the most effective way to enhance host immunity against cancer is by targeting the negative arm of immune regulation. In this Frontiers Research Topic, we aim to gather current views from experts in these inherent overlapping fields of oncology, autoimmunity and tumour immunology, and to make them available to our potential readership who may be particularly interested in this cutting-edge area. By understanding how the immune system is normally regulated, why dysregulation of which may cause the immunological-oncological related diseases, we also encourage further discussions as to how the so-called ""self-reactivity"" (autoimmune responses) can be alternatively switched on and redirected, immunologically or molecularly, for effective cancer treatment.",,176,N/A,0,en

Nuclear Medicine and Immunology,"Sara Harsini, Abass Alavi, Nima Rezaei",Springer Nature,2021-11-24,"This book explores the close connection between immunology and nuclear medicine, which has led to radioimmunoimaging and radioimmunotherapy (RIT). Molecular imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is increasingly being used to diagnose, characterize, and monitor disease activity in the context of inflammatory disorders of known and unknown etiology, such as sarcoidosis, atherosclerosis, vasculitis, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and degenerative joint disease. The first chapters discuss the various radiopharmaceutical agents and radiolabeled preparations that have been employed in inflammation imaging. Of these, FDG-PET imaging has been shown to have the great value in the detection of inflammation and has become the centerpiece of several initiatives over the last several years. This very powerful technique will play an increasingly important role in the management of patients with inflammatory conditions in the future. The book also explores the growing role of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The rapid pace of change has been fueled by advances in our understanding of tumor biology, on the one hand, and the development of specifically targeted medical therapies, diagnostic agents, and radiotherapies, on the other.

The innovative data-oriented programming paradigm makes your systems less complex by making it simpler to access and manipulate data. In Data-Oriented Programming you will learn how to: Separate code from data Represent data with generic data structures Manipulate data with general-purpose functions Manage state without mutating data Control concurrency in highly scalable systems Write data-oriented unit tests Specify the shape of your data Benefit from polymorphism without objects Debug programs without a debugger Data-Oriented Programming is a one-of-a-kind guide that introduces the data-oriented paradigm. This groundbreaking approach represents data with generic immutable data structures. It simplifies state management, eases concurrency, and does away with the common problems you’ll find in object-oriented code. The book presents powerful new ideas through conversations, code snippets, and diagrams that help you quickly grok what’s great about DOP. Best of all, the paradigm is language-agnostic—you’ll learn to write DOP code that can be implemented in JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Clojure, and also in traditional OO languages like Java or C#. Forewords by Michael T. Nygard and Ryan Singer. About the technology Code that combines behavior and data, as is common in object-oriented designs, can introduce almost unmanageable complexity for state management. The Data-oriented programming (DOP) paradigm simplifies state management by holding application data in immutable generic data structures and then performing calculations using non-mutating general-purpose functions. Your applications are free of state-related bugs and your code is easier to understand and maintain. About the book Data-Oriented Programming teaches you to design software using the groundbreaking data-oriented paradigm. You’ll put DOP into action to design data models for business entities and implement a library management system that manages state without data mutation.

Indian Tales,Rudyard Kipling,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,1890,"""Or ever the knightly years were gone With the old world to the grave, I was a king in Babylon And you were a Christian slave,"" -W.E. Henley. His name was Charlie Mears; he was the only son of his mother who was a widow, and he lived in the north of London, coming into the City every day to work in a bank. He was twenty years old and suffered from aspirations. I met him in a public billiard-saloon where the marker called him by his given name, and he called the marker ""Bullseyes."" Charlie explained, a little nervously, that he had only come to the place to look on, and since looking on at games of skill is not a cheap amusement for the young, I suggested that Charlie should go back to his mother. That was our first step toward better acquaintance. He would call on me sometimes in the evenings instead of running about London with his fellow-clerks; and before long, speaking of himself as a young man must, he told me of his aspirations, which were all literary. He desired to make himself an undying name chiefly through verse, though he was not above sending stories of love and death to the drop-a-penny-in-the-slot journals.",Fiction,796,4.5,2,en

Degrees and Pedigrees,Michael T. Nietzel,Rowman & Littlefield,2017-08-10,"The book answers the questions of how and where America educates its leading chief executive officers. Where are America’s top executives educated? What do they study? Do they typically attend the nation’s most elite colleges? Or do they, like millions of other students, choose colleges because of reasons like proximity, cost, and state pride? How important are advanced degrees to their success? Is the MBA a prerequisite for becoming a CEO? I address these questions based on a study of 344 of the country’s highest profile CEOs selected to represent a wide range of organizations and businesses. The book will establish a theme that the majority of America's most high-powered CEOs did not attend elite colleges/universities or earn an MBA or graduate from highly selective institutions. Certainly, a significant number did so and were advantaged by the opportunity, but more often they were able to fashion for themselves a high-quality education at a rich array of institutions - public and private, regional and flagship, small and large, religious and secular. What proves more important than what colleges these leading executives attended, is the kinds of deep relationships and mentored experiences they developed. I illuminate these experiences through several vignettes in each chapter.",Education,147,N/A,0,en

Handbook of Human Systems Integration,Harold R. Booher,John Wiley & Sons,2003-07-07,"A groundbreaking look at how technology with a human touch is revolutionizing government and industry Human Systems Integration (HSI) is very attractive as a new integrating discipline designed to help move business and engineering cultures toward a more people-technology orientation. Over the past decade, the United States and foreign governments have developed a wide range of tools, techniques, and technologies aimed at integrating human factors into engineering systems in order to achieve important cost and performance benefits that otherwise would not have been accomplished. In order for this new discipline to be effective, however, a cultural change is needed that must start with organizational leadership. Handbook of Human Systems Integration outlines the principles and methods that can be used to help integrate people, technology, and organizations with a common objective toward designing, developing, and operating systems effectively and efficiently. Handbook of Human Systems Integration is broad in scope, covering both public and commercial processes as they interface with systems engineering processes. Emphasizing the importance of management and organization concepts as well as the technical uniqueness of HSI, Handbook of Human Systems Integration features: * More than ninety contributors, technical advisors, and reviewers from government, industry, and academia * Comprehensive coverage of the most recent HSI developments, particularly in presenting the cutting-edge tools, techniques, and methodologies utilized by each of the HSI domains * Chapters representing the governments and industries of the United Kingdom and Canada * Contributions from three services of the Department of Defense along with the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Academy of Sciences * Many chapters covering both military and nonmilitary applications * Concepts widely used by government contractors both in the United States and abroad This book will be of special interest to HSI practitioners, systems engineers, and managers, as well as government and industry decision-makers who must weigh the recommendations of all multidisciplines contributing to systems performance, safety, and costs in order to make sound systems acquisition decisions.",Technology & Engineering,996,N/A,0,en

World Directory of Crystallographers,"Allan L. Bednowitz, Armin P. Segmüller",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-04-17,"A brief historical account of the background leading to the publication of the first four editions of the World Directory of Crystallographers was presented by G. Boom in his preface to the Fourth Edition, published late in 1971. That edition was produced by traditional typesetting methods from compilations of biographical data prepared by national Sub-Editors. The major effort required to produce a directory by manual methods provided the impetus to use computer techniques for the Fifth Edition. The account of the production of the first computer assisted Directory was described by S.C. Abrahams in the preface of the Fifth Edition. Computer composition, which required a machine readable data base, offered several major advantages. The choice of typeface and range of characters was flexible. Corrections and additions to the data base were rapid and, once established, it was hoped updating for future editions would be simple and inexpensive. The data base was put to other Union uses, such as preparation of mailing labels and formulation of lists of crystallographers with specified common fields of interest. The Fifth Edition of the World Directory of Crystallographers was published in June of 1977, the Sixth in May of 1981. The Subject Indexes for the Fifth and Sixth Editions were printed in 1978 and 1981 respectively, both having a limited distribution.",Science,275,N/A,0,en

The Creation Controversy,Dorothy Nelkin,iUniverse,2000,"In 1999, by the board of education in Kansas voted to delete all mention of evolution from the state’s recommended science curriculum and also from its educational assessment tests. This decision, and similar decisions in other states, suggest the persistence of creationists and their ability to capture sufficient support to influence educational policies. Although evolutionary ideas have become increasing important to many scientific fields, the creationists still have significant influence on science curriculum. How have religious fundamentalists and right wing conservatives managed to have such influence? In this science-dominated age, why is their such opposition to the teaching of evolution? This book places the Kansas decision in the broader context of the controversy between creationists and evolutionists, as a group of religious fundamentalists who defined themselves as scientists have challenged the most basic assumptions of contemporary biology. Though motivated by religious beliefs, they have tried to bypass the Constitutional requirement for the separation of church and state as they seek to influence legislature and school boards. Looking at the people involved in this social movement and tracing changes in their arguments and strategies, this book links the creation-evolution controversy to broader questions about the meaning of religion in a secular science, public trust in science, and persistent concerns about its social and moral implications.",Education,250,N/A,0,en

The Diversity Machine,Frederick R. Lynch,Routledge,2017-07-05,"""Diversity"" has become the turn-of-the-century buzzword. Republican and Democratic leaders ritually chant ""diversity is our strength"" and corporate CEOs talk about the need to create a ""workforce that looks like America."" Most corporate mission statements now contain a clause on ""valuing differences"" and millions of employees have completed-or soon will undergo-some sort of ""diversity training."" Where did all this come from -and why? Who created diversity programs? How do they differ? How effective are these policies? Can they do more harm than good in organizations and in the wider society?During the past decade, sociologist Frederick R. Lynch studied the rise of a social policy movement that has successfully moved multiculturalism from universities and foundations into the courts, mass media, and the American workplace. The new diversity policies are future-oriented and market-driven, eclipsing ""old"" affirmative action debates about overcoming past discrimination against blacks.Based on more than six years of field research and hundreds of interviews, Lynch tracks the development and impact of different forms of diversity policies at dozens of consultant gatherings, in the business and professional literature and through in-depth case studies such as the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. He profiles the major consultants who have powered the diversity machine, analyzes the benefits and drawbacks of various approaches to workplace diversity and provides numerous ""you-are-there"" samples of workshops, seminars, and conferences.The book is written for the general reader interested in public-policy issues, social scientists, and others interested in the origins and consequences of workplace diversity policies.",Social Science,465,N/A,0,en

Concurrent Engineering,"C.S. Syan, U. Menon",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"BACKGROUND There is an increasing awareness that 'time to market' is the key competitive issue in the manufacturing industry today. The global markets are demanding products that are well designed, are of high quality and are at low prices with ever decreasing lead times. Hence manufacturers are forced to utilize the best methods of technology with efficient control and management accompanied by suitably enabling organizational structures. Concurrent engineering (CE) is widely seen to be the methodology that can help satisfy these strenuous demands and keep the profitability and viability of product developers, manufacturers and suppliers high. There have been many reported successes of CE in practice. Rover were able to launch Land Rover Discovery in 18 months as compared with 48-63 months for similar products in Europe. Because of its early introduction to the market it became the best selling product in its class. AT&T report part counts down to one ninth of their previous levels and quality one hundred times (in surface defects) for VLSI (very improvements of large scale integration) circuits as a result of using the CE approach. WHO SHOULD READ THIS TEXT? This book will aim to provide a sound basis for the very diverse subject known as concurrent engineering. Concurrent engineering is recognized by an increasingly large proportion of the manufacturing industry as a necessity in order to compete in today's markets. This recognition has created the demand for information, awareness and training in good concurrent engineering practice.",Technology & Engineering,239,N/A,0,en

Learning to Go to School in Japan,Lois Peak,Univ of California Press,2023-11-10,"Japanese two-year-olds are indulged, dependent, and undisciplined toddlers, but by the age of six they have become obedient, self-reliant, and cooperative students. When Lois Peak traveled to Japan in search of the ""magical childrearing technique"" behind this transformation, she discovered that the answer lies not in the family but in the preschool, where teachers gently train their pupils in proper group behavior. Using case studies drawn from two contrasting schools, Peak documents the important early stages of socialization in Japanese culture. Contrary to popular perceptions, Japanese preschools are play-centered environments that pay little attention to academic preparation. It is here that Japanese children learn their first lessons in group life. The primary goal of these cheerful--even boisterous--settings is not to teach academic facts of learning-readiness skills but to inculcate behavior and attitudes appropriate to life in public social situations. Peak compares the behavior considered permissible at home with that required of children at preschool, and argues that the teacher is expected to be the primary agent in the child's transition. Step by step, she brings the socialization process to life, through a skillful combination of classroom observations, interviews with mothers and teachers, transcripts of classroom events, and quotations from Japanese professional literature.",Social Science,231,N/A,0,en

Mechanistic Data Science for STEM Education and Applications,"Wing Kam Liu, Zhengtao Gan, Mark Fleming",Springer Nature,2022-01-01,"This book introduces Mechanistic Data Science (MDS) as a structured methodology for combining data science tools with mathematical scientific principles (i.e., “mechanistic” principles) to solve intractable problems. Traditional data science methodologies require copious quantities of data to show a reliable pattern, but the amount of required data can be greatly reduced by considering the mathematical science principles. MDS is presented here in six easy-to-follow modules: 1) Multimodal data generation and collection, 2) extraction of mechanistic features, 3) knowledge-driven dimension reduction, 4) reduced order surrogate models, 5) deep learning for regression and classification, and 6) system and design. These data science and mechanistic analysis steps are presented in an intuitive manner that emphasizes practical concepts for solving engineering problems as well as real-life problems. This book is written in a spectral style and is ideal as an entry level textbook for engineering and data science undergraduate and graduate students, practicing scientists and engineers, as well as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) high school students and teachers.",Technology & Engineering,287,N/A,0,en

Listening to Rosita,Mary Ann Villarreal,University of Oklahoma Press,2015-10-20,"Everybody in the bar had to drop a quarter in the jukebox or be shamed by “Momo” Villarreal. It wasn’t about the money, Mary Ann Villarreal’s grandmother insisted. It was about the music—more songs for all the patrons of the Pecan Lounge in Tivoli, Texas. But for Mary Ann, whose schoolbooks those quarters bought, the money didn’t hurt. When as an adult Villarreal began to wonder how the few recordings of women singers made their way into that jukebox, questions about the money seemed inseparable from those about the music. In Listening to Rosita, Villarreal seeks answers by pursuing the story of a small group of Tejana singers and entrepreneurs in Corpus Christi, Houston, and San Antonio—the “Texas Triangle”—during the mid-twentieth century. Ultimately she recovers a social world and cultural landscape in central south Texas where Mexican American women negotiated the shifting boundaries of race and economics to assert a public presence. Drawing on oral history, interviews, and insights from ethnic and gender studies, Listening to Rosita provides a counternarrative to previous research on la música tejana, which has focused almost solely on musicians or musical genres. Villarreal instead chronicles women’s roles and contributions to the music industry. In spotlighting the sixty-year singing career of San Antonian Rosita Fernández, the author pulls the curtain back on all the women whose names and stories have been glaringly absent from the ethnic and economic history of Tejana music and culture. In this oral history of the Tejana cantantes who performed and owned businesses in the Texas Triangle, Listening to Rosita shows how ethnic Mexican entrepreneurs developed a unique identity in striving for success in a society that demeaned and segregated them. In telling their story, this book supplies a critical chapter long missing from the history of the West.",History,251,N/A,0,en

The Madame Curie Complex,Julie Des Jardins,The Feminist Press at CUNY,2010-03-01,"The historian and author of Lillian Gilbreth examines the “Great Man” myth of science with profiles of women scientists from Marie Curie to Jane Goodall. Why is science still considered to be predominantly male profession? In The Madame Curie Complex, Julie Des Jardin dismantles the myth of the lone male genius, reframing the history of science with revelations about women’s substantial contributions to the field. She explores the lives of some of the most famous female scientists, including Jane Goodall, the eminent primatologist; Rosalind Franklin, the chemist whose work anticipated the discovery of DNA’s structure; Rosalyn Yalow, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist; and, of course, Marie Curie, the Nobel Prize-winning pioneer whose towering, mythical status has both empowered and stigmatized future generations of women considering a life in science. With lively anecdotes and vivid detail, The Madame Curie Complex reveals how women scientists have changed the course of science—and the role of the scientist—throughout the twentieth century. They often asked different questions, used different methods, and came up with different, groundbreaking explanations for phenomena in the natural world.",Biography & Autobiography,329,N/A,0,en

The Alchemy of Air,Thomas Hager,Crown,2008-09-09,"A sweeping history of tragic genius, cutting-edge science, and the Haber-Bosch discovery that changed billions of lives—including your own. At the dawn of the twentieth century, humanity was facing global disaster: Mass starvation was about to become a reality. A call went out to the world’ s scientists to find a solution. This is the story of the two men who found it: brilliant, self-important Fritz Haber and reclusive, alcoholic Carl Bosch. Together they discovered a way to make bread out of air, built city-sized factories, and saved millions of lives. But their epochal triumph came at a price we are still paying. The Haber-Bosch process was also used to make the gunpowder and explosives that killed millions during the two world wars. Both men were vilified during their lives; both, disillusioned and disgraced, died tragically. The Alchemy of Air is the extraordinary, previously untold story of a discovery that changed the way we grow food and the way we make war–and that promises to continue shaping our lives in fundamental and dramatic ways.",Science,338,5,2,en

The Perfectionists,Simon Winchester,HarperCollins,2018-05-08,"“Another gem from one of the world’s justly celebrated historians specializing in unusual and always fascinating subjects and people.” — Booklist (starred review) The revered New York Times bestselling author traces the development of technology from the Industrial Age to the Digital Age to explore the single component crucial to advancement—precision—in a superb history that is both an homage and a warning for our future. The rise of manufacturing could not have happened without an attention to precision. At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in eighteenth-century England, standards of measurement were established, giving way to the development of machine tools—machines that make machines. Eventually, the application of precision tools and methods resulted in the creation and mass production of items from guns and glass to mirrors, lenses, and cameras—and eventually gave way to further breakthroughs, including gene splicing, microchips, and the Hadron Collider. Simon Winchester takes us back to origins of the Industrial Age, to England where he introduces the scientific minds that helped usher in modern production: John Wilkinson, Henry Maudslay, Joseph Bramah, Jesse Ramsden, and Joseph Whitworth. It was Thomas Jefferson who later exported their discoveries to the fledgling United States, setting the nation on its course to become a manufacturing titan. Winchester moves forward through time, to today’s cutting-edge developments occurring around the world, from America to Western Europe to Asia. As he introduces the minds and methods that have changed the modern world, Winchester explores fundamental questions. Why is precision important? What are the different tools we use to measure it? Who has invented and perfected it? Has the pursuit of the ultra-precise in so many facets of human life blinded us to other things of equal value, such as an appreciation for the age-old traditions of craftsmanship, art, and high culture? Are we missing something that reflects the world as it is, rather than the world as we think we would wish it to be? And can the precise and the natural co-exist in society?",History,545,5,1,en

Introduction to Probability for Data Science,Stanley H. Chan,Michigan Publishing Services,2021,"""Probability is one of the most interesting subjects in electrical engineering and computer science. It bridges our favorite engineering principles to the practical reality, a world that is full of uncertainty. However, because probability is such a mature subject, the undergraduate textbooks alone might fill several rows of shelves in a library. When the literature is so rich, the challenge becomes how one can pierce through to the insight while diving into the details. For example, many of you have used a normal random variable before, but have you ever wondered where the 'bell shape' comes from? Every probability class will teach you about flipping a coin, but how can 'flipping a coin' ever be useful in machine learning today? Data scientists use the Poisson random variables to model the internet traffic, but where does the gorgeous Poisson equation come from? This book is designed to fill these gaps with knowledge that is essential to all data science students."" -- Preface.",Computer science and applied mathematics,0,N/A,0,en

The Economics of Artificial Intelligence,"Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, Avi Goldfarb, Catherine Tucker",University of Chicago Press,2024-03-05,"A timely investigation of the potential economic effects, both realized and unrealized, of artificial intelligence within the United States healthcare system. In sweeping conversations about the impact of artificial intelligence on many sectors of the economy, healthcare has received relatively little attention. Yet it seems unlikely that an industry that represents nearly one-fifth of the economy could escape the efficiency and cost-driven disruptions of AI. The Economics of Artificial Intelligence: Health Care Challenges brings together contributions from health economists, physicians, philosophers, and scholars in law, public health, and machine learning to identify the primary barriers to entry of AI in the healthcare sector. Across original papers and in wide-ranging responses, the contributors analyze barriers of four types: incentives, management, data availability, and regulation. They also suggest that AI has the potential to improve outcomes and lower costs. Understanding both the benefits of and barriers to AI adoption is essential for designing policies that will affect the evolution of the healthcare system.",Business & Economics,172,N/A,0,en

Railway Management and Engineering,V Profillidis,Routledge,2017-11-30,"In a rapidly changing world, with increasing competition in all sectors of transportation, railways are in a period of restructuring their management and technology. New methods of organization are introduced, commercial and tariff policies change radically, a more entrepreneurial spirit is required. At the same time, new high-speed tracks are being constructed and old tracks are renewed, high-comfort rolling stock vehicles are being introduced, logistics and combined transport are being developed. Awareness of environmental issues and search for greater safety give to the railways a new role within the transportation system. Meanwhile, methods of analysis have significantly evolved, principally due to computer applications and new ways of thinking and approaching old problems. Therefore it becomes necessary to come up with a new scientific approach to tackle management and engineering aspects of railways, to understand in-depth the origins and inter-relationships of the various situations and phenomena and to suggest the appropriate methods and solutions to solve the various emerging problems. This book aims to cover the need for a new scientific approach for railways. It is written for railway managers, economists and engineers, consulting economists and engineers, students of schools of engineering, transportation and management. The book is divided into three distinct parts: Part A deals with the management of railways, Part B deals with the track and, Part C deals with rolling stock and environmental topics. Each chapter of the book contains the necessary theoretical analysis of the phenomena studied, the recommended solutions, applications, charts and design of the specific railway component. In this way, both the requirement for a theoretical analysis is met, and the need of the railway manager and engineer for tables, nomographs, regulations, etc. is satisfied. Railways in Europe have separated activities of infrastructure from those of operation. In other parts of the world, however, railways remain unified. The book addresses both situation. Railways present great differences in their technologies. Something may be valid for one such technology, but not for another. To overcome this problem, regulations of the International Union of Railways (UIC) as well as European Standardization (CEN) have been used to the greatest extent possible. Whenever a specific technology or method is presented, the limits of its application are clearly emphasized.",Business & Economics,500,N/A,0,en

Mobile OS Vulnerabilities,"Shivi Garg, Niyati Baliyan",CRC Press,2023-08-17,"This is book offers in-depth analysis of security vulnerabilities in different mobile operating systems. It provides methodology and solutions for handling Android malware and vulnerabilities and transfers the latest knowledge in machine learning and deep learning models towards this end. Further, it presents a comprehensive analysis of software vulnerabilities based on different technical parameters such as causes, severity, techniques, and software systems’ type. Moreover, the book also presents the current state of the art in the domain of software threats and vulnerabilities. This would help analyze various threats that a system could face, and subsequently, it could guide the securityengineer to take proactive and cost-effective countermeasures. Security threats are escalating exponentially, thus posing a serious challenge to mobile platforms. Android and iOS are prominent due to their enhanced capabilities and popularity among users. Therefore, it is important to compare these two mobile platforms based on security aspects. Android proved to be more vulnerable compared to iOS. The malicious apps can cause severe repercussions such as privacy leaks, app crashes, financial losses (caused by malware triggered premium rate SMSs), arbitrary code installation, etc. Hence, Android security is a major concern amongst researchers as seen in the last few years. This book provides an exhaustive review of all the existing approaches in a structured format. The book also focuses on the detection of malicious applications that compromise users' security and privacy, the detection performance of the different program analysis approach, and the influence of different input generators during static and dynamic analysis on detection performance. This book presents a novel method using an ensemble classifier scheme for detecting malicious applications, which is less susceptible to the evolution of the Android ecosystem and malware compared to previous methods. The book also introduces an ensemble multi-class classifier scheme to classify malware into known families. Furthermore, we propose a novel framework of mapping malware to vulnerabilities exploited using Android malware’s behavior reports leveraging pre-trained language models and deep learning techniques. The mapped vulnerabilities can then be assessed on confidentiality, integrity, and availability on different Android components and sub-systems, and different layers.",Computers,190,N/A,0,en

Int. du Béton,2017,"fib Bulletin 81 reports the latest information available to researchers and practitioners on the analysis, design and experimental evidence of punching shear of structural concrete slabs. It follows previous efforts by the International Federation for Structural Concrete (fib) and its predecessor the Euro-International Committee for Concrete (CEB), through CEB Bulletin 168, Punching Shear in Reinforced Concrete (1985) and fibBulletin 12, Punching of structural concrete slabs (2001), and an international symposium sponsored by the punching shear subcommittee of ACI Committee 445 (Shear and Torsion) and held in Kansas City, Mo., USA, in 2005. This bulletin contains 18 papers that were presented in three sessions as part of an international symposium held in Philadelphia, Pa., USA, on October 25, 2016. The symposium was co-organized by the punching shear sub-committee of ACI 445 and by fib Working Party 2.2.3 (Punching and Shear in Slabs) with the objectives of not only disseminating information on this important design subject but also promoting harmonization among the various design theories and treatment of key aspects of punching shear design. The papers are organized in the same order they were presented in the symposium. The symposium honored Professor Emeritus Neil M. Hawkins (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA), whose contributions through the years in the field of punching shear of structural concrete slabs have been paramount. The papers cover key aspects related to punching shear of structural concrete slabs under different loading conditions, the study of size effect on punching capacity of slabs, the effect of slab reinforcement ratio on the response and failure mode of slabs, without and with shear reinforcement, and its implications for the design and formulation in codes of practice, an examination of different analytical tools to predict the punching shear response of slabs, the study of the post-punching response of concrete slabs, the evaluation of design provisions in modern codes based on recent experimental evidence and new punching shear theories, and an overview of the combined efforts undertaken jointly by ACI 445 and fib WP 2.2.3 to generate test result databanks for the evaluation and calibration of punching shear design recommendations in North American and international codes of practice.",Technology & Engineering,396,N/A,0,en

Systems Engineering with SysML/UML,Tim Weilkiens,Elsevier,2011-08-29,"UML, the Universal Modeling Language, was the first programming language designed to fulfill the requirement for ""universality."" However, it is a software-specific language, and does not support the needs of engineers designing from the broader systems-based perspective. Therefore, SysML was created. It has been steadily gaining popularity, and many companies, especially in the heavily-regulated Defense, Automotive, Aerospace, Medical Device and Telecomms industries, are already using SysML, or are plannning to switch over to it in the near future. However, little information is currently available on the market regarding SysML. Its use is just on the crest of becoming a widespread phenomenon, and so thousands of software engineers are now beginning to look for training and resources. This book will serve as the one-stop, definitive guide that provide an introduction to SysML, and instruction on how to implement it, for all these new users. - SysML is the latest emerging programming language--250,000 estimated software systems engineers are using it in the US alone! - The first available book on SysML in English - Insider information! The author is a member of the SysML working group and has written sections of the specification - Special focus comparing SysML and UML, and explaining how both can work together",Computers,320,N/A,0,en

Environmental Engineering: Review for the Professional Engineering Examination,"Ashok V.

Licensure demonstrates high standards of professionalism, knowledge, and ability. Because of the work experience requirement, PE examinees have generally been out of school for some time. This book summarizes the theoretical background of topics covered in the exam, which will help potential examinees refresh their memories on subjects they may not have been exposed to since their undergraduate classes. Another advantage of using this book to prepare for the PE exam is that two or three ""logical distractors"" (answers that result from common mistakes) are included among the answer choices for each problem. The solutions to the problems also explain why the logical distractors are incorrect. Research has shown that this is an efficient teaching tool. Thus, the inclusion of these logical distractors and their explanations will give individuals a better foundation in the subject matter in a shorter period of time. Although this book is intended primarily to help engineers prepare for the PE environmental engineering examination, it will also be useful in undergraduate engineering courses that cover environmental engineering topics.",Science,275,N/A,0,en

Roads to Higher Dimensional Polytopic Projects,Octavian Iordache,Springer Nature,2022-08-18,"High dimensional reference architectures presented here allows confronting and prevailing over the growing complexity of polytopic projects implementations. Such projects should be envisaged giving that conventional systems operations, equipments, methodologies or organizations will reach their limits for self-evolvability in high complexity conditions. Self-evolvable high complexity systems are based on high dimensional polytopic reference architectures. Polytope is the general term of the sequence: point, line, polygon, polyhedron and so on.The polytopic projects are targeting the artificiality, not only for materials where it is well known and applied, but also for biological, cognitive, intelligent and mathematical systems. The book highlights the polytopic projects basic similarity despite the noticeable difference as domains of application. The roads to follow and the algebra of changing roads are emphasized. The book is divided in 9 chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the Polytopic Roadmap to 4D and beyond. The role for the dialogue of processes in duality of the non-Aristotelian Logic of Contradiction and of Included Middle is emphasized for different domains. Chapter 2 refers to chemical systems. Supramolecular chemistry, metal organic frameworks, MOF, and reaction networks, are the examples considered in the frame of polytopic chemistry. Chapter 3 refers to biological systems. Biological dynamical hierarchies and quasi-species are the considered case studies. Technological and scientific projects targeting artificiality for cells and viruses are considered. Chapter 4 refers to cognitive systems. Developmental stages, formal and relational concepts analysis, and neural coding are considered here. The roles of the 4D systems of systems of systems and of conceptual 4D-cube are emphasized. Artificiality for cognitive systems is the object of study. Chapter 5 refers to mathematical systems. Modeling levels and the 4D digital twins are discussed. Hopf monoids as tools for the study of combinations and separations, dual graded graphs and V-models are informally presented. Chapter 6 refers to application of formal concept analysis, FCA, for high dimensional separations, nesting and drug delivery. Chapter 7 refers to polytopic engineering systems as multiscale transfer, distributors-collectors, cyclic operations, middle vessel columns, mixing, assembly and designs. Equipments have been characterized using Polytopic Roadmaps and classified by Periodic Tables. Chapter 8 introduces polytopic industry, economy, society and sustainability. Chapter 9 outlines new domains of interest as arts and architecture, transdisciplinarity, complex systems and unity of sciences and engineering. Polytopic Roadmaps are proposed as Method for experts from various fields to synthesize their thinking and capabilities into new projects implementation to face and surpass high complexity. A repetitive finding of this book is that self-evolvability observed in physical systems is based on the same directed sequence of reference architectures as the self-evolvability of concepts in our mind. Continuing to develop the field of self-evolvable systems and presenting the polytopic roadmaps for 4D and beyond advances in ever growing complexity domains, the book will be useful to engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and students in different branches of production, complex systems sciences and engineering, ecology and applied mathematics.",Technology & Engineering,221,N/A,0,en

Theory of Technical Systems,"Vladimir Hubka, W. Ernst Eder",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This book presents a comprehensive and unifying theory to promote the under standing of technical systems. Such a theory is useful as a foundation for a ratio nal approach to the engineering design process, as a background to engineering education, and other applications. The term ""technical system"" is used to represent all types of man-made artifacts, including technical products and processes. The technical system is therefore the subject (in the grammatical sense of the word) of the collection of activities which are performed by engineers within the processes of engineering design, including generating, retrieving, processing and transmitting of information about products. It is also the subject of various tasks in the production process, including work preparation and production planning, and in many economic considerations, company-internal and societal. In this way, the Theory of Technical Systems is a contribution to science, as in terpreted in the wider, Germanic sense of a ""co-ordinated and codified body of knowledge"". It brings together the various viewpoints of engineers, scientists, economists, ergonomists, managers, users, sociologists, etc., and shows where and how they influence the forms of engineering products. It also explains the influ ences that a product exerts on its environment. This Theory of Technical Systems should thus interest design engineers, and en gineers involved in production, management, sales, etc. In an interdisciplinary ap plication of value analysis, the Theory of Technical Systems should provide answers to many questions raised in this field.",Technology & Engineering,289,N/A,0,en

"The Art of Modeling in Science and Engineering with Mathematica, Second Edition","Diran Basmadjian, Ramin Farnood",CRC Press,2006-08-18,"Thoroughly revised and updated, The Art of Modeling in Science and Engineering with Mathematica®, Second Edition explores the mathematical tools and procedures used in modeling based on the laws of conservation of mass, energy, momentum, and electrical charge. The authors have culled and consolidated the best from the first edition and expanded the range of applied examples to reach a wider audience. The text proceeds, in measured steps, from simple models of real-world problems at the algebraic and ordinary differential equations (ODE) levels to more sophisticated models requiring partial differential equations. The traditional solution methods are supplemented with Mathematica , which is used throughout the text to arrive at solutions for many of the problems presented. The text is enlivened with a host of illustrations and practice problems drawn from classical and contemporary sources. They range from Thomson’s famous experiment to determine e/m and Euler’s model for the buckling of a strut to an analysis of the propagation of emissions and the performance of wind turbines. The mathematical tools required are first explained in separate chapters and then carried along throughout the text to solve and analyze the models. Commentaries at the end of each illustration draw attention to the pitfalls to be avoided and, perhaps most important, alert the reader to unexpected results that defy conventional wisdom. These features and more make the book the perfect tool for resolving three common difficulties: the proper choice of model, the absence of precise solutions, and the need to make suitable simplifying assumptions and approximations. The book covers a wide range of physical processes and phenomena drawn from various disciplines and clearly illuminates the link between the physical system being modeled and the mathematical expression that results.",Mathematics,536,N/A,0,en

Netcentric System of Systems Engineering with DEVS Unified Process,"Saurabh Mittal, José L. Risco Martín",CRC Press,2013-02-22,"In areas such as military, security, aerospace, and disaster management, the need for performance optimization and interoperability among heterogeneous systems is increasingly important. Model-driven engineering, a paradigm in which the model becomes the actual software, offers a promising approach toward systems of systems (SoS) engineering. However, model-driven engineering has largely been unachieved in complex dynamical systems and netcentric SoS, partly because modeling and simulation (M&S) frameworks are stove-piped and not designed for SoS composability. Addressing this gap, Netcentric System of Systems Engineering with DEVS Unified Process presents a methodology for realizing the model-driven engineering vision and netcentric SoS using DEVS Unified Process (DUNIP). The authors draw on their experience with Discrete Event Systems Specification (DEVS) formalism, System Entity Structure (SES) theory, and applying model-driven engineering in the context of a netcentric SoS. They describe formal model-driven engineering methods for netcentric M&S using standards-based approaches to develop and test complex dynamic models with DUNIP. The book is organized into five sections: Section I introduces undergraduate students and novices to the world of DEVS. It covers systems and SoS M&S as well as DEVS formalism, software, modeling language, and DUNIP. It also assesses DUNIP with the requirements of the Department of Defense’s (DoD) Open Unified Technical Framework (OpenUTF) for netcentric Test and Evaluation (T&E). Section II delves into M&S-based systems engineering for graduate students, advanced practitioners, and industry professionals. It provides methodologies to apply M&S principles to SoS design and reviews the development of executable architectures based on a framework such as the Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF). It also describes an approach for building netcentric knowledge-based contingency-driven systems. Section III guides graduate students, advanced DEVS users, and industry professionals who are interested in building DEVS virtual machines and netcentric SoS. It discusses modeling standardization, the deployment of models and simulators in a netcentric environment, event-driven architectures, and more. Section IV explores real-world case studies that realize many of the concepts defined in the previous chapters. Section V outlines the next steps and looks at how the modeling of netcentric complex adaptive systems can be attempted using DEVS concepts. It touches on the boundaries of DEVS formalism and the future work needed to utilize advanced concepts like weak and strong emergence, self-organization, scale-free systems, run-time modularity, and event interoperability. This groundbreaking work details how DUNIP offers a well-structured, platform-independent methodology for the modeling and simulation of netcentric system of systems.",Computers,715,N/A,0,en

Lo,CRC Press,2015-01-15,"Highlights the Progression of Meshing Technologies and Their Applications Finite Element Mesh Generation provides a concise and comprehensive guide to the application of finite element mesh generation over 2D domains, curved surfaces, and 3D space. Organised according to the geometry and dimension of the problem domains, it develops from the basic meshing algorithms to the most advanced schemes to deal with problems with specific requirements such as boundary conformity, adaptive and anisotropic elements, shape qualities, and mesh optimization. It sets out the fundamentals of popular techniques, including: Delaunay triangulation Advancing-front (ADF) approach Quadtree/Octree techniques Refinement and optimization-based strategies From the geometrical and the topological aspects and their associated operations and inter-relationships, each approach is vividly described and illustrated with examples. Beyond the algorithms, the book also explores the practice of using metric tensor and surface curvatures for generating anisotropic meshes on parametric space. It presents results from research including 3D anisotropic meshing, mesh generation over unbounded domains, meshing by means of intersection, re-meshing by Delaunay-ADF approach, mesh refinement and optimization, generation of hexahedral meshes, and large scale and parallel meshing, along with innovative unpublished meshing methods.

Models of the Mind,Grace Lindsay,Bloomsbury Publishing,2021-03-04,"The human brain is made up of 85 billion neurons, which are connected by over 100 trillion synapses. For more than a century, a diverse array of researchers searched for a language that could be used to capture the essence of what these neurons do and how they communicate – and how those communications create thoughts, perceptions and actions. The language they were looking for was mathematics, and we would not be able to understand the brain as we do today without it. In Models of the Mind, author and computational neuroscientist Grace Lindsay explains how mathematical models have allowed scientists to understand and describe many of the brain's processes, including decision-making, sensory processing, quantifying memory, and more. She introduces readers to the most important concepts in modern neuroscience, and highlights the tensions that arise when the abstract world of mathematical modelling collides with the messy details of biology. Each chapter of Models of the Mind focuses on mathematical tools that have been applied in a particular area of neuroscience, progressing from the simplest building block of the brain – the individual neuron – through to circuits of interacting neurons, whole brain areas and even the behaviours that brains command. In addition, Grace examines the history of the field, starting with experiments done on frog legs in the late eighteenth century and building to the large models of artificial neural networks that form the basis of modern artificial intelligence. Throughout, she reveals the value of using the elegant language of mathematics to describe the machinery of neuroscience.",Science,401,4,1,en

Imagining Climate Engineering,Jeroen Oomen,Routledge,2021-05-03,"This book highlights the increasing attention for climate engineering, a set of speculative technologies aimed to counter global warming. What is the future of the global climate? And who gets to decide—or even design—this future? Imagining Climate Engineering explores how and why climate engineering became a potential approach to anthropogenic climate change. Specifically, it showcases how views on the future of climate change and climate engineering evolved by addressing the ways in which climate engineers view its respective physical, political, and moral domains. Tracing the intellectual and political history of dreams to control the weather and climate as well as the discovery of climate change, Jeroen Oomen examines the imaginative parameters within which contemporary climate engineering research takes place. Introducing the analytical metaphor ‘ways of seeing’ to describe explicit or implicit visions, understandings, and foci that facilitate a particular understanding of what is at stake, Imagining Climate Engineering shows how visions on the knowability of climate tie into moral and political convictions about the possibility and desirability of engineering the climate. Marrying science and technology studies and the environmental humanities, Oomen provides crucial insights for the future of the climate change debate for scholars and students.",Nature,213,N/A,0,en

From X-rays to DNA,"W. David Lee, Jeffrey Drazen, Phillip A. Sharp, Robert S. Langer",MIT Press,2014,"An argument that technology accelerates biological discovery, with case studies ranging from chromosome discovery with early microscopes to how DNA replicates using radioisotope labels. Engineering has been an essential collaborator in biological research and breakthroughs in biology are often enabled by technological advances. Decoding the double helix structure of DNA, for example, only became possible after significant advances in such technologies as X-ray diffraction and gel electrophoresis. Diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis improved as new technologies—including the stethoscope, the microscope, and the X-ray—developed. These engineering breakthroughs take place away from the biology lab, and many years may elapse before the technology becomes available to biologists. In this book, David Lee argues for concurrent engineering—the convergence of engineering and biological research—as a means to accelerate the pace of biological discovery and its application to diagnosis and treatment. He presents extensive case studies and introduces a metric to measure the time between technological development and biological discovery. Investigating a series of major biological discoveries that range from pasteurization to electron microscopy, Lee finds that it took an average of forty years for the necessary technology to become available for laboratory use. Lee calls for new approaches to research and funding to encourage a tighter, more collaborative coupling of engineering and biology. Only then, he argues, will we see the rapid advances in the life sciences that are critically needed for life-saving diagnosis and treatment.",Medical,247,N/A,0,en

Introduction to Engineering: Engineering Fundamentals and Concepts,,Türker Canbazoğlu,2018-12-11,"The future presents society with enormous challenges on many fronts, such as energy, infrastructures in urban settings, mass migrations, mobility, climate, healthcare for an aging population, social security and safety. In the coming decennia, leaps in scientific discovery and innovations will be necessary in social, political, economic and technological fields. Technology, the domain of engineers and engineering scientists, will be an essential component in making such innovations possible. Engineering is the social practice of conceiving, designing, implementing, producing and sustaining complex technological products, processes or systems. The complexity is often caused by the behaviour of the system development that changes with time that cannot be predicted in advance from its constitutive parts. This is especially true when human decisions play a key role in solving the problem. Solving complex systems requires a solid foundation in mathematics and the natural sciences, and an understanding of human nature. Therefore, the skills of the future engineers must extend over an array of fields. The book was born from the ""Introduction to Engineering"" courses given by the author in various universities. At that time the author was unable to find one text book, that covered all the subjects of the course. The book claims to fulfil this gap.",,408,N/A,0,en

"High Value Fermentation Products, Volume 1","Saurabh Saran, Vikash Babu, Asha Chaubey",John Wiley & Sons,2019-03-12,"Green technologies are no longer the “future” of science, but the present. With more and more mature industries, such as the process industries, making large strides seemingly every single day, and more consumers demanding products created from green technologies, it is essential for any business in any industry to be familiar with the latest processes and technologies. It is all part of a global effort to “go greener,” and this is nowhere more apparent than in fermentation technology. This book describes relevant aspects of industrial-scale fermentation, an expanding area of activity, which already generates commercial values of over one third of a trillion US dollars annually, and which will most likely radically change the way we produce chemicals in the long-term future. From biofuels and bulk amino acids to monoclonal antibodies and stem cells, they all rely on mass suspension cultivation of cells in stirred bioreactors, which is the most widely used and versatile way to produce. Today, a wide array of cells can be cultivated in this way, and for most of them genetic engineering tools are also available. Examples of products, operating procedures, engineering and design aspects, economic drivers and cost, and regulatory issues are addressed. In addition, there will be a discussion of how we got to where we are today, and of the real world in industrial fermentation. This chapter is exclusively dedicated to large-scale production used in industrial settings.",Science,541,N/A,0,en

Socio-economic Democracy and the World Government,Dhanjoo N. Ghista,World Scientific,2004,"Due to its ability to freeze a moment in time, the photo is a uniquely powerful device for ordering and understanding the world. But when an image depicts complex, ambiguous, or controversial events--terrorist attacks, wars, political assassinations--its ability to influence perception can prove deeply unsettling. Are we really seeing the world ""as it is"" or is the image a fabrication or projection? How do a photo's content and form shape a viewer's impressions? What do such images contribute to historical memory? About to Die focuses on one emotionally charged category of news photograph--depictions of individuals who are facing imminent death--as a prism for addressing such vital questions. Tracking events as wide-ranging as the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake, the Holocaust, the Vietnam War, and 9/11, Barbie Zelizer demonstrates that modes of journalistic depiction and the power of the image are immense cultural forces that are still far from understood.

Advanced Natural Gas Engineering,"Xiuli Wang, Michael Economides",Elsevier,2013-11-25,"Natural gas is playing an increasing role in meeting world energy demands because of its abundance, versatility, and its clean burning nature. As a result, lots of new gas exploration, field development and production activities are under way, especially in places where natural gas until recently was labeled as ""stranded. Because a significant portion of natural gas reserves worldwide are located across bodies of water, gas transportation in the form of LNG or CNG becomes an issue as well. Finally natural gas is viewed in comparison to the recently touted alternatives. Therefore, there is a need to have a book covering all the unique aspects and challenges related to natural gas from the upstream to midstream and downstream. All these new issues have not been addressed in depth in any existing book. To bridge the gap, Xiuli Wang and Michael Economides have written a new book called Advanced Natural Gas Engineering. This book will serve as a reference for all engineers and professionals in the energy business. It can also be a textbook for students in petroleum and chemical engineering curricula and in training departments for a large group of companies.",Technology & Engineering,401,N/A,0,en

An Employer's and Engineer's Guide to the FIDIC Conditions of Contract,Michael D. Robinson,John Wiley & Sons,2013-04-22,"When all parties involved in the construction process fully understand their roles and are able to anticipate potential points of conflict, disputes and delays will be minimised. The Employer’s and Engineer’s Guide to the FIDIC Conditions of Contract sets out the essential administrative requirements of a FIDIC based contract by reference to the FIDIC 1999 Red Book. The obligations and duties of the Employer and the Engineer are identified and discussed. Potential pitfalls are highlighted and likely consequences pointed out. The importance of the Employer’s role in the preparation of tenders, which fully reflect his requirements and duties and obligations arising in the execution of the works, is emphasised. The key role of the Engineer in the effective administration of contracts after award is examined and commentary provided. Included in the guide are a number of appendices, including model letters which will be of value to less experienced staff (particularly those whose mother-tongue is not the English language). Engineers, quantity surveyors and project managers engaged in the contractual administration of international projects using FIDIC forms of contract will find the concise guidance in simple and jargon-free language provided here invaluable. This, together with the author’s earlier book, Contractor’s Guide to the FIDIC Conditions of Contract - which describes the duties, rights and responsibilities of the Contractor – represents the totality of supervision, design and execution of construction projects executed under the FIDIC Conditions of Contract. This book’s companion website offers invaluable resources to freely download, adapt and use: Model letters for use by the Employer Model letters for use by the Contractor Sample Interim Payment Certificate Model Form for Submissions to the Engineer Model Form of Engineer’s Order for Varied Works Model Form of Daywork/Daily Record Sheets",Law,229,N/A,0,en

Designing Communities,Wolff-Michael Roth,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The study described in this book arose in the contextof a three-year collective effort to bring about change in science teaching at Mountain Elementary School. 1 This opportunity emerged after I contacted the school with the idea to help teachers implement student-centered science teaching. At the same time, the teachers collectively had come to realize that their science teaching was not as exciting to children as it could be. They had recognized their own teaching as textbook-based with little use of the ""hands-on"" approaches prescribed by the provincial curriculum. At this point, the teachers and I decided that a joint project would serve our mutual goals: they wanted assistance in changing from textbook-based approaches to student-centered activities; I wanted to collect data on learning in student-centered knowledge producing classroom communities. I brought to this school my new understandings about classroom communi ties from several earlier studies conducted in a private high school (e. g. , Roth & Bowen, 1995; Roth & Roychoudhury, 1992). I wanted to help teachers create science learning environments in which children took charge of their learning, where children learned from more competent others by participating with them in ongoing activities, and teachers were responsible for setting up and maintaining a classroom community rather than for dissem inating information. After I had completed the data collection for the present study, I watched a documentary about an elementary school in the small French village of Moussac (Envoye Special, TV5, September 14, 1994).",Science,342,N/A,0,en

Kindergarten of Fractional Calculus,Shantanu Das,Cambridge Scholars Publishing,2020-02-18,"This book presents a simplified deliberation of fractional calculus, which will appeal not only to beginners, but also to various applied science mathematicians and engineering researchers. The text develops the ideas behind this new field of mathematics, beginning at the most elementary level, before discussing its actual applications in different areas of science and engineering. This book shows that the simple, classical laws based on Newtonian calculus, which work quite well under limiting and idealized conditions, are not of much use in describing the dynamics of actual systems. As such, the application of non-Newtonian, or generalized, calculus in the governing equations, allows the order of differentiation and integration to take on non-integer values.",Mathematics,533,N/A,0,en
Managing Construction Projects,Graham M. Winch,John Wiley & Sons,2009-12-30,"Project management is of critical importance in construction, yet its execution poses major challenges. In order to keep a project on track, decisions often have to be made before all the necessary information is available. Drawing on a wide range of research, Managing Construction Projects proposes new ways of thinking about project management in construction, exploring the skills required to manage uncertainty and offering techniques for thinking about the challenges involved. The second edition takes the information processing perspective introduced in the first edition and develops it further. In particular, this approach deepens the reader’s understanding of the dynamics in the construction project process – from the value proposition inherent in the project mission, to the functioning asset that generates value for its owners and users. Managing Construction Projects is a unique and indispensible contribution to the available literature on construction project management. It will be of particular benefit to advanced students of construction and construction project management, as well as contractors and quantity surveyors. Reviews of the First edition: ""A massive review of the art and science of the management of projects that has the great virtue of being a good read wherever it is touched. It spills the dirt on things that went wrong, elucidates the history so you can understand the industry's current stance, draws on other countries experience and explains the latest management processes. Throughout it is liberally sprinkled with anecdotes and case histories which amply illustrate the dos and don't for practitioners wishing to deliver projects on time to expected quality and price. A valuable book for students and practitioners alike."" —John D Findlay, Director, Stent ""This is a valuable source for practitioners and students. It covers the A-Z of project management in a confident contemporary manner, and provides a powerful and much needed conceptual perspective in place of a purely prescriptive approach. The engaging presentation introduces a range of challenges to established thinking about project management, often by making comparisons between practices in the UK and those of other countries."" —Peter Lansley, Professor of Construction Management, University of Reading ""A refreshing and unique study of information management and its impact upon international construction project management.... The book is well presented and written, logical and succinct and is flexible enough to allow readers to either read from start to finish or to dip into selected chapters. This book deserves to be an established text for any construction or civil engineering under - and/or postgraduate course."" —CNBR, 25th November 2003 ""Generous use is made of anecdotes andc case histories throughout to support the theory. the book illustrates the mistakes made by others, and the means to deliver projects on time and to cost."" —Building Services Journal, April 2004",Technology & Engineering,551,4,3,en

Process Modelling and Model Analysis,"Ian T. Cameron, Katalin Hangos",Elsevier,2001-05-23,"Process Modelling and Model Analysis describes the use of models in process engineering. Process engineering is all about manufacturing--of just about anything! To manage processing and manufacturing systematically, the engineer has to bring together many different techniques and analyses of the interaction between various aspects of the process. For example, process engineers would apply models to perform feasibility analyses of novel process designs, assess environmental impact, and detect potential hazards or accidents. To manage complex systems and enable process design, the behavior of systems is reduced to simple mathematical forms. This book provides a systematic approach to the mathematical development of process models and explains how to analyze those models. Additionally, there is a comprehensive bibliography for further reading, a question and answer section, and an accompanying Web site developed by the authors with additional data and exercises. - Introduces a structured modeling methodology emphasizing the importance of the modeling goal and including key steps such as model verification, calibration, and validation - Focuses on novel and advanced modeling techniques such as discrete, hybrid, hierarchical, and empirical modeling - Illustrates the notions, tools, and techniques of process modeling with examples and advances applications",Technology & Engineering,561,4,2,en

Solve for Happy,Mo Gawdat,Simon and Schuster,2017-03-21,"In this “powerful personal story woven with a rich analysis of what we all seek” (Sergey Brin, cofounder of Google), Mo Gawdat, Chief Business Officer at Google’s [X], applies his superior logic and problem solving skills to understand how the brain processes joy and sadness—and then he solves for happy. In 2001 Mo Gawdat realized that despite his incredible success, he was desperately unhappy. A lifelong learner, he attacked the problem as an engineer would: examining all the provable facts and scrupulously applying logic. Eventually, his countless hours of research and science proved successful, and he discovered the equation for permanent happiness. Thirteen years later, Mo’s algorithm would be put to the ultimate test. After the sudden death of his son, Ali, Mo and his family turned to his equation—and it saved them from despair. In dealing with the horrible loss, Mo found his mission: he would pull off the type of “moonshot” goal that he and his colleagues were always aiming for—he would share his equation with the world and help as many people as possible become happier. In Solve for Happy Mo questions some of the most fundamental aspects of our existence, shares the underlying reasons for suffering, and plots out a step-by-step process for achieving lifelong happiness and enduring contentment. He shows us how to view life through a clear lens, teaching us how to dispel the illusions that cloud our thinking; overcome the brain’s blind spots; and embrace five ultimate truths. No matter what obstacles we face, what burdens we bear, what trials we’ve experienced, we can all be content with our present situation and optimistic about the future.",Self-Help,368,N/A,0,en

Advances in X-Ray Analysis,Camden R. Hubbard,Springer,1983-06,"At the Denver X-Ray Conference, the topic for the plenary lectures alternates annually between x-ray diffraction and x-ray fluorescence. This year is a ""diffraction"" year, and the theme is accuracy in powder diffraction. Instead of comprehensive cover age, such as was attempted at the Accuracy in Powder Diffraction Meeting held at the National Bureau of Standards in 1978, this meeting focuses on recent developments in measurement accuracy of two-theta and intensity. The focus on accuracy, from the practical point of view, is important in a wide range of x-ray diffraction measurements. Accu rate data improve our ability to identify phases in a mixture using the Powder Diffraction File. Improved accuracy is essential for better characterization of the lattice, crystallite size, strain and structure. Finally, the accuracy of quantitative analysis is of great concern in many laboratories. The five invited papers of the plenary session give a broad perspective of recent activity throughout the world on uses of more accurate data, on methods to achieve greater accuracy, and on fundamental factors affecting the accuracy. The scope of the conference, however, is much broader than that of the plenary session. The workshops lead off with many practical aspects of x-ray analysis. Many of the contributed papers expand on the theme of accuracy in x-ray powder diffraction. In particular, the s.ession on XRD quantitative phase analysis provides an exception al coverage of the limitations in quantitative analysis and of the techniques being employed to improve the results.",Science,504,N/A,0,en

Engineering and War,"Ethan Blue, Michael Levine, Dean Nieusma",Springer Nature,2022-06-01,"This book investigates the close connections between engineering and war, broadly understood, and the conceptual and structural barriers that face those who would seek to loosen those connections. It shows how military institutions and interests have long influenced engineering education, research, and practice and how they continue to shape the field in the present. The book also provides a generalized framework for responding to these influences useful to students and scholars of engineering, as well as reflective practitioners. The analysis draws on philosophy, history, critical theory, and technology studies to understand the connections between engineering and war and how they shape our very understandings of what engineering is and what it might be. After providing a review of diverse dimensions of engineering itself, the analysis shifts to different dimensions of the connections between engineering and war. First, it considers the ethics of war generally and then explores questions of integrity for engineering practitioners facing career decisions relating to war. Next, it considers the historical rise of the military-industrial-academic complex, especially from World War II to the present. Finally, it considers a range of responses to the militarization of engineering from those who seek to unsettle the status quo. Only by confronting the ethical, historical, and political consequences of engineering for warfare, this book argues, can engineering be sensibly reimagined.",Technology & Engineering,107,N/A,0,en

"Preventing Bullying Through Science, Policy, and Practice","National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, Health and Medicine Division, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Committee on Law and Justice, Board on Children, Youth, and Families, Committee on the Biological and Psychosocial Effects of Peer Victimization: Lessons for Bullying Prevention",National Academies Press,2016-09-14,"Bullying has long been tolerated as a rite of passage among children and adolescents. There is an implication that individuals who are bullied must have ""asked for"" this type of treatment, or deserved it. Sometimes, even the child who is bullied begins to internalize this idea. For many years, there has been a general acceptance and collective shrug when it comes to a child or adolescent with greater social capital or power pushing around a child perceived as subordinate. But bullying is not developmentally appropriate; it should not be considered a normal part of the typical social grouping that occurs throughout a child's life. Although bullying behavior endures through generations, the milieu is changing. Historically, bulling has occurred at school, the physical setting in which most of childhood is centered and the primary source for peer group formation. In recent years, however, the physical setting is not the only place bullying is occurring. Technology allows for an entirely new type of digital electronic aggression, cyberbullying, which takes place through chat rooms, instant messaging, social media, and other forms of digital electronic communication. Composition of peer groups, shifting demographics, changing societal norms, and modern technology are contextual factors that must be considered to understand and effectively react to bullying in the United States. Youth are embedded in multiple contexts and each of these contexts interacts with individual characteristics of youth in ways that either exacerbate or attenuate the association between these individual characteristics and bullying perpetration or victimization. Recognizing that bullying behavior is a major public health problem that demands the concerted and coordinated time and attention of parents, educators and school administrators, health care providers, policy makers, families, and others concerned with the care of children, this report evaluates the state of the science on biological and psychosocial consequences of peer victimization and the risk and protective factors that either increase or decrease peer victimization behavior and consequences.",Law,362,N/A,0,en

The Semiotic Engineering of Human-computer Interaction,Clarisse Sieckenius De Souza,MIT Press,2005,"A theory of HCI that uses concepts from semiotics and computer science to focus on the communication between designers and users during interaction. In The Semiotic Engineering of Human-Computer Interaction, Clarisse Sieckenius de Souza proposes an account of HCI that draws on concepts from semiotics and computer science to investigate the relationship between user and designer. Semiotics is the study of signs, and the essence of semiotic engineering is the communication between designers and users at interaction time; designers must somehow be present in the interface to tell users how to use the signs that make up a system or program. This approach, which builds on--but goes further than--the currently dominant user-centered approach, allows designers to communicate their overall vision and therefore helps users understand designs--rather than simply which icon to click. According to de Souza's account, both designers and users are interlocutors in an overall communication process that takes place through an interface of words, graphics, and behavior. Designers must tell users what they mean by the artifact they have created, and users must understand and respond to what they are being told. By coupling semiotic theory and engineering, de Souza's approach to HCI design encompasses the principles, the materials, the processes, and the possibilities for producing meaningful interactive computer system discourse and achieves a broader perspective than cognitive, ethnographic, or ergonomic approaches. De Souza begins with a theoretical overview and detailed exposition of the semiotic engineering account of HCI. She then shows how this approach can be applied specifically to HCI evaluation and design of online help systems, customization and end-user programming, and multiuser applications. Finally, she reflects on the potential and opportunities for research in semiotic engineering.",Computers,318,2,1,en

THE TRANSITION OF DANWEI-COMMUNITY AND URBAN COMMUNITY REBUILDING,Tian Yi-Peng,American Academic Press,2021-11-18,"In this work the author endeavors to treat “Danwei” system as a special and highly organized form of community and sets about his study from the perspectives of “Danwei–community’s” change and urban community reconstruction. When it comes to the construction and development of urban communities in contemporary China, academic circles at home often attempt to unravel its intimate and indissoluble connection with “Danwei” system and seek to lay emphasis upon the great complexity of their interactive relationship with each other. However, academic circles generally incorporate “Danwei” system taken as a national system as well as a universal institution into their fields of research, whereas they rarely enter into a critical examination of the variations in its multiplicity of specific denotations by taking account of such variables as space, region and culture, nor do they show much concern about the existence of different types of “Danwei”. In view of the foregoing difficulties in which the study of “Danwei” system gets entangled, this study attempts to accomplish the following main purposes. Firstly, this study shall introduce such a variable as locality into the research on “Danwei-community” by starting off from the research perspectives of “Danwei-community’s” origin, formation and change. Secondly, several super-large industrial communities in the old industrial bases shall be chosen as classic cases in illustration of long-standing complications and entanglements enmeshed in this study. And thirdly, it seeks to reveal the mode and experience of urban community development against a background of “Danwei” system reform so that by gaining a full understanding of as well as making an in-depth analysis of their rich implications we can enrich the theory of urban community construction in the Chinese context and hence grapple successfully with some theoretical problems confronting urban community reconstruction against a background of “Danwei-community” change, which shall eventually bring about a smooth transition of “Danwei” society. This book will assuredly open an exceptional window to the transition of China from traditional to modern society, the transition of Chinese society from planned economy to market economy, and the change track of the interplay between the Chinese government and modern Chinese society after the founding of New China in 1949, at the present time and even in the foreseeable future.",Philosophy,362,N/A,0,en

Probabilistic performance-based seismic design,fib Fédération internationale du béton,fib Fédération internationale du béton,2012-05-07,"In the last ten to fifteen years a vast amount of research has been undertaken to improve on earlier methods for analysing the seismic reliability of structures. These efforts focused on identifying aspects of prominent relevance and disregarding the inessential ones, with the goal of producing methods that are both more efficient and easier to use in practice. Today this goal can be said to be substantially achieved. During these years scientific activity covered all of the many aspects involved in such a multi-disciplinary problem, ranging from seismology, to geotechnics, to structural analysis and economy, all of them to be consistently organised into a probabilistic framework. As the output of this research was dispersed into a multitude of technical papers, fib Commission 7 thought it worthwhile to select the essential aspects of this large body of knowledge and to present them into a coherent and accessible document for structural engineers. To this end a task group of specialists was formed, whose qualifications come from their personal involvement in the above-mentioned developments throughout this period of time. From its inception the group decided that the bulletin should have had a distinct educational character and provide a clear overview of the methods available. The outcome is a compact volume that starts by introducing the concepts and definitions of performance-based engineering, continues with two chapters on assessment and design, respectively, presenting the methods in detail accompanied by illustrative examples, and concludes with an appendix with sample programming excerpts for their implementation.

FRP Composites for Reinforced and Prestressed Concrete Structures,"Perumalsamy Balaguru, Antonio Nanni, James Giancaspro",CRC Press,2008-11-05,"High strength fibre composites (FRPs) have been used with civil structures since the 1980s, mostly in the repair, strengthening and retrofitting of concrete structures. This has attracted considerable research, and the industry has expanded exponentially in the last decade. Design guidelines have been developed by professional organizations in a number of countries including USA, Japan, Europe and China, but until now designers have had no publication which provides practical guidance or accessible coverage of the fundamentals. This book fills this void. It deals with the fundamentals of composites, and basic design principles, and provides step-by-step guidelines for design. Its main theme is the repair and retrofit of un-reinforced, reinforced and prestressed concrete structures using carbon, glass and other high strength fibre composites. In the case of beams, the focus is on their strengthening for flexure and shear or their stiffening. The main interest with columns is the improvement of their ductility; and both strengthening and ductility improvement of un-reinforced structures are covered.

"Dynamic Feature Space Modelling, Filtering and Self-Tuning Control of Stochastic Systems",Pieter W. Otter,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The literature on systems seems to have been growing almost expo nentially during the last decade and one may question whether there is need for another book. In the author's view, most of the literature on 'systems' is either technical in mathematical sense or technical ifF engineering sense (with technical words such as noise, filtering etc. ) and not easily accessible to researchers is other fields, in particular not to economists, econometricians and quantitative researchers in so cial sciences. This is unfortunate, because achievements in the rather 'young' science of system theory and system engineering are of impor tance for modelling, estimation and regulation (control) problems in other branches of science. State space mode~iing; the concept of ob servability and controllability; the mathematical formulations of sta bility; the so-called canonical forms; prediction error e~timation; optimal control and Kalman filtering are some examples of results of system theory and system engineering which proved to be successful in practice. A brief summary of system theoretical concepts is given in Chapter II where an attempt has been made to translate the concepts in to the more 'familiar' language used in econometrics and social sciences by means of examples. By interrelating concepts and results from system theory with those from econometrics and social sciences, the author has attempted to narrow the gap between the more technical sciences such as engi neering and social sciences and econometrics, and to contribute to either side.",Business & Economics,193,N/A,0,en

The Economics of Conservation Programs,Franz Wirl,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Demand side management (DSM) is one of the most topical issues in regulating electric utilities, both in the United States and internationally. What is DSM? It consists of various measures at the level of demand (households, commerce, industry, others), which are at least partially financed by electric utilities and which should either conserve energy or reduce the peak load. The practice of DSM originates from The Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 (PURPA) that provided the political and legal framework to set energy conservation as a national goal, which encouraged regulatory commissions to initiate utility conservation programs; see e.g., Nowell-Tschirhart (1990) and Fox-Penner (1990). Moreover, integrated resource planning, which must account for DSM on a level playing field with supply, is written into the 1992 Energy Policy Act as the U.S. Government's preferred method of electric power planning. Although PURPA set energy conservation as a national priority, its implementation was left to the states with the consequence of considerable differences concerning efforts and rules. By 1993 16 states had already implemented integrated resource planning, 9 were in the process of doing so and further 9 considered implementation, (EPRI 1993b). Due to the Clean Air Act of 1990, 24 states are considering to include external costs in integrated resource planning.",Business & Economics,210,N/A,0,en

Computational Methods and Experimental Measurements XVII,"G.M. Carlomagno, D. Poljak, C.A. Brebbia",WIT Press,2015-05-05,"Containing papers presented at the seventeenth in a series of biennial meetings organised by the Wessex Institute and first held in 1984, this book includes the latest research from scientists who perform experiments, researchers who develop computer codes, and those who carry out measurements on prototypes and whose work may interact. Progress in the engineering sciences is dependent on the orderly and concurrent development of all three fields. Continuous improvement in computer efficiency, coupled with diminishing costs and rapid development of numerical procedures have generated an ever-increasing expansion of computational simulations that permeate all fields of science and technology. As these procedures continue to grow in magnitude and complexity, it is essential to be certain of their reliability, i.e. to validate their results. This can be achieved by performing dedicated and accurate experiments. At the same time, current experimental techniques have become more complex and sophisticated so that they require the exploitation of computers, both for running experiments as well as acquiring and processing the resulting data. The papers contained in the book address advances in the interaction between these three areas. They cover such topics as: Computational and Experimental Methods; Fluid Flow; Structural and Stress Analysis; Materials Characterisation; Heat Transfer and Thermal Processes; Advances in Computational Methods; Automotive Applications; Applications in Industry; Process Simulations; Environmental Modelling and Applications; Computer Modelling; Validation of Computer Modelling; Computation in Measurements; Data Processing of Experiments; Virtual Testing and Verification; Simulation and Forecasting; Measurements in Engineering.",Mathematics,565,N/A,0,en
"Food, Energy, and Water Nexus","Chittaranjan Ray, Sekhar Muddu, Sudhirendar Sharma",Springer Nature,2022-01-17,"In this book, major issues surrounding importance of water and energy for food security in the United States and India are described representing two extremes in yield, irrigation efficiency, and automation. The farming systems in these two countries face different risks in terms of climatic shifts and systems’ resiliency to handle the shocks. One may have comparative advantage over the other, but both are susceptible. Innovations in irrigation for food and fuel production, improvements in nitrogen and water use efficiency, and rural sociological issues are discussed here. We also look into some of the unintended consequences of high productivity agriculture in terms of surface and ground water quality and impacts on ecosystem services. Finally, we present ways to move forward to meet the food demands in the next half-century in both countries. As the current world population of 7 billion is expected to reach or exceed 10 billion in the next 40 years, there will be significant additional demand for food. A rising middle class and its preference for a meat-based diet also increases the demand for animal feed. This additional food and feed production needs special considerations in water and energy management besides the development of appropriate crop hybrids to withstand future climatic shifts and other environmental factors. A resilient agricultural landscapes will also be needed to withstand climatic fluctuations, disease pressures, etc. While the upper and many middle income countries have made significant improvements in crop yield due to pressurized irrigation and automation in farming systems, the lower income countries are struggling with yield enhancements due to such limitations. The rise in population is expected to be more in Sub-Sharan Africa and Middle East (Low to middle-income countries) where the crop yields are expected to be low.",Medical,260,N/A,0,en

The Cult of Pharmacology,Richard DeGrandpre,Duke University Press,2006-11-27,"America had a radically different relationship with drugs a century ago. Drug prohibitions were few, and while alcohol was considered a menace, the public regularly consumed substances that are widely demonized today. Heroin was marketed by Bayer Pharmaceuticals, and marijuana was available as a tincture of cannabis sold by Parke Davis and Company. Exploring how this rather benign relationship with psychoactive drugs was transformed into one of confusion and chaos, The Cult of Pharmacology tells the dramatic story of how, as one legal drug after another fell from grace, new pharmaceutical substances took their place. Whether Valium or OxyContin at the pharmacy, cocaine or meth purchased on the street, or alcohol and tobacco from the corner store, drugs and drug use proliferated in twentieth-century America despite an escalating war on “drugs.” Richard DeGrandpre, a past fellow of the National Institute on Drug Abuse and author of the best-selling book Ritalin Nation, delivers a remarkably original interpretation of drugs by examining the seductive but ill-fated belief that they are chemically predestined to be either good or evil. He argues that the determination to treat the medically sanctioned use of drugs such as Miltown or Seconal separately from the illicit use of substances like heroin or ecstasy has blinded America to how drugs are transformed by the manner in which a culture deals with them. Bringing forth a wealth of scientific research showing the powerful influence of social and psychological factors on how the brain is affected by drugs, DeGrandpre demonstrates that psychoactive substances are not angels or demons irrespective of why, how, or by whom they are used. The Cult of Pharmacology is a bold and necessary new account of America’s complex relationship with drugs.",Medical,307,5,1,en

Hollywood Soundscapes,Helen Hanson,Bloomsbury Publishing,2019-07-25,"The technical crafts of sound in classical Hollywood cinema have, until recently, remained largely 'unsung' by histories of the studio era. Yet film sound – voice, music and sound effects – is a crucial aspect of film style and has been key to engaging and holding audiences since the transition to sound by Hollywood's major studios in 1929. This innovative new text restores sound technicians to Hollywood's creative history. Exploring a range of films from the early sound period (1931) through to the late studio period (1948), and drawing on a wide range of archival sources, the book reveals how Hollywood's sound designers worked and why they worked in the ways that they did. The book demonstrates how sound technicians developed conventions designed to tell stories through sound, placing them within the production cultures of studio era filmmaking, and uncovering a history of collective and collaborative creativity. In doing so, it traces the emergence of a body of highly skilled sound personnel, able to apply expert technical knowledge in the science of sound to the creation of cinematic soundscapes that are alive with mood and sensation.",Performing Arts,198,N/A,0,en

Plant Biotechnology 2002 and Beyond,I. K. Vasil,Springer Science & Business Media,2003-01-31,"The 10th IAPTC&B Congress, Plant Biotechnology 2002 and Beyond, was held June 23-28, 2002, at Disney's Coronado Springs Resort, in Orlando, Florida, USA. It was attended by 1,176 scientists from 54 countries. The best and brightest stars of international plant biotechnology headlined the scientific program. It included the opening address by the President of the IAPTC&B, 14 plenary lectures, and 111 keynote lectures and contributed papers presented in 17 symposia covering all aspects of plant biotechnology. More than 500 posters supplemented the formal program. The distinguished speakers described, discussed and debated not only the best of science that has been done or is being done, but also how the power of plant biotechnology can be harnessed to meet future challenges and needs. The program was focused on what is new and what is exciting, what is state of the art, and what is on the cutting edge of science and technology. In keeping with the international mandate of the IAPTC&B, 73 of the 125 speakers were from outside the United States, representing 27 countries from every region of the world. The 10th IAPTC&B Congress was a truly world-class event. The IAPTC&B, founded in 1963 at the first international conference of plant tissue culture organized by Philip White in the United States, currently has over 1,500 members in 85 countries. It is the largest, oldest, and the most comprehensive international professional organization in the field of plant biotechnology. The IAPTC&B has served the plant biotechnology community well through its many active national chapters throughout the World, by maintaining and disseminating a membership list and a website, by the publication of an official journal (formerly the Newsletter), and by organizing quadrennial international congresses in France (1970), the United Kingdom (1974), Canada (1978), Japan (1982), the United States (1963, 1986, 2002), The Netherlands (1990), Italy (1994), and Israel (1998). In addition, the IAPTC&B has a long tradition of publishing the proceedings of its congresses. Individually, these volumes have provided authoritative quadrennial reports of the status of international plant biotechnology. Collectively, they document the history of plant biotechnology during the 20th century. They are indeed a valuable resource. We are pleased to continue this tradition by publishing this proceedings volume of the 10th IAPTC&B Congress. Regrettably, we are not able to publish seven of the lectures in full (only their abstracts are included). The American and Canadian chapters of the IAPTC&B, the Plant Section of the Society for In Vitro Biology, and the University of Florida hosted the 10th IAPTC&B Congress. The Congress was a true partnership between academia and industry, and was generously supported by both groups (see list of donors/sponsors on back cover). A number of prominent international biotechnology companies and publishers participated in the very successful Science and Technology Exhibit (see accompanying list of exhibitors) The IAPTC&B awarded 84 fellowships to young scientists from 31 countries (see accompanying list of fellowship recipients) to support their participation in the Congress.",Science,662,4,1,en

Object-oriented Software Engineering with UML,Roger Y. Lee,N/A,2019,"The object-oriented paradigm supplements traditional software engineering by providing solutions to common problems such as modularity and reusability. Objects can be written for a specific purpose acting as an encapsulated black-box API that can work with other components by forming a complex system. This book provides a comprehensive overview of the many facets of the object-oriented paradigm and how it applies to software engineering. Starting with an in-depth look at objects, the book naturally progresses through the software engineering life cycle and shows how object-oriented concepts enhance each step. Furthermore, it is designed as a roadmap with each chapter, preparing the reader with the skills necessary to advance the project.This book should be used by anyone interested in learning about object-oriented software engineering, including students and seasoned developers. Without overwhelming the reader, this book hopes to provide enough information for the reader to understand the concepts and apply them in their everyday work. After learning about the fundamentals of the object-oriented paradigm and the software engineering life cycle, the reader is introduced to more advanced topics such as web engineering, cloud computing, agile development, and big data. In recent years, these fields have been rapidly growing as many are beginning to realize the benefits of developing on a highly scalable, automated deployment system. Combined with the speed and effectiveness of agile development, legacy systems are beginning to make the transition to a more adaptive environment.Core Features:1. Provides a thorough exploration of the object-oriented paradigm.2. Provides a detailed look at each step of the software engineering life cycle.3. Provides supporting examples and documents.4. Provides a detailed look at emerging technology and standards in object-oriented software engineering.",Computers,392,N/A,0,en

Engineering—An Endless Frontier,Sunny Y. AUYANG,Harvard University Press,2009-06-30,"Genetic engineering, nanotechnology, astrophysics, particle physics: We live in an engineered world, one where the distinctions between science and engineering, technology and research, are fast disappearing. This book shows how, at the dawn of the twenty-first century, the goals of natural scientists--to discover what was not known--and that of engineers--to create what did not exist--are undergoing an unprecedented convergence. Sunny Y. Auyang ranges widely in demonstrating that engineering today is not only a collaborator with science but its equal. In concise accounts of the emergence of industrial laboratories and chemical and electrical engineering, and in whirlwind histories of the machine tools and automobile industries and the rise of nuclear energy and information technology, her book presents a broad picture of modern engineering: its history, structure, technological achievements, and social responsibilities; its relation to natural science, business administration, and public policies. Auyang uses case studies such as the development of the F-117A Nighthawk and Boeing 777 aircraft, as well as the experiences of engineer-scientists such as Oliver Heaviside, engineer-entrepreneurs such as Henry Ford and Bill Gates, and engineer-managers such as Alfred Sloan and Jack Welch to give readers a clear sense of engineering's essential role in the future of scientific research.

U.S. Research and Development Notes Index I am impressed by the scope of Engineering - An Endless Frontier, and fascinated by Sunny Auyang's comprehensive knowledge of the subject. This is just the kind of book the National Academy of Engineering has been encouraging to promote the importance of engineering to the public. It will have a long shelf-life in that it pulls together material that is not readily accessible, and will serve as a reference for anyone interested in engineering as a profession. Engineering needs this book! --John Hutchinson, Harvard University Engineering - An Endless Frontier is extraordinary in scope. Sunny Auyang describes the different kinds of contemporary engineering practices and productions, attempts to provide historical background, explains the scientific basis for engineering innovation in different fields, and addresses the broad, systems level managerial, entrepreneurial, and design activities of professionals. It's rare to find a single author who can grasp and explain the essential features of modern technologies across such an array of industrial sectors and engineering disciplines and explain how they work, why they work they way they do, and what is required for their innovation, development and, yes, even maintenance. --Louis L.

Communities in Action,"National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, Health and Medicine Division, Board on Population Health and Public Health Practice, Committee on Community-Based Solutions to Promote Health Equity in the United States",National Academies Press,2017-04-27,"In the United States, some populations suffer from far greater disparities in health than others. Those disparities are caused not only by fundamental differences in health status across segments of the population, but also because of inequities in factors that impact health status, so-called determinants of health. Only part of an individual's health status depends on his or her behavior and choice; community-wide problems like poverty, unemployment, poor education, inadequate housing, poor public transportation, interpersonal violence, and decaying neighborhoods also contribute to health inequities, as well as the historic and ongoing interplay of structures, policies, and norms that shape lives. When these factors are not optimal in a community, it does not mean they are intractable: such inequities can be mitigated by social policies that can shape health in powerful ways. Communities in Action: Pathways to Health Equity seeks to delineate the causes of and the solutions to health inequities in the United States. This report focuses on what communities can do to promote health equity, what actions are needed by the many and varied stakeholders that are part of communities or support them, as well as the root causes and structural barriers that need to be overcome.",Medical,583,5,1,en

Error Analysis with Applications in Engineering,"Zbigniew A.

The main reason for writing this text was the lack of such an approach in existing books dealing with the error calculus. Most of books are devoted to mathematical statistics and to probability theory. The range of applications is usually limited to the problems of general statistics and to the analysis of errors in various measuring techniques. Much less attention is paid in these books to two-dimensional and three-dim- sional distributions, and almost no attention is given to problems connected with the two-dimensional and three-dimensional vectorial functions of independent random variables.

"Fire Safety Engineering Design of Structures, Third Edition","John A. Purkiss, Long-Yuan Li",CRC Press,2013-12-05,"Designing structures to withstand the effects of fire is challenging, and requires a series of complex design decisions. This third edition of Fire Safety Engineering Design of Structures provides practising fire safety engineers with the tools to design structures to withstand fires. This text details standard industry design decisions, and offers expert design advice, with relevant historical data. It includes extensive data on materials’ behaviour and modeling -- concrete, steel, composite steel-concrete, timber, masonry, and aluminium. While weighted to the fire sections of the Eurocodes, this book also includes historical data to allow older structures to be assessed. It extensively covers fire damage investigation, and includes as far back as possible, the background to code methods to enable the engineer to better understand why certain procedures are adopted. What’s new in the Third Edition? An overview in the first chapter explains the types of design decisions required for optimum fire performance of a structure, and demonstrates the effect of temperature rise on structural performance of structural elements. It extends the sections on less common engineering materials. The section on computer modelling now includes material on coupled heat and mass transfer, enabling a better understanding of the phenomenon of spalling in concrete. It includes a series of worked examples, and provides an extensive reference section. Readers require a working knowledge of structural mechanics and methods of structural design at ambient conditions, and are helped by some understanding of thermodynamics of heat transfer. This book serves as a resource for engineers working in the field of fire safety, consultants who regularly carry out full fire safety design for structure, and researchers seeking background information.

ZUM '98: The Z Formal Specification Notation,"Jonathan P. Bowen, Andreas Fett, Michael G. Hinchey",Springer Science & Business Media,1998-09-16,"1 In a number of recent presentations – most notably at FME’96 –oneofthe foremost scientists in the ?eld of formal methods, C.A.R. Hoare,has highlighted the fact that formal methods are not the only technique for producing reliable software. This seems to have caused some controversy,not least amongst formal methods practitioners. How can one of the founding fathers of formal methods seemingly denounce the ?eld of research after over a quarter of a century of support? This is a question that has been posed recently by some formal methods skeptics. However, Prof. Hoare has not abandoned formal methods. He is reiterating, 2 albeitmoreradically,his1987view thatmorethanonetoolandnotationwillbe requiredinthepractical,industrialdevelopmentoflarge-scalecomplexcomputer systems; and not all of these tools and notations will be, or even need be, formal in nature. Formalmethods arenotasolution,butratheroneofaselectionoftechniques that have proven to be useful in the development of reliable complex systems, and to result in hardware and software systems that can be produced on-time and within a budget, while satisfying the stated requirements. After almostthree decades,the time has come to view formalmethods in the context of overall industrial-scale system development, and their relationship to othertechniquesandmethods.Weshouldnolongerconsidertheissueofwhether we are “pro-formal” or “anti-formal”, but rather the degree of formality (if any) that we need to support in system development.

Nicholls",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-03-09,"The Z notation has been developed at the Programming Research Group at the Oxford University Computing Laboratory and elsewhere for over a decade. It is now used by industry as part of the software (and hardware) development process in both Europe and the USA. It is currently undergoing BSI standardisation in the UK, and has been proposed for ISO standardisation internationally. In recent years researchers have begun to focus increasingly on the development of techniques and tools to encourage the wider application of Z and other formal methods and notations. This volume contains papers from the Seventh Annual Z User Meeting, held in London in December 1992. In contrast to previous years the meeting concentrated specifically on industrial applications of Z, and a high proportion of the participants came from an industrial background. The theme is well represented by the four invited papers. Three of these discuss ways in which formal methods are being introduced, and the fourth presents an international survey of industrial applications. It also provides a reminder of the improvements which are needed to make these methods an accepted part of software development. In addition the volume contains several submitted papers on the industrial use of Z, two of which discuss the key area of safety-critical applications. There are also a number of papers related to the recently-completed ZIP project. The papers cover all the main areas of the project including methods, tools, and the development of a Z Standard, the first publicly-available version of which was made available at the meeting. Finally the volume contains a select Z bibliography, and section on how to access information on Z through comp.specification.z, the international, computer-based USENET newsgroup.

Sustainable Environmental Engineering,"Walter Z. Tang, Mika Sillanpää",John Wiley & Sons,2018-08-01,"The important resource that explores the twelve design principles of sustainable environmental engineering Sustainable Environmental Engineering (SEE) is to research, design, and build Environmental Engineering Infrastructure System (EEIS) in harmony with nature using life cycle cost analysis and benefit analysis and life cycle assessment and to protect human health and environments at minimal cost. The foundations of the SEE are the twelve design principles (TDPs) with three specific rules for each principle. The TDPs attempt to transform how environmental engineering could be taught by prioritizing six design hierarchies through six different dimensions. Six design hierarchies are prevention, recovery, separation, treatment, remediation, and optimization. Six dimensions are integrated system, material economy, reliability on spatial scale, resiliency on temporal scale, and cost effectiveness. In addition, the authors, two experts in the field, introduce major computer packages that are useful to solve real environmental engineering design problems. The text presents how specific environmental engineering issues could be identified and prioritized under climate change through quantification of air, water, and soil quality indexes. For water pollution control, eight innovative technologies which are critical in the paradigm shift from the conventional environmental engineering design to water resource recovery facility (WRRF) are examined in detail. These new processes include UV disinfection, membrane separation technologies, Anammox, membrane biological reactor, struvite precipitation, Fenton process, photocatalytic oxidation of organic pollutants, as well as green infrastructure. Computer tools are provided to facilitate life cycle cost and benefit analysis of WRRF. This important resource: • Includes statistical analysis of engineering design parameters using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) • Presents Monte Carlos simulation using Crystal ball to quantify uncertainty and sensitivity of design parameters • Contains design methods of new energy, materials, processes, products, and system to achieve energy positive WRRF that are illustrated with Matlab • Provides information on life cycle costs in terms of capital and operation for different processes using MatLab Written for senior or graduates in environmental or chemical engineering, Sustainable Environmental Engineering defines and illustrates the TDPs of SEE. Undergraduate, graduate, and engineers should find the computer codes are useful in their EEIS design. The exercise at the end of each chapter encourages students to identify EEI engineering problems in their own city and find creative solutions by applying the TDPs.

Z User Workshop,John E. Nicholls,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-03-14,"The mathematical concepts and notational conventions we know of as Z were first proposed around 1981. Its origins were in line with the objectives of the PRG - to establish a mathematical basis for program ming concepts and to verify the work by case studies with industry. Hence among early Z users some were from academic circles, with interests in the mathematical basis of programming; others came from industry and were involved with pilot projects and case studies linked with the Programming Research Group. Four years ago we had the first Z User Meeting, a fairly modest affair with representatives more or less equally divided between academia and industry. At the first meeting there were, as in this meeting, a variety of technical papers, reports of work in progress and discussions. A number of people from industry came along, either because they had begun to use Z or were curious about the new direction. In the discussion sessions at the end of the meeting, there were calls from attendees for the establishment of a more stable base for the notation, including work on its documentation and standards.

A Basis for Scientific and Engineering Translation,Michael Hann,N/A,2004,"Annotation This handbook and the accompanying e-book attack many of the most crucial difficulties encountered by both native and non-native English speakers when translating scientific and engineering material from German. The e-book is like a miniature encyclopaedia dealing with the fundamental conceptual basis of science, engineering and mathematics, with particular regard to terminology. It provides didactically organised dictionaries, thesauri and a wide range of microglossaries highlighting polysemy, homonymy, hyponymy, context, collocation, usage as well as grammatical, lexical and semantic considerations essential to accurate translation. It also supplies a wide variety of reference material and illustrations useful to self-taught professional technical translators, translator trainers at universities, and especially to student translators. All the main branches of industrial technology are examined, such as mechanical, electrical, electronic, chemical, nuclear engineering, and fundamental terminologies are provided for a broad range of important subfields: automotive engineering, plastics, computer systems, construction technology, aircraft, machine tools. The handbook provides a useful bed-time introduction to the e-book, enabling readers proficient in two languages to acquire the basic skills necessary for technical translation by familiarity with fundamental engineering conceptions themselves.",English language,0,N/A,0,en

Digital Control Engineering,"M. Sami Fadali, Antonio Visioli",Academic Press,2012-09-06,"Digital controllers are part of nearly all modern personal, industrial, and transportation systems. Every senior or graduate student of electrical, chemical or mechanical engineering should therefore be familiar with the basic theory of digital controllers. This new text covers the fundamental principles and applications of digital control engineering, with emphasis on engineering design. Fadali and Visioli cover analysis and design of digitally controlled systems and describe applications of digital controls in a wide range of fields. With worked examples and Matlab applications in every chapter and many end-of-chapter assignments, this text provides both theory and practice for those coming to digital control engineering for the first time, whether as a student or practicing engineer. Extensive Use of computational tools: Matlab sections at end of each chapter show how to implement concepts from the chapter Frees the student from the drudgery of mundane calculations and allows him to consider more subtle aspects of control system analysis and design An engineering approach to digital controls: emphasis throughout the book is on design of control systems. Mathematics is used to help explain concepts, but throughout the text discussion is tied to design and implementation. For example coverage of analog controls in chapter 5 is not simply a review, but is used to show how analog control systems map to digital control systems Review of Background Material: contains review material to aid understanding of digital control analysis and design. Examples include discussion of discrete-time systems in time domain and frequency domain (reviewed from linear systems course) and root locus design in s-domain and z-domain (reviewed from feedback control course) Inclusion of Advanced Topics In addition to the basic topics required for a one semester senior/graduate class, the text includes some advanced material to make it suitable for an introductory graduate level class or for two quarters at the senior/graduate level. Examples of optional topics are state-space methods, which may receive brief coverage in a one semester course, and nonlinear discrete-time systems Minimal Mathematics Prerequisites The mathematics background required for understanding most of the book is based on what can be reasonably expected from the average electrical, chemical or mechanical engineering senior. This background includes three semesters of calculus, differential equations and basic linear algebra. Some texts on digital control require more",Computers,602,N/A,0,en

Process Engineering and Industrial Management,Jean-Pierre Dal Pont,John Wiley & Sons,2013-03-04,"Process Engineering, the science and art of transforming raw materials and energy into a vast array of commercial materials, was conceived at the end of the 19th Century. Its history in the role of the Process Industries has been quite honorable, and techniques and products have contributed to improve health, welfare and quality of life. Today, industrial enterprises, which are still a major source of wealth, have to deal with new challenges in a global world. They need to reconsider their strategy taking into account environmental constraints, social requirements, profit, competition, and resource depletion. “Systems thinking” is a prerequisite from process development at the lab level to good project management. New manufacturing concepts have to be considered, taking into account LCA, supply chain management, recycling, plant flexibility, continuous development, process intensification and innovation. This book combines experience from academia and industry in the field of industrialization, i.e. in all processes involved in the conversion of research into successful operations. Enterprises are facing major challenges in a world of fierce competition and globalization. Process engineering techniques provide Process Industries with the necessary tools to cope with these issues. The chapters of this book give a new approach to the management of technology, projects and manufacturing. Contents Part 1: The Company as of Today 1.

Generation Z,"Corey Seemiller, Meghan Grace",Routledge,2018-11-02,"No other generation in history has received as much coverage as the Millennial generation. Books, Google searches, blogs, and news articles are everywhere about them. Yet, Generation Z is comprised of our youth and young adults today and has received very little attention comparatively. Those in Generation Z are among our youngest consumers, students, colleagues, constituents, voters, and neighbors. Being able to better understand who they are and how they see the world can be helpful in effectively working with, teaching, supervising, and leading them. Generation Z: A Century in the Making offers insight into nearly every aspect of the lives of those in Generation Z, including a focus on their career aspirations, religious beliefs and practices, entertainment and hobbies, social concerns, relationships with friends and family, health and wellness, money management, civic engagement, communication styles, political ideologies, technology use, and educational preferences. Drawing from an unprecedented number of studies with higher education research institutions, market research firms such as Pew and Census, other generational researchers and industry leaders, this is the authoritative defining work on Generation Z that market researchers, consumer behaviour specialists, and employers sorely need – and it is a fascinating read for anyone interested in the sociology of generations.",Business & Economics,334,5,1,en

Megacity Mobility,"Zongzhi Li, Adrian T. Moore, Samuel R. Staley",CRC Press,2021-12-14,"World population growth and economic prosperity have given rise to ever-increasing demands on cities, transportation planning, and goods movement. This growth, coupled with a slower pace of transportation capacity expansion and deteriorated facility restoration, has led to rapid changes in the transportation planning and policy environment. These stresses are particularly acute for megacities where degradation of mobility and facility performance have reached alarming rates.

Stress Analysis of Fiber-reinforced Composite Materials,"M. W. Hyer, Scott R. White","DEStech Publications, Inc",2009,"Updated and improved, Stress Analysis of Fiber-Reinforced Composite Materials, Hyer's work remains the definitive introduction to the use of mechanics to understand stresses in composites caused by deformations, loading, and temperature changes. In contrast to a materials science approach, Hyer emphasizes the micromechanics of stress and deformation for composite material analysis. The book provides invaluable analytic tools for students and engineers seeking to understand composite properties and failure limits. A key feature is a series of analytic problems continuing throughout the text, starting from relatively simple problems, which are built up step-by-step with accompanying calculations. The problem series uses the same material properties, so the impact of the elastic and thermal expansion properties for a single-layer of FR material on the stress, strains, elastic properties, thermal expansion and failure stress of cross-ply and angle-ply symmetric and unsymmetric laminates can be evaluated. The book shows how thermally induced stresses and strains due to curing, add to or subtract from those due to applied loads.Another important element, and one unique to this book, is an emphasis on the difference between specifying the applied loads, i.e., force and moment results, often the case in practice, versus specifying strains and curvatures and determining the subsequent stresses and force and moment results. This represents a fundamental distinction in solid mechanics.",Technology & Engineering,718,5,1,en
Infusing Real World Experiences into Engineering Education,"AMD NextGen Engineer, National Academy of Engineering",National Academies Press,2012-11-15,"The aim of this report is to encourage enhanced richness and relevance of the undergraduate engineering education experience, and thus produce better-prepared and more globally competitive graduates, by providing practical guidance for incorporating real world experience in US engineering programs. The report, a collaborative effort of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), builds on two NAE reports on The Engineer of 2020 that cited the importance of grounding engineering education in real world experience. This project also aligns with other NAE efforts in engineering education, such as the Grand Challenges of Engineering, Changing the Conversation, and Frontiers of Engineering Education. This publication presents 29 programs that have successfully infused real world experiences into engineering or engineering technology undergraduate education. The Real World Engineering Education committee acknowledges the vision of AMD in supporting this project, which provides useful exemplars for institutions of higher education who seek model programs for infusing real world experiences in their programs. The NAE selection committee was impressed by the number of institutions committed to grounding their programs in real world experience and by the quality, creativity, and diversity of approaches reflected in the submissions. A call for nominations sent to engineering and engineering technology deans, chairs, and faculty yielded 95 high-quality submissions. Two conditions were required of the nominations: (1) an accredited 4-year undergraduate engineering or engineering technology program was the lead institutions, and (2) the nominated program started operation no later than the fall 2010 semester. Within these broad parameters, nominations ranged from those based on innovations within a single course to enhancements across an entire curriculum or institution. Infusing Real World Experiences into Engineering Education is intended to provide sufficient information to enable engineering and engineering technology faculty and administrators to assess and adapt effective, innovative models of programs to their own institution's objectives. Recognizing that change is rarely trivial, the project included a brief survey of selected engineering deans concern in the adoption of such programs.",Education,41,N/A,0,en

"Gen Z, Explained","Roberta Katz, Sarah Ogilvie, Jane Shaw, Linda Woodhead",University of Chicago Press,2022-10-26,"An optimistic and nuanced portrait of a generation that has much to teach us about how to live and collaborate in our digital world. Born since the mid-1990s, members of Generation Z comprise the first generation never to know the world without the internet, and the most diverse generation yet. As Gen Z starts to emerge into adulthood and enter the workforce, what do we really know about them? And what can we learn from them? Gen Z, Explained is the authoritative portrait of this significant generation. It draws on extensive interviews that display this generation’s candor, surveys that explore their views and attitudes, and a vast database of their astonishingly inventive lexicon to build a comprehensive picture of their values, daily lives, and outlook. Gen Z emerges here as an extraordinarily thoughtful, promising, and perceptive generation that is sounding a warning to their elders about the world around them—a warning of a complexity and depth the “OK Boomer” phenomenon can only suggest. ​ Much of the existing literature about Gen Z has been highly judgmental. In contrast, this book provides a deep and nuanced understanding of a generation facing a future of enormous challenges, from climate change to civil unrest. What’s more, they are facing this future head-on, relying on themselves and their peers to work collaboratively to solve these problems. As Gen Z, Explained shows, this group of young people is as compassionate and imaginative as any that has come before, and understanding the way they tackle problems may enable us to envision new kinds of solutions. This portrait of Gen Z is ultimately an optimistic one, suggesting they have something to teach all of us about how to live and thrive in this digital world.",History,275,N/A,0,en

Sustainable Environmental Engineering,"Walter Z. Tang, Mika Sillanpää",John Wiley & Sons,2018-10-16,"The important resource that explores the twelve design principles of sustainable environmental engineering Sustainable Environmental Engineering (SEE) is to research, design, and build Environmental Engineering Infrastructure System (EEIS) in harmony with nature using life cycle cost analysis and benefit analysis and life cycle assessment and to protect human health and environments at minimal cost. The foundations of the SEE are the twelve design principles (TDPs) with three specific rules for each principle. The TDPs attempt to transform how environmental engineering could be taught by prioritizing six design hierarchies through six different dimensions. Six design hierarchies are prevention, recovery, separation, treatment, remediation, and optimization. Six dimensions are integrated system, material economy, reliability on spatial scale, resiliency on temporal scale, and cost effectiveness. In addition, the authors, two experts in the field, introduce major computer packages that are useful to solve real environmental engineering design problems. The text presents how specific environmental engineering issues could be identified and prioritized under climate change through quantification of air, water, and soil quality indexes. For water pollution control, eight innovative technologies which are critical in the paradigm shift from the conventional environmental engineering design to water resource recovery facility (WRRF) are examined in detail. These new processes include UV disinfection, membrane separation technologies, Anammox, membrane biological reactor, struvite precipitation, Fenton process, photocatalytic oxidation of organic pollutants, as well as green infrastructure. Computer tools are provided to facilitate life cycle cost and benefit analysis of WRRF. This important resource: • Includes statistical analysis of engineering design parameters using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) • Presents Monte Carlos simulation using Crystal ball to quantify uncertainty and sensitivity of design parameters • Contains design methods of new energy, materials, processes, products, and system to achieve energy positive WRRF that are illustrated with Matlab • Provides information on life cycle costs in terms of capital and operation for different processes using MatLab Written for senior or graduates in environmental or chemical engineering, Sustainable Environmental Engineering defines and illustrates the TDPs of SEE. Undergraduate, graduate, and engineers should find the computer codes are useful in their EEIS design. The exercise at the end of each chapter encourages students to identify EEI engineering problems in their own city and find creative solutions by applying the TDPs.

Weeding and Sowing,Hans Freudenthal,Springer Science & Business Media,2007-05-08,"A title that sounds like poetry, and a subtitle that seems to contradict the title! But the subtitle is right, and originally it was just the title. A strange subtitle, isn’t it? Preface to a Science of Mathematical Education. All sciences – in their prenatal stage – have known this kind of literature: only the term used was not ‘Preface’, but, for instance, ‘Prolegomena’, which * means the same though it sounds less provisional. In fact such works were thicker than the present one, by up to ten times. There is much more that can be said about a science before it comes into being than after; with the first results comes modesty. This is the preface to a book that will never be written: not by me, nor by anybody else. Once a science of mathematical education exists, it will get the preface it deserves. Nevertheless this preface – or what for honesty’s sake I have labelled so – must fulfil a function: the function of accelerating the birth of a science of mathematical education, which is seriously impeded by the unfounded view that such already exists. Against this view I have to argue: it rests on a wrong estimation – both over and under estimation at the same time – of what is to be considered as science.",Education,328,N/A,0,en
