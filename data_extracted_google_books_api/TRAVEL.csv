Travel as a Political Act,Rick Steves,Rick Steves,2018-02-06,"Change the world one trip at a time. In this illuminating collection of stories and lessons from the road, acclaimed travel writer Rick Steves shares a powerful message that resonates now more than ever. With the world facing divisive and often frightening events, from Trump, Brexit, and Erdogan, to climate change, nativism, and populism, there's never been a more important time to travel. Rick believes the risks of travel are widely exaggerated, and that fear is for people who don't get out much. After years of living out of a suitcase, he still marvels at how different cultures find different truths to be self-evident. By sharing his experiences from Europe, Central America, Asia, and the Middle East, Rick shows how we can learn more about own country by viewing it from afar. With gripping stories from Rick's decades of exploration, this fully revised edition of Travel as a Political Act is an antidote to the current climate of xenophobia. When we travel thoughtfully, we bring back the most beautiful souvenir of all: a broader perspective on the world that we all call home. All royalties from the sale of Travel as a Political Act are donated to support the work of Bread for the World, a non-partisan organization working to end hunger at home and abroad.",Travel,586,N/A,0,en
A Landscape of Travel,Jenny T. Chio,University of Washington Press,2014-03-28,"While the number of domestic leisure travelers has increased dramatically in reform-era China, the persistent gap between urban and rural living standards attests to ongoing social, economic, and political inequalities. The state has widely touted tourism for its potential to bring wealth and modernity to rural ethnic minority communities, but the policies underlying the development of tourism obscure some complicated realities. In tourism, after all, one person’s leisure is another person’s labor. A Landscape of Travel investigates the contested meanings and unintended consequences of tourism for those people whose lives and livelihoods are most at stake in China’s rural ethnic tourism industry: the residents of village destinations. Drawing on ethnographic research conducted in Ping’an (a Zhuang village in Guangxi) and Upper Jidao (a Miao village in Guizhou), Jenny Chio analyzes the myriad challenges and possibilities confronted by villagers who are called upon to do the work of tourism. She addresses the shifting significance of migration and rural mobility, the visual politics of tourist photography, and the effects of touristic desires for “exotic difference” on village social relations. In this way, Chio illuminates the contemporary regimes of labor and leisure and the changing imagination of what it means to be rural, ethnic, and modern in China today.",Social Science,327,5,1,en

Time Travel,Paul J. Nahin,JHU Press,2011-04-01,"From H.G. Wells to Isaac Asimov to Ursula K. Le Guin, time travel has long been a favorite topic and plot device in tales of science fiction and fantasy. But as any true SF fan knows, astounding stories about traversing alternate universes and swimming the tides of time demand plausible science. That’s just what Paul J. Nahin’s guide provides. An engineer, physicist, and published science fiction writer, Nahin is uniquely qualified to explain the ins and outs of how to spin such complex theories as worm holes, singularity, and relativity into scientifically sound fiction. First published in 1997, this fast-paced book discusses the common and not-so-common time-travel devices science fiction writers have used over the years, assesses which would theoretically work and which would not, and provides scientific insight inventive authors can use to find their own way forward or backward in time. From hyperspace and faster-than-light travel to causal loops and the uncertainty principle and beyond, Nahin’s equation-free romp across time will help writers send their characters to the past or future in an entertaining, logical, and scientific way. If you ever wanted to set up the latest and greatest grandfather paradox—or just wanted to know if the time-bending events in the latest pulp you read could ever happen—then this book is for you.",Literary Criticism,222,5,1,en
Travel,Peter Whitfield,N/A,2011,"No previous generation has ever travelled so energetically or so obsessively as ours, nor has travel writing ever been so much in fashion as it is now. But behind the self-conscious literary artistry of today's narratives there lies a rich and fascinating history of travel writing, stretching back over several thousand years.Travel writing has emerged from migration, war, exploration, trade, conquest, pilgrimage, science, and poetic longing. But when they recorded their travels, the military commanders of Greece and Rome, the navigators of the Age of Discovery, the diplomats and missionaries of the seventeenth century, the dilettantes who set out on the Grand Tour, the romantic travellers and the scientists of the nineteenth century all had one thing in common: they were re-imagining the world, re-interpreting it in their own minds and for their readers.This is the first general survey of the entire history of travel literature, with illustrations reproduced from manuscripts and books in the Bodleian Library's collections. Writers covered include Marco Polo, Sir John Mandeville, Thomas Coryate, Captain Cook, T.E. Lawrence, and Christopher Columbus as well as Boswell and Johnson, Byron, Ruskin, Defoe, Conrad, and James. This book highlights over a hundred texts, showing how one motive for travelling has been succeeded by another, and how travel writing has often inhabited a strange borderland between truth and imagination, fact and fiction. It demonstrates how travel writers have slowly outgrown their traditional stance of superiority to all things 'foreign', and have moved towards a deeper sensitivity to other lands and other cultures.",Travel in literature,0,N/A,0,en
My Experience with Time Travel: A hip hop musician urban science truth,David Turner,Traveling Merchant,N/A,"As this book is a real story that depicts real events, there is no fancy flying saucers or huge explosions and effects. There are no space creatures and aliens although I am not discounting anyone that has seen them. This is a real story that appears normal on the surface, except for prison time as most people do not go to prison (I don’t think). The prison time, although abnormal for most of the population is a normal prison (I suppose as I haven’t been to too many). However, it is within this buried dark place, where the seed of interest was planted and started to grow. This seed occurred yet before prison in the Hip Hop Studio of my former home; Muzak Studios where I encountered strange anomalies while recording. Coupling this with a dream I had while in prison, stirred the passion and lust for learning in this field. After my release, I was embraced with a world of technology and information that was unprecedented before my release and I have leveraged that to learn more about this phenomenon of time travel and distortion.",Art,28,N/A,0,en

Papa Brings Me the World,Jenny Sue Kostecki-Shaw,Henry Holt and Company (BYR),2020-05-05,"Jenny Sue Kostecki-Shaw's Papa Brings Me the World is a poignant picture book that celebrates the bond between parent and child, and follows their long-distance trip around the world. Most parents drive a car or ride a bus or train to work—but not Lulu’s papa. He navigates mountains, deserts, and oceans, each time returning home with pockets full of treasures. There’s an ancient calculator from China, a musical mbira from Zimbabwe, and a special game from Sumatra. But the best treasures are special stories Papa tells when he comes home—tales of playing peekaboo with rare birds in the Andes and befriending dragons in the Irish Sea. This long-distance love story between parent and child celebrates inclusivity, imagination, and the richness of global cultures. Christy Ottaviano Books",Juvenile Fiction,23,N/A,0,en

Kendi, author of How to Be an Antiracist “In Mia Bay’s superb history of mobility and resistance, the question of literal movement becomes a way to understand the civil rights movement writ large.” —Jennifer Szalai, New York Times “Traveling Black is well worth the fare. Indeed, it is certain to become the new standard on this important, and too often forgotten, history.” —Henry Louis Gates, Jr., author of Stony the Road From Plessy v. Ferguson to #DrivingWhileBlack, African Americans have fought to move freely around the United States. But why this focus on Black mobility? From stagecoaches and trains to buses, cars, and planes, Traveling Black explores when, how, and why racial restrictions took shape in America and brilliantly portrays what it was like to live with them. Mia Bay rescues forgotten stories of passengers who made it home despite being insulted, stranded, re-routed, or ignored. She shows that Black travelers never stopped challenging these humiliations, documenting a sustained fight for redress that falls outside the traditional boundaries of the civil rights movement. A riveting, character-rich account of the rise and fall of racial segregation, it reveals just how central travel restrictions were to the creation of Jim Crow laws—and why free movement has been at the heart of the quest for racial justice ever since.",History,401,N/A,0,en

His last book, Rice, Noodle, Fish,took an immersive approach to Japan that combined travel, social observation and food lore.

Slow Travel and Tourism,"Janet Dickinson, Les Lumsdon",Routledge,2010-09-23,"It is widely recognized that travel and tourism can have a high environmental impact and make a major contribution to climate change. It is therefore vital that ways to reduce these impacts are developed and implemented. 'Slow travel' provides such a concept, drawing on ideas from the 'slow food' movement with a concern for locality, ecology and quality of life. The aim of this book is to define slow travel and to discuss how some underlining values are likely to pervade new forms of sustainable development. It also aims to provide insights into the travel experience; these are explored in several chapters which bring new knowledge about sustainable transport tourism from across the world. In order to do this the book explores the concept of slow travel and sets out its core ingredients, comparing it with related frameworks such as low-carbon tourism and sustainable tourism development. The authors explain slow travel as holiday travel where air and car transport is rejected in favour of more environmentally benign forms of overland transport, which generally take much longer and become incorporated as part of the holiday experience. The book critically examines the key trends in tourism transport and recent climate change debates, setting out the main issues facing tourism planners. It reviews the potential for new consumption patterns, as well as current business models that facilitate hyper-mobility. This provides a cutting edge critique of the 'upstream' drivers to unsustainable tourism. Finally, the authors illustrate their approach through a series of case studies from around the world, featuring travel by train, bus, cycling and walking. Examples are drawn from Europe, Asia, Australia and the Americas.

"Have Dog, Will Travel",Stephen Kuusisto,Simon & Schuster,2019-03-19,"In a lyrical love letter to guide dogs everywhere, a blind poet shares his delightful story of how a guide dog changed his life and helped him discover a newfound appreciation for travel and independence. Stephen Kuusisto was born legally blind—but he was also raised in the 1950s and taught to deny his blindness in order to ""pass"" as sighted. Stephen attended public school, rode a bike, and read books pressed right up against his nose. As an adult, he coped with his limited vision by becoming a professor in a small college town, memorizing routes for all of the places he needed to be. Then, at the age of thirty-eight, he was laid off. With no other job opportunities in his vicinity, he would have to travel to find work. This is how he found himself at Guiding Eyes, paired with a Labrador named Corky. In this vivid and lyrical memoir, Stephen Kuusisto recounts how an incredible partnership with a guide dog changed his life and the heart-stopping, wondrous adventure that began for him in midlife. Profound and deeply moving, this is a spiritual journey, the story of discovering that life with a guide dog is both a method and a state of mind.",Biography & Autobiography,256,N/A,0,en

Once motivation builds, nothing stops thereafter.We have travelled extensively to all the continents of the world except Antarctica.

It is not a compilation of where we went, what we saw or what we did. It is written in simple language and in point form so that it can be easily understood and assimilated.Money is a big constraint and inhibits many from travelling. We too believed in this and did not travel for several years but determination and strong motivation gave us the courage to travel. We are a couple with middle class means. We are convinced that if we could travel, so can you. One can travel with any type of budget. All that you need to do is to plan your travels meticulously and follow the cost saving tricks and tips that we share with you. The more you save, more you can travel.Travelling through travel agencies suit many people, but this way of travel has serious limitations. If you want more from your travels and wish to travel more frequently, your only option is to travel on your own.Who should read this book? It must be read by any person who has been travelling till now through travel agencies and paying them heavily; persons hesitating and fearing travelling on their own; or a new and budding traveller. The book will appeal to all such persons.After reading the book, you will be well armed with all the information, motivation and inspiration, ready to explore the world.

Published from 1936 to 1966, the Green Book was hailed as the “black travel guide to America.” At that time, it was very dangerous and difficult for African-Americans to travel because they couldn’t eat, sleep, or buy gas at most white-owned businesses. The Green Book listed hotels, restaurants, gas stations, and other businesses that were safe for black travelers. It was a resourceful and innovative solution to a horrific problem. It took courage to be listed in the Green Book, and Overground Railroad celebrates the stories of those who put their names in the book and stood up against segregation. Author Candacy A.

The papers presented here originated at a conference on Social Change and Sustainable Transport held at the University of California at Berkeley in March 1999, under the auspices of the European Science Foundation and the National Science Foundation. The contributors, who represent a range of disciplines, including geography and regional science, economics, political science, sociology, and psychology, come from twelve different countries. Their subjects cover the consequences of environmentally sustainable transportation vs. the ""business-as-usual"" status quo, the new phenomenon of ""edge cities,"" automobile dependence as a social problem, the influence of leisure or discretionary travel and of company cars, the problems of freight transport, the future of railroads in Europe, the imposition of electronic road tolls, potential transport benefits of e-commerce, and the electric car.",Business & Economics,598,N/A,0,en

Braver Than You Think,Maggie Downs,Catapult,2020-05-12,"Newly married and established in her career as an award–winning newspaper journalist, Maggie Downs quits her job, sells her belongings, and embarks on the solo trip of a lifetime: Her mother’s. As a child, Maggie Downs often doubted that she would ever possess the courage to visit the destinations her mother dreamed of one day seeing. “You are braver than you think,” her mother always insisted. That statement would guide her as, over the course of one year, Downs backpacked through seventeen countries―visiting all the places her mother, struck with early–onset Alzheimer’s disease, could not visit herself―encountering some of the world’s most striking locales while confronting the slow loss of her mother. Interweaving travelogue with family memories, Braver Than You Think takes the reader hiking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu, white–water rafting on the Nile, volunteering at a monkey sanctuary in Bolivia, praying at an ashram in India, and fleeing the Arab Spring in Egypt. By embarking on an international journey, Downs learned to make every moment count―traveling around the globe and home again, losing a parent while discovering the world. Perfect for fans of adventure memoirs like Wild and Welcome to the Goddamn Ice Cube, Braver Than You Think explores grief and loss with tenderness, clarity, and humor, and offers a truly incredible roadmap to coping with the unimaginable.",Biography & Autobiography,305,N/A,0,en

"Have Mother, Will Travel","Claire Fontaine, Mia Fontaine",Harper Collins,2012-07-17,"A mother, a daughter, and a life-changing adventure around the world . . . Their bestselling memoir, Come Back, moved and inspired readers with the story of Mia Fontaine's harrowing drug addiction and her mother, Claire's, desperate and ultimately successful attempts to save her. Now it's a decade later and Claire and Mia each face a defining moment in her life, and a mother-daughter relationship that has frayed around the edges. At fifty-one, Claire's shed her identity as Mia's savior but realizes that, oops, she forgot to plan for life after motherhood; Mia, twenty-five and eager to step outside her role as recovery's poster child, finds adult life isn't all it's cracked up to be. Determined to transform themselves and their relationship once again, the pair sets off on a five-month around-the-world adventure. What awaits them is an extraordinary, often hilarious journey through twenty cities and twelve countries—one that includes mishaps, mayhem, and unexpected joys, from a passport-eating elephant to a calamitous camel ride around the Pyramids—and finally making peace with their tumultuous past in the lavender fields of France, where they live for the last four months of the trip. Seeing how self-possessed and community-minded twentysomethings are in other countries broadens Mia's perspective, helping her grow, and grow up. Claire uses the trip to examine her broken relationship with her own mother, a Holocaust survivor, and to create a vision for her second act. Watching her mom assess half a century of life, Mia comes to know her as Claire has always known Mia—as all mothers know their daughters—better than anyone else, and often better than themselves. Wiser for what they've learned from women in other cultures, and from each other, they return with a deepened sense of who they are and where they want to go—and with each embracing the mature friendship they've discovered and the profound love they share. Alternating between Claire and Mia's compelling and distinct voices, Have Mother, Will Travel is a testament to the power and beauty of the mother-daughter relationship, one that illuminates possibilities for our own lives.",Biography & Autobiography,379,3.5,3,en

"Saints, Cure-seekers and Miraculous Healing in Twelfth-century England",Ruth J. Salter,Boydell & Brewer,2021,"The cults of the saints were central to the medieval Church. These holy men and women acted as patrons and protectors to the religious communities who housed their relics and to the devotees who requested their assistance in petitioning God for a miracle. Among the collections of posthumous miracle stories, miracula, accounts of holy healing feature prominently and depict cure-seekers successfully securing their desired remedy for a range of ailments and afflictions. What can these miracle accounts tell us of the cure-seekers' experiences of their journey from ill health to recovery, and how was healthcare presented in these sources? This book undertakes an in-depth study of the miraculous cure-seeking process through the lens of Latin miracle accounts produced in twelfth-century England, a time both when saints' cults particularly flourished and there was an increasing transmission and dissemination of classical and Arabic medical works. Focused on shorter miracula with a predominantly localised focus, and thus on a select group of cure-seekers, it brings together studies of healthcare and pilgrimage to look at an alternative to medical intervention and the practicalities and processes of securing saintly assistance.",Angleterre,263,N/A,0,en

The Art of Travel,Alain de Botton,Penguin UK,2003-05-29,"THE SUNDAY TIMES TOP TEN BESTSELLER 'Honest, funny and dripping with witty aphorisms. Extremely entertaining and enlightening [...] all the way to journey's end' Herald One of our greatest voices in modern philosophy, author of The Course of Love, The Consolations of Philosophy, Religion for Atheists and The School of Life, presents a travel guide with a difference - an exploration of why we travel, and what we learn along the way... Few activities seem to promise as much happiness as going travelling: taking off for somewhere else, somewhere far from home, a place with more interesting weather, customs and landscapes. But although we are inundated with advice on where to travel to, we seldom ask why we go and how we might become more fulfilled by doing so. With the help of a selection of writers, artists and thinkers - including Flaubert, Edward Hopper, Wordsworth and Van Gogh - Alain de Botton provides invaluable insights into everything from holiday romance to hotel minibars, airports to sightseeing. The perfect antidote to those guides that tell us what to do when we get there, The Art of Travel tries to explain why we really went in the first place - and helpfully suggest how we might be happier on our journeys. 'Delightful, profound, entertaining. I doubt if de Botton has written a dull sentence in his life' Jan Morris 'An elegant and subtle work, unlike any other. Beguiling' Colin Thubron, The Times",Philosophy,169,N/A,0,en

The Travel Writing Tribe,Tim Hannigan,Hurst Publishers,2021-09-15,"Where can travel writing go in the twenty-first century? Author and lifelong travel writing aficionado Tim Hannigan sets out in search of this most venerable of genres, hunting down its legendary practitioners and confronting its greatest controversies. Is it ever okay for travel writers to make things up, and just where does the frontier between fact and fiction lie? What actually is travel writing, and is it just a genre dominated by posh white men? What of travel writing’s queasy colonial connections? Travelling from Monaco to Eton, from wintry Scotland to sun-scorched Greek hillsides, Hannigan swills beer with the indomitable Dervla Murphy, sips tea with the doyen of British explorers, delves into the diaries of Wilfred Thesiger and Patrick Leigh Fermor, and gains unexpected insights from Colin Thubron, Samanth Subramanian, Kapka Kassabova, William Dalrymple and many others. But along the way he realises how much is at stake: can his own love of travel writing survive this journey? The Travel Writing Tribe tackles head on the fierce critical debates usually confined to strictly academic discussions of the genre. This highly original book compels readers and travellers of all kinds to think about travel writing in new ways.",Travel,309,N/A,0,en

Ten Years a Nomad,Matthew Kepnes,Macmillan + ORM,2019-07-16,"Part memoir and part philosophical look at why we travel, filled with stories of Matt Kepnes' adventures abroad, an exploration of wanderlust and what it truly means to be a nomad. New York Times bestselling author of How to Travel the World on $50 a Day, Matthew Kepnes knows what it feels like to get the travel bug. After meeting some travelers on a trip to Thailand in 2005, he realized that living life meant more than simply meeting society's traditional milestones. Over 500,000 miles, 1,000 hostels, and 90 different countries later, Matt has compiled his favorite stories, experiences, and insights into this travel manifesto. Filled with the color and perspective that only hindsight and self-reflection can offer, these stories get to the real questions at the heart of wanderlust. Travel questions that transcend the basic ""how-to,"" and plumb the depths of what drives us to travel — and what extended travel around the world can teach us about life, ourselves, and our place in the world. Ten Years a Nomad is a heartfelt comprehension of the insatiable craving for travel, unraveling the authenticity of being a vagabond, not for months but for a fulfilling decade.",Travel,180,N/A,0,en

Smile When You're Lying,Chuck Thompson,Holt Paperbacks,2007-11-27,"From Bangkok to Bogotá, a hilarious behind-the-brochures tour of picture-perfect locales, dangerous destinations, and overrated hellholes from a guy who knows the truth about travel Travel writer, editor, and photographer Chuck Thompson has spent more than a decade traipsing through thirty-five (and counting) countries across the globe, and he's had enough. Enough of the half-truths demanded by magazine editors, enough of the endlessly recycled clichés regarded as good travel writing, and enough of the ugly secrets fiercely guarded by the travel industry. But mostly, he's had enough of returning home from assignments and leaving the most interesting stories and the most provocative insights on the editing-room floor. From getting swindled in Thailand to running afoul of customs inspectors in Belarus, from defusing hostile Swedish rockers backstage in Germany to a closed-door meeting with travel execs telling him why he's about to be fired once again, Thompson's no-holds-barred style is refreshing, invigorating, and all those other adjectives travel writers use to describe spa vacations where the main attraction is a daily colonic. Smile When You're Lying takes readers on an irresistible series of adventures in Europe, Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America, and beyond; details the effects of globalization on the casual traveler and ponders the future of travel as we know it; and offers up a treasure trove of travel-industry secrets collected throughout a decidedly speckled career.",Travel,334,N/A,0,en

Conquering Mountains: How to Solo Travel the World Fearlessly,"Matthew Kepnes, Kristin Addis",N/A,2018-06-06,"Do you dream of far off places, new sights, smells, tastes, and adventures? Have you been planning the trip of a lifetime but, after asking your partner, sister, best friend, cousin, and/or old high school classmate you barely speak with anymore, found that nobody can take off on a trip with you? Do you worry about how you'll afford it, that you'll be lonely, and most of all, how you'll make sure that you're safe? I found myself in the same position in 2012, searching for answers but coming up confused and empty-handed. I just wanted someone to make it all easy for me. I wanted to know that I was going to be okay. I started out as a normal girl without a trust fund and full of fears, but through traveling I learned that I'm brave, powerful, capable, and strong. You can find the same girl within you. This book was written to help you do just that.This is THE time and sanity-saving resource I wish existed before I started traveling.

Traveling in Place,Bernd Stiegler,University of Chicago Press,2013-10-28,"Armchair travel may seem like an oxymoron. Doesn’t travel require us to leave the house? And yet, anyone who has lost herself for hours in the descriptive pages of a novel or the absorbing images of a film knows the very real feeling of having explored and experienced a different place or time without ever leaving her seat. No passport, no currency, no security screening required—the luxury of armchair travel is accessible to us all. In Traveling in Place, Bernd Stiegler celebrates this convenient, magical means of transport in all its many forms. Organized into twenty-one “legs”—or short chapters—Traveling in Place begins with a consideration of Xavier de Maistre’s 1794 Voyage autour de ma chambre, an account of the forty-two-day “journey around his room” Maistre undertook as a way to entertain himself while under house arrest. Stiegler is fascinated by the notion of exploring the familiar as though it were completely new and strange. He engages writers as diverse as Roussel, Beckett, Perec, Robbe-Grillet, Cortázar, Kierkegaard, and Borges, all of whom show how the everyday can be brilliantly transformed. Like the best guidebooks, Traveling in Place is more interested in the idea of travel as a state of mind than as a physical activity, and Stiegler reflects on the different ways that traveling at home have manifested themselves in the modern era, from literature and film to the virtual possibilities of the Internet, blogs, and contemporary art. Reminiscent of the pictorial meditations of Sebald, but possessed of the intellectual playfulness of Calvino, Traveling in Place offers an entertaining and creative Baedeker to journeying at home.",Travel,262,N/A,0,en

Charlotte Sometimes,Penelope Farmer,New York Review of Books,2016-07-06,"A time-travel story that is both a poignant exploration of human identity and an absorbing tale of suspense. It’s natural to feel a little out of place when you’re the new girl, but when Charlotte Makepeace wakes up after her first night at boarding school, she’s baffled: everyone thinks she’s a girl called Clare Mobley, and even more shockingly, it seems she has traveled forty years back in time to 1918. In the months to follow, Charlotte wakes alternately in her own time and in Clare’s. And instead of having only one new set of rules to learn, she also has to contend with the unprecedented strangeness of being an entirely new person in an era she knows nothing about. Her teachers think she’s slow, the other girls find her odd, and, as she spends more and more time in 1918, Charlotte starts to wonder if she remembers how to be Charlotte at all. If she doesn’t figure out some way to get back to the world she knows before the end of the term, she might never have another chance.",Juvenile Fiction,209,N/A,0,en
The Best Time Travel Stories of the 20th Century,"Harry Turtledove, Martin H. Greenberg",Del Rey,2004-12-28,"LEAP INTO THE FUTURE, AND SHOOT BACK TO THE PAST H. G. Wells’s seminal short story “The Time Machine,” published in 1895, provided the springboard for modern science fiction’s time travel explosion. Responding to their own fascination with the subject, the greatest visionary writers of the twentieth century penned some of their finest stories. Here are eighteen of the most exciting tales ever told, including “Time’s Arrow” In Arthur C. Clarke’s classic, two brilliant physicists finally crack the mystery of time travel—with appalling consequences. “Death Ship” Richard Matheson, author of Somewhere in Time, unveils a chilling scenario concerning three astronauts who stumble upon the conundrum of past and future. “Yesterday was Monday” If all the world’s a stage, Theodore Sturgeon’s compelling tale follows the odyssey of an ordinary joe who winds up backstage. “Rainbird” R.A. Lafferty reflects on what might have been in this brainteaser about an inventor so brilliant that he invents himself right out of existence. “Timetipping” What if everyone time-traveled except you? Jack Dann provides some surprising answers in this literary gem. . . . as well as stories by Poul Anderson • L. Sprague de Camp • Joe Haldeman • John Kessel • Nancy Kress • Henry Kuttner • Ursula K. Le Guin • Larry Niven • Charles Sheffield • Robert Silverberg • Connie Willis By turns frightening, puzzling, and fantastic, these stories engage us in situations that may one day break free of the bonds of fantasy . . . to enter the realm of the future: our future.

Searching for Zion,Emily Raboteau,Open Road + Grove/Atlantic,2013-01-08,"From Jerusalem to Ghana to Katrina-ravaged New Orleans, a woman reclaims her history in a “beautifully written and thought-provoking” memoir (Dave Eggers, author of A Hologram for the King and Zeitoun). A biracial woman from a country still divided along racial lines, Emily Raboteau never felt at home in America. As the daughter of an African American religious historian, she understood the Promised Land as the spiritual realm black people yearned for. But while visiting Israel, the Jewish Zion, she was surprised to discover black Jews. More surprising was the story of how they got there. Inspired by their exodus, her question for them is the same one she keeps asking herself: have you found the home you’re looking for? In this American Book Award–winning inquiry into contemporary and historical ethnic displacement, Raboteau embarked on a ten-year journey around the globe and back in time to explore the complex and contradictory perspectives of black Zionists. She talked to Rastafarians and African Hebrew Israelites, Evangelicals and Ethiopian Jews—all in search of territory that is hard to define and harder to inhabit. Uniting memoir with cultural investigation, Raboteau overturns our ideas of place, patriotism, dispossession, citizenship, and country in “an exceptionally beautiful . . . book about a search for the kind of home for which there is no straight route, the kind of home in which the journey itself is as revelatory as the destination” (Edwidge Danticat, author of The Farming of Bones).",Social Science,310,N/A,0,en

When Scott Keyes booked flights to Italy for $130 roundtrip and Japan for $169 roundtrip, he didn’t just uncover amazing fares; it was the beginning of a new approach that makes travel possible for anyone who has dreamed of seeing the world. What’s stopping us all from traveling more? The confusion of buying airfare—not knowing when to book, where to buy, or what to pay. Take More Vacations is the guidebook for anyone hoping to turn one annual vacation into three. Readers will discover why the traditional way of planning vacations undercuts our ability to enjoy them, and how a new strategy can lead to cheaper fares and more trips. Why cheap flights never have to be inconvenient flights, and all the steps you can take to get a good fare even when you don’t have flexibility. The surprising best week for international travel, and how small airports actually get the best deals. Keyes challenges the conventional wisdom that it costs thousands of dollars to fly overseas and shows readers how to make previously unthinkable trips possible.",Travel,290,N/A,0,en

Travel by Design,"Marlon Gary Boarnet, Randall Crane","Oxford University Press, USA",2001,"""In Travel by Design, Boarnet and Crane demonstrate that the influence of the built environment on travel is more complex and misleading than often portrayed, a relationship that reveals predictable patterns and useful policy advice. The authors evaluate design reforms within the range of congestion management and air quality improvement policies, providing both policy advice and the first methodical assessment of the governmental and regulatory challenge of building fewer auto-dependent communities. Overall, the work gives a better understanding of how urban design influences travel behavior, while analyzing the potential for land use planning to address transportation problems.""--Jacket.",City planning,235,N/A,0,en

Argumentation in Artificial Intelligence,Iyad Rahwan,Springer Science & Business Media,2009-06-13,"Argumentation is all around us. Letters to the Editor often make points of cons- tency, and “Why” is one of the most frequent questions in language, asking for r- sons behind behaviour. And argumentation is more than ‘reasoning’ in the recesses of single minds, since it crucially involves interaction. It cements the coordinated social behaviour that has allowed us, in small bands of not particularly physically impressive primates, to dominate the planet, from the mammoth hunt all the way up to organized science. This volume puts argumentation on the map in the eld of Arti cial Intelligence. This theme has been coming for a while, and some famous pioneers are chapter authors, but we can now see a broader systematic area emerging in the sum of topics and results. As a logician, I nd this intriguing, since I see AI as ‘logic continued by other means’, reminding us of broader views of what my discipline is about. Logic arose originally out of re ection on many-agent practices of disputation, in Greek Ant- uity, but also in India and China. And logicians like me would like to return to this broader agenda of rational agency and intelligent interaction. Of course, Aristotle also gave us a formal systems methodology that deeply in uenced the eld, and eventually connected up happily with mathematical proof and foundations.",Computers,496,3,1,en

Over the years it is greatly felt that a standing reference material which can help abank worker to be aware of this rights as bank employee is necessary. Hence this effort on the part of mine to give you a summary of your rights as a bank employee edited from the available sources.

Every line present day’s employees in banks are now referring as a service condition and benefits has got an historical struggle and historical negotiation.

Jungle Travel & Survival,John Beaumont Walden,Globe Pequot,2001,"Adventure travel, whether in the rain forests of Brazil or the jungles of Belize, can be filled with risk and sometimes life-or-death situations. Here is a complete guide on how to cope with and survive the unique and often deadly challenges of a jungle excursion. Written by a seasoned veteran of over 75 expeditions, this book will teach you everything you need to know on staying alive in the jungle. Learn the different types of tropical environment you'll encounter (from rain forests to swamps); what type of gear you'll need; how to effectively combat traveler's diarrhea and malaria; the do's and don'ts of interacting with unknown tribal civilizations; group dynamics in exotic environments or extreme circumstances; how to cope with every type of hazard, both physical (arthropods, plants, reptiles) and psychological; what to do if you get separated from civilization, and what steps you can take to increase your odds for survival and rescue. --From publisher description.",Rain forest ecology,0,N/A,0,en

World Travel,"Anthony Bourdain, Laurie Woolever",HarperCollins,2021-04-20,"A guide to some of the world’s most fascinating places, as seen and experienced by writer, television host, and relentlessly curious traveler Anthony Bourdain Anthony Bourdain saw more of the world than nearly anyone. His travels took him from the hidden pockets of his hometown of New York to a tribal longhouse in Borneo, from cosmopolitan Buenos Aires, Paris, and Shanghai to Tanzania’s utter beauty and the stunning desert solitude of Oman’s Empty Quarter—and many places beyond. In World Travel, a life of experience is collected into an entertaining, practical, fun and frank travel guide that gives readers an introduction to some of his favorite places—in his own words. Featuring essential advice on how to get there, what to eat, where to stay and, in some cases, what to avoid, World Travel provides essential context that will help readers further appreciate the reasons why Bourdain found a place enchanting and memorable. Supplementing Bourdain’s words are a handful of essays by friends, colleagues, and family that tell even deeper stories about a place, including sardonic accounts of traveling with Bourdain by his brother, Christopher; a guide to Chicago’s best cheap eats by legendary music producer Steve Albini, and more. Additionally, each chapter includes illustrations by Wesley Allsbrook. For veteran travelers, armchair enthusiasts, and those in between, World Travel offers a chance to experience the world like Anthony Bourdain.",Travel,371,4,1,en

Stony the Road,"Henry Louis Gates, Jr.",Penguin,2020-04-07,"“Stony the Road presents a bracing alternative to Trump-era white nationalism. . . . In our current politics we recognize African-American history—the spot under our country’s rug where the terrorism and injustices of white supremacy are habitually swept. Stony the Road lifts the rug."" —Nell Irvin Painter, New York Times Book Review A profound new rendering of the struggle by African-Americans for equality after the Civil War and the violent counter-revolution that resubjugated them, by the bestselling author of The Black Church and The Black Box. The abolition of slavery in the aftermath of the Civil War is a familiar story, as is the civil rights revolution that transformed the nation after World War II. But the century in between remains a mystery: if emancipation sparked ""a new birth of freedom"" in Lincoln's America, why was it necessary to march in Martin Luther King, Jr.'s America? In this new book, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., one of our leading chroniclers of the African-American experience, seeks to answer that question in a history that moves from the Reconstruction Era to the ""nadir"" of the African-American experience under Jim Crow, through to World War I and the Harlem Renaissance. Through his close reading of the visual culture of this tragic era, Gates reveals the many faces of Jim Crow and how, together, they reinforced a stark color line between white and black Americans. Bringing a lifetime of wisdom to bear as a scholar, filmmaker, and public intellectual, Gates uncovers the roots of structural racism in our own time, while showing how African Americans after slavery combatted it by articulating a vision of a ""New Negro"" to force the nation to recognize their humanity and unique contributions to America as it hurtled toward the modern age. The story Gates tells begins with great hope, with the Emancipation Proclamation, Union victory, and the liberation of nearly 4 million enslaved African-Americans. Until 1877, the federal government, goaded by the activism of Frederick Douglass and many others, tried at various turns to sustain their new rights. But the terror unleashed by white paramilitary groups in the former Confederacy, combined with deteriorating economic conditions and a loss of Northern will, restored ""home rule"" to the South. The retreat from Reconstruction was followed by one of the most violent periods in our history, with thousands of black people murdered or lynched and many more afflicted by the degrading impositions of Jim Crow segregation. An essential tour through one of America's fundamental historical tragedies, Stony the Road is also a story of heroic resistance, as figures such as W. E. B. Du Bois and Ida B. Wells fought to create a counter-narrative, and culture, inside the lion's mouth. As sobering as this tale is, it also has within it the inspiration that comes with encountering the hopes our ancestors advanced against the longest odds.",History,322,N/A,0,en

Travel and Trade in the Middle Ages,Paul B. Newman,McFarland,2011-04-15,"Transportation and trade in the Middle Ages were more developed and varied than is commonly thought. This book examines why medieval Europeans traveled--from making pilgrimages to engaging in international trade--and surveys in detail how they traveled, both by land and water. Travel and trade were inextricably linked to transportation, and over time an infrastructure of roads, bridges, and accommodations grew across Europe, enabling people and goods to move around the continent and beyond. Also explored are the hardships faced by medieval travelers, including storms at sea, avalanches in the Alps, the presence of pirates and robbers, and the fundamental problems of finding a meal and shelter.",History,0,N/A,0,en

It is Miss Bishop's first volume of verse since Poems, which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1955. This new collection consists of two parts. Under the general heading ""Brazil"" are grouped eleven poems including ""Manuelzinho,"" ""The Armadillo,"" ""Twelfth Morning, or What You Will,"" ""The Riverman,"" ""Brazil, January 1, 1502"" and the title poem. The second section, entitled ""Elsewhere,"" includes others ""First Death in Nova Scotia,"" ""Manners,"" ""Sandpiper,"" ""From Trollope's Journal,"" and ""Visits to St. Elizabeths."" In addition to the poems there is an extraordinary story of a Nova Scotia childhood, ""In the Village."" Robert Lowell has recently written, ""I am sure no living poet is as curious and observant as Miss Bishop. What cuts so deep is that each poem is inspired by her own tone, a tone of large, grave tenderness and sorrowing amusement. She is too sure of herself for empty mastery and breezy plagiarism, too interested for confession and musical monotony, too powerful for mismanaged fire, and too civilized for idiosyncratic incoherence. She has a humorous, commanding genius for picking up the unnoticed, now making something sprightly and right, and now a great monument. Once her poems, each shining, were too few. Now they are many.

The Bullet Journal Method,Ryder Carroll,Fourth Estate,2021-12,"THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Transform your life using the Bullet Journal Method, the revolutionary organisational system and worldwide phenomenon. The Bullet Journal Method will undoubtedly transform your life, in more ways than you can imagine' Hal Elrod, author of The Miracle Morning In his long-awaited first book, Ryder Carroll, the creator of the enormously popular Bullet Journal organisational system, explains how to use his method to: * TRACK YOUR PAST: using nothing more than a pen and paper, create a clear, comprehensive, and organised record of your thoughts and goals. * ORDER YOUR PRESENT: find daily calm by prioritising and minimising your workload and tackling your to-do list in a more mindful and productive way. * PLAN YOUR FUTURE: establish and appraise your short-term and long-term goals, plan more complex projects simply and effectively, and live your life with meaning and purpose. Like many of us, Ryder Carroll tried everything to get organised - countless apps, systems, planners, you name it. Nothing really worked. Then he invented his own simple system that required only pen and paper, which he found both effective and calming. He shared his method with a few friends, and before long he had a worldwide viral movement. The system combines elements of a wishlist, a to-do list, and a diary. It helps you identify what matters and set goals accordingly. By breaking long-term goals into small actionable steps, users map out an approachable path towards continual improvement, allowing them to stay focused despite the crush of incoming demands. But this is much more than a time management book. It's also a manifesto for what Ryder calls ""intentional living"": making sure that your beliefs and actions align. Even if you already use a Bullet Journal, this book gives you new exercises to become more calm and focused, new insights on how to prioritise well, and a new awareness of the power of analogue tools in a digital world. *** This book has been printed with three different colour designs, black, Nordic blue and emerald.

This brief report focuses on the so-called ""Gateway Experience,"" a training program originally designed by the Monroe Institute, a Virginia-based institute for the study of human consciousness. The Gateway experience uses sound tapes to manipulate brainwaves with a goal of creating an altered state of consciousness, which includes out-of-body experiences, energy healing, remote viewing, and time travel.

Aquatint Worlds,Douglas Fordham,Association of Human Rights Institutes series,2019,"An illuminating investigation of how aquatint travel books transformed the way Britons viewed the world and their place within it In the late 18th century, British artists embraced the medium of aquatint for its ability to produce prints with rich and varied tones that became even more stunning with the addition of color. At the same time, the expanding purview of the British empire created a market for images of far-away places. Book publishers quickly seized on these two trends and began producing travel books illustrated with aquatint prints of Indian cave temples, Chinese waterways, African villages, and more. Offering a close analysis of three exceptional publications--Thomas and William Daniell's Oriental Scenery (1795-1808), William Alexander's Costume of China (1797-1805), and Samuel Daniell's African Scenery and Animals (1804-5)--this volume examines how aquatint became a preferred medium for the visual representation of cultural difference, and how it subtly shaped the direction of Western modernism.

Identified Flying Objects,Dr. Michael P. Masters,Masters Creative ,2019-03-22,"Could “UFOs” and “Aliens” simply be us, but from the future? This provocative new book cautiously examines the premise that extraterrestrials may instead be our distant human descendants, using the anthropological tool of time travel to visit and study us in their own hominin evolutionary past. Dr. Michael P. Masters, a professor of biological anthropology specializing in human evolutionary anatomy, archaeology, and biomedicine, explores how the persistence of long-term biological and cultural trends in human evolution may ultimately result in us becoming the ones piloting these disc-shaped craft, which are likely the very devices that allow our future progeny to venture backward across the landscape of time. Moreover, these extratempestrials are ubiquitously described as bipedal, large-brained, hairless, human-like beings, who communicate with us in our own languages, and who possess technology advanced beyond, but clearly built upon, our own. These accounts, coupled with a thorough understanding of the past and modern human condition, point to the continuation of established biological and cultural trends here on Earth, long into the distant human future.",Science,354,N/A,0,en

Culture on Tour,Edward M. Bruner,University of Chicago Press,2005,"Recruited to be a lecturer on a group tour of Indonesia, Edward M. Bruner decided to make the tourists aware of tourism itself. He photographed tourists photographing Indonesians, asking the group how they felt having their pictures taken without their permission. After a dance performance, Bruner explained to the group that the exhibition was not traditional, but instead had been set up specifically for tourists. His efforts to induce reflexivity led to conflict with the tour company, which wanted the displays to be viewed as replicas of culture and to remain unexamined. Although Bruner was eventually fired, the experience became part of a sustained exploration of tourist performances, narratives, and practices. Synthesizing more than twenty years of research in cultural tourism, Culture on Tour analyzes a remarkable variety of tourist productions, ranging from safari excursions in Kenya and dance dramas in Bali to an Abraham Lincoln heritage site in Illinois. Bruner examines each site in all its particularity, taking account of global and local factors, as well as the multiple perspectives of the various actors—the tourists, the producers, the locals, and even the anthropologist himself. The collection will be essential to those in the field as well as to readers interested in globalization and travel.",Art,319,N/A,0,en
Economic Psychology of Travel and Tourism,John C. Crotts,Psychology Press,1994,"Here is an informative overview of economic psychology as applied to the study of travel and tourism. Economic psychology provides evidence about the behavior of consumers that is instrumental for the development of economic theory as well as for marketing, consumer policy, and research on travel and tourism. Economic Psychology of Travel and Tourism stimulates new approaches to the study of travel and tourism. Chapters contain empirical studies and explore conceptual and theoretical perspectives of the sociopsychological mechanisms that underlie travel and tourism demand and the economics of destinations. This book is a helpful resource for travel and marketing professionals and advanced students of tourism. These individuals often have a good background in psychology and in marketing, but little, if any, knowledge on how the two fields are linked. Economic Psychology of Travel and Tourism helps them see and understand the broader economic psychological issues that impact both the supply and demand sides of the travel and tourism economy. Economic Psychology of Travel and Tourism discusses such issues as corporate identity, promotion/advertising, information processing, meaning structure, and consumer behavior, research, and demand. Specific chapters in this book include: an investigation of the relationship between the way tourists think to realize their dreams and the tourist industry's potential to make those dreams come true an examination of current literature related to 4 prevalent topical areas associated with consumer behavior in recreational and touristic contexts an exploratory study to determine the extent to which friends and/or relatives influence travel decisionmaking processes beyond the role of information provider the development of a model of decisionmaking associated with long-term, complex purchase processes effects of tour brochures with experiential information a study of promotion and demand in international tourism Economic Psychology of Travel and Tourism clarifies for readers applications of psychological theories and methods to the study of travel and tourism phenomena, helping them recognize areas of economic and social psychology that can help them deal more effectively with fundamental issues underlying the travel and tourism economy.",Business & Economics,160,N/A,0,en

The Humanities Pandemic,Margaret Topping,Springer Nature,2023-07-25,"This book explores how the Humanities can play an essential services role in addressing global challenges such as the Covid pandemic. In arguing for their contribution alongside that of the Health Sciences, it calls for a new critical engagement – honest and self-reflective – from Humanities scholars with the question of how to overcome a fundamental challenge facing universities globally: finding a common language and set of ‘cultural’ assumptions between disciplines as the basis for communication. The book looks at the nature of the challenges that can beset collaboration across disciplines (and indeed across sectors, notably between researchers and the general public) and argues for a new Translational Humanities, in both the sense of an applied Humanities and a Humanities that can translate itself across disciplines and sectors. Crucially, too, it suggests that it is not narratives such as a pandemic novel or contagion film that successfully engage with contentious debates about the challenges of Covid, but rather critically distant texts and thematic contexts that typically place the self in the position of other like travel narratives. This book sits at a previously unconsidered intersection between debates around interdisciplinary collaboration and communication, theories of intercultural contact and encounter, and the role of the Humanities in tackling global issues.",Literary Criticism,152,N/A,0,en

Multimodal Usability,"Niels Ole Bernsen, Laila Dybkjær",Springer Science & Business Media,2009-10-03,"This preface tells the story of how Multimodal Usability responds to a special challenge. Chapter 1 describes the goals and structure of this book. The idea of describing how to make multimodal computer systems usable arose in the European Network of Excellence SIMILAR – “Taskforce for cre- ing human-machine interfaces SIMILAR to human-human communication”, 2003– 2007, www. similar. cc. SIMILAR brought together people from multimodal signal processing and usability with the aim of creating enabling technologies for new kinds of multimodal systems and demonstrating results in research prototypes. Most of our colleagues in the network were, in fact, busy extracting features and guring out how to demonstrate progress in working interactive systems, while claiming not to have too much of a notion of usability in system development and evaluation. It was proposed that the authors support the usability of the many multimodal pro- types underway by researching and presenting a methodology for building usable multimodal systems. We accepted the challenge, rst and foremost, no doubt, because the formidable team spirit in SIMILAR could make people accept outrageous things. Second, h- ing worked for nearly two decades on making multimodal systems usable, we were curious – curious at the opportunity to try to understand what happens to traditional usability work, that is, work in human–computer interaction centred around tra- tional graphical user interfaces (GUIs), when systems become as multimodal and as advanced in other ways as those we build in research today.",Computers,435,N/A,0,en

The first goal is to explore the difference between fairness and justice in language assessment. The authors distinguish internal and external dimensions of the equitable and just treatment of individuals taking language tests which are used as gatekeeping devices to determine access to education and employment, immigrant status, citizenship, and other rights. The second goal is to show how the extent of test fairness can be demonstrated and improved using the tools of psychometrics, in particular the models collectively known as Rasch measurement. “This book will have an enormous impact on the field of language assessment. Using Rasch analysis models to explore and identify sources of unfairness, the authors make a compelling case for fairness in the design and implementation of language assessment instruments and for justice in the interpretation and use of test results. A real strength of the book is that it guides readers through analytical techniques in an accessible way.” Dan Douglas, Professor Emeritus, Applied Linguistics Program, Iowa State University.",Foreign Language Study,78,N/A,0,en

Cartographies of Travel and Navigation,James R. Akerman,University of Chicago Press,2010-11-15,"Finding one’s way with a map is a relatively recent phenomenon. In premodern times, maps were used, if at all, mainly for planning journeys in advance, not for guiding travelers on the road. With the exception of navigational sea charts, the use of maps by travelers only became common in the modern era; indeed, in the last two hundred years, maps have become the most ubiquitous and familiar genre of modern cartography. Examining the historical relationship between travelers, navigation, and maps, Cartographies of Travel and Navigation considers the cartographic response to the new modalities of modern travel brought about by technological and institutional developments in the twentieth century. Highlighting the ways in which the travelers, operators, and planners of modern transportation systems value maps as both navigation tools and as representatives of a radical new mobility, this collection brings the cartography of travel—by road, sea, rail, and air—to the forefront, placing maps at the center of the history of travel and movement. Richly and colorfully illustrated, Cartographies of Travel and Navigation ably fills the void in historical literature on transportation mapping.",Science,383,N/A,0,en

Gee, Ph.D., DPS (Hon.), James C. Makens, Ph.D., and Dexter J.L. Choy, Ph.D. assert that public policies--local, regional, and even global--play a vital role in defining the quality of a visitor's experience. The savvy hospitality and travel professional will not only understand these influences, but know how to shape them. The Travel Industry helps the student achieve both goals. This innovative third edition focuses on topics of a more global nature, such as concepts of trade barriers as impediments to promoting international travel and tourism. Specific illustrations are offered on how government policies, including diplomatic recognition, will affect tourism trade relationships. The third edition also covers current U.S. policies and reciprocal acts to promote tourism exchanges with other countries, as well as a special section on the amusement, entertainment, and retail product aspects of tourism. Other highlights of the third edition include: * the impact of technology on travel distribution systems * ticketless travel leading to a redefining of the role of tomorrow's travel agents * expanded text on land transportation, including discussions on NAFTA's effect on rail travel * information on tourist business enterprises * technology and the international hotel business.

A Century of Travels in China,"Douglas Kerr, Julia Kuehn",Hong Kong University Press,2007-05-01,"Writings of travelers have shaped ideas about an evolving China, while preconceived ideas about China also shaped the way they saw the country. A Century of Travels in China explores the impressions of these writers on various themes, from Chinese cities and landscapes to the work of Europeans abroad. From the time of the first Opium War to the declaration of the People's Republic, China's history has been one of extraordinary change and stubborn continuities. At the same time, the country has beguiled, scared and puzzled people in the West. The Victorian public admired and imitated Chinese fashions, in furniture and design, gardens and clothing, while maintaining a generally negative idea of the Chinese empire as pagan, backward and cruel. In the first half of the twentieth century, the fascination continued. Most foreigners were aware that revolutionary changes were taking place in Chinese politics and society, yet most still knew very little about the country. But what about those few people from the English-speaking world who had first-hand experience of the place? What did they have to say about the ""real"" China? To answer this question, we have to turn to the travel accounts and memoirs of people who went to see for themselves, during China's most traumatic century. While this book represents the work of expert scholars, it is also accessible to non-specialists with an interest in travel writing and China, and care has been taken to explain the critical terms and ideas deployed in the essays from recent scholarship of the travel genre.",Language Arts & Disciplines,255,N/A,0,en

Viewing the Islamic Orient,Pallavi Pandit Laisram,Routledge,2014-07-11,"The Islamic Orient studies the travel accounts of four British travelers during the nineteenth century. Through a critical analysis of these works, the author examines and questions Edward Said’s concept of ""Orientalism"" and ""Orientalist"" discourse: his argument that the orientalist view had such a strong influence on westerners that they invariably perceived the orient through the lens of orientalism. On the contrary, the author argues, no single factor had an overwhelming influence on them. She shows that westerners often struggled with their own conceptions of the orient, and being away for long periods from their homelands, were in fact able to stand between cultures and view them both as insiders and outsiders. The literary devices used to examine these writings are structure, characterization, satire, landscape description, and word choice, as also the social and political milieu of the writers. The major influences in the author’s analysis are Said, Foucault, Abdel-Malek and Marie Louise Pratt.",History,266,N/A,0,en
Tourism and Travel during the Cold War,"Sune Bechmann Pedersen, Christian Noack",Routledge,2019-09-11,"The Iron Curtain was not an impenetrable divide, and contacts between East and West took place regularly and on various levels throughout the Cold War. This book explores how the European tourist industry transcended the ideological fault lines and the communist states attracted an ever-increasing number of Western tourists. Based on extensive original research, it examines the ramifications of tourism, from sun-and-sea package tours to human rights travels, in key Eastern European locations including East Berlin, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Albania. The book’s analysis of the politics, culture, and history of tourism to the East offers important new perspectives on European tourism in the twentieth century.

Health Monitoring of Structural Materials and Components,Douglas Adams,John Wiley & Sons,2007-06-05,"The first complete introduction to health monitoring, encapsulating both technical information and practical case studies spanning the breadth of the subject.Written by a highly-respected figure in structural health monitoring, this book provides readers with the technical skills and practical understanding required to solve new problems encountered in the emerging field of health monitoring. The book presents a suite of methods and applications in loads identification (usage monitoring), in-situ damage identification (diagnostics), and damage and performance prediction (prognostics). Concepts in modelling, measurements, and data analysis are applied through real-world case studies to identify loading, assess damage, and predict the performance of structural components, as well as examine engine components, automotive accessories, aircraft parts, spacecraft components, civil structures and defence system components.In particular the book, provides the reader with a fundamental and practical understanding of the material, discusses models demonstrating the physical basis for health monitoring techniques, gives a detailed review of the best practices in dynamic measurements including sensing, presents numerous data analysis techniques using model- and signal-based methods, discusses case studies involving real-world applications of health monitoring, offers end-of-chapter problems to enhance the study of the topic for students and instructors; and includes an accompanying website with MATLAB programs providing hands-on training to readers for writing health monitoring model simulation and data analysis algorithms.Health Monitoring of Structural Materials and Components is an excellent introductory text for newcomers to the subject as well as an excellent study tool for students and lecturers. Practitioners and researchers, those with a greater understanding and application of the technical skills involved, will also find this essential reading as a reference text to address current and future challenges in this field. The wide variety of case studies will appeal to a broad spectrum of engineers in the aerospace, civil, mechanical, machinery and defence communities. In particular the book: provides the reader with a fundamental and practical understanding of the material; discusses models demonstrating the physical basis for health monitoring techniques; gives a detailed review of the best practices in dynamic measurements including sensing; presents numerous data analysis techniques using model- and signal-based methods; discusses case studies involving real-world applications of health monitoring; offers end-of-chapter problems to enhance the study of the topic for students and instructors; and includes an accompanying website with MATLAB programs providing hands-on training to readers for writing health monitoring model simulation and data analysis algorithms.",Science,488,N/A,0,en

"Have Robot, Will Travel—A Byron Preiss Robot Mystery",Alexander C. Irvine,iBooks,2023-11-21,"From Alexander C. Irvine, the Locus Award-winning author of A SCATTERING OF JADES, comes a thrilling new robot mystery set in the world of the late SF Grand Master and beloved author, Isaac Asimov. Exiled to the colony Nova Levis, roboticist Derec Avery and Auroran ambassador Ariel Burgess have tried to make their best of their situation, after exposing an anti-robot conspiracy on Earth five years before that cost them their jobs and their freedom. But all that is about to change. . . A human has been murdered on Kopernik, a space station orbiting the Earth, and all the clues point toward a robot as the killer. But how can that be, when robots are programmed to never bring harm to humans? It’s a familiar situation for Derec and Ariel—the sort of mystery that led to their current status as political pariahs. Still, not even an exiled robot expert can turn down an opportunity to add his expertise to the investigation, and before too long, Derec is on his way to Kopernik. Ariel, meanwhile, has a mystery of her own to unravel. With the help of old friends—and potentially new enemies— Derec searches for the identity of a killer, unaware that Ariel is walking directly into the center of the web of intrigue....",Fiction,376,N/A,0,en

The Trump White House,Ronald Kessler,Forum Books,2018-04-03,"The unvarnished and unbiased inside story of President Donald Trump and his White House by New York Times bestselling author Ronald Kessler Based on exclusive interviews with the president and his staff, The Trump White House: Changing the Rules of the Game tells the real story of what Donald Trump is like, who influences him, how he makes decisions, what he says about the people around him, and how he operates when the television lights go off, while portraying the inside story of the successes that have already brought solid results as well as the stumbles that have turned off even longtime supporters and undercut his agenda. The Trump White House reveals: • Trump aides Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner have been responsible for Trump’s most disastrous decisions. Trump is aware that his daughter and son-in-law are problems and has hinted to them that they should go back to New York. Seeing Jared on TV, Trump said, “Look at Jared, he looks like a little boy, like a child.” • First Lady Melania Trump has a tremendous impact on policy and strategy. She sits in on meetings and is widely admired by aides for her judgment. • Kellyanne Conway is the No. 1 White House leaker. • Trump’s Secret Service Director Randolph “Tex” Alles proposed withdrawing protection from some Trump family members and aides to save money. Horrified White House staffers shot down the idea. • Trump has told friends that billionaires are constantly asking him to fix them up with longtime Communications Director Hope Hicks, a former model, but he says he refuses. • Trump calls certain reporters directly, feeding them stories attributed to “a senior White House official,” creating the impression that the White House leaks even more than it already does. Never before has an American president had so much impact on the country and the world in so short a time as Donald Trump. Yet no president has stirred so much controversy, dominating media coverage and conversation both pro and con. Months after Trump took office, consumer confidence hit a seventeen-year high, unemployment plummeted to the lowest level in seventeen years, and the stock market zoomed to repeated record highs. At the same time, ISIS was nearly defeated, Arab countries banded together to stop financing terrorists and promoting radical Islamic ideology, and Trump’s decision to send missiles into Syria because of its use of chemical weapons and his strident warnings to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un made it clear to adversaries that they take on the United States at their peril. Yet for all the media coverage, Trump remains a cipher. Ronald Kessler has known Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for two decades and understands him better than any other journalist. The book includes an exclusive interview with Trump, the only interview he says he has given or will give for a book as president. Crammed with media-grabbing revelations. The Trump White House is the unvarnished and unbiased inside story that answers the question: Who is Donald Trump?",Political Science,314,N/A,0,en

The chapter situates these questions in three debates in recent historiography: the history of transnational tourism, of the cultural Cold War, and of mobilities in the supposedly backward and static societies in Eastern Europe.",Cold War,0,N/A,0,en

Lisa studied abroad in college, and for their honeymoon Lisa and her husband toured Europe. During her travels to Malta, an older man tried to give her some advice based on his own experience living on the island since he was a young boy. She was not sure if she should talk to the stranger but was interested in his advice. When traveling to some places she was wary to talk to locals because she was afraid that they weren't being genuine. Through her travels, Lisa learned how much locals had to share with tourists. Lisa created the Greater Than a Tourist book series to help connect people with locals. A topic that locals are very passionate about sharing.",,110,N/A,0,en

The Maze of Banking,Gary B. Gorton,Oxford University Press,2015-03-03,"After the financial crisis of 2007-2008, analysts continue to question the security of banking sectors in nations in Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Africa. Why do such crises recur? What is it about the accumulation of bank debt that potentially jeopardizes national and global banking systems? There is no one better-equipped to answer such questions than Gary Gorton, who has been studying financial crises since his PhD thesis in 1983. The Maze of Banking contains a collection of his academic papers on the subjects of banks, banking, and financial crises. The papers in this volume span almost 175 years of U.S. banking history, from pre-U.S. Civil War private bank notes issued during the U.S. Free Banking Era (1837-1863), followed by the U.S. National Banking Era (1863-1914) before there was a central bank, through loan sales, securitization, and the financial crisis of 2007-2008. Banking changed profoundly during these 175 years, yet it did not change in fundamental ways. The forms of money changed, resulting in associated changes in the information structure of the economy. Bank debt evolved as an instrument for storing value, smoothing consumption, and transactions, but its fundamental nature did not change. In all its forms, it is vulnerable to bank runs without government intervention. Comprehensive and informative, the collection is the definitive volume on the history of the U.S. banking system. These papers provide the framework for understanding how the financial crisis of 2007-2008 developed and steps to promote a stable banking industry, thereby preventing future economic crises. The Maze of Banking is essential reading material for students and academics with an interest in economics, finance, and the history of banking.",Business & Economics,690,N/A,0,en

Bartlett's Familiar Quotations,Geoffrey O'Brien,"Little, Brown",2022-10-25,"From ancient Egypt to today, enjoy a sweeping survey of world history through its most memorable words in this completely revised and updated nineteenth edition. More than 150 years after its initial publication, Bartlett’s Familiar Quotations now enters its nineteenth edi­tion. First compiled by John Bartlett, a bookseller in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as a commonplace book of only 258 pages, the original 1855 edition mainly featured selections from the Bible, Shakespeare, and the great English poets. Today, Bartlett’s includes more than 20,000 quotes from roughly 4,000 con­tributors. Spanning centuries of thought and culture, it remains the finest and most popular compendium of quotations ever assembled. While continuing to draw on timeless classi­cal references, this edition also incorporates more than 3,000 new quotes from more than 700 new sources, including Alison Bechdel, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Pope Francis, Atul Gawande, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Hilary Mantel, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Claudia Rankine, Fred Rogers, Bernie Sanders, Patti Smith, and Malala Yousafzai. Bartlett’s showcases the thoughts not only of renowned figures from the arts, literature, politics, science, sports, and business, but also of otherwise unknown individuals whose thought-provoking ideas have moved, unsettled, or inspired readers and listeners throughout the ages. Bartlett’s makes searching for the perfect quote easy in three ways: alphabetically by author, chrono­logically by the author’s birth date, or thematically by subject. Whether one is searching for appropriate remarks for a celebration, comforting thoughts for a serious occasion, or simply to answer the question “Who said that?” Bartlett’s offers readers and schol­ars alike a stunning treasury of words that have influ­enced",Reference,2788,N/A,0,en

And Ralph Waldo Emerson found Leaves of Grass 'the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed,' calling it a 'combination of the Bhagavad Gita and the New York Herald.' Published at the author's own expense on July 4, 1855, Leaves of Grass initially consisted of a preface, twelve untitled poems in free verse (including the work later titled 'Song of Myself' which Malcolm Cowley called 'one of the great poems of modern times'), and a now-famous portrait of a devil-may-care Walt Whitman in a workman's shirt. Over the next four decades, Whitman continually expanded and revised the book as he took on the role of a workingman's bard who championed American nationalism, political democracy, contemporary progress, and unashamed sex.

Traveling South,John David Cox,University of Georgia Press,2010-04-15,"Traveling South is the first major study of how narratives of travel through the antebellum South helped construct an American national identity during the years between the Revolutionary War and the Civil War. John Cox makes his case on the basis of a broad range of texts that includes slave narratives, domestic literature, and soldiers’ diaries, as well as more traditional forms of travel writing. In the process he extends the boundaries of travel literature both as a genre and as a subject of academic study. The writers of these intranational accounts struggled with the significance of travel through a region that was both America and “other.” In writings by J. Hector St. John de Crèvecoeur and William Bartram, for example, the narrators create personal identities and express their Americanness through travel that, Cox argues, becomes a defining aspect of the young nation. In the narratives of Frederick Douglass and Solomon Northup, the complex relationship between travel and slavery highlights contemporary debates over the meaning of space and movement. Both Fanny Kemble and Harriet Jacobs explore the intimate linkings of women’s travel and the construction of an ideal domestic space, whereas Frederick Law Olmsted seeks, through his travel writing, to reform the southern economy and expand a New England yeoman ideology throughout the nation. The Civil War diaries of Union soldiers, written during the years that witnessed the largest movement of travelers through the South, echo earlier themes while concluding that the South should not be transformed in order to become sufficiently “American”; rather, it was and should remain a part of the American nation, regardless of perceived differences.",Social Science,266,N/A,0,en

The University Library,John Huston Finley,N/A,1926,"The genesis of the University Library lies in a compilation of ""Little Masterpieces,"" the first of which were published more than twenty-five years ago. The material included in these volumes was selected by able editors and writers whose experience was great and whose taste was excellent. Out of the ""Little Masterpieces"" grew a course in liberal education which was known as the Pocket University, and out of the Pocket University grew, finally, the University Library. The publishers most gratefully acknowledge their debt to the editors who compiled the original volumes: Bliss Perry, Henry van Dyke, Hardin Craig, Thomas L. Masson, Asa Don Dickinson, the late Hamilton W. Mabie, George Iles, the late Dr. Lyman Abbott, and others. Some of the most important material contained in the Pocket University is, of course, included in the University Library but the sequence has been entirely changed and the scope of the work greatly broadened.

The annotations are especially valuable: they show a solid grasp of the author’s life, work, and times, and provide rich and detailed background information about allusions to Chinese and Japanese classics. Along with the high quality of the translations themselves, this thorough commentary makes the book a significant scholarly resource and will help readers appreciate the density and delicacy of Bashō’s writing.

The full ""Unwritten"" routine consists of two different basic effects. Effect 1 - Any Word Drawing A spectator opens the book to any page and chooses a word describing something that she can visualize in her mind. Without asking for the page number or any specifics of the word (such as the length of the word or the letters it contains), the performer correctly draws out the image that the spectator is visualizing. Effect 2 - Imagined Drawing Prediction A spectator opens the book to any page and mentally selects a word from the last line of a chosen paragraph. She makes a simple drawing that represents the word and then uses her imagination to add to the sketch to make it into a larger picture. A sealed envelope that has been in full view from the start of the show is opened to reveal a prediction drawing that correctly matches the spectator's imagined drawing! Note: Instead of a prediction, you can perform the effect as a drawing duplication. Both effects can be performed individually or together to form a complete routine. The routine can be performed in casual settings or close-up, parlour and large-scale stage shows. ""Unwritten"" includes the following features: - Can be Performed Completely Hands Free - The Book Can be Freely Examined During Performance - No Pumping for Page Numbers, Length of Word or Specific Letters - No Peeks - No Switches - No Pre-Show Work - No Sleight of Hand - No Memory Work or Cribs - No Assistants - Large Fonts Make the Text Easy to Read - Can Be Performed Stand-Alone or with Other Book Tests",,264,N/A,0,en

Included in the collection is the novel 'Kangaroo' which, while strictly speaking not a piece of travel writing, nevertheless, gives a vivid account of the persecution which sent the Lawrences on their travels and is a fascinating portrait of Australia between the wars. David Herbert Lawrence was the son of a coal-miner and a mother from a family with middle-class aspirations.

The Business of Common Life,David Kaufmann,N/A,1995,"Deriving his theoretical model from systems theory and the Frankfurt school, David Kaufmann argues that the consolidation of economic theory and the critical acceptance of the novel in late Georgian Britain were central to the cultural work if describing and legitimating the commercial state and the society that sustained it. By juxtaposing political texts (from Hume to Mill), moral philosophy, and classical economic theory (from Smith to Mill), and novels by Radcliffe, Austen, Scott, and Shelley, Kaufmann shows how these different discourses worry and attempt to think through the problems of justice and citizenship that mark liberalism and modernity. ""This is the most consistently interesting and coherently argued treatment of political economy and literature that I've read. It will find an audience among both literary historians and cultural critics. Indeed, I predict that some of Kaufmann's formulations could influence the way this subject is addressed by future scholars. The Business of Common Life is a book that any student of the subject will have to read and consider carefully.""--Mary Poovey, The Johns Hopkins University",History,216,N/A,0,en

Teaching Children Gymnastics,"Peter H. Werner, Lori H. Williams, Tina J. Hall",Human Kinetics,2011-11-02,"This third edition of Teaching Children Gymnastics will help you tailor a gymnastics program to your teaching situation while combining the best facets of developmental skills, health-related fitness, and conceptual learning based on process characteristics of body, space, effort, and relationships. Internationally renowned author and educator Peter Werner and coauthors Lori Williams and Tina Hall guide you through the process of teaching gymnastics skills and then linking those skills into sequences. Having conducted workshops at all levels, the three authors combine decades’ worth of gymnastics knowledge and teaching experience. In this book, they offer updated and new material, including • a chapter on designing gymnastics sequences; • sections on behavior management, inclusion, and advocacy; • information on scope and sequence for grades K to 5; • information based on revised national standards, assessment, and designing of gymnastics sequences; and • additional learning experiences, plus ideas for creating more learning experiences. You will find real-life scenarios that will help you apply the material, and you will learn how to create a positive learning environment for your students. Chapter objectives, summaries, and reflection questions enhance the learning experience. Part I of Teaching Children Gymnastics provides an overview of developmentally appropriate gymnastics, exploring why it should be part of a high-quality elementary physical education program and how the instructional approach used in the book differs from the traditional approach used in physical education. The material in part I will help you plan your program, incorporate it into your curriculum, and assess your students. Part II provides great learning experiences for the skill themes of traveling, statics, and rotation. Each skill theme is broken into categories that help children acquire the skills they need to learn. It’s in this portion that they develop sequences that integrate all the skills they have learned. The authors also supply an appendix with forms and handouts, cutting down your preparation time. Teaching Children Gymnastics is a great tool for novice and experienced teachers alike. More than that, it’s the perfect resource for opening up the fun and exciting world of gymnastics to youngsters who are always looking for an excuse to perform just the types of skills that they will learn—and design sequences for—through this book.",Education,266,N/A,0,en

Aspects of Tourist Behavior,Metin Kozak,Cambridge Scholars Publishing,2013-07-26,"As in other fields of research, the behaviour of consumers has also received a great deal of attention in tourism research over the past few decades due to its growing importance in the efficient marketing and management of tourism operations. The rapid development of IT applications and the equally swift changes of needs and wants have influenced consumers in terms of the behaviour involved in searching for information and in decision-making processes. As such, this book encompasses a collection of chapters addressing various aspects of tourist behaviour, from need-recognition to post-consumption, supported through selected practical examples from a range of countries, such as Portugal, Italy, New Zealand, Jamaica, Taiwan, Malaysia, and South Africa, among others. The book, systematic in structure and thorough in content, is very useful for people who wish to improve and update their current knowledge of tourist behaviour, and also to those carrying out further research on this field.",Business & Economics,217,N/A,0,en

The Sub-committee on Lords' Conduct found that Lord Bhatia's interpretation of ""main residence"" was unreasonable and that he did not act in good faith in designating the Reigate property and in claiming for overnight subsistence and travel. Lord Bhatia appealed to the full Committee against the Sub-committee's findings and recommendations. The Committee upholds the findings of the Sub-committee, and recommends that he makes a personal statement of apology to the House and is then suspended from the House for one year or until she has repaid the sum of £27,446 wrongly claimed, whichever is the later.",Business & Economics,168,N/A,0,en

Inscribed Landscapes,Richard E. Strassberg,Univ of California Press,1994-09-20,"Alongside the scores of travel books about China written by foreign visitors, Chinese travelers' impressions of their own country rarely appear in translation. This anthology is the only comprehensive collection in English of Chinese travel writing from the first century A.D. through the nineteenth. Early examples of the genre describe sites important for their geography, history, and role in cultural mythology, but by the T'ang dynasty in the mid-eighth century certain historiographical and poetic discourses converged to form the ""travel account"" (yu-chi) and later the ""travel diary"" (jih-chi) as vehicles of personal expression and autobiography. These first-person narratives provide rich material for understanding the attitudes of Chinese literati toward place, nature, politics, and the self. The anthology is abundantly illustrated with paintings, portraits, maps, and drawings. Each selection is meticulously translated, carefully annotated, and prefaced by a brief description of the writer's life and work. The entire collection is introduced by an in-depth survey of the rise of Chinese travel writing as a cultural phenomenon. Inscribed Landscapes provides a unique resource for travelers as well as for scholars of Chinese literature, art, and history.",Education,610,N/A,0,en

It examines the potential of the 'open skies' initiative, in the aftermath of the new U.S./EC air transport agreement, to inspire a genuine globalization of the world's air transport industry in such crucial aspects as the following: cabotage; ownership and citizenship requirements; route selection; airline identity; capacity; pricing regimes; competition and public aid; regulatory harmonization; labor laws; provisions for charter and/or cargo transportation; fair operation of and access to computer reservations systems; authorization of code-sharing arrangements; alliances and antitrust immunity; and dispute resolution.",Law,750,N/A,0,en

The Little Book of Managing Uncertainty,Harry Katzan Jr.,iUniverse,2022-08-22,"Advanced technology is the cornerstone of modern society. Some of the reasons for studying the methods and applications of technology are that the subject serves as the basis of our everyday existence. We use technology on a daily basis, yet we know very little about the underlying concepts. We have no introduction to the subject matter, no principles of best behavior, and no theories. It is a time for change and this book fills that need. In this book, we are going to take a look at the evolving technology of uncertainty. Getting a handle on uncertainty permits a practitioner to perform in an excellent manner on tasks from management to applied technology. Modern government, such as the intelligence services, is exceedingly complicated, and uncertainty exists in almost every aspect of their daily lives. Business and finance have similar requirements so that participants can excel in all aspects of the decisions of everyday business life. The ability to deal with uncertainty is based on the methods of combining diverse possibilities into a coherent whole called a frame of discernment. Then, using a methodology known as Dempster-Shafer theory, evidence can be evaluated and a basis for decision making can be discerned. The effective use of Dempster-Shafer theory is conceptualized through computer methodology. Once determined to be unsolvable by experts, the methods contained herein have been solved by the author as a visiting professor in Switzerland. The methods are summarized in a research monograph entitled Managing Uncertainty and simplified in this book, along with an appropriate appendix that introduces the methodology. The book is comprised of introductory material followed by appropriate examples in essays that can be read in any order determined by the reader’s interests. The essays are based on peer reviewed journal articles presented at technical conferences. The various essays can be addressed in any order as they are adjusted to fit the needs of practicing professionals.

The Digital Economy,"Edward J. Malecki, Bruno Moriset",Routledge,2007-12-07,"Information technologies (IT) shape economic space, but we have no clear map of the cyber economy since the ""digital revolution"" began in the early 1970s. The Digital Economy offers an up-to-date, critical synthesis that links the various aspects of the digital or cyber economy from the perspective of real firms. A geographic approach emphasizes how IT has made businesses less dependent on locational constraints, and the tangible effects on places and regions are placed at the core of the analysis. Case studies of companies, including Amazon, Dell, Li & Fung, and Volvo, demonstrate that the geography of digitally-driven production is the outcome of both dispersion and agglomeration dynamics. Global corporations are shown to have footprints that ignore – to some degree – distance and time, yet creative and coordinating activities remain anchored in urban innovative ecosystems such as Silicon Valley and Bangalore. These trends have been made possible by the development of a worldwide and integrated telecommunications network, whose unequal presence dictates the capabilities of places and communities to be connected to the global economy. However, the threat of the digital divide must not be overstated. In cities, rural areas, and emerging countries, local development is wrapped up in human capital, rather than technology. This engaging and accessible text describes and explains the patterns and dynamics of today’s digital economic space. The effects on places and regions and the people in them are at the core of the authors’ analysis, illustrated by many real examples. This book will be useful to anyone studying business and management, geography and information and communication studies.",Business & Economics,390,N/A,0,en
Tourism and Regional Development,Maria Giaoutzi,Routledge,2017-05-15,"Tourist visits used to be a less common activity in the past. However, more people than ever now make leisure trips, making this an era of mass tourism. This drastic change in spatial behaviour is not only caused by economic prosperity, but the scale of this phenomenon means that it is able to generate economic growth, making tourism a key factor in regional development policy. One of the main challenges of current regional policy is to market the attractiveness of an area, thereby increasing tourist visits and subsequent revenue. In particular, regions are attempting this through the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), which offer information on interesting places, and efficient methods for organizing and booking trips. This book examines the interconnections between tourism, ICT and regional development. Bringing together a range of European case studies illustrating various ICT and policy innovations, it not only critiques current activity by regions in terms of tourism development, but also considers how this sector is likely to continue to grow.",Political Science,448,N/A,0,en

Critical Infrastructure Protection in Homeland Security,Ted G. Lewis,John Wiley & Sons,2019-11-25,"Covers critical infrastructure protection, providing a rigorous treatment of risk, resilience, complex adaptive systems, and sector dependence Wide in scope, this classroom-tested book is the only one to emphasize a scientific approach to protecting the key infrastructures components of a nation. It analyzes the complex network of entities that make up a nation's infrastructure, and identifies vulnerabilities and risks in various sectors by combining network science, complexity theory, risk analysis, and modeling and simulation. This approach reduces the complex problem of protecting water supplies, energy pipelines, telecommunication stations, power grid, and Internet and Web networks to a much simpler problem of protecting a few critical nodes. The new third edition of Critical Infrastructure Protection in Homeland Security: Defending a Networked Nation incorporates a broader selection of ideas and sectors than the previous book. Divided into three sections, the first part looks at the historical origins of homeland security and critical infrastructure, and emphasizes current policy. The second examines theory and foundations, highlighting risk and resilience in the context of complexity theory, network science, and the prevailing theories of catastrophe. The last part covers the individual sectors, including communications, internet, cyber threats, information technology, social networks, SCADA, water and water treatment, energy, and more. Covers theories of catastrophes, details of how sectors work, and how to deal with the problem of critical infrastructure protection’s enormity and complexity Places great emphasis on computer security and whole-community response Includes PowerPoint slides for use by lecturers, as well as an instructor's guide with answers to exercises Offers five robust appendices that augment the non-mathematical chapters with more rigorous explanations and mathematics Critical Infrastructure Protection in Homeland Security, Third Edition is an important book for upper-division undergraduates and first-year graduate students in political science, history, public administration, and computer technology. It will also be of great interest to professional security experts and policymakers.",Political Science,468,N/A,0,en

Each entry in the volume is around 1,000 words, the style more essayistic than encyclopaedic, with contributors reflecting on their chosen keyword from a variety of disciplinary perspectives. The emphasis on travelogues and other cultural representations of mobility drawn from a range of national and linguistic traditions ensures that the volume has a comparative dimension; the aim is to give an overview of each term in its historical and theoretical complexity, providing readers with a clear sense of how the selected words are essential to a critical understanding of travel writing.

Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design IV,"Weiming Shen, Jianming Yong, Yun Yang, Jean-Paul A. Barthès, Junzhou Luo",Springer,2008-12-18,"Design of complex artifacts and systems requires the cooperation of multidisciplinary design teams using multiple sophisticated commercial and non-commercial engine- ing tools such as CAD tools, modeling, simulation and optimization software, en- neering databases, and knowledge-based systems. Individuals or individual groups of multidisciplinary design teams usually work in parallel and independently with various engineering tools, which are located on different sites, often for quite a long period of time. At any moment, individual members may be working on different versions of a design or viewing the design from various perspectives, at different levels of details. In order to meet these requirements, it is necessary to have efficient comput- supported collaborative design systems. These systems should not only automate in- vidual tasks, in the manner of traditional computer-aided engineering tools, but also enable individual members to share information, collaborate, and coordinate their activities within the context of a design project. Based on close international collaboration between the University of Technology of Compiègne in France and the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Ac- emy of Sciences in the early 1990s, a series of international workshops on CSCW in Design started in 1996. In order to facilitate the organization of these workshops, an International Working Group on CSCW in Design (CSCWD) was established and an International Steering Committee was formed in 1998. The series was converted to int- national conferences in 2000 building on the success of the four previous workshops.",Computers,688,N/A,0,en

Offering a wide-ranging approach to travel literature's significance in Victorian life, this book features analysis of physical and verbal violence in major exploration narratives as well as lesser-known volumes and newspaper accounts of expeditions. It also presents new perspectives on Olive Schreiner and Joseph Conrad by linking violence in their fictional travelogues with the rhetoric of humanitarian trusteeship.",Fiction,229,N/A,0,en

"Sustainable Transport, Mobility Management and Travel Plans",Marcus Enoch,Routledge,2016-04-01,"Charting the development of the travel plan as a concept, this book draws on a range of research-based contributions to determine the state-of-the-art and to explore a series of future scenarios in this area for practitioners and policy makers. Site-based mobility management or 'travel plans' address the transport problem by engaging with those organisations such as employers that are directly responsible for generating the demand for travel, and hence have the potential to have a major impact on transport policy. To do this effectively however, travel plans need to be reoriented to be made more relevant to the needs of these organisations, whilst the policy framework in which they operate needs modifying to better support their diffusion and enhance their effectiveness. Marcus Enoch breaks down the travel plan concept into four axes related to its development (namely segment, scale, structure and support), and investigates the following questions: - What makes them special? - Why are they introduced? - What do they look like in terms of their design and the measures they use? - How common are they and in what sectors and location types? - How effective are they? - What barriers do they face and how might these be overcome?",Business & Economics,269,N/A,0,en

Kindred,Octavia E. Butler,Beacon Press,2004-02-01,"From the New York Times bestselling author of Parable of the Sower and MacArthur “Genius” Grant, Nebula, and Hugo award winner The visionary time-travel classic whose Black female hero is pulled through time to face the horrors of American slavery and explores the impacts of racism, sexism, and white supremacy then and now. “I lost an arm on my last trip home. My left arm.” Dana’s torment begins when she suddenly vanishes on her 26th birthday from California, 1976, and is dragged through time to antebellum Maryland to rescue a boy named Rufus, heir to a slaveowner’s plantation. She soon realizes the purpose of her summons to the past: protect Rufus to ensure his assault of her Black ancestor so that she may one day be born. As she endures the traumas of slavery and the soul-crushing normalization of savagery, Dana fights to keep her autonomy and return to the present. Blazing the trail for neo-slavery narratives like Colson Whitehead’s The Underground Railroad and Ta-Nehisi Coates’s The Water Dancer, Butler takes one of speculative fiction’s oldest tropes and infuses it with lasting depth and power. Dana not only experiences the cruelties of slavery on her skin but also grimly learns to accept it as a condition of her own existence in the present. “Where stories about American slavery are often gratuitous, reducing its horror to explicit violence and brutality, Kindred is controlled and precise” (New York Times). “Reading Octavia Butler taught me to dream big, and I think it’s absolutely necessary that everybody have that freedom and that willingness to dream.” —N. K. Jemisin Developed for television by writer/executive producer Branden Jacobs-Jenkins (Watchmen), executive producers also include Joe Weisberg and Joel Fields (The Americans, The Patient), and Darren Aronofsky (The Whale). Janicza Bravo (Zola) is director and an executive producer of the pilot. Kindred stars Mallori Johnson, Micah Stock, Ryan Kwanten, and Gayle Rankin.",Fiction,292,2.5,2,en

Chopper Heroes,William Peterson,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2018-04-09,"Chopper Heroes Have Guns Will Travel will introduce many of the survivors of the nasty war in Vietnam. The true, interesting, gut-wrenching and often thrilling stories you are about to read are from men whom I am honored to know. Many of the words written here are theirs from interviews I have done. As a storyteller, I have tried to recapture the events as they happened forty-five plus years ago. The narrative and scenes created here are mostly true, and the dialogue is written for all audiences from teenagers to adults, men and women alike. I am proud to have been a helicopter crew chief/door gunner with C/227th Assault Helicopter Batallion,1st Air Cav. Our unit supported many of these men in every way; inserting them into the fiery, bloody hell of battle and supplying them with ammo, food, water, and mail, often under intense enemy fire. When they were ready to move on to a different LZ, our aircraft picked them up and re-inserted them into yet another nightmarish battle. When they were sick or wounded, we flew them to the closest field hospital. When they were silently lying in the jungle, having breathed their last, they were solemnly picked up and carefully loaded on our choppers. We reverently evacuated them to an area where they could be cared for, prior to their final flight back to their loved ones. I have the utmost respect for the guys we called ""grunts."" Though our military technology didn't always work, the helicopter was a very useful tool for putting our troops right where they needed to be - deep within the enemy's lair. More importantly, the choppers saved innumerable lives that in other wars would have been snuffed out. I am grateful to have been a part of the First Team in Viet Nam. In my personal stories that you will read, I have used actual names whenever possible. In other cases, names have been changed in honor of the families. It is my most sincere hope that these accounts will be read by many who have lost loved ones in this most unpopular war. Many soldiers involved in Viet Nam, the Gulf War, Iraq, Afghanistan, and others have declined to tell their own stories to those they love back home, as they actually happened. The feelings that war veterans have, run very deep and are often very traumatic. Many don't want to relive those horrendous nightmares. Severe cases of PTSD, guilt, or not wanting families to know what they went through are prevalent and very real. In many cases, their stories are relived here as they actually happened. Here, you may finally read about what your son, grandson, husband, father, or friend endured. Though honorable and often heroic, you can be sure the memories are horrible, and something they will never forget. Throughout these stories, you will see the word ""grunts."" It seems that all wars have their own nomenclature. In Viet Nam, a grunt fought the toughest part of the war, in my mind. I pray that knowing what your loved ones went through may bring healing to many of you. May God bless you and your family.",,148,N/A,0,en

A Time Travel Dialogue,John W. Carroll,Open Book Publishers,2014-08-01,"Is time travel just a confusing plot device deployed by science fiction authors and Hollywood filmmakers to amaze and amuse? Or might empirical data prompt a scientific hypothesis of time travel? Structured on a fascinating dialogue involving a distinguished physicist, Dr. Rufus, a physics graduate student and a computer scientist this book probes an experimentally supported hypothesis of backwards time travel – and in so doing addresses key metaphysical issues, such as causation, identity over time and free will. The setting is the Jefferson National Laboratory during a period of five days in 2010. Dr. Rufus’s experimental search for the psi-lepton and the resulting intractable data spurs the discussion on time travel. She and her two colleagues are pushed by their observations to address the grandfather paradox and other puzzles about backwards causation, with attention also given to causal loops, multi-dimensional time, and the prospect that only the present exists. Sensible solutions to the main puzzles emerge, ultimately advancing the case for time travel really being possible. A Time Travel Dialogue addresses the possibility of time travel, approaching familiar paradoxes in a rigorous, engaging, and fun manner. It follows in the long philosophical tradition of using dialogue to present philosophical ideas and arguments, but is ground breaking in its use of the dialogue format to introduce readers to the metaphysics of time travel, and is also distinctive in its use of lab results to drive philosophical analysis. The discussion of data that might decide whether time is one-dimensional (one timeline) or multi-dimensional (branching time) is especially novel.",Science,98,N/A,0,en

Nathan Wexler is a brilliant physicist who thinks he's found a way to send matter a split second back into the past. But before he can even confirm his findings, he and his wife-to-be, Jenna Morrison, find themselves in a battle for their very lives. Because while time travel to an instant earlier seems useless, Jenna comes to learn that no capability in history has ever been more profound or far-reaching. Now, as Jenna fights to defeat the powerful forces arrayed against her, nothing less than the fate of humanity hangs in the balance. . . SPLIT SECOND is a roller coaster ride of a thriller, one that will have readers pondering the nature of time, and of reality, long after they've read the last page.""Richards is a tremendous new talent"" (Stephen Coonts) who can ""keep you turning the pages all night long"" (Douglas Preston)",Physicists,0,3,2,en
"Mobilities, Tourism and Travel Behavior",Leszek Butowski,BoD – Books on Demand,2018-01-17,"The notion of ""mobilities,"" when looked at from a practical point of view, turns out to cover different kinds of human activity. It is not surprising, then, that when approached from an academic perspective, it reveals enormous potential for interdisciplinary research, which has proven extremely attractive to many scholars from different continents, disciplines, and schools of academic inquiry. The scholars in this volume focus on the specific aspects of mobilities, namely, tourism and travel behavior, but approach them from a plethora of positions. Such a myriad of perspectives is bound to be challenging in methodological terms, but it seems there is a growing agreement as to the worthiness of this interdisciplinary research. By means of combining various approaches, researchers obtain access to a fascinating and increasingly ubiquitous phenomenon of contemporary human mobility.",Business & Economics,252,N/A,0,en

The Semantics of Dynamic Space in French,"Michel Aurnague, Dejan Stosic",John Benjamins Publishing Company,2019-07-29,"Research on the semantics of spatial markers in French is known mainly through Vandeloise’s (1986, 1991) work on static prepositions. However, interest in the expression of space in French goes back to the mid-1970s and focused first on verbs denoting changes in space, whose syntactic properties were related to specific semantic distinctions, such as the opposition between “movement” and “displacement”. This volume provides an overview of recent studies on the semantics of dynamic space in French and addresses important questions about motion expression, among which “goal bias” and asymmetry of motion, the status of locative PPs, the expression of manner, fictive or non-actual motion. Descriptive, experimental and formal or computational analyses are presented, providing complementary perspectives on the main issue. The volume is intended for researchers and advanced students wishing to learn about both spatial semantics in French and recent debates on the representation of motion events in language and cognition.",Language Arts & Disciplines,408,N/A,0,en

The last of these, designated on 1 January 2010, has been Lady Uddin's family home since 1993. The Sub-committee on Lords' Conduct found that Lady Uddin's interpretation of ""main residence"" was unreasonable. The designation of the Frinton and Maidstone properties was a deliberate misrepresentation of her position and the travel claims were made with the intention of substantiating her designation of her main residences. In total, the Sub-committee calculated that she wrongly claimed £125,349.10 over the period in question. Lady Uddin appealed to the full Committee against the Sub-committee's findings and recommendations. The Committee upholds the finding on the sum wrongly claimed, and recommends that she makes a personal statement of apology to the House and is then suspended from the House for three years or until she has repaid the sum wrongly claimed, whichever is the later.",Business & Economics,276,N/A,0,en

Terrorism,Ben Saul,Bloomsbury Publishing,2012-02-07,"International anti-terrorism measures existed long before 11 September 2001 but have increased markedly since. A myriad of norms in different branches of law are now deployed to confront transnational and domestic terrorism. There is also a proliferating body of 'soft law' addressing terrorism, stemming from United Nations organs, specialised international bodies and regional organisations. It is timely to draw together these diverse legal developments over time into a single reference work. Bringing the original documents together provides for ease of reference and enables scholars, practitioners and students to more easily compare and contrast various sources. The book's coverage is comprehensive (thematically, organisationally, geographically and temporally) and open to a balance of sources (hard and soft), but is judicious in its selection and prioritisation of the most significant and representative documents - in a field where there are many repetitive or insubstantial documents. Importantly, the book looks beyond the traditional trans-Atlantic bias towards European, British and American sources in this area to include materials from Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East. Taken as a whole, the book aids in evidencing the emerging field of international anti-terrorism law.",Law,1649,N/A,0,en

These vehicles have unique development requirements due to their high loads, huge dimensions, and specific operating conditions. Hauling efficiencies can be improved by increasing vehicle load capacity; however capacities are influenced by legislation, road limits, and design. Designing HDWVs differs from other multi-purpose all-wheel-drive vehicles. The chassis must be custom-designed to suit the customer’s particular purpose. The number of axles is another variable, as well as which ones are driving and which are driven. Tires are also customizable. Translated by SAE from Russian, this book narrates the history of HDWVs and presents the theory and calculations required to design them. It summarizes results of the authors’ academic research and experience and presents innovative technical solutions used for electric and hydrostatic transmissions, steering systems, and active safety of these vehicles. The book consists of three parts. Part one covers HDWV design history and general design methods, including basic vehicle design, and evaluating HDWV use conditions. Part one also covers general operation requirements and consumer needs, and a brief analysis of structural components of existing HDWVs and prototypes. Part two outlines information needs for designing HDWVs. Part three reviews basic theory and calculation of innovative technical solutions, as well as special requirements for component parts. This comprehensive title provides the following information about HDWVs: • History of design and manufacture. • Manufacturers’ summary design data. • Background data on sample vehicles. • Component calculation examples. • Overview of motion theory, which is useful in design and placement of bulky cargo.",Technology & Engineering,579,N/A,0,en

Fast And Furious: A Comprehensive Collection Of U.S. Government Documents To 2017,,Jeffrey Frank Jones,2018-12-11,"Over 26,000 total pages .... Background: The Fast and Furious operation was responsible for allowing approximately 2,000 firearms to illegally flow into the hands of criminals, including Mexican drug cartel associates. On December 14, 2010, Customs and Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry, a United States Marine, was killed while on patrol just miles from the Mexican border. The firearms found at the scene were semi-automatic rifles that were allowed to walk as part of Operation Fast and Furious. Congressional Republicans have investigated Fast and Furious since January 2011. Over the course of the investigation, the Justice Department has provided false information, stonewalled document requests, produced scores of blacked-out pages and duplicate documents, and refused to comply with two congressional subpoenas. In August 2012, the U.S. House of Representatives Office of General Counsel filed suit against the Justice Department. On January 19, 2016, United States District Judge Amy Berman Jackson issued her opinion and ordered DOJ release documents previously withheld under the President’s executive privilege claim. On April 8, 2016, DOJ complied with the Judge’s order, delivering more than 20,500 pages of documents to the Committee. CONTENTS: Statement of Michael E.

"Transitivity, Valency, and Voice",Denis Creissels,Oxford University Press,2024-10-29,"This book sets up a consistent theoretical and terminological framework for the study of the phenomena that are commonly subsumed under the terms transitivity, valency, and voice. These three concepts are at the heart of the most basic aspects of clausal structure in any language; however, there is considerable cross-linguistic variation in the constraints on how verbs combine with noun phrases that refer to participants in the event that they denote or to the circumstances of the event. In this book, Denis Creissels explores and accounts for the extent of this cross-linguistic variation, capturing its regularities and examining the historical phenomena that have resulted in the emergence of constructions and markers. The novel framework developed in the book allows similar phenomena to be identified across typologically diverse languages, and facilitates systematic comparison of the manifestations of these phenomena in the grammars of individual languages.",Language Arts & Disciplines,849,N/A,0,en

Sharing Economy and the Impact of Collaborative Consumption,"de Luna, Iviane Ramos, Fitó-Bertran, Àngels, Lladós-Masllorens, Josep, Liébana-Cabanillas, Francisco",IGI Global,2019-09-20,"The introduction of new technology and technological services worldwide has ushered in a new wave of peer-to-peer and access-driven companies that are disrupting the most established business categories. The emergence of these new business models has upset the flow in contemporary society and transformed people's behavior towards sharing-based economies. Companies and entrepreneurs can see this significant change in people’s behavior as both an opportunity and a threat. Sharing Economy and the Impact of Collaborative Consumption provides emerging research on the impact that the sharing services are having on society as well as the importance of the sharing economy development in the coming years, dealing with relevant issues such as regulations, the technological aspects involved in these platforms, the impact in the tourism sector, and consumer behavior in relation to these services. Multidisciplinary in nature, this publication establishes links between economics, finance, marketing, consumer behavior, and IT, and covers topics that include e-commerce, consumer behavior, and peer economy. It is ideally designed for researchers, students, business professionals, and entrepreneurs seeking current research on the impact that this industry has on various economic, marketing, and societal aspects of different countries.",Business & Economics,342,N/A,0,en

International Developments Towards Improved Car-sharing Services,Bodo Schwieger,Writersworld Limited,2004,"The main topic of this book is the introduction of a new mobility service: One-Way and Open-End car-sharing. Dr. Bodo Schwieger describes a process starting from the anticipation and measurement of customer's needs to the introduction of innovative services. The described field test is second to none, as it offers gasoline vehicles in a One-Way rental scheme within an urban environment: 25 Smart vehicles were based at 8 stations and available to 4,000 car-sharing customers. This service is being analyzed for efficiency and customer reactions. In a second step, other car-sharing companies in Hamburg (Germany), Seattle (Washington), Kyoto and Tokyo (Japan) are analyzed for their approaches to improving their services. combines technological competence, marketing know-how and customer analysis. Car-sharing has recently become a highly relevant topic with the fast expansion of the American providers and the market entry of Deutsche Bahn AG and Shell AG in Germany. The method respects the large amount of interdependence with other services and also the multiplicity of different customer groups.

Some of the women were eccentric, many were very adventurous, some were in search of a different world... British women make up the largest portion of the book's focus--these particular adventurers being backed in many cases by family money, scientific inquiry, and the ready availability of the British seafaring tradition. Entries include the woman's family background, her educational history, and a summary of her world travels, with in many cases evocative extracts from their writings (many are literary gems).",Social Science,225,N/A,0,en

Three Seventeenth-Century Plays on Women and Performance,"Hero Chalmers, Julie Sanders, Sophie Tomlinson",Manchester University Press,2006-09-19,"This is a ground-breaking edition of three seventeenth-century plays that all engage in diverse and exciting ways with questions of gender and performance. The collection, edited by three pioneering scholars of elite female culture and early modern drama, makes the texts of three much-discussed plays - John Fletcher's The Wild-Goose Chase, James Shirley's The Bird in a Cage and Margaret Cavendish's The Convent of Pleasure - available together in a full scholarly edition for the first time.The Wild Goose Chase (1621) and The Bird in a Cage (1633) were both performed in the commercial London theatres in the Jacobean and Caroline periods respectively. The Convent of Pleasure (1668) is a so-called 'closet' drama, designed primarily for reading but drawing on a tradition of aristocratic theatricals. In a wide-ranging co-authored introduction to the volume, the editors explore the concerns of these playtexts in relation to contemporary debates surrounding popular festivity and anti-theatricalism, as well as the agency of elite female culture in the Stuart period and the emergence of the professional female actor in the Restoration.The volume will be an invaluable teaching and research tool for students and scholars of early modern drama, women's writing and performance studies more generally, as well as providing a rich sourcebook for the reader interested in seventeenth-century theatrical culture.",Drama,354,N/A,0,en

Columbia Crew Survival Investigation Report,United States. National Aeronautics and Space Administration,N/A,2008,"""NASA commissioned the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) to conduct a thorough review of both the technical and the organizational causes of the loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia and her crew on February 1, 2003. The accident investigation that followed determined that a large piece of insulating foam from Columbia's external tank (ET) had come off during ascent and struck the leading edge of the left wing, causing critical damage. The damage was undetected during the mission. The CAIB’s findings and recommendations were published in 2003 and are available on the web at http://caib.nasa.gov/. NASA responded to the CAIB findings and recommendations with the Space Shuttle Return to Flight Implementation Plan.1 Significant enhancements were made to NASA's organizational structure, technical rigor, and understanding of the flight environment. The ET was redesigned to reduce foam shedding and eliminate critical debris. In 2005, NASA succeeded in returning the space shuttle to flight. In 2010, the space shuttle will complete its mission of assembling the International Space Station and will be retired to make way for the next generation of human space flight vehicles: the Constellation Program. The Space Shuttle Program recognized the importance of capturing the lessons learned from the loss of Columbia and her crew to benefit future human exploration, particularly future vehicle design. The program commissioned the Spacecraft Crew Survival Integrated Investigation Team (SCSIIT). The SCSIIT was asked to perform a comprehensive analysis of the accident, focusing on factors and events affecting crew survival, and to develop recommendations for improving crew survival for all future human space flight vehicles. To do this, the SCSIIT investigated all elements of crew survival, including the design features, equipment, training, and procedures intended to protect the crew. This report documents the SCSIIT findings, conclusions, and recommendations.""--PDF Executive summary.",Government publications,396,N/A,0,en

The Hacker Crackdown,Bruce Sterling,Open Road Media,2020-08-11,"The bestselling cyberpunk author “has produced by far the most stylish report from the computer outlaw culture since Steven Levy’s Hackers” (Publishers Weekly). Bruce Sterling delves into the world of high-tech crime and punishment in one of the first books to explore the cyberspace breaches that threaten national security. From the crash of AT&T’s long-distance switching system to corporate cyberattacks, he investigates government and law enforcement efforts to break the back of America’s electronic underground in the 1990s. In this modern classic, “Sterling makes the hackers—who live in the ether between terminals under noms de net such as VaxCat—as vivid as Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday. His book goes a long way towards explaining the emerging digital world and its ethos” (Publishers Weekly). This edition features a new preface by the author that analyzes the sobering increase in computer crime over the twenty-five years since The Hacker Crackdown was first published. “Offbeat and brilliant.” —Booklist “Thoroughly researched, this account of the government’s crackdown on the nebulous but growing computer-underground provides a thoughtful report on the laws and rights being defined on the virtual frontier of cyberspace. . . . An enjoyable, informative, and (as the first mainstream treatment of the subject) potentially important book . . . Sterling is a fine and knowledgeable guide to this strange new world.” —Kirkus Reviews “A well-balanced look at this new group of civil libertarians. Written with humor and intelligence, this book is highly recommended.” —Library Journal",Computers,220,5,2,en

Discrete Choice Analysis with R,"Antonio Páez, Geneviève Boisjoly",Springer Nature,2023-01-25,"This book is designed as a gentle introduction to the fascinating field of choice modeling and its practical implementation using the R language. Discrete choice analysis is a family of methods useful to study individual decision-making. With strong theoretical foundations in consumer behavior, discrete choice models are used in the analysis of health policy, transportation systems, marketing, economics, public policy, political science, urban planning, and criminology, to mention just a few fields of application. The book does not assume prior knowledge of discrete choice analysis or R, but instead strives to introduce both in an intuitive way, starting from simple concepts and progressing to more sophisticated ideas. Loaded with a wealth of examples and code, the book covers the fundamentals of data and analysis in a progressive way. Readers begin with simple data operations and the underlying theory of choice analysis and conclude by working with sophisticated models including latent class logit models, mixed logit models, and ordinal logit models with taste heterogeneity. Data visualization is emphasized to explore both the input data as well as the results of models. This book should be of interest to graduate students, faculty, and researchers conducting empirical work using individual level choice data who are approaching the field of discrete choice analysis for the first time. In addition, it should interest more advanced modelers wishing to learn about the potential of R for discrete choice analysis. By embedding the treatment of choice modeling within the R ecosystem, readers benefit from learning about the larger R family of packages for data exploration, analysis, and visualization.",Mathematics,349,N/A,0,en

Travel and Conflict in the Early Modern World,"Gábor Gelléri, Rachel Willie",Routledge,2020-11-30,"This edited collection examines the meeting points between travel, mobility, and conflict to uncover the experience of travel - whether real or imagined - in the early modern world. Until relatively recently, both domestic travel and voyages to the wider world remained dangerous undertakings. Physical travel, whether initiated by religious conversion and pilgrimage, diplomacy, trade, war, or the desire to encounter other cultures, inevitably heralded disruption: contact zones witnessed cultural encounters that were not always cordial, despite the knowledge acquisition and financial gain that could be reaped from travel. Vast compendia of travel such as Hakluyt's Principla Navigations, Voyages and Discoveries, printed from the late sixteenth century, and Prévost's Histoire Générale des Voyages (1746-1759) underscored European exploration as a marker of European progress, and in so doing showed the tensions that can arise as a consequence of interaction with other cultures. In focusing upon language acquisition and translation, travel and religion, travel and politics, and imaginary travel, the essays in this collection tease out the ways in which travel was both obstructed and enriched by conflict.",Cultural relations,276,N/A,0,en

"Travel Culture, Travel Writing and Bengali Women, 1870–1940",Jayati Gupta,Taylor & Francis,2020-07-23,"This book chronicles travel writings of Bengali women in colonial India and explores the intersections of power, indigeneity, and the representations of the ‘self’ and the ‘other’ in these writings. It documents the transgressive histories of these women who stepped out to create emancipatory identities for themselves. The book brings together a selection of travelogues from various Bengali women and their journeys to the West, the Aryavarta, and Japan. These writings challenge stereotypes of the 'circumscribed native woman’ and explore the complex personal and socio-political histories of women in colonial India. Reading these from a feminist, postcolonial perspective, the volume highlights how these women from different castes, class and ages confront the changing realities of their lives in colonial India in the backdrop of the independence movement and the second world war. The author draws attention to the personal histories of these women, which informed their views on education, womanhood, marriage, female autonomy, family, and politics in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Engaging and insightful, this volume will be of interest to students and researchers of literature and history, gender and culture studies, and for general readers interested in women and travel writing.",History,347,N/A,0,en

Islam and Travel in the Middle Ages,Houari Touati,University of Chicago Press,2010-08,"In the Middle Ages, Muslim travelers embarked on a rihla, or world tour, as surveyors, emissaries, and educators. On these journeys, voyagers not only interacted with foreign cultures—touring Greek civilization, exploring the Middle East and North Africa, and seeing parts of Europe—they also established both philosophical and geographic boundaries between the faithful and the heathen. These voyages thus gave the Islamic world, which at the time extended from the Maghreb to the Indus Valley, a coherent identity. Islam and Travel in the Middle Ages assesses both the religious and philosophical aspects of travel, as well as the economic and cultural conditions that made the rihla possible. Houari Touati tracks the compilers of the hadith who culled oral traditions linked to the prophet, the linguists and lexicologists who journeyed to the desert to learn Bedouin Arabic, the geographers who mapped the Muslim world, and the students who ventured to study with holy men and scholars. Travel, with its costs, discomforts, and dangers, emerges in this study as both a means of spiritual growth and a metaphor for progress. Touati’s book will interest a broad range of scholars in history, literature, and anthropology.",History,321,5,1,en

Schedule-Based Dynamic Transit Modeling,"Nigel H. M. Wilson, Agostino Nuzzolo",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-03-09,"Schedule-Based Dynamic Transit Modeling: Theory and Applications outlines the new schedule-based dynamic approach to mass transit modeling. In the last ten years the schedule-based dynamic approach has been developed and applied especially for operational planning. It allows time evolution of on-board loads and travel times for each run of each line to be obtained, and uses behavioral hypotheses strictly related to transit systems and user characteristics. It allows us to open new frontiers in transit modelling to support network design, timetable setting, investigation of congestion effects, as well as the assessment of new technologies introduction, such as information to users (ITS technologies). The contributors and editors of the book are leading researchers in the field of transportation, and in this volume they build a solid foundation for developing still more sophisticated models. These future models of mass transit systems will continue to add higher levels of accuracy and sensitivity desired in forecasting the performance of public transport systems.",Business & Economics,288,N/A,0,en

Mobility as a Service and Greener Transportation Systems in a Nordic context,"Anna Laine, Tommi Lampikoski, Tuukka Rautiainen, Marika Bröckl, Christian Bang, Nina Stokkendal Poulsen, Anders Kofoed-Wiuff",Nordic Council of Ministers,2018-12-04,"The transport sector is a major source of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. This study estimates the potential of digitalized mobility solutions, such as Mobility as a Service (MaaS), to reduce emissions and vehicle kilometers travelled in the Nordic countries. Also, to assess the potential future impact of MaaS, modelling is done to project road transport’s energy consumption, CO2 emissions and total costs in the Nordic countries up to 2050. There are still several barriers to the wider adoption of shared mobility services. We present ways to overcome these barriers with incentives and policy instruments to substitute car ownership, and specify what different actors can do to accelerate this change. Finally we present policy recommendations on how to reduce the dependence on car ownership, reduce the vehicle kilometers driven, and stimulate the demand for greener mobility services.",Science,94,N/A,0,en

Mark Twain's Travel Literature,Harold H. Hellwig,McFarland,2008-03-19,"This critical study analyzes major concepts in the travel literature of Mark Twain and notes how his oeuvre (including his classic works of fiction) revolves around travel as a central issue. The book focuses especially on his representations of time, place, and identity in the travel works Roughing It, A Tramp Abroad, The Innocents Abroad, Life on The Mississippi, and Following the Equator. All receive an in-depth analysis, noting Twain's strong sense of nostalgia for the disappearing American frontier, his growing concern over the assimilation of Native American cultures, and his continual search for a sense of personal and national identity. One appendix provides a complete list of the travel literature contained in Twain's personal library.",History,228,N/A,0,en

Crying in H Mart,Michelle Zauner,Vintage,2021-04-20,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • From the indie rock sensation known as Japanese Breakfast, an unforgettable memoir about family, food, grief, love, and growing up Korean American—“in losing her mother and cooking to bring her back to life, Zauner became herself” (NPR). • CELEBRATING OVER ONE YEAR ON THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER LIST In this exquisite story of family, food, grief, and endurance, Michelle Zauner proves herself far more than a dazzling singer, songwriter, and guitarist. With humor and heart, she tells of growing up one of the few Asian American kids at her school in Eugene, Oregon; of struggling with her mother's particular, high expectations of her; of a painful adolescence; of treasured months spent in her grandmother's tiny apartment in Seoul, where she and her mother would bond, late at night, over heaping plates of food. As she grew up, moving to the East Coast for college, finding work in the restaurant industry, and performing gigs with her fledgling band--and meeting the man who would become her husband--her Koreanness began to feel ever more distant, even as she found the life she wanted to live. It was her mother's diagnosis of terminal cancer, when Michelle was twenty-five, that forced a reckoning with her identity and brought her to reclaim the gifts of taste, language, and history her mother had given her. Vivacious and plainspoken, lyrical and honest, Zauner's voice is as radiantly alive on the page as it is onstage. Rich with intimate anecdotes that will resonate widely, and complete with family photos, Crying in H Mart is a book to cherish, share, and reread.",Biography & Autobiography,257,4,1,en

Travels into Print,"Innes M. Keighren, Charles W. J. Withers, Bill Bell",University of Chicago Press,2015-05-11,"In eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Britain, books of travel and exploration were much more than simply the printed experiences of intrepid authors. They were works of both artistry and industry—products of the complex, and often contested, relationships between authors and editors, publishers and printers. These books captivated the reading public and played a vital role in creating new geographical truths. In an age of global wonder and of expanding empires, there was no publisher more renowned for its travel books than the House of John Murray. Drawing on detailed examination of the John Murray Archive of manuscripts, images, and the firm’s correspondence with its many authors—a list that included such illustrious explorers and scientists as Charles Darwin and Charles Lyell, and literary giants like Jane Austen, Lord Byron, and Sir Walter Scott—Travels into Print considers how journeys of exploration became published accounts and how travelers sought to demonstrate the faithfulness of their written testimony and to secure their personal credibility. This fascinating study in historical geography and book history takes modern readers on a journey into the nature of exploration, the production of authority in published travel narratives, and the creation of geographical authorship—a journey bound together by the unifying force of a world-leading publisher.",History,395,N/A,0,en

When Experiments Travel,Adriana Petryna,Princeton University Press,2009-04-27,"The phenomenal growth of global pharmaceutical sales and the quest for innovation are driving an unprecedented search for human test subjects, particularly in middle- and low-income countries. Our hope for medical progress increasingly depends on the willingness of the world's poor to participate in clinical drug trials. While these experiments often provide those in need with vital and previously unattainable medical resources, the outsourcing and offshoring of trials also create new problems. In this groundbreaking book, anthropologist Adriana Petryna takes us deep into the clinical trials industry as it brings together players separated by vast economic and cultural differences. Moving between corporate and scientific offices in the United States and research and public health sites in Poland and Brazil, When Experiments Travel documents the complex ways that commercial medical science, with all its benefits and risks, is being integrated into local health systems and emerging drug markets. Providing a unique perspective on globalized clinical trials, When Experiments Travel raises central questions: Are such trials exploitative or are they social goods? How are experiments controlled and how is drug safety ensured? And do these experiments help or harm public health in the countries where they are conducted? Empirically rich and theoretically innovative, the book shows that neither the language of coercion nor that of rational choice fully captures the range of situations and value systems at work in medical experiments today. When Experiments Travel challenges conventional understandings of the ethics and politics of transnational science and changes the way we think about global medicine and the new infrastructures of our lives.",Social Science,271,N/A,0,en

Awareness of the Heart,Dennis Maglinte,Dennis T. Maglinte,2011-05-24,"So often in many people's lives, there is an awakening. For some it comes out of nowhere, and for others it seems as though it has always been. Seemingly from darkness, a light turns on, and all that was once confusing becomes clear, and all that was once hidden is revealed. Some call this enlightenment. Some call this a revelation. Some call this peace. I call it an awareness of the heart. The following passages were written between late 2002 until 2010. Inspired by those around me, including loved ones, family, friends and strangers, and by the happenings of the world we share, my heart was poured onto paper. Though these words were written by my hand and sometimes spoken by my tongue, there is nothing unique about them, for the stirring in me is also in you. So whether you choose to read the following passages in order, read it backwards, or randomly allow yourself to pick a page, don't follow me. Instead, take a journey into your own heart and see where it takes you. Throughout these pages, you will find references to God, Allah, Great Spirit, The Divine, Elohim, Yahweh, Jehovah, He who has no name, and a myriad of other beliefs. Though our words and our thoughts may differ, today, allow yourself to read with an open mind, an open heart and an open spirit. Let your heart inspire you. Let God work through you by being you.","Body, Mind & Spirit",448,N/A,0,en

Gypsy and Traveller Ethnicity,Brian A Belton,Routledge,2004-08-02,"The book explores the notion of Gypsy and Traveller ethnicity and provides a critique of the conceptual basis of racial and ethnic categorisation. An analysis of the post-war housing situation is given in order to illustrate a connection between social and economic conditions, legislation affecting gypsies and travellers and the visibility and general consciousness of the gypsy and traveller population. The originality of the book lies in its argument that the position of gypsies and travellers largely arises out of social conditions and interaction rather than political, biological or ideological determinants. It puts forward the notion of an ethnic narrative of traveller identity and illustrates how variations of this have been defensively deployed by some travellers and elaborated on by theorists. Belton focuses on the social generation of travellers as a cultural, ethnic and racial categorization, offering a rational explanation of the development of an itinerant population that is less ambiguous and more informative in terms of the social nature of the gypsy and traveller position than interpretations based on 'blood', 'breed', 'stock', ethnicity or race that dominate the literature.",Political Science,252,N/A,0,en

Plug&Play Places,Robert Nadler,Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG,2014-10-08,"In post-industrial societies more and more people earn an income in creative knowledge work, a highly flexible labour market segment that demands a geographically mobile workforce. Creative knowledge work is based on an understanding of language, culture and symbolic meanings. This can best be obtained through local and national embeddedness. Yet, this necessity for embeddedness stands in contrast to the demand in geographical mobility. How is this contradiction solved by individuals? What new forms of place attachment does this bring about? This book introduces a showcase of 25 multilocal creative knowledge workers, who live in different countries at the same time. It investigates how continuous mobility becomes part of their lifeworld, and how it changes their feelings of belonging and practices of place attachment. Applying an innovative methodological mix of social phenomenology, hermeneutics and mental mapping, this book takes a detailed look at biographies and the role of places in mobile lifeworlds. Plug&Play Places brings forth the idea that places have to be understood as individual items, which are configured and then plugged into the ‘system’ of the own lifeworld. They can be ‘played’ without great effort once an individual needs to make use of them. This new type of place attachment is a form of subjective standardization of place, which complements the well-known models of objective standardization of places. Plug&Play Places is relevant for scientists who deal with mobility and its impact on individual lifeworlds, with transnational multilocality and with flexibilized labour markets. Furthermore, the book provides a detailed qualitative perspective which can enrich the explanations of quantitative research in the same field. It is an interesting reading also for practitioners engaged in urban planning, housing and real estate development. Robert Nadler holds a doctoral degree in Urban and Local European Studies from the University of Milan-Bicocca. He is a researcher at the Leibniz Institute for Regional Geography and published on creative industries, multilocality and labour mobility.",Social Science,436,5,1,en

In March of 2021, Chavez began to write Heromaker: A British Story Written By An American, which he plans to eventually be the first installment of an extensive series of books surrounding the main protagonist(s). Chavez has always had a fascination with culture affiliated with the United Kingdom, which has stemmed from watching Peter Pan as a child.

"If the Gods Are Not Crazy, Then Surely These Corporate Executives Are",Alec Aaron,Dorrance Publishing,2014-09-16,"A Trinidad-born programmer analyst, Alec Aaron recounts his difficult experiences obtaining a career in Corporate America. Coming from a schooling background not akin to that of the United States, Aaron is often meant with confusion and distrust about his General Certificate of Education from the University of Cambridge in England, a high school called “Presentation College,” and the number of years he spent in high school. Also, the quality, depth, details, contents and duration of his undergrad degree are treated with derision and disdain. More troubles come in the workplace itself, as Aaron seems often at the wrong end of a chain of blame, even after past performance suggests otherwise. Although Aaron has since gotten “to the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel,” he offers his experiences in the hope that other non-traditional job seekers will be more aware of the trials and tribulations of obtaining a position in Corporate America.",Biography & Autobiography,218,N/A,0,en

Teacher Subject Identity in Professional Practice,Clare Brooks,Routledge,2016-03-31,"Teacher Subject Identity in Professional Practice focuses on a key, but neglected, element of a teacher’s identity: that of their subject expertise. Studies of teachers’ professional practice have shown the importance of a teacher’s identity and the extent to which it can affect their resilience, commitment and ultimately their effectiveness. Drawing upon narrative research undertaken with a range of teachers over a period of 14 years, the book explores how subject expertise can play a significant role in teacher identity, acting as a professional compass guiding teachers at all levels of their professional practice. It reveals powerful individual stories of meaning-making which highlight the dynamic importance of teachers’ subject expertise The book’s metaphor of a professional compass goes to the heart of teacher professionalism, and provides a valuable mechanism to enable teachers to respond to challenges they face in their daily practice. It enables teachers to consider the moral dimensions of their practice, and can constitute a significant component in professional formation and identity. Throughout the book the importance of subject expertise for teachers’ professional practice is explored at a range of scales: from the classroom to broad education policy, and at different stages of a teacher’s career which offers readers a deeper understanding of the importance of subject expertise for teachers. Teacher Subject Identity in Professional Practice makes a significant contribution to an under-researched area. It identifies the role and significance of teachers’ subject expertise as a dimension of their teacher identity. The book is key reading for teacher educators, policy makers and researchers with an interest in teachers’ professional development and practice.",Education,165,N/A,0,en

Travel Junkie,Jack Harms,AuthorHouse,2011-08,"This is not a travel guide, nor is it a typical travel book. This is a story about a man who overcame personal tragedies to achieve his lifetime ambition to explore the world. You won't find stories of a man who climbed mountains or sailed the seas. Instead you'll hear about one man's journey who visited over 100 well-known foreign countries and cities, swam with the sharks in Bora-Bora, Tahiti and in Grand Cayman, explored the underwater world of the Australian Great Barrier Reef, walked the Great Wall of China; and went on photo safaris in the African wild game parks. When he began his traveling adventures, the last thing on his mind was writing a book. As he progressed through his trips, he would entertain his relatives, friends and clients with the stories and photos of his more important memories. Invariably, they would say ""you ought to write a book!"" And so he did, and here it is. The book should assist the beginning traveler in deciding where to go, how to go, and how long to stay, and last but not least, how to stay safe in a sometimes dangerous world. Traveling can be, and often is, very rewarding. But it can also be frustrating, expensive, and dangerous. When traveling to a foreign country it is best to expect the unexpected, as your experience will be unlike anything you've experienced before. The Travel Junkie also reveals the true character of Jack Harms and his personal life. Including his hitchhiking days, his attraction to famous entertainers' live performances, his traumatic experiences - being on his own at the age of fourteen in Jackson Hole, Wyoming and the deaths of his mother, and only two brothers at very young ages.",Biography & Autobiography,159,N/A,0,en

Making Do in Damascus,Sally K. Gallagher,Syracuse University Press,2012-10-10,"Drawing on fieldwork that spans nearly twenty years, Making Do in Damascus offers a rare portrayal of ordinary family life in Damascus, Syria. It explores how women draw on cultural ideals around gender, religion, and family to negotiate a sense of collective and personal identity. Emphasizing the ability of women to manage family relationships creatively within mostly conservative Sunni Muslim households, Gallagher highlights how personal and material resources shape women’s choices and constraints concerning education, choice of marriage partner, employment, childrearing, relationships with kin, and the uses and risks of new information technologies. Gallagher argues that taking a nuanced approach toward analyzing women’s identity and authority in society allows us to think beyond dichotomies of Damascene women either as oppressed by class and patriarchy or as completely autonomous agents of their own lives. Tracing ordinary women’s experiences and ideals across decades of social and economic change, Making Do in Damascus highlights the salience of collective identity, place, and connection within families, as well as resources and regional politics, in shaping a generation of families in Damascus.",Social Science,360,N/A,0,en

To Be an Arab in Israel,Laurence Louër,Columbia University Press,2007-03-06,"To Be an Arab in Israel fills a long-neglected gap in the study of Israel and the contemporary Arab world. Whether for ideological reasons or otherwise, both Israeli and Arab writers have yet to seriously consider Israel's significant minority of non-Jewish citizens, whose existence challenges common assumptions regarding Israel's exclusively Jewish character. Arabs have been a presence at all levels of the Israeli government since the foundation of the state. Laurence Louër begins her history in the 1980s when the Israeli political system began to take the Arab nationalist parties into account for the political negotiations over coalition building. Political parties-especially Labour-sought the votes of Arab citizens by making unusual promises such as ownership and access to land. The continuing rise of nationalist sentiments among Palestinians, however, threw the relationship between the Jewish state and the Arab minority into chaos. But as Louër demonstrates, ""Palestinization"" did not prompt the Arab citizens of Israel to set aside their Israeli citizenship. Rather, Israel's Arabs have sought to insert themselves into Israeli society while simultaneously celebrating their difference, and these efforts have led to a confrontation between two conceptions of society and two visions of Israel. Louër's fascinating book embraces the complexity of this history, revealing the surprising collusions and compromises that have led to alliances between Arab nationalists and Israeli authorities. She also addresses the current role of Israel's Arab elites, who have been educated at Hebrew-speaking universities, and the continuing absorption of militant Islamists into Israel's bureaucracy. To Be an Arab in Israel is a discerning treatment of an enigmatic, little known, but nevertheless highly influential people. Their effect on the balance of power in the Middle East seems destined to grow in the twenty-first century.",History,252,N/A,0,en

Where Am I Giving? by New York Times bestselling author Kelsey Timmerman takes you on a journey to meet people who will inspire you to live a purpose-filled, generous life and make the greatest impact you can through your career, time, consumer dollars, and donations. Starting in his hometown of Muncie, Indiana, and then traveling all over the world (Myanmar, Kenya, India, Nepal, and more), Kelsey explores not only different ways of giving—as a worker, consumer, volunteer, giver, local and global citizen—but also the benefits and effectiveness of these methods. He spends time with monks, students, a refugee, a Marine, a former Hollywood executive, Peace Corps Volunteers, and seasoned aid workers to explore how they give, as well as with the people on the receiving end of their giving. Along the way he struggles to be a more informed giver as he becomes a ""voluntourist,” starts his own local non-profit, and searches for a balance between rationality and passion in how he gives. This book will help you: Reveal the amazing opportunities you have to make an impact using your own gifts—and it doesn't have to be money Understand the sociology, philosophy, anthropology, and neuroscience of giving See how giving can make you more connected and happier Examine types of giving, including microlending, volunteering, donating, ethical consumption, mission trips, voluntourism, child sponsorship, etc. Dive into a nuanced view of effectiveness of international aid and its intersection with development, politics, and culture Where Am I Giving? is a fast-paced narrative combining compelling stories collected over 15 years of travel to 90+ countries, mixed with practical advice on how to make giving a part of our everyday lives.",Social Science,306,N/A,0,en

I Write Therefore I Am,Douglas Haig Simpson,Trafford Publishing,2002,"You have a great pleasure waiting for you in this collection of essays, stories and reminiscences. The author has wide-ranging interests from such things as social issues and religion to the solar system and the psychology of the dreaming mind. His ideas will surprise and delight you and you will be intrigued by the unexpected slant he gives to old controversies as he searches for new answers. Humor is never far away. If he does fall into preaching in his discussions of economics and land use it is because he believes that a lack of attention to the forces at work are leading us toward disaster. In another mood which he labels Irish sentiment he tugs at our heart strings with his account of a simple thing like the death of a pet guinea pig. The selections are seldom longer than a few pages but the impact of each is to leave you with a satisfied feeling and the realization that you have something new to think about.",Language Arts & Disciplines,300,N/A,0,en

He bathed her with love, bathed her, bathed her and finally drowned her completely into his love. Saratu loves him with the truest love of her heart. As matter-of-factly, they were head over heels in love. They admired each other, they adored each other, they allured each other, they liked each other, they want each other, they need each other, they beseechingly desired each other and they loved each other like politicians with corruptions. They declared their love for each other and not so long they stood in front of an overfilled church congregation to publicly declare their love for each other in a one-in-town society marriage. They swam in their love and lived very, very comfortable and happily in love. Saratu wasn't in need of anything, even sex.

After The Event,Chris Henson,Mark Binmore,2023-08-01,"I am waiting for Mark. For the last several months he has been missing, Garbo-like, from public life. But in reality he has been writing a new book. We have agreed to go back over the original manuscripts for this edition, to do some editing, add in some extras, delete a few choice words and phrases. We meet in his London home, where he is dressed in a workday uniform of brown shirt, jeans and trainers, hair clipped up in practical busy-busy fashion, all smiles and loud laughter. We first met over five years ago. Then we tentatively shook hands and the laughter was nervous. All that has changed. But some things have not. He still famously hates interviews. Around us there is evidence of a very regular existence. There are books scattered everywhere, a Sony widescreen with a DVD of Shackleton sitting below it. Atop the fireplace hangs a painting called Fishermen by James Southall, a tableau of weather-beaten sea dogs wrestling with a rowing boat; a gift he bought himself on the anniversary of a publication. Balanced against a wall in the office next door is a replica of the Rosebud sledge burned at the dramatic conclusion of Citizen Kane. As I unpack my scripts, I begin with a question. You once said, 'There is a figure that is adored, but I'd question very strongly that it's me.' There is silence. A stare. You did say it. 'Well supposedly I said that. But in what context did I say it?' Just talking about people building up this image of you. It was one of the first things you ever said to me. 'Yes, but I'm not, am I?' There was also that interview that described you as someone fragile being who's hidden himself away. 'That was fairly amusing. A lot of the time it doesn't bother me. I suppose I do think I go out of my way to be a very normal person and I just find it frustrating that people think that I'm some kind of weirdo reclusive that never comes out into the world.' His voice notches up in volume. Did you ever feel you would finish your first book? 'Oh yeah,' he sighs. 'I mean, there were so many times I thought, I'll have the book finished this year, definitely, I'll get it out this year. Then there were a couple of years where I thought, I'm never gonna do this. I don't know why. Time evaporates.' He walks over and picks up the manuscripts. He reads a bit. He laughs. 'Did I really agree to this?' he asks. Mark knows the answer. 'A couple of people who read the first book Tour De Europa,' he says, 'they either really liked it or they found it very uncomfortable. I liked the idea of it being uncomfortable. I thought that was great. I love the ambiguity. But I also loved looking back on lost conversations and instantly remembering an emotion.' A clock somewhere strikes two and a friend arrives with tea, pizza, avocado with balsamic vinegar and cream cake for afters, only to be playfully admonished by Mark, who protests, 'I can't eat all this shit!' It would appear some things never change.",,476,N/A,0,en

The Healing I Took Birth For,Ondrea Levine,Weiser Books,2015-05-01,"For more than 32 years, Stephen and Ondrea Levine have provided emotional and spiritual support to those who face life-threatening illness and their caregivers; deeply affecting hundreds of thousands of people in the process. The Healing I Took Birth For, which was begun after Ondrea’s own medical prognosis that foretold the end of a lifetime of spiritual exploration, is the culmination of her work. Their collaboration, in the service of the dying, especially during the height of the AIDS epidemic, set them both more deeply on the path of compassion—compassion for self, for others, for all. The Healing I Took Birth For is the heartfelt sharing of Ondrea’s life of service and a deeply inspiring example of how one faces illness and great personal difficulties, with a deep spiritual practice and grace. It is the most “intimate collaboration” she and Stephen have worked on and it will inspire readers to find their own way toward living a life of compassion.",Self-Help,226,N/A,0,en

"René Descartes: The Complete Correspondence in English Translation, Volume I",,Oxford University Press,2024-09-21,"René Descartes: The Complete Correspondence in English Translation is the first complete English translation of the extant correspondence of the polymath René Descartes, who excelled in all areas of philosophy, the sciences, and mathematics. The translation is based on the best available editions, modified by several other sources. It is accompanied by an editorial apparatus consisting of cross-references and brief biographies of the correspondents. Descartes' correspondence elaborates his views, providing a crucial resource for students, teachers, and scholars in philosophy, history of philosophy, and history of science and mathematics. Volume I presents correspondence from the period 1619 to 1638. The letters begin with exchanges between Descartes and the physico-mathematician Isaac Beeckman, the essayist Guez de Balzac, the lens maker Jean Ferrier, and Descartes' future primary correspondent Marin Mersenne. It includes letters to high ranking Oratorians. One can also see the beginnings of Descartes' relations with Constantijn Huygens, who will be Descartes' other chief correspondent. One can also trace the developments of Descartes' early unpublished works on metaphysics, physics, and human biology, together with his reaction to the condemnation of Galileo by the Catholic Church. The letters show developments in Descartes' construction and publication of the Discourse on Method, together with the essays Dioptrics, Meteors, and Geometry. This results in an explosion of letters from and to various critics such as the professor of medicine Vopiscus Fortunatus Plemp, the astrologer Jean Baptiste Morin, the mathematicians Pierre Petit, Gilles Personne de Roberval, Pierre de Fermat, and many others.",Philosophy,496,N/A,0,en

An Introduction to the Geography of Tourism,Velvet Nelson,Rowman & Littlefield,2017-03-03,"Tourism is an astonishingly complex phenomenon that is becoming an ever-greater part of life in today’s global world. This clear and engaging text introduces undergraduate students to this vast and diverse subject through the lens of geography, the only field with the breadth to consider all of the aspects, activities, and perspectives that constitute tourism. Indeed, geography and tourism have always been interconnected, and Velvet Nelson reinforces the relationship between them by using both human and physical geography to interpret all facets of tourism—economic, social, and environmental. She shows how geography provides the tools and concepts to consider both the positive and negative factors that affect tourists and destinations as well as the effects tourism has on both peoples and places. Her real-world case studies, based both on research and on the experiences of tourists themselves, vividly illustrate key issues. This comprehensive, thematically organized introduction will enhance students’ understanding of geographic concepts and how they can be used as a way of viewing and understanding the world.",Social Science,384,N/A,0,en

Call You When I Land,Nikki Vargas,Harlequin,2023-11-07,"""Colorful, vivid storytelling.... for anyone looking for a road to reinvention."" —Kristin Newman A soul-stirring memoir from Colombian immigrant and travel journalist Nikki Vargas, whisking us through the countries that brought her new love, self-discovery, and the inspiration to launch the first international feminist travel magazine, Unearth Women. At twenty-six years old, life looked a certain way for Nikki Vargas. She’d settled in New York City ready to join the ranks of the Carrie Bradshaws of the world, had landed in a promising advertising career, and was newly engaged to her college sweetheart. But between corporate happy hours and wedding dress fittings, she couldn’t shake a deep underlying sense of imposter syndrome, a voice telling her that she was rocketing towards a future that didn’t look like her. And so, she bought a plane ticket: first to Cartagena. Then to Panama. Then to Iguazú. What begins with one freelance travel writing assignment escalates into a whirlwind, globe-spanning journey that would transform Nikki’s life. Taking her from the street food stalls of Vietnam to the cascading waterfalls of Argentina, Nikki uncovers shocking truths about her family, comes face to face with a new love interest – or two – and ultimately turns a no-name blog into the internationally celebrated venture of Unearth Women, the first major female-focused travel publication. Told in transporting detail and candid reflections, Call You When I Land takes the familiar story of a woman going abroad to find herself and turns it on its head, as the act of traveling becomes, for Nikki, an exhilarating career path – and ultimately a tool to champion women’s voices across the world.",Biography & Autobiography,265,N/A,0,en

He finds himself in a strange new world when he is sent to boarding school in Ireland, where his mother grew up. Bob is at first confused by the English spoken by the people around him. Accustomed to comfort, his new school has bad food and no heat. Even worse, the teachers use a bamboo cane on students as punishment. One of them even seems so nuts that the other boys say he's a Martian. Bob only wants to go home. Then Bob falls in with a group of friends who prod him out of some of his misery. He discovers the teacher he finds the most frightening (the one assigned to cane the boys) is the one he likes the best. He and his friends create hilarity with their suspenseful pranks and, inspired by the Goons comedy radio show, they commit acts of theater which culminate in Bob bringing American rock and roll to the other boys for the very first time.",Biography & Autobiography,313,N/A,0,en

Travel Journalism and Travel Media,Ben Cocking,Springer Nature,2020-06-08,"This book charts the trajectory of travel journalism from its print based origins to the emergence of hybridised multi-platform content. It considers how this has led to not only different kinds of travel journalism but different kinds of travel journalists; the professional travel journalist is now challenged online by user generated content. Cocking focuses on the conventions and “news values” of British print-based travel journalism, examining the genre’s liminal position between truth and fiction. In the context of the expansion of global tourism, Cocking explores how travel journalism from different parts of the world negotiates cultural differences in its depictions of destinations, regions, and tourist practices. Consideration is also given to the political potential of travel journalism and its capacity for awareness raising. Based on original research including qualitative analysis of print-based articles and blogs this book offers an innovative and original contribution to this emerging field of study.",Social Science,165,N/A,0,en

The Meaning of Travel,Emily Thomas,N/A,2020,"How can we think more deeply about our travels? This was the question that inspired Emily Thomas' journey into the philosophy of travel. Part philosophical ramble, part travelogue, The Meaning of Travel begins in the Age of Discovery, when philosophers first started taking travel seriously. It meanders forward to consider Montaigne on otherness, John Locke on cannibals, and Henry Thoreau on wilderness. On our travels with Thomas, we discover the dark side of maps, how the philosophy of space fuelled mountain tourism, and why you should wash underwear in woodland cabins... We also confront profound issues, such as the ethics of 'doom tourism' (travel to 'doomed' glaciers and coral reefs), and the effect of space travel on human significance in a leviathan universe. The first ever exploration of the places where history and philosophy meet, this book will reshape your understanding of travel.",History,262,N/A,0,en

Straight to the Point,Julie Leibrich,Otago University Press,1993,"""Based on interviews with randomly selected former offenders, this book takes a fresh look at the course and nature of crime. It cuts across theorising, trying to understand what people actually experience, why they do what they do, and to get a picture of successful change."" ""As the Justice Department's Centennial Fellow, Dr Leibrich tracked down fifty offenders who had been sentenced to supervision in 1987 and not reoffended three years later. She asked them why not. The people who participated in the interviews did so because they wanted to, and their stories make this a moving piece of research."" ""The author soon found that 'going straight' was 'curved' - that the people she interviewed did not fall into such neat categories as 'straight' and 'crooked'. Her methodology (which she describes in detail in the appendices) needed to grapple with the many subtleties of her material and drew on different kinds of research strategies, utilising their strengths. In an exciting account of her approach to problem-solving on the basis of trial and error, and intuition, the reader gains insight into the personal experience of the research process, the pitfalls and highlights, the frustration and anxiety of data collection - 'Will I find Trinity? Is the guy I'm going to meet really okay? Do I include people who have reoffended? Does my write-up reflect people's real experience?' The result, this book, is tight and rigorous in its analysis, but does justice to the richness and warmth of the data, valuing the words and actions of the people who participated in the study.""--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Bewildered Travel,Frederick J. Ruf,University of Virginia Press,2012-10-05,"Why do we travel? Ostensibly an act of leisure, travel finds us thrusting ourselves into jets flying miles above the earth, only to endure dislocations of time and space, foods and languages foreign to our body and mind, and encounters with strangers on whom we must suddenly depend. Travel is not merely a break from routine; it is its antithesis, a voluntary trading in of the security one feels at home for unpredictability and confusion. In Bewildered Travel Frederick Ruf argues that this confusion, which we might think of simply as a necessary evil, is in fact the very thing we are seeking when we leave home. Ruf relates this quest for confusion to our religious behavior. Citing William James, who defined the religious as what enables us to ""front life,"" Ruf contends that the search for bewilderment allows us to point our craft into the wind and sail headlong into the storm rather than flee from it. This view challenges the Eliadean tradition that stresses religious ritual as a shield against the world’s chaos. Ruf sees our departures from the familiar as a crucial component in a spiritual life, reminding us of the central role of pilgrimage in religion. In addition to his own revealing experiences as a traveler, Ruf presents the reader with the journeys of a large and diverse assortment of notable Americans, including Henry Miller, Paul Bowles, Mark Twain, Mary Oliver, and Walt Whitman. These accounts take us from the Middle East to the Philippines, India to Nicaragua, Mexico to Morocco--and, in one threatening instance, simply to the edge of the author’s own neighborhood. ""What gives value to travel is fear,"" wrote Camus. This book illustrates the truth of that statement.",Religion,298,N/A,0,en

Airport capacity constraintsand strategies for mitigation: A global perspective analyses airport capacity constraints with empiricalmethods that forecast future capacities and capacity shortfalls.The book discusses in detail the importance of airport capacity constraints on air traffic development,especially for international hubs, along with mitigation strategies for already congested airports. It analysesempirical data to provide greater insight into the problems of airport congestion and capacity shortage.The authors present detailed global traffic forecasts for the years 2030 and 2040, and mitigation strategiesfor overcoming the problem of limited airport capacity.As expanding current airports becomes increasingly difficult, and time consuming – especially for hubs– the study of current and future airport capacity constraints becomes ever more needed.

Population Dynamics and Infectious Diseases in Asia,Adrian Sleigh,World Scientific,2006,"Initially stimulated by a scholarly workshop convened in Singapore in late 2004, and written over the subsequent 18 months, this volume considers the potentially lethal pattern of infectious disease emergence in Asia. It studies linkages to changes in patterns of human activity, including but not limited to shifts in the distribution and concentration of human settlements and the patterns of movement within and between them. It explores the causes and consequences of infectious agents in the region historically and examines such newly emergent natural biological threats as SARS and avian influenza. Drawing on a range of disciplinary perspectives, the book contains analyses rooted in the social, physical and biological sciences as well as works which span these fields. Among the issues considered are the ways in which changes in our natural and built environment, social and economic pressures, shifting policies and patterns of collaboration in responding to disease impact upon our approach to and success in containing serious threats. Infection control has moved beyond the province of clinical experts, epidemiologists and microbiologists, into the mathematics of epidemic prevention and control, as well as the overall physical and human ecology and historical contexts of emerging infections. Not only does such a broad approach enable appreciation of complex forces driving growing epidemic risks in Asia today, it also reveals the importance and relevance of population dynamics, as well as the global urgency of alleviating unsatisfactory health conditions in Asia. The topic and the broad approach has international appeal beyond the region as many of these forces operate throughout the world. Sample Chapter(s).

Time Travel in Einstein's Universe,J. Richard Gott,HMH,2015-08-25,"A Princeton astrophysicist explores whether journeying to the past or future is scientifically possible in this “intriguing” volume (Neil deGrasse Tyson). It was H. G. Wells who coined the term “time machine”—but the concept of time travel, both forward and backward, has always provoked fascination and yearning. It has mostly been dismissed as an impossibility in the world of physics; yet theories posited by Einstein, and advanced by scientists including Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne, suggest that the phenomenon could actually occur. Building on these ideas, J. Richard Gott, a professor who has written on the subject for Scientific American, Time, and other publications, describes how travel to the future is not only possible but has already happened—and contemplates whether travel to the past is also conceivable. This look at the surprising facts behind the science fiction of time travel “deserves the attention of anyone wanting wider intellectual horizons” (Booklist). “Impressively clear language. Practical tips for chrononauts on their options for travel and the contingencies to prepare for make everything sound bizarrely plausible. Gott clearly enjoys his subject and his excitement and humor are contagious; this book is a delight to read.” —Publishers Weekly",Science,307,5,1,en

"Tourism, Territory and Sustainable Development",João Romão,Springer,2018-05-09,"Welfare rise, spatial mobility, and global information and communication channels (in particular, social media) have prompted the emergence of a specific booming and rapidly growing mobility industry all over the world, namely tourism. The tourist sector (including recreation and leisure activities) has turned into a complex contemporaneous socio-economic and geographic phenomenon, with a multiplicity of travel motives (e.g., entertainment, culture, relaxed life style, wellness, nature, etc.) and with a wide variety of impacts (e.g., urban- and regional-economic effects, crowding phenomena, environmental decay, etc.). Time has now come to offer a synthesis of the analytical apparatus in tourism research, with particular attention for system-wide, socio-economic and environmental dimensions of this important global industry. Tourism has in the past been a largely neglected field in regional science research. And therefore, it is laudable that João Romão has taken the decision to compose a systematically designed and well crafted monograph on the socio-economic, environmental and spatial dimensions of modern tourism. It offers a wealth of analytical insights and quantitative research tools for advanced tourism studies. It also fills an important gap in the current regional science literature.

Saturn's Moons,Jo Catling,Routledge,2017-07-05,"The German novelist, poet and critic W. G. Sebald (1944-2001) has in recent years attracted a phenomenal international following for his evocative prose works such as Die Ausgewanderten (The Emigrants), Die Ringe des Saturn (The Rings of Saturn) and Austerlitz, spellbinding elegiac narratives which, through their deliberate blurring of genre boundaries and provocative use of photography, explore questions of Heimat and exile, memory and loss, history and natural history, art and nature. Saturn's Moons: a W. G. Sebald Handbook brings together in one volume a wealth of new critical and visual material on Sebald's life and works, covering the many facets and phases of his literary and academic careers -- as teacher, as scholar and critic, as colleague and as collaborator on translation. Lavishly illustrated, the Handbook also contains a number of rediscovered short pieces by W. G. Sebald, hitherto unpublished interviews, a catalogue of his library, and selected poems and tributes, as well as extensive primary and secondary bibliographies, details of audiovisual material and interviews, and a chronology of life and works. Drawing on a range of original sources from Sebald's Nachlass - the most important part of which is now held in the Deutsches Literaturarchiv Marbach - Saturn's Moons6g will be an invaluable sourcebook for future Sebald studies in English and German alike, complementing and augmenting recent critical works on subjects such as history, memory, modernity, reader response and the visual.

Urbanization and Affordances that Promote Well-Being for (Urban) People and for a Healthy Biosphere,"Stephan Barthel, Marketta Kyttä",Frontiers Media SA,2020-01-30,"The world is urbanizing at an unprecedented rate. It is estimated that in the near future urban landscapes for another ca. 2.7 billion people will be built on planet Earth, approximately converting land equivalent to the size of South Africa. Such land conversion, coupled with citizen densification, increasing in-equalities, shifting diets, and emerging technologies, challenge human well-being and pose ever-increasing demand for resources generated by the Biosphere. This Research Topic concentrates on the various ways urbanization can promote individual well-being (mental, physical, and social health) as well as ecological health (a healthy Biosphere). What kind of affordances for human health promotion can urbanization include? What kinds of affordances for a psychological connection with nature can urbanization include? What kinds of nudges for pro-environmental behavior and consumption (decreasing detrimental consumption behaviors) can be actively designed in urban settings? The Research Topic at hand uses a transactional approach, where an affordance can be understood as a non-deterministic in-situ precondition for a human activity, enabled by relations between abilities of an individual with features of an environment. We encourage a broad definition of the concept of affordances, where ‘the environment’ must not be restricted to the material biophysical environment alone, but also could be combined with social immaterial features. We see that the transactional approach of this Research Topic posits that meaning arises in relations between humans and their environment, that it will be equally applicable to natural and designed environments, and that it doesn’t regard dichotomies like city-contra-nature or social-contra-ecological. Hence, this Research Topic is interested in if the transactional approach can be used as a conceptual tool, not only for promotion of mental, physical, and social health in cities, but simultaneously for unraveling relations at the micro scale in cities which can be used for solutions that also promote a healthy Biosphere.",,187,N/A,0,en

Cine-Mobility,Han Sang Kim,BRILL,2023-12-04,"In 1916, a group of Korean farmers and their children gathered to watch a film depicting the enthronement of the Japanese emperor. For this screening, a unit of the colonial government’s news agency brought a projector and generator by train to their remote rural town. Before the formation of commercial moviegoing culture for colonial audiences in rural Korean towns, many films were sent to such towns and villages as propaganda. The colonial authorities, as well as later South Korean postcolonial state authorities, saw film as the most effective medium for disseminating their political messages. In Cine-Mobility, Han Sang Kim argues that the force of propaganda films in Korea was derived primarily not from their messages but from the new mobility of the viewing position. From the first film shot in Korea in 1901 through early internet screen cultures in late 1990s South Korea, Cine-Mobility explores the association between cinematic media and transportation mobility, not only in diverse and discrete forms such as railroads, motorways, automobiles, automation, and digital technologies, but also in connection with the newly established rules and restrictions and the new culture of mobility, including changes in gender dynamics, that accompanied it.",History,270,N/A,0,en

Tourism in the City,"Nicola Bellini, Cecilia Pasquinelli",Springer,2016-08-29,"This book critically explores the interconnections between tourism and the contemporary city from a policy-oriented standpoint, combining tourism perspectives with discussion of urban models, issues, and challenges. Research-based analyses addressing managerial issues and evaluating policy implications are described, and a comprehensive set of case studies is presented to demonstrate practices and policies in various urban contexts. A key message is that tourism policies should be conceived as integrated urban policies that promote tourism performance as a means of fostering urban quality and the well-being of local communities, e.g., in terms of quality spaces, employment, accessibility, innovation, and learning opportunities. In addition to highlighting the significance of urban tourism in relation to key urban challenges, the book reflects on the risks and tensions associated with its development, including the rise of anti-tourism movements as a reaction to touristification, cultural commodification, and gentrification. Attention is drawn to asymmetries in the costs and benefits of the city tourism phenomenon, and the supposedly unavoidable trade-off between the interests of residents and tourists is critically questioned.",Business & Economics,344,N/A,0,en

Aerospace Health and Safety: Today and the Future,"Irina Mordukhovich, Mardi A. Crane-Godreau, Eileen Mcneely, Christopher Scheibler",Frontiers Media SA,2023-11-20,"Aviation plays vital roles in commerce, defense, science and leisure travel. Irrespective of the purpose of flight, crew and passengers are challenged by exposure to a variety of environmental conditions that can differ widely from work and travel environments on the surface of the Earth. With anticipated changes in aviation and space technology, new challenges to health and safety of crew and passengers can be expected. In this Research Topic, we welcome contributions from those whose work and interests are relevant to the health and safety of crew and passengers. This includes, but is not limited to, health and safety professionals, FAA examiners, corporate medical officers, aerospace and occupational physicians, physiologists, military and scientific team members, public health professionals, as well as engineers who are tasked with crew and passenger health and safety design projects. While 4.1 billion passengers fly on commercial airlines annually (and this figure is even higher when taking into account privately owned aircraft and military flight), for the most part aviation is safe. Passengers do arrive at their destinations with little concern to their own well-being and flight is generally well tolerated. However, older flyers, people with (diagnosed or undiagnosed) preexisting disease, and other vulnerable passengers (such as young children and pregnant women) may be at risk of complications and crew may be at special risk due to the frequency and duration of their many flight-related exposures. Health and safety issues for crew and passengers include but are not limited to: potentially severe circadian rhythm disruption, potential health effects of low-level cosmic ionizing radiation exposure at altitude, reduced oxygen delivery and tissue hypoxia at cabin pressurization, cabin air contamination by engine gases, toxic materials used in uniforms and some cabin seat materials, occupational noise, pesticides used for cabin disinsection, lack of adequate crew rest on layovers or between flights, cardiovascular demands of flight and effects of flight-related dehydration, the current absence of screening protocols especially in the context of a rising number of elderly and vulnerable flyers, lack of healthy nutrition at airports and in flight, availability of food and hydration as well as adequate cabin temperature under delay conditions, effects of alcohol use on flight-related physiological and behavioral health risks, anxiety and psychological distress associated with air travel, the effects of long-haul or ultra-long-haul flights on thromboembolic events as well as smoking cessation efforts and related psychological outcomes, job-related stress and harassment among crew. Cosmic ionizing and non-ionizing radiation exposure have drawn attention as have historic exposures of crew and passengers to second-hand cigarette smoke. The threat of political and interpersonal violence and altercations involving aviation cannot be overlooked. On-board medical emergencies run a wide gamut and the capacity to respond becomes more problematic as the duration of flights becomes longer or in the case of flight over oceans and the poles. In addition, in-flight and post flight embolisms and myocardial infarctions are more prevalent than might be expected. We hence encourage manuscripts that address in-flight medical response, including the capabilities on different types of aircraft on potential interventions by crew and medical volunteers. In addition, aviation as a vector for the carriage of disease is a significant concern to public health and security of populations world-wide, and we welcome submissions regarding infectious disease epidemiology and medicine as it relates to air travel. Insects and occasional unplanned travel by birds and rodents can present additional public health concerns. We are approaching an era where space travel may soon be increasingly common. Future flights for near-Earth orbit by leisure travelers and as well as travel to the moon and Mars raise a host of new questions with health and safety implications. What are the proposed health and safety accommodations going to be? Who will be allowed to travel? Perhaps the most interesting question is - who will make the rules?",Science,301,N/A,0,en
The Globalization of Health Care,I. Glenn Cohen,Oxford University Press,2013-03-19,"The Globalization of Health Care is the first book to offer a comprehensive legal and ethical analysis of the most interesting and broadest reaching development in health care of the last twenty years: its globalization. It ties together the manifestation of this globalization in four related subject areas - medical tourism, medical migration (the physician ""brain drain""), telemedicine, and pharmaceutical research and development, and integrates them in a philosophical discussion of issues of justice and equity relating to the globalization of health care. The time for such an examination is right. Medical tourism and telemedicine are growing multi-billion-dollar industries affecting large numbers of patients. The U.S. heavily depends on foreign-trained doctors to staff its health care system, and nearly forty percent of clinical trials are now run in the developing world, with indications of as much of a 10-fold increase in the past 20 years. NGOs across the world are agitating for increased access to necessary pharmaceuticals in the developing world, claiming that better access to medicine would save millions from early death at a relatively low cost. Coming on the heels of the most expansive reform to U.S. health care in fifty years, this book plots the ways in which this globalization will develop as the reform is implemented.",Law,479,1,1,en
Life-Oriented Behavioral Research for Urban Policy,Junyi Zhang,Springer,2017-01-03,"This book presents a life-oriented approach, which is an interdisciplinary methodology proposed for cross-sectoral urban policy decisions such as transport, health, and energy policies. Improving people’s quality of life (QOL) is one of the common goals of various urban policies on the one hand, while QOL is closely linked with a variety of life choices on the other. The life-oriented approach argues that life choices in different domains (e.g., residence, neighborhood, health, education, work, family life, leisure and recreation, finance, and travel behavior) are not independent of one another, and ignorance of and inability to understand interdependent life choices may result in a failure of consensus building for policy decisions. The book provides evidence about behavioral interdependencies among life domains based on both extensive literature reviews and case studies covering a broad set of life choices. This work further illustrates interbehavioral analysis frameworks with respect to various life domains, along with a rich set of future research directions. This book deals with life choices in a relatively general way. Thus, it can serve not only as a reference for research, but also as a textbook for teaching and learning in varied behavior-related disciplines.",Technology & Engineering,522,N/A,0,en

"Human Mobility, Spatiotemporal Context, and Environmental Health: Recent Advances in Approaches and Methods",Mei-Po Kwan,MDPI,2019-07-12,"Environmental health researchers have long used concepts like the neighborhood effect to assessing people’s exposure to environmental influences and the associated health impact. However, these are static notions that ignore people’s daily mobility at various spatial and temporal scales (e.g., daily travel, migratory movements, and movements over the life course) and the influence of neighborhood contexts outside their residential neighborhoods. Recent studies have started to incorporate human mobility, non-residential neighborhoods, and the temporality of exposures through collecting and using data from GPS, accelerometers, mobile phones, various types of sensors, and social media. Innovative approaches and methods have been developed. This Special Issue aims to showcase studies that use new approaches, methods, and data to examine the role of human mobility and non-residential contexts on human health behaviors and outcomes. It includes 21 articles that cover a wide range of topics, including individual exposure to air pollution, exposure and access to green spaces, spatial access to healthcare services, environmental influences on physical activity, food environmental and diet behavior, exposure to noise and its impact on mental health, and broader methodological issues such as the uncertain geographic context problem (UGCoP) and the neighborhood effect averaging problem (NEAP).

This topic has received much attention over the last decade, mainly in the three fields of urban design, public health, and transportation. This Special Issue aims to provide multidisciplinary and evidence-based state-of-the-art research on how the locations where people live impact their active behaviors and health outcomes.",Medical,234,N/A,0,en
COVID Ecology and Evolution: Systemic Biosocial Dynamics,"Matteo Convertino, Salvatore Flavio Pileggi",Frontiers Media SA,2023-05-23,"With the world in a state of emergency due to the Coronavirus pandemic, almost the entire scientific community and all governmental/intergovernmental agencies are focused on defining the most effective disease control and forecasting. However, is disease control the only or most crucial element to consider? In this Research Topic, we intend to highlight crucially important topics about Coronavirus related to its environmental dependencies, biological diversity and stability, and socio-economic outcomes, considering also information, modeling and technological aspects of the pandemic. The objective of the Research Topic is to bring together spatio-temporal biological, ecological, environmental and social aspects of Coronavirus to better understand its dynamics, shifts, systemic impacts on health and socio-economic effects. Studies via models that link Coronavirus to other viruses are welcome, in order to properly characterize the biology, ecology and environmental niche or universality of Coronavirus dynamics. We also seek prospective studies that investigate potential future spillovers of Coronavirus-like viruses by indicating risk hotspots in relation to socio-environmental determinants. Other issues focused on public health and medical aspects are welcome; however, these studies need to explicitly address the virus’ connection with the environment in order to gain insight into its ecology and evolution. Studies addressing data and modeling challenges as well as different model approaches (from machine learning to phenomenological and process-based models) have a lot of interest. Lastly, we highly encourage studies that quantitatively explore the coupled evolution of population perceptions and the associated infodemic (for instance, inferred from social media), behavior and systemic health outcomes.",Science,125,N/A,0,en

It has over the years turned into an appealing multi-disciplinary oriented approach to the understanding of the impacts of leisure time in a modern society, including cultural heritage, sustainable quality of life, and industrial organization of the hospitality industry. The increasing dynamics in the tourist industry and its worldwide effects will continue to attract the attention of both the research and the policy sector in the years to come. Rather than speculating on non-observed facts, there is a clear need for evidence-based research in order to map out the complex dynamics of the tourist industry. The present volume comprises novel studies – mainly of a quantitative-analytical nature – on the supply, demand and contextual aspects of modern tourism. It contains a sound mix of theory, methodology, policy and case studies on various tourism issues in different parts of the world.​",Business & Economics,346,N/A,0,en

Risks and Challenges in Medical Tourism,"Jill R.

Risks and Challenges in Medical Tourism: Understanding the Global Market for Health Services provides an in-depth, comprehensive assessment of the benefits and risks when health care becomes a global commodity. The collection includes contributions from leading scholars in law and public policy, medicine and public health, bioethics, anthropology, health geography, and economics. This timely and informative handbook looks at medical tourism from the perspective of some of the major regions that send and receive medical tourists, including the United States, the European Union, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. Contributors examine how government agencies, medical tourism companies, international hospital chains, and other organizations promote medical tourism and the globalization of health care. The topics explored include the legal remedies available to medical tourists when procedures go awry; potential consequences when patients cross borders for medical procedures that are illegal in their home countries; the relationship of medical tourism to international spread of infectious disease; and the lack of adequate transnational policies and regulations governing the global market for health services.",Health & Fitness,210,N/A,0,en

Travel and Travail,Mary C. Fuller,U of Nebraska Press,2019,"Popular English travel guides from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries asserted that women who wandered too far afield were invariably suspicious, dishonest, and unchaste. As the essays in Travel and Travail reveal, however, early modern women did travel, often quite extensively, with no diminution of their moral fiber. Female travelers were also frequently represented on the English stage and in other creative works, both as a reproach to the ban on female travel and as a reflection of historical women's travel, whether intentional or not. Travel and Travail conclusively refutes the notion of female travel in the early modern era as ""an absent presence."" The first part of the volume offers analyses of female travelers (often recently widowed or accompanied by their husbands), the practicalities of female travel, and how women were thought to experience foreign places. The second part turns to literature, including discussions of roving women in Shakespeare, Margaret Cavendish, and Thomas Heywood. Whether historical actors or fictional characters, women figured in the wider world of the global Renaissance, not simply in the hearth and home.",History,484,N/A,0,en

Where Is My Flying Car?,J. Storrs Hall,Stripe Press,2021-11-30,"From an engineer and futurist, an impassioned account of technological stagnation since the 1970s and an imaginative blueprint for a richer, more abundant future The science fiction of the 1960s promised us a future remade by technological innovation: we’d vacation in geodesic domes on Mars, have meaningful conversations with computers, and drop our children off at school in flying cars. Fast-forward 60 years, and we’re still stuck in traffic in gas-guzzling sedans and boarding the same types of planes we flew in over half a century ago. What happened to the future we were promised? In Where Is My Flying Car?, J. Storrs Hall sets out to answer this deceptively simple question. What starts as an examination of the technical limitations of building flying cars evolves into an investigation of the scientific, technological, and social roots of the economic stagnation that started in the 1970s. From the failure to adopt nuclear energy and the suppression of cold fusion technology to the rise of a counterculture hostile to progress, Hall recounts how our collective ambitions for the future were derailed, with devastating consequences for global wealth creation and distribution. Hall then outlines a framework for a future powered by exponential progress—one in which we build as much in the world of atoms as we do in the world of bits, one rich in abundance and wonder. Drawing on years of original research and personal engineering experience, Where Is My Flying Car?, originally published in 2018, is an urgent, timely analysis of technological progress over the last 50 years and a bold vision for a better future.",Technology & Engineering,360,N/A,0,en

Routes,James Clifford,Harvard University Press,1997-04-21,"When culture makes itself at home in motion, where does an anthropologist stand? In a follow-up to The Predicament of Culture, one of the defining books for anthropology in the last decade, James Clifford takes the proper measure: a moving picture of a world that doesn't stand still, that reveals itself en route, in the airport lounge and the parking lot as much as in the marketplace and the museum. In this collage of essays, meditations, poems, and travel reports, Clifford takes travel and its difficult companion, translation, as openings into a complex modernity. He contemplates a world ever more connected yet not homogeneous, a global history proceeding from the fraught legacies of exploration, colonization, capitalist expansion, immigration, labor mobility, and tourism. Ranging from Highland New Guinea to northern California, from Vancouver to London, he probes current approaches to the interpretation and display of non-Western arts and cultures. Wherever people and things cross paths and where institutional forces work to discipline unruly encounters, Clifford's concern is with struggles to displace stereotypes, to recognize divergent histories, to sustain ""postcolonial"" and ""tribal"" identities in contexts of domination and globalization. Travel, diaspora, border crossing, self-location, the making of homes away from home: these are transcultural predicaments for the late twentieth century. The map that might account for them, the history of an entangled modernity, emerges here as an unfinished series of paths and negotiations, leading in many directions while returning again and again to the struggles and arts of cultural encounter, the impossible, inescapable tasks of translation.",Language Arts & Disciplines,424,5,1,en

How Ghosts Travel,James J. Siegel,N/A,2016-02-02,"This collection seems to have been written with vapor-the unseen made visible through James Siegel's intuitive eye. The poems also form an elegy of place, Ohio. Personal phantoms populate this physical and metaphysical locus. Haunted by history and its ruins, the poet deciphers "" t]hat fur-covered / folklore crawling out from under the skin."" Recasting stanzas into incantations, Siegel conjures memories that ""brush the sides of your face, / rest in the tangles of your hair."" Finally, ghosts become the Holy Ghost, with ""a congregation of wings,"" with ""the rattle of the rosary."" Angelic presences reify the ineffable. And from that perspective, the poet shows the reader how ""the vault of the stars unlocks."" Dean Kostos, author of ""This Is Not a Skyscraper"" and ""Rivering"" ""How Ghosts Travel"" is James Siegel's beautifully-atmospheric explication of his past, which here is ever-present. His voice, though casual and colloquial at times, is always tuned to the lyrical as he resurrects his childhood and young adulthood in industrial and small-town Ohio in poems scarred with heartbreak and loss. But what is perhaps most impressive about this debut collection is the sheer number of poems that remain vibrantly in mind long after they're read, among them ""Fishing Photo, Circa 1984,"" ""Boy Scout Blue,"" ""Massillon,"" ""Flatlands,"" ""The Road,"" and ""Serpent Mound,"" one of the most skillful love poems I've encountered. This is a book well worth the price of admission. Myrna Stone, author of ""In The Present Tense: Portraits of My Father""and ""The Casanova Chronicles"" In""How Ghosts Travel,"" James J. Siegel tells us ""you may leave behind your landscapes"" but not without warning ""we cannot expect the past to just stop talking."" This collection channels that past, using crumbling maps, a oujia board, even the ""bones of an ancient civilization unearthed where a parking lot was supposed to be"" torevisit the ""charged particles"" of a childhood in suburban Ohio. Atribute to the Midwest of his parents and grandparents, Siegel observes ""Factories close, families move, gears sigh one last time."" But luckily there arethe drive-in theaters, Lake Erie fishing trips, County Fairs, and Boy Scout badges to remember.One would think this ""world has slipped away"" with ""the drugstore windows filled with dust,"" but Siegel reminds us ""Nature knows what to do"" when ""itfills the emptyspaces of the Ferris wheelwith thick birch branches."" This book is a ride on that wheel, granting a view of the whole town, its industrial graveyards and abandoned homes made fertile again by their former lives and the poet who resurrects them.

Clinical Studies in Neuropsychoanalysis Revisited,"Christian Salas, Oliver Turnbull, Mark Solms",Routledge,2021-07-28,"In the past few decades, we have accumulated an impressive amount of knowledge regarding the neural basis of the mind. One of the most important sources of this knowledge has been the in-depth study of individuals with focal brain damage and other neurological disorders. This book offers a unique perspective, in that it uses a combination of neuropsychology and psychoanalytic knowledge from diverse schools (Freudian, Kleinian, Lacanian, Relational, etc.), to explore how damage to specific areas of the brain can change the mind. Twenty years after the publication of Clinical Studies in Neuro-Psychoanalysis, this book continues the pioneering work of Mark Solms and Karen Kaplan-Solms, bringing together clinicians and researchers from all over the world to report key developments in the field. They present a rich set of new case studies, from a diverse range of brain injuries, neuropsychological impairments and even degenerative and paediatric pathologies. This volume will be of immense value to those working with neurological populations that want to incorporate psychoanalytic ideas in case formulations, as well as for those who want to introduce themselves in the neurological basis of psychoanalytic models of the mind and the broader psychoanalytic community.",Psychology,351,N/A,0,en
TRANSPORTATION PLANNING,"PRABIR KUMAR SARKAR, VINAY MAITRI, G. J. JOSHI",PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.,2014-11-14,"Transportation planning plays a useful role as a lifeline for any society. It comprises applications of science and art, where a great deal of judgement coupled with its technical elements is required to arrive at a meaningful decision in order to develop transportation infrastructure facilities for the community. Transportation planning, thereby, helps in achieving a safer, faster, comfortable, convenient, economical and environment-friendly movement of people and goods traffic. In this context, an attempt has been made to write a comprehensive book on this subject, which not only deals with the basic principles and fundamentals of transportation planning but also keeps abreast of the current practices and policies conducted in transportation planning. Divided into 23 chapters, the book felicitously proffers the fundamental techniques of transportation planning and travel demand modelling, urban form and urban structure and their relation with transport pattern, land use-transport model, accessibility and mobility consideration in transport modelling, graph theory and road network planning, cost benefit analysis, mass transport planning, applications of intelligent transport system, applications of software in transport planning, and transport policies. Exploiting a systematic approach avoiding prolixity, this book will prove to be a vade mecum for the undergraduate and postgraduate students of civil engineering and transportation engineering. Besides, this book is of immense benefit to the students opting a course on Master of Planning conducted in various institutes. Highlights of the Book • Systematically organised concepts well-supported with ample illustrations • Prodigious illustrative figures and tables • Incorporates chapter-end summary to help in grasping the quirk concepts • Presents state-of-the-art data • Includes chapter-end review questions to help students prepare for examination",Technology & Engineering,490,4.5,2,en

Healthcare System Access,Nicoleta Serban,John Wiley & Sons,2019-12-24,"A guide to a holistic approach to healthcare measurement aimed at improving access and outcomes Healthcare System Access is an important resource that bridges two areas of research—access modeling and healthcare system engineering. The book’s mathematical modeling approach highlights fundamental approaches on measurement of and inference on healthcare access. This mathematical modeling facilitates translating data into knowledge in order to make data-driven estimates and projections about parameters, patterns, and trends in the system. The complementary engineering approach uses estimates and projections about the system to better inform efforts to design systems that will yield better outcomes. The author—a noted expert on the topic—offers an in-depth exploration of the concepts of systematic disparities, reviews measures for systematic disparities, and presents a statistical framework for making inference on disparities with application to disparities in access. The book also includes information health outcomes in the context of prevention and chronic disease management. In addition, this text: Integrates data and knowledge from various fields to provide a framework for decision making in transforming access to healthcare Provides in-depth material including illustrations of how to use state-of-art methodology, large data sources, and research from various fields Includes end-of-chapter case studies for applying concepts to real-world conditions Written for health systems engineers, Healthcare System Access: Measurement, Inference, and Intervention puts the focus on approaches to measure healthcare access and addresses important enablers of such change in healthcare towards improving access and outcomes.",Medical,272,N/A,0,en

Pro-active Dynamic Vehicle Routing,Francesco Ferrucci,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-03-14,"This book deals with transportation processes denoted as the Real-time Distribution of Perishable Goods (RDOPG). The book presents three contributions that are made to the field of transportation. First, a model considering the minimization of customer inconvenience is formulated. Second, a pro-active real-time control approach is proposed. Stochastic knowledge is generated from past request information by a new forecasting approach and is used in the pro-active approach to guide vehicles to request-likely areas before real requests arrive there. Various computational results are presented to show that in many cases the pro-active approach is able to achieve significantly improved results. Moreover, a measure for determining the structural quality of request data sets is also proposed. The third contribution of this book is a method that is presented for considering driver inconvenience aspects which arise from vehicle en-route diversion activities. Specifically, this method makes it possible to restrict the number of performed vehicle en-route diversion activities.​",Business & Economics,356,N/A,0,en

"Musimathics, Volume 1",Gareth Loy,MIT Press,2011-08-19,"A commonsense, self-contained introduction to the mathematics and physics of music; essential reading for musicians, music engineers, and anyone interested in the intersection of art and science. “Mathematics can be as effortless as humming a tune, if you know the tune,” writes Gareth Loy. In Musimathics, Loy teaches us the tune, providing a friendly and spirited tour of the mathematics of music—a commonsense, self-contained introduction for the nonspecialist reader. It is designed for musicians who find their art increasingly mediated by technology, and for anyone who is interested in the intersection of art and science. In Volume 1, Loy presents the materials of music (notes, intervals, and scales); the physical properties of music (frequency, amplitude, duration, and timbre); the perception of music and sound (how we hear); and music composition. Calling himself “a composer seduced into mathematics,” Loy provides answers to foundational questions about the mathematics of music accessibly yet rigorously.

Careers after Congress,Matthew S. Dabros,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2017-05-18,"Citizens, journalists, and watchdog organizations claim that U.S. Congress members serve special interest groups in return for lucrative jobs in industry once they leave officeand that these legislators become lax in their final term of office as they are no longer compelled by elections to provide quality representation to citizens. This book investigates the veracity of these claims. The established consensus among scholars and citizens groups is that democracy suffers when U.S. Congress members prepare to leave officethat legislators are quick to satisfy pressure groups' requests in part because they anticipate being rewarded with financially compelling positions in those organizations once they leave office. But is this actually true? Focusing on 346 of the senators and representatives who left office during the 107th through 111th Congresses (January 2001 to January 2011), this book makes a counterintuitive argument: that job-seeking legislators provide stalwart service to citizens during their final term of office for fear of damaging their reputations and imperiling their post-Congressional career prospects. After an introductory chapter, author Matthew S. Dabros summarizes past research on political opportunism before discussing how nonelectoral constraints imposed by special interests (namely, diminished post-Congressional employment opportunities) actually encourage job-seeking legislators to provide quality representation to citizens even in their final term in office. The book also describes the nature and identifies the determinants of post-Congressional careers. The chapters use numerous contemporary examples and draw parallels to topics familiar to general readers to ensure that the book is highly accessible and interesting to nonspecialists.",Political Science,149,N/A,0,en

Multi-week travel diary data-sets and GPS observations are exciting sources of information for the description and modelling of the variability of individual travel patterns. Through an analysis of these strong new data sets, this book questions what are the most suitable methodological tools to represent the structures of long-term travel behaviour. It also examines what the data tells us about the travellers' motives and looks at how planning should translate the findings into forecasting tools and transport strategies. In doing so, the multifaceted and ambiguous character of daily life travel is revealed, illustrating how, while sound routines in time and space seem to dominate daily life, individuals show a considerable amount of variability and flexibility in travel and activity behaviour.",Political Science,249,N/A,0,en

Expanded coverage includes descriptions of overseas manufacturer's products and concepts, model-based optimization in control theory, new major inventions and innovations in control valves, and a full chapter devoted to safety. With more than 2000 graphs, figures, and tables, this all-inclusive encyclopedic volume replaces an entire library with one authoritative reference. The fourth edition brings the content of the previous editions completely up to date, incorporates the developments of the last decade, and broadens the horizons of the work from an American to a global perspective.

Tokyo Travel Sketchbook,Amaia Arrazola,Tuttle Publishing,2020-03-03,"Tokyo Travel Sketchbook traces the journey of illustrator and graphic designer Amaia Arrazola on a four-week trip through the beating heart of Tokyo. When Arrazola accepts a month long artist's residency in the Japanese capital, she has little idea of what to expect but gamely packs her paints and pencils and seizes the opportunity to create an illustrated diary of her time there, filling the pages of her sketchbooks with curious images of life in the world's largest city. This book provides readers with a unique vision of Japan's capital, as seen through the eyes of an artist. Arrazola immerses herself in the cult of Hello Kitty and the pop-eyed charms of ""Kawaii"" cute culture, while conveying the collision of traditional and modern Japanese culture in the female Samurais she meets and draws. The city's cultural curiosities come alive in a metropolis that is ever on the go, as she browses sex shops, drinks pink coffee, eats spaghetti sandwiches and photographs subway sleepers. Throughout her explorations, Arrazola uses the concept of wabi sabi as a guiding principle--coming to see her own life and artworks as examples of ""flawed beauty"" and imperfectly perfect Zen design. The result is a fresh, often funny, one-of-a-kind look at a city that works hard and plays hard--in many surprising ways. At the heart of Tokyo Travel Sketchbook are two contradictory Japans--the glittering neon world of a high-tech ultramodern society existing side-by-side with a nation where ancient tradition holds sway and where the unadorned, the simple and the silent are prized and celebrated as much as the new, the fashionable and the trendy. These competing realities make for a memorable visual journey and a stunning souvenir of a stranger's brief stay in a strange land. From smoking laws to high-tech toilets, Arrazola finds beauty in the weirdness and imperfection of this modern metropolis. *Recommended for readers ages 14 & up*",Travel,197,N/A,0,en

Time Travel,James Gleick,Vintage,2017-09-05,"Best Books of 2016 BOSTON GLOBE * THE ATLANTIC From the acclaimed bestselling author of The Information and Chaos comes this enthralling history of time travel—a concept that has preoccupied physicists and storytellers over the course of the last century. James Gleick delivers a mind-bending exploration of time travel—from its origins in literature and science to its influence on our understanding of time itself. Gleick vividly explores physics, technology, philosophy, and art as each relates to time travel and tells the story of the concept's cultural evolutions—from H.G. Wells to Doctor Who, from Proust to Woody Allen. He takes a close look at the porous boundary between science fiction and modern physics, and, finally, delves into what it all means in our own moment in time—the world of the instantaneous, with its all-consuming present and vanishing future.",History,354,N/A,0,en

The Sea in World History [2 volumes],Stephen K. Stein,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2017-04-24,"This two-volume set documents the essential role of the sea and maritime activity across history, from travel and food production to commerce and conquest. In all eras, water transport has served as the cheapest and most efficient means of moving cargo and people over any significant distance. Only relatively recently have railroads and aircraft provided an alternative. Most of the world's bulk goods continue to travel primarily by ship over water. Even today, 95 percent of the cargo that enters and leaves the United States does so by ship. Similarly, people around the world rely on the sea for food, and in recent years, the sea has become an important source of oil and other resources, with the longterm effects of our continuing efforts to extract resources from the sea further highlighting environmental concerns that range from pollution to the exhaustion of fish stocks. This chronologically organized two-volume reference addresses the history of the sea, beginning with ancient civilizations (4000 to 1000 BCE) and ending with the modern era (1945 to the present day). Each of the eight chapters is further broken down into sections that focus on specific nations or regions, offering detailed descriptions of that area of the world and shorter entries on specific topics, individuals, and events. The book spans maritime history, covering major seafaring peoples and nations; famous explorers, travelers, and commanders; events, battles, and wars; key technologies, including famous ships; important processes and ongoing events, such as piracy and the slave trade; and more. Readers will benefit from dozens of primary source documents—ranging from ancient Egyptian tales of seafaring to texts by renowned travelers like Marco Polo, Zheng He, and Ibn Battuta—that provide firsthand accounts from the age of discovery as well as accounts of battle from World War I and II and more modern accounts of the sea.",History,856,N/A,0,en

Avelynn,Marissa Campbell,Macmillan,2015-09-08,"This dazzling debut brings the Dark Ages to light and illuminates one Saxon noblewoman's romance with a Viking warrior and her struggle to find her path in a changing and dangerous world 869. For eighteen years, Avelynn, the beautiful and secretly pagan daughter of the Ealdorman of Somerset, has lived in an environment of love, acceptance, and equality. Somerset has flourished under twenty years of peace. But with whispers of war threatening their security, Avelynn's father makes an uncompromising decision that changes her life forever. Forced into a betrothal with Demas, a man who only covets her wealth and status, Avelynn's perception of independence is shattered. With marriage looming, she turns to her faith, searching for answers in an ancient ritual along the coast, only to find Alrik The Blood-Axe and sixty Viking berserkers have landed. In a year of uncertainty that sees Avelynn discover hidden powers, stumble into a passionate love affair with Alrik, and lead men into battle, Avelynn must walk a fine line as her deceptions mount and Demas' tactics to possess her become more desperate and increasingly brutal. Avelynn and Alrik are caught in the throes of fate as they struggle to find the way back to themselves and onwards to each other.",Fiction,349,N/A,0,en

Live No Lies,John Mark Comer,WaterBrook,2021-09-28,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • The bestselling author of The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry equips readers to recognize and resist the lies that seek to rob them of peace and freedom. “Live No Lies is brilliant, deep, scriptural, and will equip you to face the enemy and fight.”—Jennie Allen, New York Times bestselling author of Get Out of Your Head We are at war. Not with a foreign government or domestic terrorists or a creepy new artificial intelligence hell-bent on taking over the world. No, it’s a war we feel deep inside our own chests: we are at war with lies. The problem isn’t so much that we tell lies but that we live them. We let them into our bodies, and they sabotage our peace. All around us in the culture and deep within our own body memories are lies: deceptive ideas that wreak havoc on our emotional health and spiritual well-being, and deceptive ideas about who God is, who we are, and what the good life truly is. The choice is not whether to fight or not fight, but whether we win or surrender. Ancient apprentices of Jesus developed a paradigm for this war; they spoke of the three enemies of the soul: the devil, the flesh, and the world. Live No Lies taps into this ancient wisdom from saints of the Way and translates the three enemies for the modern era, with all its secularism and sophistication. As a generation, we chuckle at the devil as a premodern myth, we are confused by Scripture’s teaching on the flesh in an age where sensual indulgence is a virtue not a vice, and we have little to no category for the New Testament concept of the world. In this provocative and practical book, bestselling author John Mark Comer combines cultural analysis with spiritual formation. He identifies the role lies play in our spiritual deformation and lays out a strategic plan to overcome them. Do you feel the tug-of-war in your own heart, the inner conflict between truth and lies? The spirit and the flesh? The Way of Jesus and the world? It’s time to start winning. It’s time to live no lies...",Religion,337,N/A,0,en

Earth Is My Witness,Art Wolfe,Mandala Publishing,2017-10-31,"Art Wolfe’s definitive opus, Earth Is My Witness represents forty years of expeditionary photography. For the first time, Wolfe presents the three subjects at the heart of his work—landscapes, wildlife, and cultures on the edge of extinction—in a single masterpiece that takes us through the world’s ecosystems and geographical regions in a vivid display of the fragility and interconnectivity of life on Earth, while simultaneously exploring his evolution as an artist and the techniques he uses to capture the nuances and rhythms of nature. Earth Is My Witness is the most extensive collection of Art Wolfe photography ever compiled. This lavishly produced work spans the globe, bringing the beauty of the planet’s fast-disappearing landscapes, wildlife, and cultures into stunning focus. Containing unpublished work from throughout Wolfe’s widely celebrated career, Earth Is My Witness offers a riveting and comprehensive look at the world’s ecosystems and geographical regions. Here Wolfe presents an encyclopedic selection of his photography along with intimate stories that exemplify his boundless curiosity. From the rich sights and smells of the Pushkar Camel Fair to the exact moment when a polar bear and her cubs leave their Arctic den, these images represent what Wolfe has lived for: moments when circumstance, light, and subject miraculously collide to form an iconic image. These photographs and the stories behind them explore the delicate interconnectivity of life across our planet. Setting the stage for this fascinating journey is award-winning author Wade Davis. Together, photographer and author present a world that borders on the fantastic but is all the more precious for its fragility. At the heart of Wolfe’s work is the appeal for environmental, cultural, and wildlife preservation, which he makes with beautiful, far-reaching precision in this definitive opus.",Photography,0,N/A,0,en

Cast adrift in time in this idyllic Midwestern town she is set upon a course of “rehabilitation”—but cannot resist falling in love with a fellow exile and questioning the constrains of the Wainscotia world with results that are both devastating and liberating. Arresting and visionary, Hazards of Time Travel is both a novel of harrowing discovery and an exquisitely wrought love story that may be Joyce Carol Oates’s most unexpected novel so far.",Fiction,310,N/A,0,en

You Are Not a Rock,Mark Freeman,Penguin,2018-09-04,"Mental health is . . . being yourself. A prescriptive and positive guide, illustrated with line drawings, making the case that mental well-being, like physical health, can be strengthened over time and with specific techniques We all want to feel less anxiety, guilt, anger and sadness. We want to obsess less and be less lonely, free ourselves from our demons, compulsive habits, and stress. But as humans (unlike rocks) we experience all of these. And paradoxically, trying to avoid and control them only makes things worse. Having struggled with serious mental illness for many years himself, Mark Freeman has become a dedicated mental-health advocate and coach. He makes the case that instead of trying to feel less and avoid pain and stress, we need to build emotional fitness, especially our capacity for strength, balance and focus. With wit, compassion, and depth of experience and anecdotes, he shows that we can recover from many mental disorders, from mild to very serious, at all ages and stages of life, and even if other methods have failed. Freeman's innovative approach makes use of a range of therapeutic techniques, mindfulness training, peer support, humor, and common sense.",Psychology,274,N/A,0,en

Questions of Travel,Caren Kaplan,Duke University Press,1996-08-21,"Contemporary theory is replete with metaphors of travel—displacement, diaspora, borders, exile, migration, nomadism, homelessness, and tourism to name a few. In Questions of Travel, Caren Kaplan explores the various metaphoric uses of travel and displacement in literary and feminist theory, traces the political implications of this “traveling theory,” and shows how various discourses of displacement link, rather than separate, modernism and postmodernism. Addressing a wide range of writers, including Paul Fussell, Edward Said, James Clifford, Gilles Deleuze, Jean Baudrillard, Gayatri Spivak, Edward Soja, Doreen Massey, Chandra Mohanty, and Adrienne Rich, Kaplan demonstrates that symbols and metaphors of travel are used in ways that obscure key differences of power between nationalities, classes, races, and genders. Neither rejecting nor dismissing the powerful testimony of individual experiences of modern exile or displacement, Kaplan asks how mystified metaphors of travel might be avoided. With a focus on theory’s colonial discourses, she reveals how these metaphors continue to operate in the seemingly liberatory critical zones of poststructuralism and feminist theory. The book concludes with a critique of the politics of location as a form of essentialist identity politics and calls for new feminist geographies of place and displacement.",Literary Criticism,258,N/A,0,en

Rudy's Rules for Travel,Mary K. Jensen,Simon and Schuster,2018-04-10,"Most honeymoons, Mary knows, do not start this way. Lying outside on the sloping attic roof in Edinburgh, listening to the soft snores of her groom, she realizes that Rudy’s number one rule, “adapt,"" once again reigns. Rudy’s Rules for Travel takes you across the twentieth-century globe with intrepid, frugal Rudy and his spouse Mary, a catastrophic thinker seeking comfort. Whether stalled in a Spanish car tunnel, stranded atop a runaway elephant, or held at rifle-point at a Soviet border, Rudy has a rule for every occasion—for example, “Relax, some kind stranger will appear.” Mary, meanwhile, has her deep breathing and her own commandment: “Expect the worst.” The two are a picture of contrast. As Mary was being born, Rudy was a new American citizen flying US Air Force missions over his homeland, Germany. His father was a seaman, hers an accountant. And when this marriage of opposites goes traveling, their stories combine laugh-out-loud humor with poignant lessons from the odyssey of a World War II veteran.

For more than two decades, Ronna Welsh has been empowering home cooks and chefs with radically simple strategies for cooking creatively and efficiently. In this sweeping masterwork with 400 recipes, she shows how to make varied, impromptu, economical, and delicious meals by coaxing the most flavor from common ingredients.

The rule-based approach has been used extensively in the development of artificial intelligence systems, such as expert systems and machine learning. This rule-based programming technique has been applied in such diverse fields as medical diagnostic systems, insurance and banking systems, as well as automated design and configuration systems. Rule-based programming is also helpful in bridging the semantic gap between an application and a program, allowing domain specialists to understand programs and participate more closely in their development. Over sixty programs are presented and all programs are available from an ftp site. Many of these programs are presented in several versions allowing the reader to see how realistic programs are elaborated from `back of envelope' models. Metaprogramming is also presented as a technique for bridging the `semantic gap'. Rule-Based Programming will be of interest to programmers, systems analysts and other developers of expert systems as well as to researchers and practitioners in artificial intelligence, computer science professionals and educators.",Computers,317,N/A,0,en

Davis",Elsevier,2019-10-26,"Mapping the Travel Behavior Genome covers the latest research on the biological, motivational, cognitive, situational, and dispositional factors that drive activity-travel behavior. Organized into three sections, Retrospective and Prospective Survey of Travel Behavior Research, New Research Methods and Findings, and Future Research, the chapters of this book provide evidence of progress made in the most recent years in four dimensions of the travel behavior genome. These dimensions are Substantive Problems, Theoretical and Conceptual Frameworks, Behavioral Measurement, and Behavioral Analysis. Including the movement of goods as well as the movement of people, the book shows how traveler values, norms, attitudes, perceptions, emotions, feelings, and constraints lead to observed behavior; how to design efficient infrastructure and services to meet tomorrow's needs for accessibility and mobility; how to assess equity and distributional justice; and how to assess and implement policies for improving sustainability and quality of life. Mapping the Travel Behavior Genome examines the paradigm shift toward more dynamic, user-centric, demand-responsive transport services, including the ""sharing economy,"" mobility as a service, automation, and robotics.

Solving the 111-Year-Old Riddle,Bimal. G,Notion Press,2018-04-18,"Bimal G’s book ‘Solving the 111-Year-Old Riddle’ opens an unexplored window of physics for the readers. Through this book, the author has aimed to solve the riddles generated by the theories of relativity and quantum mechanics. He believes that something is oddly wrong with the explanations and interpretations of these most celebrated theories even though the equations and its predictions are perfect and powerful. Puzzling paradoxes and logic-defying ideas had confounded the realm of physics ever since the formulation of special theory of relativity in 1905. By flouting reality, the theory of quantum mechanics too challenged common sense. Both these theories failed to give rational explanations to various natural phenomena. This book is a bold attempt to demystify the theories of relativity and quantum mechanics, which seem besotted with mathematical formalism than logical reasoning. It seeks to unite the two strong pillars of physics, fix the inconsistencies between them, and fill in the missing link by giving a new avatar to absolute space and time. In the process, the author puts forth a revolutionary new theory that removes paradoxes in the realm of physics, redefines the puzzling inertia and explains the riddling dark matter & dark energy along with other natural phenomena and scientific experiments.",Science,189,N/A,0,en
Methodological Developments in Data Linkage,"Katie Harron, Harvey Goldstein, Chris Dibben",John Wiley & Sons,2015-09-22,"A comprehensive compilation of new developments in data linkage methodology The increasing availability of large administrative databases has led to a dramatic rise in the use of data linkage, yet the standard texts on linkage are still those which describe the seminal work from the 1950-60s, with some updates. Linkage and analysis of data across sources remains problematic due to lack of discriminatory and accurate identifiers, missing data and regulatory issues. Recent developments in data linkage methodology have concentrated on bias and analysis of linked data, novel approaches to organising relationships between databases and privacy-preserving linkage. Methodological Developments in Data Linkage brings together a collection of contributions from members of the international data linkage community, covering cutting edge methodology in this field. It presents opportunities and challenges provided by linkage of large and often complex datasets, including analysis problems, legal and security aspects, models for data access and the development of novel research areas. New methods for handling uncertainty in analysis of linked data, solutions for anonymised linkage and alternative models for data collection are also discussed. Key Features: Presents cutting edge methods for a topic of increasing importance to a wide range of research areas, with applications to data linkage systems internationally Covers the essential issues associated with data linkage today Includes examples based on real data linkage systems, highlighting the opportunities, successes and challenges that the increasing availability of linkage data provides Novel approach incorporates technical aspects of both linkage, management and analysis of linked data This book will be of core interest to academics, government employees, data holders, data managers, analysts and statisticians who use administrative data. It will also appeal to researchers in a variety of areas, including epidemiology, biostatistics, social statistics, informatics, policy and public health.",Medical,288,5,1,en

Rowling have deployed veterans to explore questions that are simultaneously personal, political, and philosophical: What does a community owe to those who serve it? What can be recovered from the past? Do people stay the same over time? Are there right times of life at which to do certain things? Is there value in experience? How can wisdom be shared? Veteran Poetics features veterans who travel in time, cause havoc with their reappearances, solve murders, refuse to stop talking about the wars they have been in, and refuse to say a word about them.

Utah in the Twentieth Century,"Brian Q. Cannon, Jessie L. Embry",University Press of Colorado,2009-06-15,"The twentieth could easily be Utah’s most interesting, complex century, yet popular ideas of what is history seem mired in the nineteenth. One reason may be the lack of readily available writing on more recent Utah history. This collection of essays shifts historical focus forward to the twentieth, which began and ended with questions of Utah’s fit with the rest of the nation. In between was an extended period of getting acquainted in an uneasy but necessary marriage, which was complicated by the push of economic development and pull of traditional culture, demand for natural resources from a fragile and scenic environment, and questions of who governs and how, who gets a vote, and who controls what is done on and to the contested public lands. Outside trade and a tourist economy increasingly challenged and fed an insular society. Activists left and right declaimed constitutional liberties while Utah’s Native Americans become the last enfranchised in the nation. Proud contributions to national wars contrasted with denial of deep dependence on federal money; the skepticism of provocative writers, with boosters eager for growth; and reflexive patriotism somehow bonded to ingrained distrust of federal government.",History,468,N/A,0,en

Boundary Integral Equations in Elasticity Theory,A.M. Linkov,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-11-11,"by the author to the English edition The book aims to present a powerful new tool of computational mechanics, complex variable boundary integral equations (CV-BIE). The book is conceived as a continuation of the classical monograph by N. I. Muskhelishvili into the computer era. Two years have passed since the Russian edition of the present book. We have seen growing interest in numerical simulation of media with internal structure, and have evidence of the potential of the new methods. The evidence was especially clear in problems relating to multiple grains, blocks, cracks, inclusions and voids. This prompted me, when preparing the English edition, to place more emphasis on such topics. The other change was inspired by Professor Graham Gladwell. It was he who urged me to abridge the chain of formulae and to increase the number of examples. Now the reader will find more examples showing the potential and advantages of the analysis. The first chapter of the book contains a simple exposition of the theory of real variable potentials, including the hypersingular potential and the hypersingular equations. This makes up for the absence of such exposition in current textbooks, and reveals important links between the real variable BIE and the complex variable counterparts. The chapter may also help readers who are learning or lecturing on the boundary element method.",Science,286,N/A,0,en

George Eliot in Context,Margaret Harris,Cambridge University Press,2013-05-30,"Prodigiously learned, alive to the massive social changes of her time, defiant of many Victorian orthodoxies, George Eliot has always challenged her readers. She is at once chronicler and analyst, novelist of nostalgia and monumental thinker. In her great novel Middlemarch she writes of 'that tempting range of relevancies called the universe'. This volume identifies a range of 'relevancies' that inform both her fictional and her non-fictional writings. The range and scale of her achievement are brought into focus by cogent essays on the many contexts - historical, intellectual, political, social, cultural - to her work. In addition there are discussions of her critical history and legacy, as well as of the material conditions of production and distribution of her novels and her journalism. The volume enables fuller understanding and appreciation, from a twenty-first-century standpoint, of the life and work of one of the nineteenth century's major writers.",Literary Criticism,367,N/A,0,en

'Tinkers',Mary Burke,OUP Oxford,2009-07-16,"The history of Irish Travellers is not analogous to that of the 'tinker', a Europe-wide underworld fantasy created by sixteenth-century British and continental Rogue Literature that came to be seen as an Irish character alone as English became dominant in Ireland. By the Revival, the tinker represented bohemian, pre-Celtic aboriginality, functioning as the cultural nationalist counter to the Victorian Gypsy mania. Long misunderstood as a portrayal of actual Travellers, J.M. Synge's influential The Tinker's Wedding was pivotal to this 'Irishing' of the tinker, even as it acknowledged that figure's cosmopolitan textual roots. Synge's empathetic depiction is closely examined, as are the many subsequent representations that looked to him as a model to subvert or emulate. In contrast to their Revival-era romanticization, post-independence writing portrayed tinkers as alien interlopers, while contemporaneous Unionists labelled them a contaminant from the hostile South. However, after Travellers politicized in the 1960s, more even-handed depictions heralded a querying of the 'tinker' fantasy that has shaped contemporary screen and literary representations of Travellers and has prompted Traveller writers to transubstantiate Otherness into the empowering rhetoric of ethnic difference. Though its Irish equivalent has oscillated between idealization and demonization, US racial history facilitates the cinematic figuring of the Irish-American Traveler as lovable 'white trash' rogue. This process is informed by the mythology of a population with whom Travelers are allied in the white American imagination, the Scots-Irish (Ulster-Scots). In short, the 'tinker' is much more central to Irish, Northern Irish and even Irish-American identity than is currently recognised.",Literary Criticism,342,N/A,0,en
From Babel to Dragomans,Bernard Lewis,Oxford University Press,2004-05-02,"Bernard Lewis is recognized around the globe as one of the leading authorities on Islam. Hailed as ""the world's foremost Islamic scholar"" (Wall Street Journal), as ""a towering figure among experts on the culture and religion of the Muslim world"" (Baltimore Sun), and as ""the doyen of Middle Eastern studies"" (New York Times), Lewis is nothing less than a national treasure, a trusted voice that politicians, journalists, historians, and the general public have all turned to for insight into the Middle East. Now, this revered authority has brought together writings and lectures that he has written over four decades, featuring his reflections on Middle Eastern history and foreign affairs, the Iranian Revolution, the state of Israel, the writing of history, and much more. The essays cover such urgent and compelling topics as ""What Saddam Wrought,"" ""Deconstructing Osama and His Evil Appeal,"" ""The Middle East, Westernized Despite Itself,"" ""The Enemies of God,"" and ""Can Islam Be Secularized?"" The collection ranges from two English originals of articles published before only in foreign languages, to previously unpublished writings, to his highly regarded essays from publications such as Foreign Affairs and The New York Review of Books. With more than fifty pieces in all, plus a new introduction to the book by Lewis, this is a valuable collection for everyone interested in the Middle East. Here then is a rich repository of wisdom on one of the key areas of the modern world--a wealth of profound reflections on Middle Eastern history, culture, politics, and current events.",History,455,N/A,0,en

Water Supply Systems,"Cedo Maksimovic, Francesco Calomino, John Snoxell",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-04-17,"Technology now affects almost every aspect of Water Supply Management, Operation, Planning and Design; the speed of development means that assessing what is ""new"" is sometimes difficult. Old ideas can now be applied because of new technology; technology is now revealing problems that were unnoticed 10 years ago. Some emerging technologies promise much but are still underdeveloped for use in real world conditions, while we should always remember that ""new"" technology depends upon the state of development in respective countries, a point which is particularly relevant to the NATO Advanced Study Institute, for which this book has been produced. Thus our objective in producing the book has been to highlight, in a wide range of technical areas, where and how technology is being applied, what is ""new"" and what the limitations of these technologies are in the real world. We have also tried to provide an European and American perspective where possible to illustrate how problems are tackled in different cultural environments.

Travel in Twentieth-Century French and Francophone Cultures,Charles Forsdick,OUP Oxford,2005-05-19,"This book is one of the first studies of twentieth-century travel literature in French, tracking the form from the colonial past to the postcolonial present. Whereas most recent explorations of travel literature have addressed English-language material, Forsdick's study complements these by presenting a body of material that has previously attracted little attention, ranging from conventional travel writing to other cultural phenomena (such as the Colonial Exposition of 1931) in which changing attitudes to travel are apparent. Travel in Twentieth-Century French and Francophone Cultures explores the evolution of attitudes to cultural diversity, explaining how each generation seems simultaneously to foretell the collapse and reinvention of 'elsewhere'. It also follows the progressive renegotiation of understandings of travel (and travel literature) across the twentieth century, focusing in particular on the emergence of travel narratives from France's former colonies. The book suggests that an exclusive colonial understanding of travel as a practice defined along the lines of class, gender, and ethnicity has slowly been transformed so that travel has become an enabling figure - encapsulated in notions such as James Clifford's 'traveling cultures' - central to analyses of contemporary global culture. Engaging initially with Victor Segalen's early twentieth-century reflection on travel and exoticism and Albert Kahn's 'Archives de la Planète', Forsdick goes on to examine a series of interrelated texts and phenomena: early African travel narratives, inter-war ethnography, post-war accounts of Citroën 2CV journeys, the travel stories of immigrant workers, the work of Nicholas Bouvier and the Pour une littérature voyageuse movement, narratives of recent walking journeys, and contemporary Polynesian literature. In delineating a francophone space stretching far beyond metropolitan France itself, the book contributes to new understandings of French and Francophone Studies, and will also be of interest to those interested in issues of comparatism as well as colonial and postcolonial culture and identity.",Literary Criticism,282,N/A,0,en

A Course in Networks and Markets,Rafael Pass,MIT Press,2019-04-16,"A graduate-level, mathematically rigorous introduction to strategic behavior in a networked world. This introductory graduate-level text uses tools from game theory and graph theory to examine the role of network structures and network effects in economic and information markets. The goal is for students to develop an intuitive and mathematically rigorous understanding of how strategic agents interact in a connected world. The text synthesizes some of the central results in the field while also simplifying their treatment to make them more accessible to nonexperts. Thus, students at the introductory level will gain an understanding of key ideas in the field that are usually only taught at the advanced graduate level. The book introduces basic concepts from game theory and graph theory as well as some fundamental algorithms for exploring graphs. These tools are then applied to analyze strategic interactions over social networks, to explore different types of markets and mechanisms for networks, and to study the role of beliefs and higher-level beliefs (beliefs about beliefs). Specific topics discussed include coordination and contagion on social networks, traffic networks, matchings and matching markets, exchange networks, auctions, voting, web search, models of belief and knowledge, and how beliefs affect auctions and markets. An appendix offers a “Primer on Probability.” Mathematically rigorous, the text assumes a level of mathematical maturity (comfort with definitions and proofs) in the reader.",Computers,263,N/A,0,en

The Sweet Life in Paris,David Lebovitz,Crown,2009-05-05,"From the New York Times bestselling author of My Paris Kitchen and L'Appart, a deliciously funny, offbeat, and irreverent look at the city of lights, cheese, chocolate, and other confections. Like so many others, David Lebovitz dreamed about living in Paris ever since he first visited the city and after a nearly two-decade career as a pastry chef and cookbook author, he finally moved to Paris to start a new life. Having crammed all his worldly belongings into three suitcases, he arrived, hopes high, at his new apartment in the lively Bastille neighborhood. But he soon discovered it's a different world en France. From learning the ironclad rules of social conduct to the mysteries of men's footwear, from shopkeepers who work so hard not to sell you anything to the etiquette of working the right way around the cheese plate, here is David's story of how he came to fall in love with—and even understand—this glorious, yet sometimes maddening, city. When did he realize he had morphed into un vrai parisien? It might have been when he found himself considering a purchase of men's dress socks with cartoon characters on them. Or perhaps the time he went to a bank with 135 euros in hand to make a 134-euro payment, was told the bank had no change that day, and thought it was completely normal. Or when he found himself dressing up to take out the garbage because he had come to accept that in Paris appearances and image mean everything. Once you stop laughing, the more than fifty original recipes, for dishes both savory and sweet, such as Pork Loin with Brown Sugar–Bourbon Glaze, Braised Turkey in Beaujolais Nouveau with Prunes, Bacon and Bleu Cheese Cake, Chocolate-Coconut Marshmallows, Chocolate Spice Bread, Lemon-Glazed Madeleines, and Mocha–Crème Fraîche Cake, will have you running to the kitchen for your own taste of Parisian living.",Travel,306,4,18,en

Stony the Road,"Henry Louis Gates, Jr.",Penguin,2019-04-02,"“Stony the Road presents a bracing alternative to Trump-era white nationalism. . . . In our current politics we recognize African-American history—the spot under our country’s rug where the terrorism and injustices of white supremacy are habitually swept. Stony the Road lifts the rug."" —Nell Irvin Painter, New York Times Book Review A profound new rendering of the struggle by African-Americans for equality after the Civil War and the violent counter-revolution that resubjugated them, by the bestselling author of The Black Church and The Black Box. The abolition of slavery in the aftermath of the Civil War is a familiar story, as is the civil rights revolution that transformed the nation after World War II. But the century in between remains a mystery: if emancipation sparked ""a new birth of freedom"" in Lincoln's America, why was it necessary to march in Martin Luther King, Jr.'s America? In this new book, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., one of our leading chroniclers of the African-American experience, seeks to answer that question in a history that moves from the Reconstruction Era to the ""nadir"" of the African-American experience under Jim Crow, through to World War I and the Harlem Renaissance. Through his close reading of the visual culture of this tragic era, Gates reveals the many faces of Jim Crow and how, together, they reinforced a stark color line between white and black Americans. Bringing a lifetime of wisdom to bear as a scholar, filmmaker, and public intellectual, Gates uncovers the roots of structural racism in our own time, while showing how African Americans after slavery combatted it by articulating a vision of a ""New Negro"" to force the nation to recognize their humanity and unique contributions to America as it hurtled toward the modern age. The story Gates tells begins with great hope, with the Emancipation Proclamation, Union victory, and the liberation of nearly 4 million enslaved African-Americans. Until 1877, the federal government, goaded by the activism of Frederick Douglass and many others, tried at various turns to sustain their new rights. But the terror unleashed by white paramilitary groups in the former Confederacy, combined with deteriorating economic conditions and a loss of Northern will, restored ""home rule"" to the South. The retreat from Reconstruction was followed by one of the most violent periods in our history, with thousands of black people murdered or lynched and many more afflicted by the degrading impositions of Jim Crow segregation. An essential tour through one of America's fundamental historical tragedies, Stony the Road is also a story of heroic resistance, as figures such as W. E. B. Du Bois and Ida B. Wells fought to create a counter-narrative, and culture, inside the lion's mouth. As sobering as this tale is, it also has within it the inspiration that comes with encountering the hopes our ancestors advanced against the longest odds.",History,322,N/A,0,en

The Evolution of Travel Time Information Systems,Margarita Martínez-Díaz,Springer Nature,2022-01-21,"This book deals with the estimation of travel time in a very comprehensive and exhaustive way. Travel time information is and will continue to be one key indicator of the quality of service of a road network and a highly valued knowledge for drivers. Moreover, travel times are key inputs for comprehensive traffic management systems. All the above-mentioned aspects are covered in this book. The first chapters expound on the different types of travel time information that traffic management centers work with, their estimation, their utility and their dissemination. They also remark those aspects in which this information should be improved, especially considering future cooperative driving environments.Next, the book introduces and validates two new methodologies designed to improve current travel time information systems, which additionally have a high degree of applicability: since they use data from widely disseminated sources, they could be immediately implemented by many administrations without the need for large investments. Finally, travel times are addressed in the context of dynamic traffic management systems. The evolution of these systems in parallel with technological and communication advancements is thoroughly discussed. Special attention is paid to data analytics and models, including data-driven approaches, aimed at understanding and predicting travel patterns in urban scenarios. Additionally, the role of dynamic origin-to-destination matrices in these schemes is analyzed in detail.",Technology & Engineering,299,N/A,0,en

Political and Judicial Rights through the Prism of Religious Belief,"Carl Sterkens, Hans-Georg Ziebertz",Springer,2018-10-24,"This innovative volume is focused on the relationship between religion on the one hand and political and judicial rights on the other. At a time when the so-called ‘checks and balances’ that guarantee the vulnerable equilibrium between legislative, executive and judicial branches of governance are increasingly under pressure, this book offers valuable insights. It presents empirical work that has measured young people’s attitudes and explains the variety found across their views. Readers will find answers to the question: To what extent do youths in different countries support political and judicial human rights and what influences their attitudes towards these rights? The political rights in this question include, among others, active and passive voting right, the right to protest, and the rights of refugees. Judicial rights refer in general to the right of a fair trial, and include principles like equality before the law; the right to independent and impartial judgement; the presumption of innocence; the right to legal counsel; and the privilege against self-incrimination. Expert contributing authors look at aspects such as religious beliefs and practices, personal evaluation of state authorities, and personality characteristics. The authors discuss contextual determinants for attitudes towards political and judicial rights, in both theory and empirical indicators. Numerous helpful tables and figures support the written word. This book makes an original contribution to research through the empirical clarification of factors that induce or reduce people’s support of political and judicial rights. It will appeal to graduates and researchers in religious studies, philosophy or sociology of religion, among other disciplines, but it will also interest the general reader who is concerned with matters of human rights and social justice.",Social Science,314,N/A,0,en

Basic Naval Architecture,Philip A. Wilson,Springer,2018-02-09,"This textbook provides readers with an understanding of the basics of ship stability as it has been enacted in international law. The assessment of ship stability has evolved considerably since the first SOLAS convention after the sinking of the RMS Titanic, and this book enables readers to familiarise themselves with the most up-to-date modern day methodology, as well as looking ahead to the effects on ship design over the next fifty years. The author not only explains the methodology of probabilistic ship damage as required by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), but also details the new requirements to assess certain sizes and classes of ships to the seven second-generation ship stability requirements. Many textbooks that are currently used by undergraduates focus on the geometric-centric deterministic approach to the assessment of ship stability, whereas this book also includes material on the classes of ships that are now required to have probabilistic ship damage assessment, as has only recently been agreed by the IMO. Basic Naval Architecture: Ship Stability contains up-to-date information, making it ideal for university students studying ocean or marine engineering, as well as being of interest to students on naval architecture and ship science courses. Highly illustrated and including chapter studies for ease of learning, the book is an ideal one-volume textbook for students.",Science,215,N/A,0,en

New Dynamics in Old Age,"Hans-Werner Wahl, Clemens Tesch-Romer, Dr. Andreas Hoff, Jon Hendricks",Routledge,2017-07-05,"This book was nurtured by the belief that the new dynamics of today's and tomorrow's aging has not yet been treated well in the gerontology literature. Several questions drove the choice of substance for the book: What kind of new dynamics of aging deserves consideration? What kinds of theories and fields are at the core of treating such a new dynamics? And what kind of empirical evidence should be considered? The master hypothesis on which the book is based maintains that the new dynamics of old age is best observed in a range of everyday aging contexts that have been undergoing major change since the second half of the 20th century. In particular, five areas of new and persistent dynamics are treated in depth: the social environment, with a focus on cohort effects in social relations and the consideration of family relations and elders as care redelivers; the home environment, with emphasis on housing and quality of life, relocation and urban aging issues; the outdoor environment, with consideration of out-of-home activity patterns, car-driving behaviour and the leisure world of aging; the technological environment, with treatments of the role of the Internet and the potential of technology for aging outcomes and; and the societal environment with a focus on global aging, the new politics of old age and older persons as market consumers. The book's main purpose is to provide the scholarly gerontology community with a comprehensive and critical discussion of these new trends related to old age. The book will be of interest for the scholarly community of gerontology in a variety of disciplines; sociology, psychology, demography, epidemiology, humanities, social policy and geriatrics; students in gerontology education and in the disciplines named above who have an interest in aging issues (graduate level); professionals in practical and applied fields related to aging such as community and urban planners, health and care providers and policymakers; people involved in senior citizens' organizations and those in industry who wish to serve older people with new products.",Psychology,721,N/A,0,en

Influencer Marketing Applications Within the Metaverse,"Bansal, Rohit, Qalati, Sikandar Ali, Chakir, Aziza",IGI Global,2023-05-22,"The metaverse is an immersive digital world that combines augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) to allow people to interact online as if they were in the physical world. While everything in the metaverse doesn’t exist in the physical world, it still offers unique opportunities for customers to experience your brand. The metaverse is free from physical limitations, presenting a novel opportunity for brands. Just as e-commerce revolutionized the way people shop, so could the metaverse. And by taking advantage of the metaverse's ability to bridge the gap between physical and virtual commerce, brands can use it to enrich their consumers' shopping experiences. To be successful, brands must quickly learn from mistakes and build on successful campaigns to stand out. The metaverse is data-driven, and marketers can use this in creating their growth strategies. Because growth marketing involves continuous experimentation and testing, brands can use this virtual world as their stomping ground to analyze their various marketing campaigns and observe consumer behavior. Influencer Marketing Applications Within the Metaverse explores how enterprises experimenting with the metaverse can connect, engage with, and incentivize human and machine customers to create new value exchanges, revenue streams, and markets. The book examines how brands can enrich their consumers’ shopping experiences by taking advantage of the metaverse's ability to bridge the gap between physical and virtual commerce.

While the Earth Sleeps We Travel,Ahmed M. Badr,Andrews McMeel Publishing,2020-10-13,"Beginning in 2018, Ahmed M. Badr—an Iraqi-American poet and former refugee—traveled to Greece, Trinidad & Tobago, and Syracuse, New York, holding storytelling workshops with hundreds of displaced youth: those living in and outside of camps, as well as those adjusting to life after resettlement. Combining Badr’s own poetry with the personal narratives and creative contributions of dozens of young refugees, While the Earth Sleeps We Travel seeks to center and amplify the often unheard perspectives of those navigating through and beyond the complexities of displacement. The result is a diverse and moving collection—a meditation on the concept of ""home"" and a testament to the power of storytelling.",Poetry,176,N/A,0,en

The Study of the Diffusion of Gases Or Aerosols in the Lower Atmosphere,"H. E. Cramer, Frank Record, H. C. Vaughan",N/A,1958,"The principal objectives of the research described in this report have been to achieve improved understanding of the basic physical processes involved in the dispersal of airborne material in the lower atmosphere; and, to establish empirical relationships between basic diffusion parameters and direct meteorological indicators that permit satisfactory quantitative estimates of dispersal from continuous point sources, over travel distances of the order of 1 km, in a wide variety of general weather conditions. These objectives have been achieved largely as the result of a series of comprehensive field observations involving simultaneous measurements both of diffusion and the structure of atmospheric turbulence. The diffusion measurements comprise 10-min average concentrations of sulfur-dioxide gas emitted from a continuous point source near ground level, at travel distances from 50 to 800 m from the release-point for the tracer. The meteorological observations include mean wind speeds, frequency distributions of azimuth oLnd direction, vertical profiles of wind speed and air temperature, and measurements of the fluctuations in wind velocity obtained from bivanes and heatedthermocouple anemometers. Over one hundred individual experiments of this type were carried out at Round Hill and at a field site near O'Neill, Nebraska during Project Prairie Grass, an extensive series of diffusion measurements sponsored by the Air Force Cambridge Research Center during the summer of 1956. These data comprise the most comprehensive set of small-scale diffusion and meteorological observations currently available. They provide a fairly complete picture of the probable variations in basic diffusion parameters over travel distances of the order of 1 km in all conditions of thermal stratification ...",Atmospheric diffusion,312,N/A,0,en

Geological and Geophysical Observations in an Abyssal Hill Area Using a Deeply Towed Instrument Package,Bruce Peter Luyendyk,N/A,1969,"In order to study the smaller scale geological and geophysical phenomena of the deep ocean floor near-bottom observations have been made over two north-south trending abyssal hills in the northeast Pacific. The study area is located in a region of magnetic lineations 130 kilometers south of the Murray Fracture Zone (vicinity 32 deg 25'N, 125 deg 45'W). The hill on the west is an elongate shield volcano, while the eastern hill is a block fault (horst) structure. The hills have a variable sediment cover that is thickest in the valley between them. The horizontal variation in sediment thickness is affected primarily by continuous down-slope transport of sediments resuspended by burrowers; and further, by covering of the sedimentary section by lava flows, trapping of sediments in local depressions and base levels, non-deposition or erosion due to spatially varying bottom currents, and mass movement. Measurements of the relative sedimentation rate show that it is presently up to twice as high in the valley as on the adjacent highs. The magnetic anomalies measured at depth are lineated parallel to the bottom topography and the anomalies at the ocean surface. Magnetic model studies suggest that they are caused by a magnetization within the second layer that varies smoothly in a direction perpendicular to the lineations. Empirical evidence from other authors suggests that paleofield fluctuations, frozen into the crust as it is created at the crests of oceanic rises, are the most likely cause.

Hydrothermal Processes Above the Yellowstone Magma Chamber,"Lisa A. Morgan, Wayne C. Shanks, Kenneth Lee Pierce",N/A,2009,"Hydrothermal explosions are violent and dramatic events resulting in the rapid ejection of boiling water, steam, mud, and rock fragments from source craters that range from a few meters up to more than 2 km in diameter; associated breccia can be emplaced as much as 3 to 4 km from the largest craters. Hydrothermal explosions occur where shallow interconnected reservoirs of steam- and liquid-saturated fluids with temperatures at or near the boiling curve underlie thermal fields. Sudden reduction in confining pressure causes fluids to flash to steam, resulting in significant expansion, rock fragmentation, and debris ejection. In Yellowstone, hydrothermal explosions are a potentially significant hazard for visitors and facilities and can damage or even destroy thermal features. The breccia deposits and associated craters formed from hydrothermal explosions are mapped as mostly Holocene (the Mary Bay deposit is older) units throughout Yellowstone National Park (YNP) and are spatially related to within the 0.64-Ma Yellowstone caldera and along the active Norris-Mammoth tectonic corridor.",Nature,108,N/A,0,en

The Medieval Invention of Travel,Shayne Aaron Legassie,University of Chicago Press,2017-04-12,"Over the course of the Middle Ages, the economies of Europe, Asia, and northern Africa became more closely integrated, fostering the international and intercontinental journeys of merchants, pilgrims, diplomats, missionaries, and adventurers. During a time in history when travel was often difficult, expensive, and fraught with danger, these wayfarers composed accounts of their experiences in unprecedented numbers and transformed traditional conceptions of human mobility. Exploring this phenomenon, The Medieval Invention of Travel draws on an impressive array of sources to develop original readings of canonical figures such as Marco Polo, John Mandeville, and Petrarch, as well as a host of lesser-known travel writers. As Shayne Aaron Legassie demonstrates, the Middle Ages inherited a Greco-Roman model of heroic travel, which viewed the ideal journey as a triumph over temptation and bodily travail. Medieval travel writers revolutionized this ancient paradigm by incorporating practices of reading and writing into the ascetic regime of the heroic voyager, fashioning a bold new conception of travel that would endure into modern times. Engaging methods and insights from a range of disciplines, The Medieval Invention of Travel offers a comprehensive account of how medieval travel writers and their audiences reshaped the intellectual and material culture of Europe for centuries to come.",Literary Criticism,317,N/A,0,en

He also believes he's received a message from God. The message: go back in time and save Jesus Christ from being crucified. When a secret mission involving one of his inventions goes horribly wrong, Rydel obsessively tries to learn what caused the system failure and, in doing so, stumbles upon a physics-bending ability to travel through time. Overworked and massively sleep-deprived, Rydel believes he has received a message from God—save God’s son. And the man of science embarks on a world-changing quest to rescue Jesus. As he covers his tracks to journey back undetected, he neglects to factor in the consequences of a devastating butterfly effect. And he’s terrified to discover The Unit, a highly-trained team of elite soldiers, is hunting him down to stop him from making choices that could upend all of human history. Will The Unit find Rydel before he alters the past? And, if they find him, can some members of the elite force be persuaded to join Rydel on his mission to save Jesus Christ from the cross? “Save Him combines the physics of chaos theory and the whiz-bang action of a techno thriller to fuel a military page-turner that tests the faith of everyone involved.” - Blue Ink Reviews “Every time I thought I had this book figured out a little bit it surprised me...and then did it again and again.” - Amazon Review",Fiction,277,N/A,0,en

"Advances in Social Media for Travel, Tourism and Hospitality","Marianna Sigala, Ulrike Gretzel",Routledge,2017-07-20,"This book brings together cutting edge research and applications of social media and related technologies, their uses by consumers and businesses in travel, tourism and hospitality. The first section addresses topical issues related to how social media influence the operations and strategies of tourism firms and help them enhance tourism experiences: open innovation, crowdsourcing, service-dominant logic, value co-creation, value co-destruction and augmented reality. The second section of the book looks at new applications of social media for marketing purposes in a variety of tourism-related sectors, addressing crowd-sourced campaigns, customer engagement and influencer marketing. The third section uses case studies and new methodologies to analyze travel review posting and consumption behaviors as well as the impact of social media on traveller perceptions and attitudes, with a focus on collaborative consumption and sharing economy accommodation. Finally, the fourth section focuses on hot topics and issues related to the analysis, interpretation and use of online information and user-generated content for deriving business intelligence and enhancing business decision-making. Written by an international body of well-known researchers, this book uses fresh theoretical lenses, perspectives and methodological approaches to look at the practical implications of social media for tourism suppliers, destinations, tourism policy makers and researchers alike. For these reasons, it will be a valuable resource for students, managers and academics with an interest in information and communication technologies, marketing for tourism and hospitality, and travel and transportation management.",Science,341,N/A,0,en

Travel and Imagination,"Garth Lean, Russell Staiff, Emma Waterton",Routledge,2016-02-24,"The imagination has long been associated with travel and tourism; from the seventeenth century when the showman and his peepshow box would take the village crowd to places, cities and lands through the power of stories, to today when we rely on a different range of boxes to whisk us away on our imaginative travels: the television, the cinema and the computer. Even simply the notion of travel, it would seem, gives us license to daydream. The imagination thus becomes a key concept that blurs the boundaries between our everyday lives and the idea of travel. Yet, despite what appears to be a close and comfortable link, there is an absence of scholarly material looking at travel and the imagination. Bringing together geographers, sociologists, cultural researchers, philosophers, anthropologists, visual researchers, archaeologists, heritage researchers, literary scholars and creative writers, this edited collection explores the socio-cultural phenomenon of imagination and travel. The volume reflects upon imagination in the context of many forms of physical and non-physical travel, inviting scholars to explore this fascinating, yet complex, area of inquiry in all of its wonderful colour, slipperiness, mystery and intrigue. The book intends to provide a catalyst for thinking, discussion, research and writing, with the vision of generating a cannon of scholarship on travel and the imagination that is currently absent from the literature.",Business & Economics,263,N/A,0,en

Air travel and health,"Great Britain: Parliament: House of Lords: Science and Technology Committee, Lord Broers",The Stationery Office,2007-12-12,"This report is a follow-up to an earlier report published in 2000 (HLP 121-I, session 1999-2000, ISBN 9780104442005), on air travel and health. That report acted as a stimulus to further research into the health of air crew and passengers, and led to a broader examination of such issues. The report also led to the setting up of the Aviation Health Working Group in 2001, and later the Aviation Health Unit, in 2003, within the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which acts as a focal point for aviation health in the UK. In this report the Committee sets out the current situation, and still finds issues that remain of concern, particularly the risk to air travellers of venous thromboembolism (VTE). A WHO study is to examine VTE risk for individuals with existing risk factors, and the Committee urges the Government to continue to support this project. The Committee also believes that further investigation into the effects of fumes on pilots and others should be continued. The Committee has set out a number of recommendations, including: that jet lag should be studied as a confounding effect of DVT; that the Government should explore ways to increase the research capacity in aviation health; that the CAA should implement the recommendations of its own research into aircraft seating standards, and increase the minimum seat pitch to at least 28.2 inches; the Government should also review the level of air passenger duty levied on ""premium economy"" seating; also that the Government and airlines advise passengers on the proven benefits of good hygiene in the reduction of disease transmission, and that as part of their contingency plans airlines that are flying from areas affected by a pandemic, should provide bacterial wipes to passengers; that the Government and the AHU work together with airlines and others in providing consistent air travel advice to passengers on the risks associated with self-medicating with the intention of preventing DVT.",Medical,212,N/A,0,en

Dan O'Hair",Routledge,2020-10-28,"The Handbook of Risk and Crisis Communication explores the scope and purpose of risk, and its counterpart, crisis, to facilitate the understanding of these issues from conceptual and strategic perspectives. Recognizing that risk is a central feature of our daily lives, found in relationships, organizations, governments, the environment, and a wide variety of interactions, contributors to this volume explore such questions as ""What is likely to happen, to whom, and with what consequences?"" ""To what extent can science and vigilance prevent or mitigate negative outcomes?"" and ""What obligation do some segments of local, national, and global populations have to help other segments manage risks?"", shedding light on the issues in the quest for definitive answers. The Handbook offers a broad approach to the study of risk and crisis as joint concerns. Chapters explore the reach of crisis and risk communication, define and examine key constructs, and parse the contexts of these vital areas. As a whole, the volume presents a comprehensive array of studies that highlight the standard principles and theories on both topics, serving as the largest effort to date focused on engaging risk communication discussions in a comprehensive manner. Now available in paperback, the Handbook of Risk and Crisis Communication can be readily used in graduate coursework and individual research programs. With perspectives from psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and communication, the Handbook provides vital insights for all disciplines studying risk, and is required reading for scholars and researchers investigating risk and crisis in various contexts.",Business & Economics,665,N/A,0,en

Such issues have included placing undue pressure on infrastructure; destruction of the physical, economic, and socio-cultural environment; and affecting the quality of residents’ daily lives by impacting their mobility and, in some cases, the price and rent of resident accommodation, goods, and services. To achieve a certain level of balance between the interests of local residents and visitors, new regulatory measures and legislation in high tourism areas must be discussed. TheHandbook of Research on the Impacts, Challenges, and Policy Responses to Overtourism is a collection of innovative research on best practices and legislation solutions for the management of tourism destinations suffering from overtourism, tourismophobia, or antitourism movement issues.

China's Rise In Mainland Asean: New Dynamics And Changing Landscape,"Suthiphand Chirathivat, Buddhagarn Rutchatorn, Anupama Devendrakumar",World Scientific,2019-01-15,"The rationale for this volume on China's Rise in Mainland ASEAN: New Dynamics and Changing Landscapes stems from the rise in recent years of China, ASEAN's giant neighbor, and in its wake the significant economic, political, and socio-cultural developments in the ASEAN region. In the last two decades, China has successfully established itself as a powerful regional and global power, surpassing Japan in 2010 as the second largest economy of the world, and has become a major player in the affairs of South East Asian nations.At the same time, while China's spectacular growth makes it vulnerable in terms of expanding its global dependence, it also makes its neighbours equally vulnerable due to their growing dependence on China. All of these developments have led China through its evolving foreign policy to exert considerable influence on its immediate ASEAN neighbours in many complex ways.While the China-ASEAN bilateral relations are soaring, there are growing concerns among ASEAN member countries about the nature of China's engagement with ASEAN. In this context, this book focuses on China's influence on mainland ASEAN countries: Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam. China's Rise in Mainland ASEAN: New Dynamics and Changing Landscapes contributes useful insights, rich discussions, as well as the debates relevant to building a knowledge base about and better understanding of China's rising influence in mainland ASEAN.",Political Science,321,N/A,0,en

The IA was carried out in two parts. The first part was a listing survey, which was conducted at the beginning of Season B 2015, during the planting period. A total of 19,575 households were enlisted in 120 randomly selected villages throughout the country, and 93 percent of those households were bean-producing households. The listing exercise revealed that 28 percent of bean farmers had grown at least one HIB variety in at least one season, since 2010—the equivalent of approximately half a million households. In Season B 2015, 20 percent of bean farmers were reported to be growing an HIB—the equivalent of approximately 350,000 households. Detailed results of the listing exercise are available in a separate report3. The second part of the study was a more detailed household survey, which was conducted among a subsample of nearly 1,400 bean-farming households, immediately after harvest had taken place. Both the listing and main household survey are nationally representative of rural bean producing households in Rwanda. This report presents key descriptive results from the main survey and sheds light on issues that may be investigated further in forthcoming publications.

Financial and Economic Tools Used in the World Hospitality Industry,"Ford Lumban Gaol, Natalia Filimonova, Vladimir Maslennikov",CRC Press,2018-06-18,"The 2017 Fifth International Conference on Management and Technology in Knowledge, Service, Tourism & Hospitality (SERVE 2017) was held on 21-22 October 2017 and on 30 November 2017, in Bali, Indonesia and at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russia. The theme of the conference was ""Financial and Economic Tools Used in the World Hospitality Industry"". Conference contributions dealt with various interdisciplinary research topics, particularly in the fields of social sciences, economics, business, management, education, and finance. Through this conference proceedings volume, we propose to launch a renewed discussion of how financial and economic tools can be used in the world hospitality, service, and tourism industries. The purpose of this volume is to develop new theoretical and empirical knowledge that explores the possibilities of developing tourism, hospitality, service industries in sharing economy. These proceedings should be of interest to academics and professionals in the wider field of social sciences, including disciplines such as education, psychology, tourism and knowledge management.",Business & Economics,299,N/A,0,en

Travel and Drugs in Twentieth-Century Literature,Lindsey Michael Banco,Routledge,2013-01-11,"This book examines the connections between two disparate yet persistently bound thematics -- mobility and intoxication -- and explores their central yet frequently misunderstood role in constructing subjectivity following the 1960s. Emerging from profound mid-twentieth-century changes in how drugs and travel were imagined, the conceptual nexus discussed sheds new light on British and North American responses to sixties counterculture. With readings of Aldous Huxley, William Burroughs, Alex Garland, Hunter S. Thompson, and Robert Sedlack, Banco traces twin arguments, looking at the ways travel is imagined as a disciplinary force acting upon the creative, destabilizing powers of psychedelic intoxication; and exploring the ways drugs help construct travel spaces and practices as, at times, revolutionary, and at other times, neo-colonial. By following a sequence of shifting understandings of drug and travel orthodoxies, this book traverses fraught and irresistibly linked terrains from the late 1950s up to a period marked by international, postmodern tourism. As such, it helps illuminate a world where tourism is continually expanding yet constantly circumscribed, and where illegal drugs are both increasingly unregulated in the global economy and perceived more and more as crucial agents in the construction of human subjectivity.",Literary Criticism,193,N/A,0,en

Travel and Travellers from Bede to Dampier,Geraldine Barnes with Gabrielle Singleton,Cambridge Scholars Publishing,2008-12-11,"The essays in this collection -- a selection of papers presented at the University of Sydney Centre for Medieval Studies workshop, ‘Travel and Cartography from Bede to the Enlightenment’ (August 22-23, 2001) – track a variety of travel narratives from the eighth century to the eighteenth. Their voyages, which extend from from the literal to the spiritual, the political, and the artistic, show how the concept of narrative mapping has changed over time, and how it encompasses cosmogony, geography, chorography, topography, and inventory. Each essay is concerned in some way with the application of the medieval geographical imagination, or with the enduring influence of that imagination upon post-medieval travel and discovery writing. This book will be of interest to undergraduate and postgraduate university students and to a broad range of academics across the disciplines of literature and history. It will be of particular interest to medievalists and scholars of the early modern period and to readers of, the new (1997) scholarly journal, Studies in Travel Writing. The volume will also appeal to a more general, informed readership interested in the history of travel and the history of ideas, early contact with indigenous people, and encounters between East and West.",Travel,250,N/A,0,en

The basis of a major PBS documentary by Ric Burns, this “excellent history” (The New Yorker) reveals how the automobile fundamentally changed African American life. Driving While Black demonstrates that the car—the ultimate symbol of independence and possibility—has always held particular importance for African Americans, allowing black families to evade the dangers presented by an entrenched racist society and to enjoy, in some measure, the freedom of the open road.

Home and Harem,Inderpal Grewal,Duke University Press,1996-03-14,"Moving across academic disciplines, geographical boundaries, and literary genres, Home and Harem examines how travel shaped ideas about culture and nation in nineteenth-century imperialist England and colonial India. Inderpal Grewal’s study of the narratives and discourses of travel reveals the ways in which the colonial encounter created linked yet distinct constructs of nation and gender and explores the impact of this encounter on both English and Indian men and women. Reworking colonial discourse studies to include both sides of the colonial divide, this work is also the first to discuss Indian women traveling West as well as English women touring the East. In her look at England, Grewal draws on nineteenth-century aesthetics, landscape art, and debates about women’s suffrage and working-class education to show how all social classes, not only the privileged, were educated and influenced by imperialist travel narratives. By examining diverse forms of Indian travel to the West and its colonies and focusing on forms of modernity offered by colonial notions of travel, she explores how Indian men and women adopted and appropriated aspects of European travel discourse, particularly the set of oppositions between self and other, East and West, home and abroad. Rather than being simply comparative, Home and Harem is a transnational cultural study of the interaction of ideas between two cultures. Addressing theoretical and methodological developments across a wide range of fields, this highly interdisciplinary work will interest scholars in the fields of postcolonial and cultural studies, feminist studies, English literature, South Asian studies, and comparative literature.",Social Science,298,N/A,0,en

Chasing the Rising Sun,Ted Anthony,Simon and Schuster,2007-07-13,"Chasing the Rising Sun is the story of an American musical journey told by a prize-winning writer who traced one song in its many incarnations as it was carried across the world by some of the most famous singers of the twentieth century. Most people know the song ""House of the Rising Sun"" as 1960s rock by the British Invasion group the Animals, a ballad about a place in New Orleans -- a whorehouse or a prison or gambling joint that's been the ruin of many poor girls or boys. Bob Dylan did a version and Frijid Pink cut a hard-rocking rendition. But that barely scratches the surface; few songs have traveled a journey as intricate as ""House of the Rising Sun."" The rise of the song in this country and the launch of its world travels can be traced to Georgia Turner, a poor, sixteen-year-old daughter of a miner living in Middlesboro, Kentucky, in 1937 when the young folk-music collector Alan Lomax, on a trip collecting field recordings, captured her voice singing ""The Rising Sun Blues."" Lomax deposited the song in the Library of Congress and included it in the 1941 book Our Singing Country. In short order, Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Lead Belly, and Josh White learned the song and each recorded it. From there it began to move to the planet's farthest corners. Today, hundreds of artists have recorded ""House of the Rising Sun,"" and it can be heard in the most diverse of places -- Chinese karaoke bars, Gatorade ads, and as a ring tone on cell phones. Anthony began his search in New Orleans, where he met Eric Burdon of the Animals. He traveled to the Appalachians -- to eastern Kentucky, eastern Tennessee, and western North Carolina -- to scour the mountains for the song's beginnings. He found Homer Callahan, who learned it in the mountains during a corn shucking; he discovered connections to Clarence ""Tom"" Ashley, who traveled as a performer in a 1920s medicine show. He went to Daisy, Kentucky, to visit the family of the late high-lonesome singer Roscoe Holcomb, and finally back to Bourbon Street to see if there really was a House of the Rising Sun. He interviewed scores of singers who performed the song. Through his own journey he discovered how American traditions survived and prospered -- and how a piece of culture moves through the modern world, propelled by technology and globalization and recorded sound.",Music,323,N/A,0,en
Travels with Charley in Search of America,John Steinbeck,Penguin,1997-04-01,"An intimate journey across America, as told by one of its most beloved writers A Penguin Classic In September 1960, John Steinbeck embarked on a journey across America. He felt that he might have lost touch with the country, with its speech, the smell of its grass and trees, its color and quality of light, the pulse of its people. To reassure himself, he set out on a voyage of rediscovery of the American identity, accompanied by a distinguished French poodle named Charley; and riding in a three-quarter-ton pickup truck named Rocinante. His course took him through almost forty states: northward from Long Island to Maine; through the Midwest to Chicago; onward by way of Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana (with which he fell in love), and Idaho to Seattle, south to San Francisco and his birthplace, Salinas; eastward through the Mojave, New Mexico, Arizona, to the vast hospitality of Texas, to New Orleans and a shocking drama of desegregation; finally, on the last leg, through Alabama, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey to New York. Travels with Charley in Search of America is an intimate look at one of America's most beloved writers in the later years of his life—a self-portrait of a man who never wrote an explicit autobiography. Written during a time of upheaval and racial tension in the South—which Steinbeck witnessed firsthand—Travels with Charley is a stunning evocation of America on the eve of a tumultuous decade. This Penguin Classics edition includes an introduction by Jay Parini. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

One Thousand Days of Spring,,N/A,2014,"A true story of a young successful stockbroker going broke, and lifting his thumb in search for his true self, by traveling the world. After almost five years of traveling on five different continents, Tomislav laid down in a hammock in one village on the coast of Ecuador, and started writing a book. He was determined to put down everything he knows about traveling, and with that, answer the questions that many people ask him for years: How is it possible to travel with almost no money? Is his way of traveling safe enough? What are the worst, and the best moments on the road? How can you earn money while traveling? Where to look for sponsors? How did his parents and friends react? Why is he traveling in the first place? Since it was impossible to give a simple and short answers to those questions, he started answering them in the only way possible - by telling his life story. Tomislav wrote about his student days in Croatia, about the days when he had a well paid job as a stockbroker, about going bankrupt, about turning his life around, about first ventures on the road with a backpack on his back, and about finding a way that he will follow in the years to come - by traveling. Tomislav wrote about hitchhiking in numerous countries, sleeping in homes of strangers, camping on the side of the road, eating in supermarkets and drinking beer in parks, volunteering, many anecdotes that he encountered on the road, natural beauties that left him breathless, and about the beautiful people that he met on the way.",Hitchhiking,244,N/A,0,en
The Lost Continent,Bill Bryson,Anchor Canada,2012-09-25,"""I come from Des Moines. Somebody had to."" And, as soon as Bill Bryson was old enough, he left. Des Moines couldn't hold him, but it did lure him back. After ten years in England he returned to the land of his youth, and drove almost 14,000 miles in search of a mythical small town called Amalgam, the kind of smiling village where the movies from his youth were set. Instead he drove through a series of horrific burgs, which he renamed Smellville, Fartville, Coleslaw, Coma, and Doldrum. At best his search led him to Anywhere, USA, a lookalike strip of gas stations, motels and hamburger outlets populated by obese and slow-witted hicks with a partiality for synthetic fibres. He discovered a continent that was doubly lost: lost to itself because he found it blighted by greed, pollution, mobile homes and television; lost to him because he had become a foreigner in his own country.",Travel,354,N/A,0,en

The Biology of Swimming,Karl Hamouche,N/A,2019-03,"- Learn about how your swimming machine works- Understand why you feel the way you do in practice- Over 300 illustrations to help you grasp the tough conceptsDon't be afraid! This is not biology class, this is swimming class. Your body is a Swimming Machine with a lot of moving parts. Knowing how these all work can help you understand why you feel the way you do at practice, why you train the way you do, and why you race the way you do.Complicated exercise science is translated into simple ""picture book"" format by Swim Smart founder Karl Hamouche, MD.""Karl's book has helped me understand and even enjoy the very difficult topic of human physiology. I laughed (who knew Glycolysis could be funny?) and I continue to refer to various chapters throughout the season for support and clarification.Karl explains the complexity of the human body in clear, simple language that helps both coaches and athletes get straight to the point: ""How can I go fast!?!"" For example, last summer I read the Taper chapter to my group three weeks before our big meet and we had the most drama free Taper I've ever been a part of. We had a common language and noticed and named every stage along the way, and this helped all of us feel confident in the process and normalized the sensations that generally trigger uncertainty and doubt. We're doing the same thing with energy systems and I've never had more buy-in with both specific sets and overall cycles because we've got clarity around their purpose. Thank you, Karl, your book has helped me be a better coach!""- Megan Oesting, ASCA Coach of the year 2019, head coach of Eastern Iowa Federation and founder of MOSTswimtech.",,326,N/A,0,en

The Ride of Her Life,Elizabeth Letts,Ballantine Books,2021-06-01,"NATIONAL BESTSELLER • The #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Perfect Horse and The Eighty-Dollar Champion presents a “heartwarming [and] engaging folk-hero biography” (Kirkus Reviews) of a woman who fulfilled her lifelong wish to see the Pacific Ocean by riding her horse across America. “[Letts] vividly portrays an audacious woman whose optimism, courage, and good humor are to be marveled at and admired.”—Booklist, starred review In 1954, sixty-three-year-old Maine farmer Annie Wilkins embarked on an impossible journey. She had no money and no family, she had just lost her farm, and her doctor had given her only two years to live. But Annie wanted to see the Pacific Ocean before she died. She ignored her doctor’s advice to move into the county charity home. Instead, she bought a cast-off brown gelding named Tarzan, donned men’s dungarees, and headed south in mid-November, hoping to beat the snow. Annie had little idea what to expect beyond her rural crossroads; she didn’t even have a map. But she did have her ex-racehorse, her faithful mutt, and her own unfailing belief that Americans would treat a stranger with kindness. Annie, Tarzan, and her dog, Depeche Toi, rode straight into a world transformed by the rapid construction of modern highways. Between 1954 and 1956, the three travelers pushed through blizzards, forded rivers, climbed mountains, and clung to the narrow shoulder as cars whipped by them at terrifying speeds. Annie rode more than four thousand miles, through America’s big cities and small towns. Along the way, she met ordinary people and celebrities—from Andrew Wyeth (who sketched Tarzan) to Art Linkletter and Groucho Marx. She received many offers—a permanent home at a riding stable in New Jersey, a job at a gas station in rural Kentucky, even a marriage proposal from a Wyoming rancher. In a decade when car ownership nearly tripled, when television’s influence was expanding fast, when homeowners began locking their doors, Annie and her four-footed companions inspired an outpouring of neighborliness in a rapidly changing world.",Nature,337,N/A,0,en

Modelling Public Transport Passenger Flows in the Era of Intelligent Transport Systems,"Guido Gentile, Klaus Nökel",Springer,2016-02-03,"This book shows how transit assignment models can be used to describe and predict the patterns of network patronage in public transport systems. It provides a fundamental technical tool that can be employed in the process of designing, implementing and evaluating measures and/or policies to improve the current state of transport systems within given financial, technical and social constraints. The book offers a unique methodological contribution to the field of transit assignment because, moving beyond “traditional” models, it describes more evolved variants that can reproduce:• intermodal networks with high- and low-frequency services;• realistic behavioural hypotheses underpinning route choice;• time dependency in frequency-based models; and• assumptions about the knowledge that users have of network conditionsthat are consistent with the present and future level of information that intelligent transport systems (ITS) can provide. The book also considers the practical perspective of practitioners and public transport operators who need to model and manage transit systems; for example, the role of ITS is explained with regard to their potential in data collection for modelling purposes and validation techniques, as well as with regard to the additional data on network patronage and passengers’ preferences that influences the network-management and control strategies implemented. In addition, it explains how the different aspects of network operations can be incorporated in traditional models and identifies the advantages and disadvantages of doing so. Lastly, the book provides practical information on state-of-the-art implementations of the different models and the commercial packages that are currently available for transit modelling. Showcasing original work done under the aegis of the COST Action TU1004 (TransITS), the book provides a broad readership, ranging from Master and PhD students to researchers and from policy makers to practitioners, with a comprehensive tool for understanding transit assignment models.",Technology & Engineering,671,N/A,0,en

Philosophy of Time,Sean Enda Power,Routledge,2021-05-26,"As a growing area of research, the philosophy of time is increasingly relevant to different areas of philosophy and even other disciplines. This book describes and evaluates the most important debates in philosophy of time, under several subject areas: metaphysics, epistemology, physics, philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, cognitive science, rationality, and art. Questions this book investigates include the following. Can we know what time really is? Is time possible, especially given modern physics? Must there be time because we cannot think without it? What do we experience of time? How might philosophy of time be relevant to understanding the mind–body relationship or evidence in cognitive science? Can the philosophy of time help us understand biases toward the future and the fear of death? How is time relevant to art—and is art relevant to philosophical debates about time? Finally, what exactly could time travel be? And could time travel satisfy emotions such as nostalgia and regret? Through asking such questions, and showing how they might be best answered, the book demonstrates the importance philosophy of time has in contemporary thought. Each of the book’s ten chapters begins with a helpful introduction and ends with study questions and an annotated list of further reading. This and a comprehensive bibliography at the end of the book prepare the reader to go further in their study of the philosophy of time.",Philosophy,330,N/A,0,en

The Kindness of Strangers,Fearghal O Nuallain,Summersdale,2019-09-03,"Travel is the only thing you can buy that makes you richer Travel opens our minds to the world; it helps us to embrace risk and uncertainty, overcome challenges and understand the people we meet and the places we visit. But what happens when we arrive home? How do our experiences shape us? The Kindness of Strangers explores what it means to be vulnerable and to be helped by someone we've never met before. Someone who could have walked past, but chose not to. This is a collection of stories by accomplished travellers and adventurous souls like Sarah Outen, Benedict Allen, Ed Stafford and Al Humphreys, who have completed daring journeys through challenging terrain. Each has a story to tell of a time when they were vulnerable, when they were in need and a kind stranger came to their rescue. These are stories that make our hearts grow, stories that will restore our faith in the world and remind us that, despite what the media says, the world isn't a scary place - rather, it is filled with Kind Strangers just like us.",Travel,0,N/A,0,en
The Horse Travel Handbook,CuChullaine O'Reilly,Long Riders' Guild Press,2015-05-08,"For thousands of years we have travelled on horseback but until now no one has shown us the way.The Horse Travel Handbook, a field guide drawn from its parent edition The Encyclopaedia of Equestrian Exploration, is the most authoritative work of its kind and contains the hard-earned wisdom gained by hundreds of Long Riders during centuries of equestrian travel. The concise, easy-to-use volume covers every aspect needed to successfully complete a journey by horse, including how to organize the trip, plan a route, choose the proper equipment and purchase horses. Traditional challenges such as loading a pack saddle, avoiding dangerous animals, fording rivers and outwitting horse thieves are covered here along with ingenious solutions to modern dilemmas like crossing international borders, surviving vehicle traffic and negotiating with hostile bureaucrats. This handbook covers all aspects of equine welfare including feeding, watering, saddling and health care. Technical details such as daily travel distance, where to locate nightly shelter and ways to avoid cultural conflicts are among the hundreds of specific topics examined. Equestrian explorers have special linguistic needs. Vital words such as hay and farrier are not found in standard phrase-books. A special appendix contains the Equestionary that provides images of objects and situations most likely to be of use when language is a barrier. Created by the founder of the Long Riders' Guild after decades of travel and study, this comprehensive book is filled with the indispensable knowledge needed to resolve problems, overcome hardships and avoid dangers while travelling. Just as importantly, it empowers readers to turn their dream into a life-changing equestrian journey.",Nature,296,N/A,0,en
The Future of Humanity,Michio Kaku,Anchor,2018-02-20,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • The national bestselling author of The God Equation traverses the frontiers of astrophysics, artificial intelligence, and technology to offer a stunning vision of man's future in space, from settling Mars to traveling to distant galaxies. “Amazing … Kaku is in smooth perfect control of it the entire time.” —The Christian Science Monitor We are entering a new Golden Age of space exploration. With irrepressible enthusiasm and a deep understanding of the cutting-edge research in space travel, world-renowned physicist and futurist Dr. Michio Kaku presents a compelling vision of how humanity may develop a sustainable civilization in outer space. He reveals the developments in robotics, nanotechnology, and biotechnology that may allow us to terraform and build habitable cities on Mars and beyond. He then journeys out of our solar system and discusses how new technologies such as nanoships, laser sails, and fusion rockets may actually make interstellar travel a possibility. We travel beyond our galaxy, and even beyond our universe, as Kaku investigates some of the hottest topics in science today, including warp drive, wormholes, hyperspace, parallel universes, and the multiverse. Ultimately, he shows us how humans may someday achieve a form of immortality and be able to leave our bodies entirely, laser porting to new havens in space.",Science,338,5,1,en

Airplane Mode,Shahnaz Habib,Catapult,2023-12-05,"Winner of the New American Voices Award Longlisted for the Andrew Carnegie Medals of Excellence This witty personal and cultural history of travel from the perspective of a Third World-raised woman of color, Airplane Mode, asks: what does it mean to be a joyous traveler when we live in the ruins of colonialism, capitalism and climate change? The conditions of travel have long been dictated by the color of passports and the color of skin. The color of one’s skin and passport have long dictated the conditions of travel. For Shahnaz Habib, travel and travel writing have always been complicated pleasures. Habib threads the history of travel with her personal story as a child on family vacations in India, an adult curious about the world, and an immigrant for whom roundtrips are an annual fact of life. Tracing the power dynamics that underlie tourism, this insightful debut parses who gets to travel, and who gets to write about the experience. Threaded through the book are inviting and playful analyses of obvious and not-so-obvious travel artifacts: passports, carousels, bougainvilleas, guidebooks, trains, the idea of wanderlust itself. Together, they tell a subversive history of travel as a Euro-American mode of consumerism—but as any traveler knows, travel is more than that. As an immigrant whose loved ones live across continents, Habib takes a deeply curious and joyful look at a troubled and beloved activity.",Travel,289,N/A,0,en

This New Ocean,William E. Burrows,Modern Library,2010-09-29,"It was all part of man's greatest adventure--landing men on the Moon and sending a rover to Mars, finally seeing the edge of the universe and the birth of stars, and launching planetary explorers across the solar system to Neptune and beyond. The ancient dream of breaking gravity's hold and taking to space became a reality only because of the intense cold-war rivalry between the superpowers, with towering geniuses like Wernher von Braun and Sergei Korolyov shelving dreams of space travel and instead developing rockets for ballistic missiles and space spectaculars. Now that Russian archives are open and thousands of formerly top-secret U.S. documents are declassified, an often startling new picture of the space age emerges: the frantic effort by the Soviet Union to beat the United States to the Moon was doomed from the beginning by gross inefficiency and by infighting so treacherous that Winston Churchill likened it to ""dogs fighting under a carpet""; there was more than science behind the United States' suggestion that satellites be launched during the International Geophysical Year, and in one crucial respect, Sputnik was a godsend to Washington; the hundred-odd German V-2s that provided the vital start to the U.S. missile and space programs legally belonged to the Soviet Union and were spirited to the United States in a derring-do operation worthy of a spy thriller; despite NASA's claim that it was a civilian agency, it had an intimate relationship with the military at the outset and still does--a distinction the Soviet Union never pretended to make; constant efforts to portray astronauts and cosmonauts as ""Boy Scouts"" were often contradicted by reality; the Apollo missions to the Moon may have been an unexcelled political triumph and feat of exploration, but they also created a headache for the space agency that lingers to this day. This New Ocean is based on 175 interviews with Russian and American scientists and engineers; on archival documents, including formerly top-secret National Intelligence Estimates and spy satellite pictures; and on nearly three decades of reporting. The impressive result is this fascinating story--the first comprehensive account--of the space age. Here are the strategists and war planners; engineers and scientists; politicians and industrialists; astronauts and cosmonauts; science fiction writers and journalists; and plain, ordinary, unabashed dreamers who wanted to transcend gravity's shackles for the ultimate ride. The story is written from the perspective of a witness who was present at the beginning and who has seen the conclusion of the first space age and the start of the second.",Science,795,N/A,0,en

Patriarch and Folk,E. Bradford Burns,Harvard University Press,1991,"The painful sixty-year process that brought Nicaragua from colonial status to incipient nation-state is the focus of this fresh examination of inner struggle in a key isthmian country. E. Bradford Burns shows how Nicaragua's elite was able to consolidate control of the state and form a stable government, resolving the bitter rivalry between the two cities Le&oacu;n and Granada, but at the same time began the destruction of the rich folk culture of the Indians, eventually reducing them to an impoverished and powerless agrarian proletariat. The history of this nation echoes that of other Latin American lands yet is peculiarly its own. Nicaragua emerged not from a war against Spain but rather from the violent interactions among the patriarchs of the dominant families, the communities of common people, and foreigners. Burns is eloquent on the subject of American adventurism in Nicaragua, which culminated in the outrageous expedition of the filibuster William Walker and his band of mercenaries in the 1850s. It was a major breach of the trust and friendship Nicaraguans had extended to the United States, and the Nicaraguans' subsequent victory over the foreign invaders helped forge their long-delayed sense of national unity. The decimation of Nicaraguan archives for the period prior to 1858 renders the study of early nineteenth-century history especially challenging, but Burns has made ingenious use of secondary sources and the few published primary materials available, including travelers' accounts and other memoirs, newspapers, government reports, and diplomatic correspondence. He provides valuable insight into Nicaraguan society of the time, of both the elite and the folk, including a perceptive section on the status and activities of women and the family in society. This book will appeal not only to professional historians but to general readers as well.",History,332,N/A,0,en
British culture and the end of empire,Stuart Ward,Manchester University Press,2017-03-01,"This book is the first major attempt to examine the cultural manifestations of the demise of imperialism as a social and political ideology in post-war Britain. Far from being a matter of indifference or resigned acceptance as is often suggested, the fall of the British Empire came as a profound shock to the British national imagination, and resonated widely in British popular culture. The sheer range of subjects discussed, from the satire boom of the 1960s to the worlds of sport and the arts, demonstrates how profoundly decolonisation was absorbed into the popular consciousness. Offers an extremely novel and provocative interpretation of post-war British cultural history, and opens up a whole new field of enquiry in the history of decolonisation.",History,254,N/A,0,en

Handbook of Abductive Cognition,Lorenzo Magnani,Springer Nature,2023-03-31,"This Handbook offers the first comprehensive reference guide to the interdisciplinary field of abductive cognition, providing readers with extensive information on the process of reasoning to hypotheses in humans, animals, and in computational machines. It highlights the role of abduction in both theory practice: in generating and testing hypotheses and explanatory functions for various purposes and as an educational device.

Drawing on hemispheric studies, Indigenous studies, and southern theory to decentre British and other European metropoles, the collection offers a groundbreaking challenge to national paradigms and traditional literary periodisations and canons by prioritising southern cultural networks in multiple regional centres from Cape Town to Dunedin.

Modernist Voyages,Anna Snaith,Cambridge University Press,2014-02-24,"London's literary and cultural scene fostered newly configured forms of feminist anticolonialism during the modernist period. Through their writing in and about the imperial metropolis, colonial women authors not only remapped the city, they also renegotiated the position of women within the empire. This book examines the significance of gender to the interwoven nature of empire and modernism. As transgressive figures of modernity, writers such as Jean Rhys, Katherine Mansfield, Una Marson and Sarojini Naidu brought their own versions of modernity to the capital, revealing the complex ways in which colonial identities 'traveled' to London at the turn of the twentieth century. Anna Snaith's original study provides an alternative vantage point on the urban metropolis and its artistic communities for scholars and students of literary modernism, gender and postcolonial studies, and English literature more broadly.",Literary Criticism,289,N/A,0,en

The Undiscovered Country,Melek Ortabasi,BRILL,2020-05-11,"""Yanagita Kunio (1875–1962) was a public intellectual who played a pivotal role in shaping modern Japan’s cultural identity. A self-taught folk scholar and elite bureaucrat, he promoted folk studies in Japan. So extensive was his role that he has been compared with the fabled Grimm Brothers of Germany and the great British folklorist James G. Frazer (1854–1941), author of The Golden Bough. This monograph is only the second book-length English-language examination of Yanagita, and it is the first analysis that moves beyond a biographical account of his pioneering work in folk studies. An eccentric but insightful critic of Japan’s rush to modernize, Yanagita offers a compelling array of rebuttals to mainstream social and political trends in his carefully crafted writings. Through a close reading of Yanagita’s interdisciplinary texts, which comment on a wide range of key cultural issues that characterized the first half of Japan’s twentieth century, Melek Ortabasi seeks to reevaluate the historical significance of his work. Ortabasi’s inquiry simultaneously exposes, discursively, some of the fundamental assumptions we embrace about modernity and national identity in Japan and elsewhere.""",Biography & Autobiography,355,N/A,0,en
When Mayors Take Charge,Joseph P. Viteritti,Rowman & Littlefield,2009-10-01,"Large urban school systems have been the weakest link in American education, driving middle-class families into the suburbs while contributing mightily to the racial learning gap. Activist mayors in several major cities have responded by taking control of their public schools. When Mayors Take Charge is the most up-to-date assessment available on this phenomenon. It brings together the topic's leading experts to analyze the factors and people driving the trend, its achievements and shortcomings, its prospects for the future, and ways to improve it. Part One of the book assesses the results of mayoral control nationwide. The second section details the experience in three key cities: Boston and Chicago, the major prototypes for mayoral control, and Detroit, where mayoral control ended in disaster. The final section provides the first in-depth examination of New York City, where the law installing mayoral control sunsets in 2009.

Landscape has long been a major arena for debate about the nature of Eighteenth-century English culture; this book surveys those debates and offers a provocative new account. Mayhew shows that describing landscape was a religiously contested practice, and that different theological positions led differing authors to different descriptive approaches.

The empire of nature,John M. MacKenzie,Manchester University Press,2017-03-01,"This study assesses the significance of the hunting cult as a major element of the imperial experience in Africa and Asia. Through a study of the game laws and the beginnings of conservation in the 19th and early-20th centuries, the author demonstrates the racial inequalities which existed between Europeans and indigenous hunters. Africans were denied access to game, and the development of game reserves and national parks accelerated this process. Indigenous hunters in Africa and India were turned into ""poachers"" and only Europeans were permitted to hunt. In India, the hunting of animals became the chief recreation of military officers and civilian officials, a source of display and symbolic dominance of the environment. Imperial hunting fed the natural history craze of the day, and many hunters collected trophies and specimens for private and public collections as well as contributing to hunting literature. Adopting a radical approach to issues of conservation, this book links the hunting cult in Africa and India to the development of conservation, and consolidates widely-scattered material on the importance of hunting to the economics and nutrition of African societies.",Nature,351,N/A,0,en

Possessing Nature,Paula Findlen,Univ of California Press,1994-09-16,"In 1500 few Europeans regarded nature as a subject worthy of inquiry. Yet fifty years later the first museums of natural history had appeared in Italy, dedicated to the marvels of nature. Italian patricians, their curiosity fueled by new voyages of exploration and the humanist rediscovery of nature, created vast collections as a means of knowing the world and used this knowledge to their greater glory. Drawing on extensive archives of visitors' books, letters, travel journals, memoirs, and pleas for patronage, Paula Findlen reconstructs the lost social world of Renaissance and Baroque museums. She follows the new study of natural history as it moved out of the universities and into sixteenth- and seventeenth-century scientific societies, religious orders, and princely courts. Findlen argues convincingly that natural history as a discipline blurred the border between the ancients and the moderns, between collecting in order to recover ancient wisdom and the development of new textual and experimental scholarship. Her vivid account reveals how the scientific revolution grew from the constant mediation between the old forms of knowledge and the new.",History,468,N/A,0,en

Its broad coverage and accessible language give it access to a wider audience than many academic anthologies, thereby advancing the interests of all those who value the study of colonial history.""—Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History Women and the Colonial Gaze is the first collection to present a broad chronological and geographical examination of the ways in which images and stereotypes of women have been used to define relationships between colonial powers and subject peoples. In essays ranging from ancient Rome to twentieth-century Asia and Africa, the contributions suggest that the use of gender as a tool in the imperialist context is much older and more comprehensive than previously suggested. Contributors look particularly at the ways in which colonizers constructed a national identity by creating a contrast with the colonial ""other,"" in contexts ranging from Christian views of Islam women in medieval Spain to French beliefs about Native American women. They also examine the ways in which images of gender as constructed by colonial powers impacted the lives of native women from colonial-era India to Korea to Swaziland.

Angels Tapping at the Wine-shop's Door,Rudi Matthee,Oxford University Press,2023-06-01,"Islam is the only major world religion that resists the juggernaut of alcohol consumption. In many Islamic countries, alcohol is banned; in others, it plays little role in social life. Yet, Muslims throughout history did drink, often to excess--whether sultans and shahs in their palaces, or commoners in taverns run by Jews or Christians. This evocative study delves into drinking's many historic, literary and social manifestations in Islam, going beyond references to 'hypocrisy' or the temptations of 'forbidden fruit'. Rudi Matthee argues that alcohol, through its 'absence' as much as its presence, takes us to the heart of Islam. Exploring the long history of this faith--from the eight-century Umayyad dynasty to Erdogan's Turkey, and from Islamic Spain to modern Pakistan--he unearths a tradition of diversity and multiplicity in which Muslims drank, and found myriad excuses to do so. They celebrated wine and used it as a poetic metaphor, even viewing alcohol as a gift from God--the key to unlocking eternal truth. Drawing on a plethora of sources, Matthee presents Islam not as an austere and uncompromising faith, but as a set of beliefs and practices that embrace ambivalence, allowing for ambiguity and even contradiction.",Religion,525,N/A,0,en
Prospero's Cell,Lawrence Durrell,Open Road Media,2012-06-12,"From a member of the real-life family portrayed in The Durrells in Corfu, this memoir of the idyllic Greek island is “among the best books ever written” (The New York Times). Before Lawrence Durrell became a renowned novelist, poet, and travel writer, he spent four youthful years on Corfu, an island jewel with beauty to match the long and fascinating history within its rocky shores. While his brother, Gerald, was collecting animals as a budding naturalist, Lawrence fished, drank, and lived with the natives in the years leading up to World War II, sheltered from the tumult that was engulfing Europe—until finally he could ignore the world no longer. Durrell left for Alexandria, to serve his country as a wartime diplomat, but never forgot the wonders of Corfu. In this “brilliant” journey through that idyllic time and place, Durrell returns to the land that made him so happy, blending his love of history with memories of his adventures there (The Economist).

Innovative and engaging, this book applies theories of landscape, space and place from the discipline of cultural geography within an early modern historical context. Different kinds of drama and performance are analysed: from commercial drama by key playwrights to household masques and entertainment performed by families and in semi-official contexts. Sanders provides a fresh look at works from the careers of Ben Jonson, John Milton and Richard Brome, paying attention to geographical spaces and habitats like forests, coastlines and arctic landscapes of ice and snow, as well as the more familiar locales of early modern country estates and city streets and spaces. Overall, the book encourages readers to think about geography as kinetic, embodied and physical, not least in its literary configurations, presenting a key contribution to early modern scholarship.",Literary Criticism,255,N/A,0,en

Drugs as Weapons Against Us,John L. Potash,Trine Day,2015-05-25,"Drugs as Weapons Against Us meticulously details how a group of opium-trafficking families came to form an American oligarchy and eventually achieved global dominance. This oligarchy helped fund the Nazi regime and then saved thousands of Nazis to work with the Central Intelligence Agency. CIA operations such as MK-Ultra pushed LSD and other drugs on leftist leaders and left-leaning populations at home and abroad. Evidence supports that this oligarchy further led the United States into its longest-running wars in the ideal areas for opium crops, while also massively funding wars in areas of coca plant abundance for cocaine production under the guise of a &“war on drugs&” that is actually the use of drugs as a war on us. Drugs as Weapons Against Us tells how scores of undercover U.S. Intelligence agents used drugs in the targeting of leftist leaders from SDS to the Black Panthers, Young Lords, Latin Kings, and the Occupy Movement. It also tells how they particularly targeted leftist musicians, including John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobain, and Tupac Shakur to promote drugs while later murdering them when they started sobering up and taking on more leftist activism. The book further uncovers the evidence that Intelligence agents dosed Paul Robeson with LSD, gave Mick Jagger his first hit of acid, hooked Janis Joplin on amphetamines, as well as manipulating Elvis Presley, Eminem, the Wu Tang Clan, and others.",Social Science,437,5,1,en
Hidden Histories,D. Medina Lasansky,didapress,2018-01-10,"Tuscany is a landscape whose cultural construction is complicated and multi-layered. It is this very complexity that this book seeks to untangle. By revealing hidden histories, we learn how food, landscape and architecture are intertwined, as well as the extent to which Italian design and contemporary consumption patterns form a legacy that draws upon the Romantic longings of a century before. In the process, this book reveals the extent to which Tuscany has been constructed by Anglos — and what has been distorted, idealized and even overlooked in the process.",Architecture,364,N/A,0,en
Public Transit Economics and Deregulation Policy,J. Berechman,Elsevier,2013-10-22,"Drawing on transit experience from various countries and markets, this book examines the economic environment of transit operations, the cost and production properties of transit service supply and the policies and prospects of transit regulatory reform. The principal objectives of the book are: first to conduct theoretical and empirical analyses of the major factors which jointly determine the economic structure and conditions of the transit sector; and second to explore and suggest policies which could resolve the sector's present crisis and make it economically viable. The first objective is explored in Part One where major structural demand factors and regulatory and subsidy conditions are identified and examined. Analytical and empirical measurement of technical production characteristics of transit services supply is carried out in Part Two. Part Three focuses on transit regulatory reform policy issues. The book is aimed primarily at an audience of transportation professionals, including economists and planners as well as public policy analysts. It requires, in general, a sound background in economics, mainly microeconomics. Thus graduate students in economics, geography, urban planning and public policy, and advanced undergraduates with good training in economics can best benefit from this book.",Political Science,360,N/A,0,en
Tourists,Lucy Lethbridge,Bloomsbury Publishing,2022-08-18,"*FOYLES NON-FICTION BOOK OF THE MONTH* 'I really can't recommend this enough - especially if you are going on holiday' Tom Holland 'Delightful ... Lucy Lethbridge has written a glorious romp of a book' Kathryn Hughes, The Mail on Sunday 'It is the paramount wish of every English heart, ever addicted to vagabondizing, to hasten to the Continent...' In 1815 the Battle of Waterloo brought to an end the Napoleonic Wars and the European continent opened up once again to British tourists. The nineteenth century was to be an age driven by steam technology, mass-industrialisation and movement, and, in the footsteps of the Grand Tourists a hundred years earlier, the British middle-classes flocked to Europe to see the sights. In Tourists, the voices of these travellers – puzzled, shocked, delighted and amazed – are brought vividly to life. From the discomfort of the stagecoach to the 'self-contained pleasure palace' of the beach resort, Lucy Lethbridge brilliantly examines two centuries of tourists' experience. Among a range of disparate characters, we meet the commercial titans of Victorian tourism, Albert Smith, Henry Gaze and Thomas Cook, as well as their successor, Vladimir Raitz, the creator of the modern beach holiday. The growth of popular tourism introduced new markets in guidebooks, souvenirs, cuisine and health cures. It smoothed over class differences but also exacerbated them. It destroyed traditional cultures while at the same time preserving them. From portable cameras to postcards and suntans, Tourists explores how tourism has reflected changing attitudes to modernity and how, from the grand hotel to the campsite, the foreign holiday exposes deep fears, hopes and even longings for home.",Travel,321,N/A,0,en

'In its gem-like miniature quality, among the best books ever written.' New York Times In his youth, before he became a celebrated writer and poet, Lawrence Durrell spent four transformative years on the island jewel of Corfu, fascinated by the idyllic natural beauty and blood-stained ancient history within its rocky shores. While his brother Gerald collected animals as a budding naturalist - later fictionalised in My Family and Other Animals and filmed as The Durrells in Corfu - Lawrence fished, drank and befriended the local villagers. After World War II catapulted him back into a turmoiled world, Durrell never forgot the wonders of Corfu.

Hudson River School Visions,Sanford Robinson Gifford,Metropolitan Museum of Art,2003,"Sanford Gifford (American, 1823-1880), a leading Hudson River School landscape painter and a founder of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, was so esteemed by the New York art world that, at his untimely death, the Museum mounted a show of his work-the first monographic exhibition accorded any artist-and published a Memorial Catalogue that, for nearly a century, remained the principal source on his oeuvre. Gifford's art, which was inspired by the work of Thomas Cole, the founder of the Hudson River School, and by that of British artist J.M.W. Turner, and enriched by his travels in Europe (from 1855 to 1857, and from 1868 to 1869), came to be called ""air painting,"" for he made the ambient light of each scene-color saturated and atmospherically potent-the key to its expression. His approach to painting and his unique style gave rise to a highly distinctive body of work with enchanting and mesmerizing effect. This publication examines seventy paintings by the artist and includes comparative illustrations of related works by Gifford, his Hudson River School mentors and colleagues, and those painters, in addition to Cole and Turner, who exerted influence on his art, including Frederic Edwin Church and John F. Kensett. The essays discuss Gifford's place in the Hudson River School, his numerous Catskill Mountain subjects, his experiences and perceptions as a traveler both at home and abroad, and the variety of his patrons. -- Metropolitan Museum of Art website.",Hudson River school of landscape painting,290,N/A,0,en

The Long Recessional,David Gilmour,Macmillan + ORM,2003-06-11,"A major new biography of Rudyard Kipling Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936) was a unique figure in British history, a great writer as well as an imperial icon whose life trajectory matched that of the British Empire from its zenith to its final decades. Kipling was in his early twenties when his first stories about Anglo-Indian life vaulted him into celebrity. He went on to be awarded the Nobel Prize, and to add more phrases to the language than any man since Shakespeare, but his conservative views and advocacy of imperialism damaged his critical reputation -- while at the same time making him all the more popular with a general readership. By the time he died, the man who incarnated an era for millions was almost forgotten, and new generations must come to terms in their own way with his enduring but mysterious powers. Previous works on Kipling have focused exclusively on his writing and on his domestic life. Here, the distinguished biographer David Gilmour not only explains how and why Kipling wrote, but also explores the themes of his complicated life, his ideas, his relationships, and his views on the Empire and the future. Gilmour is the first writer to explore Kipling's public role, his influence on the way Britons saw themselves and their Empire. His fascinating new book, based on extensive research (especially in the underexplored archives of the United States), is a groundbreaking study of a great and misunderstood writer.",Biography & Autobiography,521,N/A,0,en

Livingstone's 'lives',Justin Livingstone,Manchester University Press,2014-11-01,"David Livingstone, the ‘missionary-explorer’, has attracted more commentary than nearly any other Victorian hero. Beginning in the years following his death, he soon became the subject of a major biographical tradition. Yet out of this extensive discourse, no unified image of Livingstone emerges. Rather, he has been represented in diverse ways and in a variety of socio-political contexts. Until now, no one has explored Livingstone’s posthumous reputation in full. This book meets the challenge. In approaching Livingstone’s complex legacy, it adopts a metabiographical perspective: in other words, this book is a biography of biographies. Rather than trying to uncover the true nature of the subject, metabiography is concerned with the malleability of biographical representation. It does not aim to uncover Livingstone’s ‘real’ identity, but instead asks: what has he been made to mean? Crossing disciplinary boundaries, Livingstone’s 'lives' will interest scholars of imperial history, postcolonialism, life-writing, travel-writing and Victorian studies.",History,303,N/A,0,en

"Architecture, Travellers and Writers",Anne Hultzsch,Routledge,2017-07-05,"Does the way in which buildings are looked at, and made sense of, change over the course of time? How can we find out about this? By looking at a selection of travel writings spanning four centuries, Anne Hultzsch suggests that it is language, the description of architecture, which offers answers to such questions. The words authors use to transcribe what they see for the reader to re-imagine offer glimpses at modes of perception specific to one moment, place and person. Hultzsch constructs an intriguing patchwork of local and often fragmentary narratives discussing texts as diverse as the 17th-century diary of John Evelyn, Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719) and an 1855 art guide by Swiss art historian Jacob Burckhardt. Further authors considered include 17th-century collector John Bargrave, 18th-century novelist Tobias Smollett, poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, critic John Ruskin as well as the 20th-century architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner.

Migration and Modernities,DeLucia JoEllen DeLucia,Edinburgh University Press,2018-11-27,"Recovers a comparative literary history of migrationThis collection initiates transnational, transcultural and interdisciplinary conversations about migration in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Migrants are by definition liminal, and many have existed historically in the murky spaces between nations, regions or ethnicities. These essays together traverse the globe, revealing the experiences - real or imagined - of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century migrants, from dispossessed Native Americans to soldiers in South America, Turkish refugees to Scottish settlers. They explore the aesthetic and rhetorical frameworks used to represent migrant experiences during a time when imperial expansion and technological developments made the fortunes of some migrants and made exiles out of others. These frameworks continue to influence the narratives we tell ourselves about migration today and were crucial in producing a distinctively modern subjectivity in which mobility and rootlessness have become normative.Key FeaturesOffers a comparative framework for understanding the modern history of migration and the aesthetics of mobilityForegrounds interdisciplinary debates about belonging, rights, and citizenshipDemonstrates how mobility unsettles the national, cultural, racialized, and gendered frames we often use to organize literary and historical studyBrings together scholars from the US and Europe to explore the connections between migrant experiences and the emergence of modernityEmphasizes the globalism of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries",American literature,253,N/A,0,en

"Space, Time and Einstein",J.B. Kennedy,Routledge,2014-12-18,"This introduction to one of the liveliest and most popular fields in philosophy is written specifically for a beginning readership with no background in philosophy or science. Step-by-step analyses of the key arguments are provided and the philosophical heart of the issues is revealed without recourse to jargon, maths, or logical formulas. The book introduces Einstein's revolutionary ideas in a clear and simple way, along with the concepts and arguments of philosophers, both ancient and modern that have proved of lasting value. Specifically, the theories of the ancient Greek philosophers, Zeno, Euclid and Parmenides are considered alongside the ideas of Newton, Leibniz and Kant as well as the giants of twentieth-century physics, Einstein and Lorentz. The problems at the heart of the philosophy of space and time, such as change, motion, infinity, shape, and inflation, are examined and the seismic impact made by relativity theory and quantum theory is assessed in the light of the latest research. The writing is lucid and entertaining, allowing a beginning readership to grasp some difficult concepts while offering the more experienced reader a succinct and illuminating presentation of the state of the debate. ""Space, Time and Einstein"" shows the reader the excitement of scientific discovery and the beauty of theory in the search for answers to these fundamental questions.",History,255,N/A,0,en

Club Red,Diane P. Koenker,Cornell University Press,2013-04-24,"The Bolsheviks took power in Russia 1917 armed with an ideology centered on the power of the worker. From the beginning, however, Soviet leaders also realized the need for rest and leisure within the new proletarian society and over subsequent decades struggled to reconcile the concept of leisure with the doctrine of communism, addressing such fundamental concerns as what the purpose of leisure should be in a workers' state and how socialist vacations should differ from those enjoyed by the capitalist bourgeoisie.In Club Red, Diane P. Koenker offers a sweeping and insightful history of Soviet vacationing and tourism from the Revolution through perestroika. She shows that from the outset, the regime insisted that the value of tourism and vacation time was strictly utilitarian. Throughout the 1920s and '30s, the emphasis was on providing the workers access to the ""repair shops"" of the nation's sanatoria or to the invigorating journeys by foot, bicycle, skis, or horseback that were the stuff of ""proletarian tourism."" Both the sedentary vacation and tourism were part of the regime’s effort to transform the poor and often illiterate citizenry into new Soviet men and women.Koenker emphasizes a distinctive blend of purpose and pleasure in Soviet vacation policy and practice and explores a fundamental paradox: a state committed to the idea of the collective found itself promoting a vacation policy that increasingly encouraged and then had to respond to individual autonomy and selfhood. The history of Soviet tourism and vacations tells a story of freely chosen mobility that was enabled and subsidized by the state. While Koenker focuses primarily on Soviet domestic vacation travel, she also notes the decisive impact of travel abroad (mostly to other socialist countries), which shaped new worldviews, created new consumer desires, and transformed Soviet vacation practices.",History,323,N/A,0,en

Travel and Ethics,"Corinne Fowler, Charles Forsdick, Ludmilla Kostova",Routledge,2013-12-13,"Despite the recent increase in scholarly activity regarding travel writing and the accompanying proliferation of publications relating to the form, its ethical dimensions have yet to be theorized with sufficient rigour. Drawing from the disciplines of anthropology, linguistics, literary studies and modern languages, the contributors in this volume apply themselves to a number of key theoretical questions pertaining to travel writing and ethics, ranging from travel-as-commoditization to encounters with minority languages under threat. Taken collectively, the essays assess key critical legacies from parallel disciplines to the debate so far, such as anthropological theory and postcolonial criticism. Also considered, and of equal significance, are the ethical implications of the form’s parallel genres of writing, such as ethnography and journalism. As some of the contributors argue, innovations in these genres have important implications for the act of theorizing travel writing itself and the mode and spirit in which it continues to be conducted. In the light of such innovations, how might ethical theory maintain its critical edge?",Literary Criticism,275,N/A,0,en

The Temporary European,Cameron Hewitt,Travelers' Tales,2022-02-01,"Write guidebooks, make travel TV, lead bus tours? Cameron Hewitt has been Rick Steves’ right hand for more than 20 years, doing just that. The Temporary European is a collection of vivid, entertaining travel tales from across Europe. Cameron zips you into his backpack for engaging and inspiring experiences: sampling spleen sandwiches at a Palermo street market; hiking alone with the cows high in the Swiss Alps; simmering in Budapest’s thermal baths; trekking across an English moor to a stone circle; hand-rolling pasta at a Tuscan agriturismo; shivering through Highland games in a soggy Scottish village; and much more. Along the way, Cameron introduces us to his favorite Europeans. In Mostar, Alma demonstrates how Bosnian coffee isn’t just a drink, but a social ritual. In France, Mathilde explains that the true mastery of a fromager isn’t making cheese, but aging it. In Spain, Fran proudly eats acorns, but never corn on the cob. While personal, the stories also tap into the universal joy of travel. Cameron’s travel motto (inspired by a globetrotting auntie) is ""Jams Are Fun""—the fondest memories arrive when your best-laid plans go sideways. And he encourages travelers to stow their phones and guidebooks, slow down, and savor those magic moments that arrive between stops on a busy itinerary. The stories are packed with inspiration and insights for your next trip, including how to find the best gelato in Italy, how to select the best produce at a Provençal market, how to navigate Spain’s confusing tapas scene, and how to survive the experience of driving in Sicily (hint: just go numb). And you’ll get a reality check for every traveler’s ""dream job"": researching and writing guidebooks; guiding busloads of Americans on tours around Europe; scouting and producing a travel TV show; and working with Rick Steves and his merry band of travelers. It’s a candid account of how the sausage gets made in the travel business—told with warts-and-all honesty and a sense of humor. For Rick Steves fans, or anyone who loves Europe, The Temporary European is inspiring, insightful, and fun.",Travel,395,N/A,0,en
"Travel, Tourism and Art","Dr Jo-Anne Lester, Dr Tijana Rakic","Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.",2014-01-28,"Art, in its many forms, has long played an important role in people’s imagination, experience and remembrance of places, cultures and travels as well as in their motivation to travel. Travel and tourism, on the other hand, have also inspired numerous artists and featured in many artworks. The fascinating relationships between travel, tourism and art encompass a wide range of phenomena from historical ‘Grand Tours’ during which a number of travellers experienced or produced artwork, to present-day travel inspired by art, artworks produced by contemporary travellers or artworks produced by locals for tourist consumption. Focusing on the representations of ‘touristic’ places, locals, travellers and tourists in artworks; the role of travel and tourism in inspiring artists; as well as the role of art and artwork in imagining, experiencing and remembering places and motivating travel and tourism; this edited volume provides a space for an exploration of both historical and contemporary relationships between travel, tourism and art. Bringing together scholars from a wide range of disciplines and fields of study including geography, anthropology, history, philosophy, and urban, cultural, tourism, art and leisure studies, this volume discusses a range of case studies across different art forms and locales.",History,405,N/A,0,en

Travel and Imagination,"Dr Emma Waterton, Dr Garth Lean, Dr Russell Staiff","Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.",2014-04-28,"The imagination has long been associated with travel and tourism; from the seventeenth century when the showman and his peepshow box would take the village crowd to places, cities and lands through the power of stories, to today when we rely on a different range of boxes to whisk us away on our imaginative travels: the television, the cinema and the computer. Even simply the notion of travel, it would seem, gives us license to daydream. The imagination thus becomes a key concept that blurs the boundaries between our everyday lives and the idea of travel. Yet, despite what appears to be a close and comfortable link, there is an absence of scholarly material looking at travel and the imagination. Bringing together geographers, sociologists, cultural researchers, philosophers, anthropologists, visual researchers, archaeologists, heritage researchers, literary scholars and creative writers, this edited collection explores the socio-cultural phenomenon of imagination and travel. The volume reflects upon imagination in the context of many forms of physical and non-physical travel, inviting scholars to explore this fascinating, yet complex, area of inquiry in all of its wonderful colour, slipperiness, mystery and intrigue. The book intends to provide a catalyst for thinking, discussion, research and writing, with the vision of generating a cannon of scholarship on travel and the imagination that is currently absent from the literature.",Business & Economics,265,N/A,0,en

The Routledge Companion to Travel Writing,Carl Thompson,Routledge,2015-12-22,"As many places around the world confront issues of globalization, migration and postcoloniality, travel writing has become a serious genre of study, reflecting some of the greatest concerns of our time. Encompassing forms as diverse as field journals, investigative reports, guidebooks, memoirs, comic sketches and lyrical reveries; travel writing is now a crucial focus for discussion across many subjects within the humanities and social sciences. An ideal starting point for beginners, but also offering new perspectives for those familiar with the field, The Routledge Companion to Travel Writing examines: Key debates within the field, including postcolonial studies, gender, sexuality and visual culture Historical and cultural contexts, tracing the evolution of travel writing across time and over cultures Different styles, modes and themes of travel writing, from pilgrimage to tourism Imagined geographies, and the relationship between travel writing and the social, ideological and occasionally fictional constructs through which we view the different regions of the world. Covering all of the major topics and debates, this is an essential overview of the field, which will also encourage new and exciting directions for study.

Formations of Colonial Modernity in East Asia,Tani E. Barlow,N/A,1997,"The essays in Formations of Colonial Modernity in East Asia challenge the idea that notions of modernity and colonialism are mere imports from the West, and show how colonial modernity has evolved from and into unique forms throughout Asia. Although the modernity of non-European colonies is as indisputable as the colonial core of European modernity, until recently East Asian scholarship has tried to view Asian colonialism through the paradigm of colonial India (for instance), failing to recognize anti-imperialist nationalist impulses within differing Asian countries and regions. Demonstrating an impatience with social science models of knowledge, the contributors show that binary categories focused on during the Cold War are no longer central to the project of history writing. By bringing together articles previously published in the journal positions: east asia cultures critique, editor Tani Barlow has demonstrated how scholars construct identity and history, providing cultural critics with new ways to think about these concepts--in the context of Asia and beyond. Chapters address topics such as the making of imperial subjects in Okinawa, politics and the body social in colonial Hong Kong, and the discourse of decolonization and popular memory in South Korea. This is an invaluable collection for students and scholars of Asian studies, postcolonial studies, and anthropology. Contributors. Charles K. Armstrong, Tani E. Barlow, Fred Y. L.

Premodern Travel in World History,"Stephen Gosch, Peter Stearns",Routledge,2007-12-12,"This book features some of the greatest travellers in human history – people who undertook long journeys to places they knew little or nothing about. From Roman tourists, to the establishment of the Silk Road; an epic trek round China and India in the seventh century, to Marco Polo and through to the first speculations on space travel, Premodern Travel in World History provides an overview of long-distance travel in Afro-Eurasia from around 400BCE to 1500. This survey uses succinct accounts of the most epic journeys in the premodern world as lenses through which to examine the development of early travel, trade and cultural interchange between China, central Asia, India and southeast Asia, while also discussing themes such as the growth of empires and the spread of world religions. Complete with maps, this concise and interesting study analyzes how travel pushed and shaped the boundaries of political, geographical and cultural frontiers.",History,332,N/A,0,en

"Travel, Pilgrimage and Social Interaction from Antiquity to the Middle Ages","Jenni Kuuliala, Jussi Rantala",Routledge,2019-10-10,"Mobility and travel have always been key characteristics of human societies, having various cultural, social and religious aims and purposes. Travels shaped religions and societies and were a way for people to understand themselves, this world and the transcendent. This book analyses travelling in its social context in ancient and medieval societies. Why did people travel, how did they travel and what kind of communal networks and negotiations were inherent in their travels? Travel was not only the privilege of the wealthy or the male, but people from all social groups, genders and physical abilities travelled. Their reasons to travel varied from profane to sacred, but often these two were intermingled in the reasons for travelling. The chapters cover a long chronology from Antiquity to the end of the Middle Ages, offering the reader insights into the developments and continuities of travel and pilgrimage as a phenomenon of vital importance.",History,258,N/A,0,en

The Economic Institutions of Higher Education,"J. Patrick Raines, Charles G. Leathers",Edward Elgar Publishing,2003,"Working within the context of the evolutionary-institutional transformation of higher education, the authors trace the development of an economic model by which the behavioral tendencies of modern universities can be evaluated. That model is expanded to provide insights to the following questions: Why do universities compete and how do they develop and implement their competitive strategies? How do universities make critical institutional decisions about operational missions, academic policies, and internal resource allocation? Do universities efficiently and effectively pursue the special social functions assigned to them? Patrick Raines and Charles Leathers present an integrated, coherent theory to explain the behavior of universities and provide a realistic economic model that predicts how universities allocate their scarce educational resources. This alternative view is contrasted with the mainstream explanations of university behavior based on the maximization of student welfare or faculty influences. The authors extend the existing literature on the operation of universities by presenting a history of the evolution of the modern entrepreneurial universities as well as an explanation of academic capitalism. This absorbing volume will appeal to anyone interested in the history of economic thought or the history of education. Scholars of Veblen, Smith, and Malthus will be fascinated by their individual and comparative theories of the purpose and failures of higher education.",Business & Economics,272,N/A,0,en

New Worlds Reflected,Dr Chloë Houston,"Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.",2013-06-28,"Utopias have long interested scholars of the intellectual and literary history of the early modern period. From the time of Thomas More's Utopia (1516), fictional utopias were indebted to contemporary travel narratives, with which they shared interests in physical and metaphorical journeys, processes of exploration and discovery, encounters with new peoples, and exchange between cultures. Travel writers, too, turned to utopian discourses to describe the new worlds and societies they encountered. Both utopia and travel writing came to involve a process of reflection upon their authors' societies and cultures, as well as representations of new and different worlds. As awareness of early modern encounters with new worlds moves beyond the Atlantic World to consider exploration and travel, piracy and cultural exchange throughout the globe, an assessment of the mutual indebtedness of these genres, as well as an introduction to their development, is needed. New Worlds Reflected provides a significant contribution both to the history of utopian literature and travel, and to the wider cultural and intellectual history of the time, assembling original essays from scholars interested in representations of the globe and new and ideal worlds in the period from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries, and in the imaginative reciprocal responsiveness of utopian and travel writing. Together these essays underline the mutual indebtedness of travel and utopia in the early modern period, and highlight the rich variety of ways in which writers made use of the prospect of new and ideal worlds. New Worlds Reflected showcases new work in the fields of early modern utopian and global studies and will appeal to all scholars interested in such questions.",History,288,N/A,0,en

Whether the travel was undertaken in the name of exploration, pilgrimage, science, inspiration, self-discovery, or a combination of these elements, questions of veracity and authenticity inevitably arise. Women, Travel, and Truth is a collection of twelve essays that explore the manifold ways in which travel and truth interact in women's travel writing. Essays range in date from Lady Mary Wortley Montagu in the eighteenth century to Jamaica Kincaid in the twenty-first, across such regions as India, Italy, Norway, Siberia, Austria, the Orient, the Caribbean, China and Mexico. Topics explored include blurred distinctions of fiction and non-fiction; travel writing and politics; subjectivity; displacement, and exile.

"""Travel, Collecting, and Museums of Asian Art in Nineteenth-Century Paris """,Ting Chang,Routledge,2017-07-05,"Travel, Collecting, and Museums of Asian Art in Nineteenth-Century Paris examines a history of contact between modern Europe and East Asia through three collectors: Henri Cernuschi, Emile Guimet, and Edmond de Goncourt. Drawing on a wealth of material including European travelogues of the East and Asian reports of the West, Ting Chang explores the politics of mobility and cross-cultural encounter in the nineteenth century. This book takes a new approach to museum studies and institutional critique by highlighting what is missing from the existing scholarship -- the foreign labors, social relations, and somatic experiences of travel that are constitutive of museums yet left out of their histories. The author explores how global trade and monetary theory shaped Cernuschi's collection of archaic Chinese bronze. Exchange systems, both material and immaterial, determined Guimet's museum of religious objects and Goncourt's private collection of Asian art. Bronze, porcelain, and prints articulated the shifting relations and frameworks of understanding between France, Japan, and China in a time of profound transformation. Travel, Collecting, and Museums of Asian Art in Nineteenth-Century Paris thus looks at what Asian art was imagined to do for Europe. This book will be of interest to scholars and students interested in art history, travel imagery, museum studies, cross-cultural encounters, and modern transnational histories.",Art,210,N/A,0,en

Entropy Theory and its Application in Environmental and Water Engineering,Vijay P. Singh,John Wiley & Sons,2013-01-10,"Entropy Theory and its Application in Environmental and Water Engineering responds to the need for a book that deals with basic concepts of entropy theory from a hydrologic and water engineering perspective and then for a book that deals with applications of these concepts to a range of water engineering problems. The range of applications of entropy is constantly expanding and new areas finding a use for the theory are continually emerging. The applications of concepts and techniques vary across different subject areas and this book aims to relate them directly to practical problems of environmental and water engineering. The book presents and explains the Principle of Maximum Entropy (POME) and the Principle of Minimum Cross Entropy (POMCE) and their applications to different types of probability distributions. Spatial and inverse spatial entropy are important for urban planning and are presented with clarity. Maximum entropy spectral analysis and minimum cross entropy spectral analysis are powerful techniques for addressing a variety of problems faced by environmental and water scientists and engineers and are described here with illustrative examples. Giving a thorough introduction to the use of entropy to measure the unpredictability in environmental and water systems this book will add an essential statistical method to the toolkit of postgraduates, researchers and academic hydrologists, water resource managers, environmental scientists and engineers. It will also offer a valuable resource for professionals in the same areas, governmental organizations, private companies as well as students in earth sciences, civil and agricultural engineering, and agricultural and rangeland sciences. This book: Provides a thorough introduction to entropy for beginners and more experienced users Uses numerous examples to illustrate the applications of the theoretical principles Allows the reader to apply entropy theory to the solution of practical problems Assumes minimal existing mathematical knowledge Discusses the theory and its various aspects in both univariate and bivariate cases Covers newly expanding areas including neural networks from an entropy perspective and future developments.",Science,787,N/A,0,en

The Climate Bonus,Alison Smith,Routledge,2013-06-26,"We urgently need to transform to a low carbon society, yet our progress is painfully slow, in part because there is widespread public concern that this will require sacrifice and high costs. But this need not be the case. Many carbon reduction policies provide a range of additional benefits, from reduced air pollution and increased energy security to financial savings and healthier lifestyles, that can offset the costs of climate action. This book maps out the links between low carbon policies and their co-benefits, and shows how low carbon policies can lead to cleaner air and water, conservation of forests, more sustainable agriculture, less waste, safer and more secure energy, cost savings for households and businesses and a stronger and more stable economy. The book discusses the ways in which joined-up policies can help to maximise the synergies and minimise the conflicts between climate policy and other aspects of sustainability. Through rigorous analysis of the facts, the author presents well-reasoned and evidenced recommendations for policy-makers and all those with an interest in making a healthier and happier society. This book shows us how, instead of being paralysed by the threat of climate change, we can use it as a stimulus to escape from our dependence on polluting fossil fuels, and make the transition to a cleaner, safer and more sustainable future.",Political Science,489,N/A,0,en

Travel Tales Monthly,"Michael Brein, Ph.D.","Michael Brein, Inc.",2014-10-20,"Michael Brein’s Travel Tales Monthly is a monthly bookazine release of simply incredible travel tales, told 10 at a time. Michael Brein, aka The Travel Psychologist has made it his life’s passion to interview, now more than 1,750 world adventurers and travelers he has met throughout his world travels to more than 125 countries over the last four decades. “You wouldn’t believe the incredible stories people have told me about their travels,” says Michael when he talks about the nearly 10,000 travel tales he has amassed over the years in this way. Stories run the gamut of the good, the wonderful, and the magical, as well as, indeed, the bad, the horrible, and the truly horrific! These are--simply stated--great stories! Stories are told mainly in the present tense by interviewees, but, sadly, some are revealed about travelers who unfortunately did not live to tell their tales. These have often been related by weary, bleary-eyed travelers who felt that these tales should also be told. Into the pages of Travel Tales Monthly and then into the volumes of The Travel Psychologist Travel Tales Series ebooks will go the formerly untold tales of close calls, dangers, and great escapes; the mystical, spiritual, and the paranormal; meeting people, making friends, and incredible hospitality; harassment by beggars, hustlers, and con artists of all kinds; formidable characters met and phenomenal experiences had; and much, much more—all in the form of about 200 ebooks covering all sorts of subjects, countries and themes. The intent of Travel Tales Monthly is to present collections of tales each month, introducing you to the stories as they make their way into The Travel Psychologist Travel Tales Series in the form of completed standalone ebooks in the series. The telling of travel stories by Michael Brein via his Travel Tales Monthly as well as his travel tales ebook series is travel storytelling par excellence, but with one significant difference: Michael Brein is the world’s first and perhaps only travel psychologist. Thus, he tells the travel stories with a particular, unique psychological bent—there’s a lot of travel psychology behind everyone’s sharing of their experiences. With deft and persistence, Michael hones in on and ferrets out the usually heretofore unexplored and untold truly psychological netherworld that lurks just below the surface of most people’s travel experiences, bringing them into full view. For instance, what led up to a good or wonderful travel experience? How can we experience more of same? What was behind the horrific life-threatening or pickpocketing experience that got you caught up in in that one horrendous moment? Let’s unravel bad experiences piece by piece to see how this might have been avoided in the first place. Let’s unfold wonderful travel experiences to see how these may be repeated. What are some of the philosophical and life-changing insights gained from mystical experiences in one’s travels? What’s it like to experience your roots? How does it feel to be the first white person that others have ever seen? How does it feel like to be touched by a stranger? What is real fear like? On and on, Michael Brein delves into travel experiences from the standpoint of what is interesting, what is to be learned, and what is to be gained? How can this be made to happen again? Or NOT at all? Michael Brein is sure that you will be mesmerized and captivated by the stories you read in his Travel Tales Monthly and in his Travel Psychologist Travel Tales Series. In this Issue (No. 4 Oct 2014): Michael Brein’s Travel Tales Monthly Bookazine Issue No. 4 for October 2014 contains among the best travel stories from Michael’s huge collection of about 10,000 travel tales that he has gathered in interviews with nearly 1,750 world travelers and adventurers during his four decades of travel to more than 125 countries throughout the world. The 10 travel tales that are featured for October, as well as each following month, include a fascinating mix of travel stories as well as a few brief vignettes. The October issue features such tales as The Hug, Les Ugly Americains, and The Red Dodge, whereby travelers get themselves into trouble by behaving and acting in ways that make them ‘Persona Non-Grata’ overseas. It is difficult enough to be culturally sensitive back home. But what are the consequences of being insensitive in a strange foreign land? What do you do? And, if that is not enough for you, how about Run! Run!, our featured story for this month about an ’ugly’ American, who, in spite of himself, commits a series of simple cultural faux pas in Kathmandu—contrary to the good advice of a friend—a ‘beautiful’ American this time—which gets out of hand and morphs into a very scary, close call involving his worst nightmare and a possible threat to his life. You are going to consider this month what goes into being the ‘Good, Bad, and the Ugly’ of travel. And you will also see some aspects of travel that you may not ever have considered before. And, once again, you will certainly experience vicariously those odd vagaries of travel-life that can await you and can suddenly appear just around the corner at about any turn along the way. Dr. Loren Ekroth, our guest contributor for this month, revisits us with some very good travel advice and ‘picks.’",Travel,95,N/A,0,en

Aviation Investment,Doramas Jorge-Calderón,Routledge,2020-12-28,"Aviation Investment uniquely addresses investment appraisal methods across the key industries that make up the aviation sector, including the airports, air traffic management, airline and aircraft manufacturing – or aeronautic – industries. This practice-oriented book presents methods through realistic case studies. It covers both economic appraisal, or cost-benefit analysis, measuring the value of projects to society, and financial appraisal, valuing projects as cash generators. This substantially expanded second edition covers in greater detail the treatment of environmental emissions, paying particular attention to climate change. It addresses the treatment of Market-Based Mechanisms (MBMs), including cap and trade systems like ETS and offset systems like CORSIA, and compares them to environmental taxes. It also addresses the adjustments needed to measure the foreign exchange generating value of projects, relevant in the presence of trade barriers. The new edition includes two new project types. One is airport relocations, perhaps the most complex type of airport projects, where the economic case is often more nuanced than may be apparent. The second is the re-introduction of supersonic travel. Aviation Investment offers all aviation sub-sectors a single-source reference, bringing together the theoretical background of the economic appraisal literature and aviation investment in practice. It is written in a style that is accessible to non-academic professionals, using formulae only where strictly necessary to enable practical applications, and benefits from the substantial practical experience of the author.",Business & Economics,301,N/A,0,en

Economics of Urban Highway Congestion and Pricing,"J. F. McDonald, Edmond L. d'Ouville, Louie Nan Liu",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Economics of Urban Highway Congestion and Pricing offers the most extensive examination to date of the relationship between congestion tolls and highway capacity in the long run. This study breaks new ground in the economic theory of optimal road capacity by including theoretical contributions, empirical studies, and simulation experiments that all pertain to the general topic reflected in the title. The book is organized into four sections: 1) highway traffic flow; 2) commuter choice of tollways versus freeways; 3) congestion pricing in the short run; and 4) road capacity and pricing in the long run. In particular, the first section on highway traffic flow examines the chief models and empirical studies of vehicular flow on urban highways. The second section of the book is a theoretical and empirical examination of the choice that commuters make between urban tollways and freeways. The third section is devoted to congestion pricing in the short run, the time period in which the urban highway facilities are taken as given. This section is the most important part of the book from the standpoint of public policy. The fourth and last section of the book considers road capacity and pricing in the long run, with the concluding chapter gathering the authors' main results in one place and making recommendations both for current policy and for future research.",Business & Economics,240,N/A,0,en

A Textbook of Tourism for Class X (A.Y. 2023-24)Onward,Singdha Kainthola,Goyal Brothers Prakashan,2023-05-20,"A Textbook of Tourism [Subject Code 406] for class 10 is designed to facilitate the job role of Travel Agent/Tour Operator. This book has been developed as per the latest syllabus and examination pattern prescribed by the CBSE. The language in the book is deliberately kept to be reader-friendly, allowing easy accessibility and grasp of knowledge. In addition, the pictures and diagrams are used to give the readers a good understanding of the topics without any difficulties. Tourism has grown significantly in the last decade. Tourism is the world's largest and fastestgrowing industry and also the largest source of income and employment. India is a diverse country, and its diversity attracts visitors from around the world. India is a developing nation, and tourism provides emerging and developing nations with excellent opportunities to strengthen their economies, contribute to local infrastructure, preserve the environment and cultural treasures and traditions, and lessen poverty and inequality. The government is emphasising in developing and promoting tourism. It has also introduced various policies and schemes to boost the tourism industry by providing more job opportunities in the society. It has also started several short-term vocational courses related to the travel and tourism sector. With these courses, individuals can quickly acquire the necessary skills to join the travel industry. In addition, CBSE has introduced Tourism as a vocational course at the school level. In the previous class, you learned some basics of travel and tourism, and this book will extend your knowledge of those topics. This book will teach you about different types of tourism, tourism's social, economic, and cultural impact, tourism organisations, tourism businesses, and tourism products, as well as requirement of soft skills in tourism. Tourism is classified as a service industry, and because of the nature of the jobs in the tourism industry, a person should have a high level of soft skills. This book provides knowledge about those soft skills required for this industry. In addition, this book will teach you about different personality traits and how to develop your personality. Each chapter has been divided into the foil owing parts: (a) Introduction: It introduces you to the chapter's topic and learning objectives. (b) Relevant Knowledge: This part of the unit provides you with the relevant information on the topics covered. The knowledge developed through this part will enable the students to perform certain activities listed at the end of each topic. (c) Assignment: The various questions included in this part of the chapter will help the students to check their understanding of the topics learned. We hope that this book will help further enhance the understanding and knowledge of the tourism sector. We also hope that this book will boost the students' morale and enormously benefit the teachers. This book attempts to cover almost every aspect of tourism and travel that can help students become tourism professionals. Constructive suggestions for the improvement of the book are most welcome. -Authors",Juvenile Nonfiction,122,N/A,0,en

School Travel,Great Britain. Parliament. House of Commons. Transport Committee,The Stationery Office,2009,"In a report out today (HCP 352 session 08/09 ISBN 9780215529206), the House of Commons Transport Select Committee tells education and transport ministers they must do far more to produce a modal shift away from cars towards public transport, dedicated school transport including ’Yellow Buses', walking and safer cycling schemes for British school children. The Transport Committee Chairman Louise Ellman MP says: ""Young people deserve safe and affordable travel to education, leisure and employment. The journeys people make when young will influence their preferences and habits in adulthood."" Also ""Both the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Department for Transport urgently need to identify how they are going to ensure children and young adults are not denied opportunities because public transport is either inadequate or too costly. In particular, travel should not present a barrier to accessing the new Diploma courses. For similar reasons much more should be done to identify children eligible for free school transport."" The Committee recognise in their report that no single model will suit all situations and that car travel to school can be the most suitable method in some circumstances. However, they call on ministers to: provide high quality guidance and examples of best practice to illustrate when a dedicated school bus system is appropriate; top up the Education Maintenance Allowance for students from low income families and extend similar support for young people engaged in the new 14-19 diplomas; do more to encourage local authorities to identify pupils eligible for free school transport; consider the viability of a concessionary scheme offering reduced fares to young people; ensure that the Department for Transport, Department of Health and the Department for Children, Schools and Families work together so that national policy and practical implementation at the local level deliver both value for money and a greater number of joint initiatives that promote walking and cycling; help local authorities address the inherent tension between school choice and travel impact by raising awareness of sustainable school travel issues amongst parents and young people when they are selecting schools; in rural areas, review whether the maximum travel distance under which free transport may be provided allows for sufficient choice of schools; monitor the effectiveness of School Travel Plans. The Committee also calls on local authorities to consider new ways to fund and run innovative schemes that integrate transport, health and educational objectives for school travel.",Education,250,N/A,0,en

Preference Data for Environmental Valuation,"John Whitehead, Tim Haab, Ju-Chin Huang",Routledge,2012-03-15,"The monetary valuation of environmental goods and services has evolved from a fringe field of study in the late 1970s and early 1980s to a primary focus of environmental economists over the past decade. Despite its rapid growth, practitioners of valuation techniques often find themselves defending their practices to both users of the results of applied studies and, perhaps more troubling, to other practitioners. One of the more heated threads of this internal debate over valuation techniques revolves around the types of data to use in performing a valuation study. In the infant years of the development of valuation techniques, two schools of thought emerged: the revealed preference school and the stated preference school, the latter of which is perhaps most associated with the contingent valuation method. In the midst of this debate an exciting new approach to non-market valuation was developed in the 1990s: a combination and joint estimation of revealed preference and stated preference data. There are two primary objectives for this book. One objective is to fill a gap in the nonmarket valuation ""primer"" literature. A number of books have appeared over the past decade that develop the theory and methods of nonmarket valuation but each takes an individual nonmarket valuation method approach. This book considers each of these valuation methods in combination with another method. These relationships can be exploited econometrically to obtain more valid and reliable estimates of willingness-to-pay relative to the individual methods. The second objective is to showcase recent and novel applications of data combination and joint estimation via a set of original, state-of-the-art studies that are contributed by leading researchers in the field. This book will be accessible to economists and consultants working in business or government, as well as an invaluable resource for researchers and students alike.",Business & Economics,343,N/A,0,en
Revealed Preference Approaches to Environmental Valuation Volumes I and II,Catherine L. Kling,Routledge,2019-01-22,"In this two volume collection the editors have chosen a sample of some of the most essential and inspirational articles and papers for understanding revealed preference methods to value environmental amenities. The papers cover the gamut of methods that are typically classified as revealed preference approaches - including: recreation demand models, hedonic methods, and averting behavior methods, as well as efforts to combine stated and revealed preferences. While this collection is far from exhaustive, the editors have included papers they believe will represent the state of the art in the theory and application of revealed preference methods, contribute to development of the state of the art, or raise fundamental challenges and insights that will drive the research agenda in the coming years.",Business & Economics,610,N/A,0,en

Tourism in South and Southeast Asia,"C. Michael Hall, Stephen Page",Routledge,2012-10-12,"'Tourism in South and South East Asia' is a comprehensive and solid introduction to tourism in South and South East Asia with a specific appeal both to institutions in the region, and other institutions who wish to expose students to one of the most dynamic tourism regions in the world. Despite downturns in outbound tourism (due to the current economic crisis), inbound tourism from outside the region has continued to increase with governments placing more emphasis on the economic significance of tourism than ever. 'Tourism in South and South East Asia' is the first tourism book to deal comprehensively with the implications of the Asian economic crisis for tourism. With South and South East Asia set to be the fastest growing area of tourism activity in the world well into the next century, 'Tourism in South and South East Asia' is an essential text for students both within and outside of this region. Dealing with concepts, themes and issues which are pertinent to tourism development, planning, marketing and management; these two internationally known authors have produced an authoritative text that covers all aspects of this topic through the use of illustrative and relevant case studies.",Business & Economics,304,N/A,0,en

Balancing Environment and Development,Lloyd S. Dixon,Rand Corporation,2008,"The Western Riverside County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP) is an ambitious effort to balance development and environmental concerns in an area of rapid urban growth. In return for setting up a 500,000-acre conservation reserve, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the California Department of Fish and Game granted the county and cities in western Riverside County a 75-year ""take"" permit for endangered species. The take permit allows the cities and county to approve development projects outside the reserve that could negatively affect 146 sensitive plant and animal species. The plan is supposed to speed the frequently time-consuming and litigious process of permitting new highway and development projects while establishing an integrated conservation reserve rather than the patchwork of uncoordinated reserves that was so often the case in the past. The Western Riverside County Regional Conservation Authority (RCA) acquires land for and manages the reserve. This monograph examines the value of the land needed for the reserve, the financial consequences of acquiring the land over different periods of time, and the projected costs of operating the reserve. It compares projected costs and revenues and identifies potential funding sources to fill any resulting funding gap. It also examines the prospect for achieving the MSHCP's habitat-conservation goals and whether the MSHCP has, in fact, streamlined the permitting processes. Finally, it identifies issues that the RCA Board of Directors, RCA staff, and stakeholders should address to ensure the plan's success and the ongoing economic and ecological health of the county",Business & Economics,271,N/A,0,en

Aircraft Propellers,Carl M. Harlacher,N/A,1941,"Power to. drive the airplane through the air is furnished by the engine, the brake horsepower of which is transformed into thrust by the propeller. The propeller may be described as a twisted airfoil of irregular plan form. In order to analyze the blade element, each blade is divided into 6-inch sections and each section is set at the proper angle to the relative air (fig. 1). The sections near the tip of the propeller travel at a higher peripheral speed than those near the hub, consequently the blade angles become less as the tip is approached. The sections from 12 to 18 inches from the hub are thick ill order to give strength to the propeller, and as a result, deliver little or no thrust. In general, each section is so designed and set at such an angle that when the propeller is being operated at a given rotative and forward speed, the best efficiency of each section will be obtained.",Airplanes,136,N/A,0,en

The Lincoln Highway: A Read with Jenna Pick,Amor Towles,Penguin,2021-10-05,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER More than ONE MILLION copies sold A TODAY Show Read with Jenna Book Club Pick A New York Times Notable Book, a New York Times Readers’ Choice Best Book of the Century, and Chosen by Oprah Daily, Time, NPR, The Washington Post, Bill Gates and Barack Obama as a Best Book of the Year “Wise and wildly entertaining . . . permeated with light, wit, youth.” —The New York Times Book Review “A classic that we will read for years to come.” —Jenna Bush Hager, Read with Jenna book club “Fantastic. Set in 1954, Towles uses the story of two brothers to show that our personal journeys are never as linear or predictable as we might hope.” —Bill Gates “A real joyride . . . elegantly constructed and compulsively readable.” —NPR The bestselling author of A Gentleman in Moscow and Rules of Civility and master of absorbing, sophisticated fiction returns with a stylish and propulsive novel set in 1950s America In June, 1954, eighteen-year-old Emmett Watson is driven home to Nebraska by the warden of the juvenile work farm where he has just served fifteen months for involuntary manslaughter. His mother long gone, his father recently deceased, and the family farm foreclosed upon by the bank, Emmett's intention is to pick up his eight-year-old brother, Billy, and head to California where they can start their lives anew. But when the warden drives away, Emmett discovers that two friends from the work farm have hidden themselves in the trunk of the warden's car. Together, they have hatched an altogether different plan for Emmett's future, one that will take them all on a fateful journey in the opposite direction—to the City of New York. Spanning just ten days and told from multiple points of view, Towles's third novel will satisfy fans of his multi-layered literary styling while providing them an array of new and richly imagined settings, characters, and themes. “Once again, I was wowed by Towles’s writing—especially because The Lincoln Highway is so different from A Gentleman in Moscow in terms of setting, plot, and themes. Towles is not a one-trick pony. Like all the best storytellers, he has range. He takes inspiration from famous hero’s journeys, including The Iliad, The Odyssey, Hamlet, Huckleberry Finn, and Of Mice and Men. He seems to be saying that our personal journeys are never as linear or predictable as an interstate highway. But, he suggests, when something (or someone) tries to steer us off course, it is possible to take the wheel.” – Bill Gates",Fiction,593,N/A,0,en

Love & Olives,Jenna Evans Welch,Simon & Schuster Books for Young Readers,2020-11-10,"A New York Times Bestseller From the New York Times bestselling author of Love & Gelato comes a Mamma Mia!–inspired tale about a teen girl finding romance while trying to connect with her absent father in beautiful Santorini, Greece. Liv Varanakis doesn’t have a lot of fond memories of her father, which makes sense—he fled to Greece when she was only eight. What Liv does remember, though, is their shared love for Greek myths and the lost city of Atlantis. So when Liv suddenly receives a postcard from her father explaining that National Geographic is funding a documentary about his theories on Atlantis—and will she fly out to Greece and help?—Liv jumps at the opportunity. But when she arrives to gorgeous Santorini, things are a little…awkward. There are so many questions, so many emotions that flood to the surface after seeing her father for the first time in years. And yet Liv doesn’t want their past to get in the way of a possible reconciliation. She also definitely doesn’t want Theo—her father’s charismatic so-called “protégé”—to witness her struggle. And that means diving into all that Santorini has to offer—the beautiful sunsets, the turquoise water, the hidden caves, and the delicious cuisine. But not everything on the Greek island is as perfect as it seems. Because as Liv slowly begins to discover, her father may not have invited her to Greece for Atlantis, but for something much more important.",Young Adult Fiction,512,N/A,0,en

This one-of-a kind story is must read for fans of Brandon Mull and Soman Chainani, and the start of a thrilling tale from a masterful storyteller. Sam Miracle’s life is made up of dreams, dreams where he’s a courageous, legendary hero instead of a foster kid with two bad arms that can barely move. Sometimes these dreams feel so real, they seem like forgotten memories. And sometimes they make him believe that his arms might come alive again. But Sam is about to discover that the world he knows and the world he imagines are separated by only one thing: time. And that separation is only an illusion. The laws of time can be bent and shifted by people with special magic that allows them to travel through the past, present, and future. But not all of these “time walkers” can be trusted. One is out to protect Sam so that he can accept his greatest destiny, and another is out to kill him so that a prophecy will never be fulfilled. However, it’s an adventurous girl named Glory and two peculiar snakes who show Sam the way through the dark paths of yesterday to help him make sure there will be a tomorrow for every last person on earth.",Juvenile Fiction,180,N/A,0,en

Amid the constant rain of German bombs and the escalating violence of World War II, British parents by the thousands chose to send their children out of the country: the wealthy, independently; the poor, through a government relocation program called CORB. In September 1940, passenger liner SS City of Benares set sail for Canada with one hundred children on board.

Fire Road,Kim Phuc Phan Thi,NavPress,2017-10-03,"Get out! Run! We must leave this place! They are going to destroy this whole place! Go, children, run first! Go now! These were the final shouts nine year-old Kim Phuc heard before her world dissolved into flames—before napalm bombs fell from the sky, burning away her clothing and searing deep into her skin. It’s a moment forever captured, an iconic image that has come to define the horror and violence of the Vietnam War. Kim was left for dead in a morgue; no one expected her to survive the attack. Napalm meant fire, and fire meant death. Against all odds, Kim lived—but her journey toward healing was only beginning. When the napalm bombs dropped, everything Kim knew and relied on exploded along with them: her home, her country’s freedom, her childhood innocence and happiness. The coming years would be marked by excruciating treatments for her burns and unrelenting physical pain throughout her body, which were constant reminders of that terrible day. Kim survived the pain of her body ablaze, but how could she possibly survive the pain of her devastated soul? Fire Road is the true story of how she found the answer in a God who suffered Himself; a Savior who truly understood and cared about the depths of her pain. Fire Road is a story of horror and hope, a harrowing tale of a life changed in an instant—and the power and resilience that can only be found in the power of God’s mercy and love.",Religion,305,N/A,0,en

Lands of Lost Borders,Kate Harris,Vintage Canada,2019-05-07,"NATIONAL BESTSELLER WINNER OF THE RBC TAYLOR PRIZE WINNER OF THE EDNA STAEBLER AWARD FOR CREATIVE NON-FICTION ""Every day on a bike trip is like the one before--but it is also completely different, or perhaps you are different, woken up in new ways by the mile."" As a teenager, Kate Harris realized that the career she most craved--that of a generalist explorer, equal parts swashbuckler and philosopher--had gone extinct. From her small-town home in Ontario, it seemed as if Marco Polo, Magellan and their like had long ago mapped the whole earth. So she vowed to become a scientist and go to Mars. To pass the time before she could launch into outer space, Kate set off by bicycle down a short section of the fabled Silk Road with her childhood friend Mel Yule, then settled down to study at Oxford and MIT. Eventually the truth dawned on her: an explorer, in any day and age, is by definition the kind of person who refuses to live between the lines. And Harris had soared most fully out of bounds right here on Earth, travelling a bygone trading route on her bicycle. So she quit the laboratory and hit the Silk Road again with Mel, this time determined to bike it from the beginning to end. Like Rebecca Solnit and Pico Iyer before her, Kate Harris offers a travel narrative at once exuberant and meditative, wry and rapturous. Weaving adventure and deep reflection with the history of science and exploration, Lands of Lost Borders explores the nature of limits and the wildness of a world that, like the self and like the stars, can never be fully mapped.",Biography & Autobiography,0,N/A,0,en
These Precious Days,Ann Patchett,HarperCollins,2021-11-23,"The beloved New York Times bestselling author reflects on home, family, friendships and writing in this deeply personal collection of essays. ""The elegance of Patchett’s prose is seductive and inviting: with Patchett as a guide, readers will really get to grips with the power of struggles, failures, and triumphs alike."" —Publisher's Weekly “Any story that starts will also end.” As a writer, Ann Patchett knows what the outcome of her fiction will be. Life, however, often takes turns we do not see coming. Patchett ponders this truth in these wise essays that afford a fresh and intimate look into her mind and heart. At the center of These Precious Days is the title essay, a surprising and moving meditation on an unexpected friendship that explores “what it means to be seen, to find someone with whom you can be your best and most complete self.” When Patchett chose an early galley of actor and producer Tom Hanks’ short story collection to read one night before bed, she had no idea that this single choice would be life changing. It would introduce her to a remarkable woman—Tom’s brilliant assistant Sooki—with whom she would form a profound bond that held monumental consequences for them both. A literary alchemist, Patchett plumbs the depths of her experiences to create gold: engaging and moving pieces that are both self-portrait and landscape, each vibrant with emotion and rich in insight. Turning her writer’s eye on her own experiences, she transforms the private into the universal, providing us all a way to look at our own worlds anew, and reminds how fleeting and enigmatic life can be. From the enchantments of Kate DiCamillo’s children’s books (author of The Beatryce Prophecy) to youthful memories of Paris; the cherished life gifts given by her three fathers to the unexpected influence of Charles Schultz’s Snoopy; the expansive vision of Eudora Welty to the importance of knitting, Patchett connects life and art as she illuminates what matters most. Infused with the author’s grace, wit, and warmth, the pieces in These Precious Days resonate deep in the soul, leaving an indelible mark—and demonstrate why Ann Patchett is one of the most celebrated writers of our time.",Biography & Autobiography,320,N/A,0,en

I think it will open doors for many.” Heartfelt and awe-inspiring, Leigh Ann Henion’s Phenomenal is a moving tale of physical grandeur and emotional transformation, a journey around the world that ultimately explores the depths of the human heart. A journalist and young mother, Henion combines her own varied experiences as a parent with a panoramic tour of the world’s most extraordinary natural wonders. Phenomenal begins in hardship: with Henion deeply shaken by the birth of her beloved son, shocked at the adversity a young mother faces with a newborn. The lack of sleep, the shrinking social circle, the health difficulties all collide and force Henion to ask hard questions about our accepted wisdom on parenting and the lives of women. Convinced that the greatest key to happiness—both her own and that of her family—lies in periodically venturing into the wider world beyond home, Henion sets out on a global trek to rekindle her sense of wonder. Henion’s quest takes her far afield, but it swiftly teaches her that freedom is its own form of parenting—one that ultimately allows her to meet her son on his own terms with a visceral understanding of the awe he experiences every day at the fresh new world. Whether standing on the still-burning volcanoes of Hawai‘i or in the fearsome lightning storms of Venezuela, amid the vast animal movements of Tanzania or the elegant butterfly migrations of Mexico, Henion relates a world of sublimity and revelation. Henion’s spiritual wanderlust puts her in the path of modern-day shamans, reindeer herders, and astrophysicists. She meets laypeople from all over the world, from all walks of life, going to great lengths to chase migrations, auroras, eclipses, and other phenomena. These seekers trust their instincts, follow their passions, shape their days into the lives they most want to lead. And, somewhere along the way, Leigh Ann Henion becomes one of them. A breathtaking memoir, Phenomenal reveals unforgettable truths about motherhood, spirituality, and the beauty of nature.

If the Oceans Were Ink,Carla Power,Macmillan + ORM,2015-04-07,"PULITZER PRIZE FINALIST • NATIONAL BOOK AWARD FINALIST • Hailed by The Washington Post as “mandatory reading,” and praised by Fareed Zakaria as “intelligent, compassionate, and revealing,” a powerful journey to help bridge one of the greatest divides shaping our world today. If the Oceans Were Ink is Carla Power's eye-opening story of how she and her longtime friend Sheikh Mohammad Akram Nadwi found a way to confront ugly stereotypes and persistent misperceptions that were cleaving their communities. Their friendship-between a secular American and a madrasa-trained sheikh-had always seemed unlikely, but now they were frustrated and bewildered by the battles being fought in their names. Both knew that a close look at the Quran would reveal a faith that preached peace and not mass murder; respect for women and not oppression. And so they embarked on a yearlong journey through the controversial text. A journalist who grew up in the Midwest and the Middle East, Power offers her unique vantage point on the Quran's most provocative verses as she debates with Akram at cafes, family gatherings, and packed lecture halls, conversations filled with both good humor and powerful insights. Their story takes them to madrasas in India and pilgrimage sites in Mecca, as they encounter politicians and jihadis, feminist activists and conservative scholars. Armed with a new understanding of each other's worldviews, Power and Akram offer eye-opening perspectives, destroy long-held myths, and reveal startling connections between worlds that have seemed hopelessly divided for far too long. Praise for If the Oceans Were Ink “A vibrant tale of a friendship.... If the Oceans Were Ink is a welcome and nuanced look at Islam [and] goes a long way toward combating the dehumanizing stereotypes of Muslims that are all too common.... If the Oceans Were Ink should be mandatory reading for the 52 percent of Americans who admit to not knowing enough about Muslims.”—The Washington Post “For all those who wonder what Islam says about war and peace, men and women, Jews and gentiles, this is the book to read. It is a conversation among well-meaning friends—intelligent, compassionate, and revealing—the kind that needs to be taking place around the world.”—Fareed Zakaria, author of The Post-American World “Carla Power’s intimate portrait of the Quran, told with nuance and great elegance, captures the extraordinary, living debate over the Muslim holy book’s very essence. A spirited, compelling read.”—Azadeh Moaveni, author of Lipstick Jihad “Unique, masterful, and deeply engaging. Carla Power takes the reader on an extraordinary journey in interfaith understanding as she debates and discovers the Quran’s message, meaning, and values on peace and violence, gender and veiling, religious pluralism and tolerance.”—John L.

Backroads of Paradise,Cathy Salustri,University Press of Florida,2016-08-25,"In the 1930s, the Federal Writers' Project sent mostly anonymous writers, but also Zora Neale Hurston and Stetson Kennedy, into the depths of Florida to reveal its splendor to the world. The FWP and the State of Florida jointly published the results as Florida: A Guide to the Southernmost State, which included twenty-two driving tours of the state's main roads. Eventually, after Eisenhower built the interstates, drivers bypassed the small towns that thrived along these roads in favor of making better time. Those main roads are now the state's backroads—forgotten by all but local residents, a few commuters, and dedicated road-trippers. Retracing the original routes in the Guide, Cathy Salustri rekindles our notions of paradise by bringing a modern eye to the historic travelogues. Salustri's 5,000-mile road trip reveals a patchwork quilt of Florida cultures: startling pockets of history and environmental bliss stitched against the blight of strip malls and franchise restaurants. The journey begins on US 98, heading west toward the Florida/Alabama state line, where coastal towns dot the roadway. Here, locals depend on the tourism industry, spurred by sugar sand beaches, as well as the abundance of local seafood. On US 41, Salustri takes us past the state's only whitewater rapids, a retired carnie town, and a dazzling array of springs, swamps, and rivers interspersed with farms that produce a bounty of fruit. Along US 17, she stops for milkshakes and hamburgers at Florida's oldest diner and visits a collection of springs interconnected by underwater mazes tumbling through white spongy limestone, before stopping in Arcadia, where men still bring cattle to auction. Desperately searching for skunk apes, the Sunshine State's version of Bigfoot, she encounters more than one gator on her way through the Everglades, Ochopee, and the Skunk Ape Research Headquarters. Following the original Guide, Salustri crisscrosses the state from the panhandle to the Keys. She guides readers through forgotten and unknown corners of the state--nude beaches, a rattlesnake cannery, Devil's Millhopper in Gainesville--as well as more familiar haunts--Kennedy Space Center and The Villages, ""Florida’s Friendliest Retirement Hometown."" Woven through these journeys are nuggets of history, environmental debates about Florida's future, and a narrative that combines humor with a strong affection for an oft-maligned state. Today, Salustri urges, tourists need a new nudge to get off the interstates or away from Disney in order to discover the real Florida. Her travel narrative, following what are now backroads and scenic routes, guides armchair travelers and road warriors alike to historic sites, natural wonders, and notable man-made attractions--comparing the past views with the present landscape and commenting on the changes, some barely noticeable, others extreme, along the way.",History,220,N/A,0,en

Hitler's American Model,James Q. Whitman,Princeton University Press,2017-02-14,"How American race law provided a blueprint for Nazi Germany Nazism triumphed in Germany during the high era of Jim Crow laws in the United States. Did the American regime of racial oppression in any way inspire the Nazis? The unsettling answer is yes. In Hitler's American Model, James Whitman presents a detailed investigation of the American impact on the notorious Nuremberg Laws, the centerpiece anti-Jewish legislation of the Nazi regime. Contrary to those who have insisted that there was no meaningful connection between American and German racial repression, Whitman demonstrates that the Nazis took a real, sustained, significant, and revealing interest in American race policies. As Whitman shows, the Nuremberg Laws were crafted in an atmosphere of considerable attention to the precedents American race laws had to offer. German praise for American practices, already found in Hitler's Mein Kampf, was continuous throughout the early 1930s, and the most radical Nazi lawyers were eager advocates of the use of American models. But while Jim Crow segregation was one aspect of American law that appealed to Nazi radicals, it was not the most consequential one. Rather, both American citizenship and antimiscegenation laws proved directly relevant to the two principal Nuremberg Laws—the Citizenship Law and the Blood Law. Whitman looks at the ultimate, ugly irony that when Nazis rejected American practices, it was sometimes not because they found them too enlightened, but too harsh. Indelibly linking American race laws to the shaping of Nazi policies in Germany, Hitler's American Model upends understandings of America's influence on racist practices in the wider world.",History,223,N/A,0,en

WHO Expert Consultation on Rabies,World Health Organization,World Health Organization,2013,"""Although there is debate about the estimated health burden of rabies, the estimates of direct mortality and the DALYs due to rabies are among the highest of the neglected tropical diseases. Poor surveillance, underreporting in many developing countries, frequent misdiagnosis of rabies, and an absence of coordination among all the sectors involved are likely to lead to underestimation of the scale of the disease It is clear, however, that rabies disproportionately affects poor rural communities, and particularly children. Most of the expenditure for post- exposure prophylaxis is borne by those who can least afford it. As a result of growing dog and human populations, the burden of human deaths from rabies and the economic costs will continue to escalate in the absence of concerted efforts and investment for control. Since the first WHO Expert Consultation on Rabies in 2004, WHO and its network of collaborating centres on rabies, specialized national institutions, members of the WHO Expert Advisory Panel on Rabies and partners such as the Gates Foundation, the Global Alliance for Rabies Control and the Partnership for Rabies Prevention, have been advocating the feasibility of rabies elimination regionally and globally and promoting research into sustainable cost-effective strategies. Those joint efforts have begun to break the cycle of rabies neglect, and rabies is becoming recognized as a priority for investment. This Consultation concluded that human dog-transmitted rabies is readily amenable to control, regional elimination in the medium term and even global elimination in the long term. A resolution on major neglected tropical diseases, including rabies, prepared for submission to the World Health Assembly in May 2013 aims at securing Member States' commitment to the control, elimination or eradication of these diseases. Endorsement of the resolution would open the door for exciting advances in rabies prevention and control.""--Publisher's description.",Business & Economics,149,5,1,en

"Travel, Tourism, and Identity",Gabriel R. Ricci,Routledge,2017-09-29,"Travel, Tourism and Identity addresses the psychological and social adjustments that occur when people make contact with others outside their social, cultural, or linguistic groups. Whether such contact is the result of tourism, seeking exile, or relocating abroad, the volume's contributors demonstrate how one's identity, cultural assumptions, and worldview can be brought into question. In some cases, the traveller finds that bridging the social and cultural gap between himself and the new society is fairly easy. In other cases, the traveller discovers that reorienting himself requires absorbing a new cultural history and traditions. The contributors argue that making these adjustments will surely enhance the traveller's or tourist's experience; otherwise the traveller or tourist will be at risk of becoming a marginalized figure, one disconnected from the society that surrounds him. This latest volume in the Culture & Civilization series features a collection of essays on travel and tourism. The essays cover a range of topics from historical travels to modern social identities. They discuss ancient travels, contemporary travels in Europe, Africa and sustainable eco-tourism, and the politics of tourism. Essays also address experiences of Grenada's ""Spice Island"" identity, and the effects of globalization and migrations on personal identity.",Social Science,295,N/A,0,en

Romantic Writing and Pedestrian Travel,R. Jarvis,Springer,1997-08-04,"Romantic Writing and Pedestrian Travel is an exploration of the relationship between walking and writing. Robin Jarvis here reconstructs the scene of walking, both in Britain and on the Continent, in the 1790s, and analyses the mentality and motives of the early pedestrian traveller. He then discusses the impact of this cultural revolution on the creativity of major Romantic writers, focusing especially on William and Dorothy Wordsworth, Coleridge, Clare, Keats, Hazlitt and Hunt. In readings which engage current debates around literature and travel, landscape aesthetics, ecocriticism, the poetics of gender, and the materiality of Romantic discourse, Jarvis demonstrates how walking became not only a powerful means of self-enfranchisement but also the focus of restless textual energies.",Literary Criticism,256,N/A,0,en

Networks in Action,"David Batten, John Casti, Roland Thord",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"fifteen countries in Scandinavia, Europe, Asia, Australia, and U.S.A. All of them came to Stockholm primarily because they recognize the growing im portance of networks as complex systems, and their home institutions do not offer any systematic lectures on this topic. The Networks Course was originally initiated jointly by the Summer University of Southern Stockholm Foundation and the County Council of Stockholm, the Swedish Aviation Administration, the Swedish National Road Administration, the Swedish Post, the Swedish State Railways, and Telia AB. They have all served as joint sponsors and hosts for the Course. In the year 1993 the Course also was sponsored by the Swedish Transport and Communications Research Board. All these organizations have supported the publication of a series of key lectures from the Course, to be released as a single volume entitled Networks in Action. It is the ambition of the Foundation to create continuity in its activities for the future. The board has proposed to its principals to take a decision in this direction. It is my expectation that this will be the case for the Networks Course from 1995. This book will then serve as a basic reference for use in an era when the topic of Communication-Networks will be included on a permanent basis in the Summer University's agenda.",Business & Economics,335,N/A,0,en

Penelope Voyages,Karen R. Lawrence,Cornell University Press,2018-08-06,"Looking at travel writing by British women from the seventeenth century on, Karen R. Lawrence asks an intriguing question: What happens when, instead of waiting patiently for Odysseus, Penelope voyages and records her journey—when the woman who is expected to waitsets forth herself and traces an itinerary of her own? Lawrence ranges widely, discussing both fiction and nonfiction and traversing the genres of travel letters, realistic and sentimental novels, ethnography, fantasy, and postmodern narrative. In examining works as dissimilar as Margaret Cavendish's rendition of the Renaissance adventure narrative and Christine Brooke-Rose's postmodernist Between, she explores not only the significance of gender for travel writing, but also the value of travel itself for testing the limits of women's social freedoms and restraints. Lawrence shows how writings by Frances Burney, Mary Wollstonecraft, Sarah Lee, Mary Kingsley, Virginia Woolf, and Brigid Brophy reconceive the meanings of femininity in relation to such apparent oppositions as travel/home, other/self, and foreign/domestic. Despite the differences-historical, generic, political-among these writers, Lawrence maintains, they share common insights. Their accounts overturn the dichotomy between adventure and domesticity, demonstrating something illusory within both the stability of home and the freedom of travel.",Literary Criticism,289,N/A,0,en

On the Chocolate Trail,Rabbi Deborah R. Prinz,Turner Publishing Company,2017-10-17,"Take a delectable journey through the religious history of chocolate—a real treat! In this new and updated second edition, explore the surprising Jewish and other religious connections to chocolate in this gastronomic and historical adventure through cultures, countries, centuries and convictions. Rabbi Deborah Prinz draws from her world travels on the trail of chocolate to enchant chocolate lovers of all backgrounds as she unravels religious connections in the early chocolate trade and shows how Jewish and other religious values infuse chocolate today. With mouth-watering recipes, a glossary of chocolaty terms, tips for buying luscious, ethically produced chocolate, a list of sweet chocolate museums around the world and more, this book unwraps tasty facts such as: Some people—including French (Bayonne) chocolate makers—believe that Jews brought chocolate making to France. The bishop of Chiapas, Mexico, was poisoned because he prohibited local women from drinking chocolate during Mass. Although Quakers do not observe Easter, it was a Quaker-owned chocolate company—Fry's—that claimed to have created the first chocolate Easter egg in the United Kingdom. A born-again Christian businessman in the Midwest marketed his caramel chocolate bar as a ""Noshie,"" after the Yiddish word for ""snack.""

Louisiana Voyages,Martha Reinhard Smallwood Field,Univ. Press of Mississippi,2006,"""Toward the end of the 19th century, journalist Field traveled by boat and buggy around Louisiana, writing columns under the name of Catharine Cole for the New Orleans Daily Picayune. Her work spread to other papers, and she was read widely throughout the South. This collection details her journeys around the state in the 1890s. With evocative and adjective-filled prose, she describes the beauty as well as the practical aspects of Louisiana life, including shrimp drying, levee building, and the cost of land. Field conjures up vivid images of the places she visits, such as the town that ""lifts its comb of roof and gray gable and soft-colored adobe chimneys from out the clumps and clouds of the chinaberry tree."" The editors, both retired professors of English at Clemson University, add brief introductions to each piece. Although Field's travel adventures depict a time without modern convenience, when women were not expected to journey alone, her enjoyment of travel for its own sake resonates with readers today.

Geocomputation with R,"Robin Lovelace, Jakub Nowosad, Jannes Muenchow",CRC Press,2019-03-22,"Geocomputation with R is for people who want to analyze, visualize and model geographic data with open source software. It is based on R, a statistical programming language that has powerful data processing, visualization, and geospatial capabilities. The book equips you with the knowledge and skills to tackle a wide range of issues manifested in geographic data, including those with scientific, societal, and environmental implications. This book will interest people from many backgrounds, especially Geographic Information Systems (GIS) users interested in applying their domain-specific knowledge in a powerful open source language for data science, and R users interested in extending their skills to handle spatial data. The book is divided into three parts: (I) Foundations, aimed at getting you up-to-speed with geographic data in R, (II) extensions, which covers advanced techniques, and (III) applications to real-world problems. The chapters cover progressively more advanced topics, with early chapters providing strong foundations on which the later chapters build. Part I describes the nature of spatial datasets in R and methods for manipulating them. It also covers geographic data import/export and transforming coordinate reference systems. Part II represents methods that build on these foundations. It covers advanced map making (including web mapping), ""bridges"" to GIS, sharing reproducible code, and how to do cross-validation in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. Part III applies the knowledge gained to tackle real-world problems, including representing and modeling transport systems, finding optimal locations for stores or services, and ecological modeling. Exercises at the end of each chapter give you the skills needed to tackle a range of geospatial problems. Solutions for each chapter and supplementary materials providing extended examples are available at https://geocompr.github.io/geocompkg/articles/.",Mathematics,354,N/A,0,en

The Regulation of Monopoly,Roger Sherman,Cambridge University Press,1989-03-31,"Competition may not function well where technology calls for large and complex investments, as in the electrivity industry where public utilities often provide service. This book presents economic welfare foundations for the purpose of evaluating how well, from a social point of view, an enterprise performs when competition is unable to function. Problems with existing institutions are emphasized. Topics treated include welfare measures and their uses in peak-load pricing, second-best pricing, and income distribution. Professor Sherman covers public choice difficulties of government intervention, and describes problems with incentives in statutory monopolies and efforts to overcome them through the study of principal-agent relationships. Contestability and sustainable prices are also discussed, as well as effects of uncertainty and imperfect information.",Business & Economics,332,N/A,0,en

"The Routledge Handbook of Census Resources, Methods and Applications",John Stillwell,Routledge,2017-08-24,"The collection of reliable and comprehensive data on the magnitude, composition and distribution of a country’s population is essential in order for governments to provide services, administer effectively and guide a country’s development. The primary source of basic demographic statistics is frequently a population census, which provides hugely important data sets for policy makers, practitioners and researchers working in a wide range of different socio-demographic contexts. The Routledge Handbook of Census Resources, Methods and Applications provides a comprehensive and authoritative guide to the collection, processing, quality assessment and delivery of the different data products that constitute the results of the population censuses conducted across the United Kingdom in 2011. It provides those interested in using census data with an introduction to the collection, processing and quality assessment of the 2011 Census, together with guidance on the various types of data resources that are available and how they can be accessed. It demonstrates how new methods and technologies, such as interactive infographics and web-based mapping, are now being used to visualise census data in new and exciting ways. Perhaps most importantly, it presents a collection of applications of census data in different social and health science research contexts that reveal key messages about the characteristics of the UK population and the ways in which society is changing. The operation of the 2011 Census and the use of its results are set in the context of census-taking around the world and its historical development in the UK over the last 200 years. The results of the UK 2011 Census are a unique and reliable source of detailed information that are immensely important for users from a wide range of public and private sector organisations, as well as those working in Population Studies, Human Geography, Migration Studies and the Social Sciences more generally.",Science,692,N/A,0,en

And since Illyrion is the element most needed for space travel, Lorq von Ray is plenty willing to fly through the core of a recently imploded sun in order to obtain seven tons of it. The potential for profit is so great that Lorq has little difficulty cobbling together an alluring crew that includes a gypsy musician and a moon-obsessed scholar interested in the ancient art of writing a novel. What the crew doesn’t know, though, is that Lorq’s quest is actually fueled by a private revenge so consuming that he’ll stop at nothing to achieve it. In the grandest manner of speculative fiction, Nova is a wise and witty classic that casts a fascinating new light on some of humanity’s oldest truths and enduring myths.",Fiction,257,N/A,0,en

This is a smart, respectful and compelling book."" —Jason DeParle, The New York Times Book Review When Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election, a bewildered nation turned to Strangers in Their Own Land to understand what Trump voters were thinking when they cast their ballots. Arlie Hochschild, one of the most influential sociologists of her generation, had spent the preceding five years immersed in the community around Lake Charles, Louisiana, a Tea Party stronghold. As Jedediah Purdy put it in the New Republic, ""Hochschild is fascinated by how people make sense of their lives. . . . [Her] attentive, detailed portraits . . . reveal a gulf between Hochchild's 'strangers in their own land' and a new elite."" Already a favorite common read book in communities and on campuses across the country and called ""humble and important"" by David Brooks and ""masterly"" by Atul Gawande, Hochschild's book has been lauded by Noam Chomsky, New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu, and countless others. The paperback edition features a new afterword by the author reflecting on the election of Donald Trump and the other events that have unfolded both in Louisiana and around the country since the hardcover edition was published, and also includes a readers' group guide at the back of the book.",Political Science,305,N/A,0,en

Thomas, a disgraced knight, has found an orphan of the Black Death in a Norman village. An almost unnerving picture of innocence, she tells Thomas that the plague is only part of a larger cataclysm--that the fallen angels under Lucifer are rising in a second war on Heaven. But is it delirium or is it faith? She believes she has seen the angels of God. She believes the dead speak to her in dreams. And now she has convinced the faithless Thomas to shepherd her across an apocalyptic landscape to Avignon. There, she tells Thomas, she will fulfill her mission. There her true nature will be revealed. And there Thomas will confront an evil wrestling for the throne of Heaven, and which has poisoned his own soul. *Kirkus Reviews",Fiction,466,N/A,0,en

I Have No Mouth & I Must Scream,Harlan Ellison,Open Road Media,2014-04-29,"Seven stunning stories of speculative fiction by the author of A Boy and His Dog. In a post-apocalyptic world, four men and one woman are all that remain of the human race, brought to near extinction by an artificial intelligence. Programmed to wage war on behalf of its creators, the AI became self-aware and turned against humanity.

Lame of Thrones,The Harvard Lampoon,Hachette UK,2020-11-10,"From Harvard's legendary humor publication comes an outrageous, uproariously funny parody of Game of Thrones, in the tradition of their previous bestselling parody book classics Bored of the Rings, Nightlight, and The Hunger Pains. An affectionate but take-no-prisoners send-up of the massive literary and television franchise, Lame of Thrones offers fans a way of reentering the fictional world they have come to love and merrily explodes all of its conventions -- as well as their expectations of the characters -- to hilarious ends. It may even leave you more satisfied than the actual TV ending of Game of Thrones. In fact, if it doesn't the Lampoon has really dropped the ball. Lame of Thrones will take you to Westopolis, where several extremely attractive egomaniacs are vying to be ruler of the realm and sit on the Pointy Chair. Our hero Jon Dough was a likely bet, but his untimely murder at the hands of his own men of the Night's Crotch has made that seem less likely. Will Dragon Queen Dennys Grandslam escape from her Clothkhaki captors and return to conquer the world? Or will she just get left in the desert counting grains of sand for the rest of the book? And what about Jon Dough's siblings? Will they be mentioned? Probably? Almost definitely, yes? It would be weird if they weren't prominent characters in the book, you say? To find out, read the book you wish George R.R. Martin would write but never will. The Lampoon -- the place where such comedy writers and performers as Conan O'Brien, Colin Jost, B.J. Novak, Patricia Marx, Alan Yang, Andy Borowitz and many more all got their start -- is ready to serve parody notice to the most entertaining, infuriating, and inescapable cultural phenomenon of the past decade.",Humor,249,N/A,0,en

The Chronoliths,Robert Charles Wilson,Tor Books,2014-05-06,"Scott Warden is a man haunted by the past--and soon to be haunted by the future. In early-twenty-first-century Thailand, Scott is an expatriate slacker. Then, one day, he inadvertently witnesses an impossible event: the violent appearance of a 200-foot stone pillar in the forested interior. Its arrival collapses trees for a quarter mile around its base, freezing ice out of the air and emitting a burst of ionizing radiation. It appears to be composed of an exotic form of matter. And the inscription chiseled into it commemorates a military victory--sixteen years in the future. Shortly afterwards, another, larger pillar arrives in the center of Bangkok--obliterating the city and killing thousands. Over the next several years, human society is transformed by these mysterious arrivals from, seemingly, our own near future. Who is the warlord ""Kuin"" whose victories they note? Scott wants only to rebuild his life. But some strange loop of causality keeps drawing him in, to the central mystery and a final battle with the future. The Chronoliths by Robert Charles Wilson is a 2002 Hugo Award Nominee for Best Novel and the winner of the 2002 John W. Campbell Memorial Award.

Bones of the Earth,Michael Swanwick,Open Road Media,2016-05-31,"Modern technology is pitted against ancient dinosaurs in this scientific thriller James Rollins calls “Jurassic Park set amid the paradox of time travel.” Paleontologist Richard Leyster is perfectly content in his position with the Smithsonian excavating dinosaur fossil sites and publishing his findings . . . until the mysterious Harry Griffin appears in his office with a cooler containing the head of a freshly killed Stegosaurus. The enigmatic stranger offers Leyster the opportunity to travel back in time to study living dinosaurs in their original habitats—but with strings attached. Soon, the paleontologist finds himself, along with a select team of colleagues—including his chief rival, the ambitious and often ruthless Dr. Gertrude Salley—making discoveries that would prove impossible working from fossils alone. But when Leyster and his team are stranded in the Cretaceous, they must learn to survive while still keeping alive the joy of scientific discovery. This shocking novel spans hundreds of millions of years and deals with the ultimate fate not only of the dinosaurs but also of all humankind. Nominated for the Locus Award, the Hugo Award, and the Nebula Award for Best Novel, Bones of the Earth cements author Michael Swanwick as an author who “proves that sci-fi has plenty of room for wonder and literary values” (San Francisco Chronicle).",Fiction,256,N/A,0,en

The Flight of the Silvers,Daniel Price,Penguin,2014-02-04,"For fans of Blake Crouch, the propulsive first book in the genre-bending Silvers trilogy, in which six ordinary people become extraordinary when they find themselves the sole survivors of an apocalypse that lands them on an Earth far different from our own—one on which they have X-Men-like powers to manipulate time. Without warning, the world comes to an end. The sky looms frigid white. The electric grid falters. Airplanes everywhere crash to the ground, and finally, the sky comes down in a crushing sheet of light, taking out everything and everyone with it—except for Hannah and Amanda Given. Saved from destruction by three fearsome and powerful beings who adorn them each with an irremovable silver bracelet, the Given sisters suddenly find themselves on a strange new Earth where restaurants move through the air like flying saucers and the fabric of time itself is manipulated by common household appliances. Upon arrival to this alternate America, Hannah and Amanda are taken to a science laboratory where they meet four other survivors from their world, all of whom wear matching silver bracelets—a mordant cartoonist, a shy teenage girl, a brilliant young Australian, and a troubled ex-prodigy. While being poked and prodded by scientists who may be friends or enemies, the group discovers that it’s not only their world that is different—they are different. Each has the power to manipulate time with their bare hands…a power they can’t always control. With no one but each other to trust, “the Silvers” must find out what exactly happened to their world and why it was that they were spared. But with unexpected new enemies emerging from around every corner, their quest for answers will quickly become a cross-country quest for survival.",Fiction,604,N/A,0,en

Slow Train to Switzerland,Diccon Bewes,Nicholas Brealey,2013-11-07,"""Bewes' breezy prose makes him a pleasant traveling companion ... he clearly knows Switzerland inside and out."" - The Spectator In June 1863 an English lady set off by train on the trip of a lifetime: Thomas Cook's first Conducted Tour of Switzerland. A century and a half later, travel writer Diccon Bewes, author of the bestselling Swiss Watching, decided to go where she went and see what she saw.

City Cycling,"John Pucher, Ralph Buehler",MIT Press,2012-10-19,"A guide to today's urban cycling renaissance, with information on cycling's health benefits, safety, bikes and bike equipment, bike lanes, bike sharing, and other topics. Bicycling in cities is booming, for many reasons: health and environmental benefits, time and cost savings, more and better bike lanes and paths, innovative bike sharing programs, and the sheer fun of riding. City Cycling offers a guide to this urban cycling renaissance, with the goal of promoting cycling as sustainable urban transportation available to everyone. It reports on cycling trends and policies in cities in North America, Europe, and Australia, and offers information on such topics as cycling safety, cycling infrastructure provisions including bikeways and bike parking, the wide range of bike designs and bike equipment, integration of cycling with public transportation, and promoting cycling for women and children. City Cycling emphasizes that bicycling should not be limited to those who are highly trained, extremely fit, and daring enough to battle traffic on busy roads. The chapters describe ways to make city cycling feasible, convenient, and safe for commutes to work and school, shopping trips, visits, and other daily transportation needs. The book also offers detailed examinations and illustrations of cycling conditions in different urban environments: small cities (including Davis, California, and Delft, the Netherlands), large cities (including Sydney, Chicago, Toronto and Berlin), and “megacities” (London, New York, Paris, and Tokyo). These chapters offer a closer look at how cities both with and without historical cycling cultures have developed cycling programs over time. The book makes clear that successful promotion of city cycling depends on coordinating infrastructure, programs, and government policies.",Sports & Recreation,413,N/A,0,en

A teenage mage of humble birth and slightly above-average skill, Zorian is attending his third year of education at Cyoria's magical academy. A driven and quiet young man, he is consumed by a desire to ensure his own future and free himself of the influence of his family, resenting the Kazinskis for favoring his brothers over him. Consequently, Zorian has no time for pointless distractions, much less other people's problems. As it happens, though, time is something he is about to get plenty of.

The Sex Lives of Cannibals,J. Maarten Troost,Crown,2004-06-08,"At the age of twenty-six, Maarten Troost—who had been pushing the snooze button on the alarm clock of life by racking up useless graduate degrees and muddling through a series of temp jobs—decided to pack up his flip-flops and move to Tarawa, a remote South Pacific island in the Republic of Kiribati. He was restless and lacked direction, and the idea of dropping everything and moving to the ends of the earth was irresistibly romantic. He should have known better. The Sex Lives of Cannibals tells the hilarious story of what happens when Troost discovers that Tarawa is not the island paradise he dreamed of. Falling into one amusing misadventure after another, Troost struggles through relentless, stifling heat, a variety of deadly bacteria, polluted seas, toxic fish—all in a country where the only music to be heard for miles around is “La Macarena.” He and his stalwart girlfriend Sylvia spend the next two years battling incompetent government officials, alarmingly large critters, erratic electricity, and a paucity of food options (including the Great Beer Crisis); and contending with a bizarre cast of local characters, including “Half-Dead Fred” and the self-proclaimed Poet Laureate of Tarawa (a British drunkard who’s never written a poem in his life). With The Sex Lives of Cannibals, Maarten Troost has delivered one of the most original, rip-roaringly funny travelogues in years—one that will leave you thankful for staples of American civilization such as coffee, regular showers, and tabloid news, and that will provide the ultimate vicarious adventure.",Biography & Autobiography,290,N/A,0,en

Uluru is the indigenous Australian name for an enormous rock formation found in central Australia. Made from sandstone, Uluru is a rock monolith or an 'island mountain', a formation that geologists refer to as a monadnock. It stands 318 m (986 ft) high and has a circumference of 8 km (5 miles). It is located 335 km (208 mi) south west of the nearest rural centre, the large town of Alice Springs. The site was first mapped by Europeans in 1872 during the construction of the Australian Overland Telegraph Line that linked the northern settlement of Darwin to Port Augusta in South Australia. Uluru was originally named Mount Olga by Ernest Giles. On a separate expedition in 1870, the explorer William Gosse renamed the formation Ayers Rock in honour of the Chief Secretary of South Australia, Sir Henry Ayers. The name was made official until 1992, when it was renamed Uluru/Ayers Rock as an official dual title, honouring both the European and Aboriginal names. Uluru is, as Ernest Giles referred to it in 1872, the world's ""most remarkable pebble."" iMinds will tell you the story behind the place with its innovative travel series, transporting the armchair traveller or getting you in the mood for discover on route to your destination. iMinds brings targeted knowledge to your eReading device with short information segments to whet your mental appetite and broaden your mind.",Travel,5,N/A,0,en

Recovery and Stress in Sport,"Michael Kellmann, Sarah Kölling",Routledge,2019-03-19,"Balancing training, stress, and recovery is essential for achieving optimal performance. The performance of professional athletes can be severely compromised by overtraining, injuries, prolonged periods of competition, or even life events outside their sporting lives. The current recovery-stress state depends on preceding stress and recovery activities, but through simultaneous assessment of stress and recovery, a differentiated picture can be provided. This manual includes two measurement instruments to gauge individual recovery, enabling both athletes and coaches to better understand the often-unconscious processes that impinge upon peak performance, and to monitor the physical, mental, emotional, mental, and overall recovery-stress state before and after training. The Acute Recovery and Stress Scale (ARSS) and the Short Recovery and Stress Scale (SRSS) are instruments that systematically enlighten the recovery-stress states of athletes. Through utilization of the ARSS and the SRSS, athletes and coaches can better understand the importance of daily activities, including how they can relate to stress/recovery and the direct impact on athletic performance. In addition to the instruments themselves, both of which are simple and easy to use, the manual also discusses their development, their basis in theory, and case studies showcasing their usage. The ARSS and the SRSS provide important information regarding the current recovery-stress state during the process of training, and are essential tools for coaches, sport scientists, sport psychologists, and athletes alike.",Psychology,117,N/A,0,en

Travels in Siberia,Ian Frazier,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux",2010-10-12,"A Dazzling Russian travelogue from the bestselling author of Great Plains In his astonishing new work, Ian Frazier, one of our greatest and most entertaining storytellers, trains his perceptive, generous eye on Siberia, the storied expanse of Asiatic Russia whose grim renown is but one explanation among hundreds for the region's fascinating, enduring appeal. In Travels in Siberia, Frazier reveals Siberia's role in history—its science, economics, and politics—with great passion and enthusiasm, ensuring that we'll never think about it in the same way again. With great empathy and epic sweep, Frazier tells the stories of Siberia's most famous exiles, from the well-known—Dostoyevsky, Lenin (twice), Stalin (numerous times)—to the lesser known (like Natalie Lopukhin, banished by the empress for copying her dresses) to those who experienced unimaginable suffering in Siberian camps under the Soviet regime, forever immortalized by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in The Gulag Archipelago. Travels in Siberia is also a unique chronicle of Russia since the end of the Soviet Union, a personal account of adventures among Russian friends and acquaintances, and, above all, a unique, captivating, totally Frazierian take on what he calls the ""amazingness"" of Russia—a country that, for all its tragic history, somehow still manages to be funny. Travels in Siberia will undoubtedly take its place as one of the twenty-first century's indispensable contributions to the travel-writing genre.",Travel,541,N/A,0,en

Current Issues in Public Utilities and Public Policy,"Fumitoshi Mizutani, Takuya Urakami, Eri Nakamura",Springer Nature,2023-01-25,"This book is novel in that it reveals significant issues of economics, management and business fields currently observed in network industries such as public utilities and transportation, and provides empirical evidence of their mechanisms and policy implications from various perspectives. This is a holistic collection of literature on public utilities economics and management, since the industries discussed include a wide range such as electricity, water supply, sewerage, transport, and postal service, which compound social infrastructure as public benefit service, and the issues examined contain not only economics topics such as cost, efficiency, and productivity, but also management topics such as governance, strategy and organizational restructuring. The book also investigates general private companies to derive future implications for policy and governance of public utilities, and covers multiple countries such as Japan, the US, and Vietnam. It demonstrates various empirical approaches and methodologies for public utility analysis through 17 chapters by experts in each field, which contributes to further cultivation of empirical studies in public utilities.",Business & Economics,358,N/A,0,en

Computing with T.Node Parallel Architecture,"D. Heidrich, J.C. Grossetie",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Parallel processing is seen today as the means to improve the power of computing facilities by breaking the Von Neumann bottleneck of conventional sequential computer architectures. By defining appropriate parallel computation models definite advantages can be obtained. Parallel processing is the center of the research in Europe in the field of Information Processing Systems so the CEC has funded the ESPRIT Supemode project to develop a low cost, high performance, multiprocessor machine. The result of this project is a modular, reconfigurable architecture based on !NMOS transputers: T.Node. This machine can be considered as a research, industrial and commercial success. The CEC has decided to continue to encourage manufacturers as well as research and end-users of transputers by funding other projects in this field. This book presents course papers of the Eurocourse given at the Joint Research Centre in ISPRA (Italy) from the 4th to 8 of November 1991. First we present an overview of various trends in the design of parallel architectures and specially of the T.Node with it's software development environments, new distributed system aspects and also new hardware extensions based on the !NMOS T9000 processor. In a second part, we review some real case applications in the field of image synthesis, image processing, signal processing, terrain modeling, particle physics simulation and also enhanced parallel and distributed numerical methods on T.Node.",Computers,264,N/A,0,en

Best and Worst Travels,Ramon Carver,iUniverse,2007-04,"Carver writes in a style not unlike Bill Bryson, candidly regaling readers with tales of his worst experiences (""Some of the worst were worse than others."") as well as the best: ""I enjoyed a great Abercrombie & Kent trip to China because it was a great adventure, a great itinerary, a great tour group with a great tour director, great hotels (except for a noisy Sheraton in Guilin), great weather, and great tour management. Seven greats out of seven ain't bad."" He says, ""Great expectations when traveling are usually the source of my greatest disappointments! I'm like the guy in a New Yorker cartoon studying a brochure telling his travel agent: 'I am so looking forward to this. I can't wait to be disappointed.'"" He writes ""How to Survive Disasters like Theft, Accidents, etc.,"" and at the risk of seeming disingenuously obvious, he provides an exhaustive list covering every possible thing that can go wrong (Getting Sick, Getting Killed, Getting Lost, etc.), offering suggestions for solving dilemmas. He concludes with ""Did I fail to mention Getting Bored to Death.""

Applying the Building Code,Ronald L. Geren,John Wiley & Sons,2016-03-21,"No other resource—not even the building code—presents the exact code information you need, when you need it at design stage The International Building Code (IBC) is a model building code developed by the International Code Council (ICC). The IBC and its complementary codes provide design and construction professionals with a complete set of comprehensive, coordinated building safety and fire prevention regulations in order to safeguard the public health and general welfare of the occupants of new and existing buildings and structures. Adopted throughout most of the United States and its territories, it is referenced by federal agencies, such as the General Services Administration, National Park Service, Department of State, U.S. Forest Service, and the Department of Defense. For architects and other design and construction professionals, it is particularly important that they understand how to apply the IBC and how code officials view buildings, so that they integrate code-required provisions in the earliest design stages of any project. Applying the IBC, as well as its companion codes, to building design is a process that is uniquely different to that of applying the building code during a planning review. Whereas other guide books explain the IBC in sequential order, from cover to cover, chapter by chapter, and section by section, Applying the Building Code explains the requirements of the IBC as they would apply during the common phases of design: from schematic design through to the preparation of construction documents. This effectively highlights applicable requirements of the building code at the appropriate stage of design based on available information. The book provides a 28-step process that is organized according to the three phases of architectural design: schematic design, design development, and construction documents Each step explains the application of the IBC, as well as other codes and standards referenced by the IBC (i.e. International Fire Code, International Energy Conservation Code, and ANSI A117.1) based on available project information Illustrations and examples are provided throughout that explain the code fundamentals associated with each step A single example project is used throughout the step-by-step process to illustrate how each step is applied and builds upon code and project information obtained through previous steps Guidance is also provided on the International Existing Building Code and how the step-by-step process is applied to projects involving existing buildings The role of the building department and its staff in regard to plan reviews and code enforcement is discussed A detailed code data information template is provided that can help organize code-related information for construction documents",Architecture,464,N/A,0,en

Warehousing in the Global Supply Chain,Riccardo Manzini,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-01-05,"With increased globalization and offshore sourcing, global supply chain management is becoming an important issue for many businesses as it involves a company's worldwide interests and suppliers rather than simply a local or national orientation. The storage systems significantly affect the level of quality of products, the customer’s service level, and the global logistic cost. The mission of warehousing systems design, control and optimization is to effectively ship products in the right place, at the right time, and in the right quantity (i.e. in any configuration) without any damages or alterations, and minimizing costs. Warehousing in the Global Supply Chain presents and discusses a set of models, tools and real applications, including a few case studies rarely presented with a sufficient detail by other literature, to illustrate the main challenges in warehousing activities. This includes all warehouse operations (from receiving to shipping), problems and issues (e.g. storage allocation, assignment, layout, vehicle routing) for industrial and service systems as parts of global supply chains. Advanced and effective solving methods are also illustrated and the discussed case studies help the reader to quickly apply the proposed models and techniques/algorithms. Warehousing in the Global Supply Chain is useful to managers and practitioners of industry and service sectors for the determination and modeling of the critical issues concerning warehousing systems planning and design. It is a valuable source of information for engineering students, doctoral and post-doctoral students, and researchers of academic institutions who are searching for advanced modeling approaches and solving techniques to complex logistic decision making problems.

"Space, Time and the Limits of Human Understanding","Shyam Wuppuluri, Giancarlo Ghirardi",Springer,2016-12-01,"In this compendium of essays, some of the world’s leading thinkers discuss their conceptions of space and time, as viewed through the lens of their own discipline. With an epilogue on the limits of human understanding, this volume hosts contributions from six or more diverse fields. It presumes only rudimentary background knowledge on the part of the reader. Time and again, through the prism of intellect, humans have tried to diffract reality into various distinct, yet seamless, atomic, yet holistic, independent, yet interrelated disciplines and have attempted to study it contextually. Philosophers debate the paradoxes, or engage in meditations, dialogues and reflections on the content and nature of space and time. Physicists, too, have been trying to mold space and time to fit their notions concerning micro- and macro-worlds. Mathematicians focus on the abstract aspects of space, time and measurement. While cognitive scientists ponder over the perceptual and experiential facets of our consciousness of space and time, computer scientists theoretically and practically try to optimize the space-time complexities in storing and retrieving data/information. The list is never-ending. Linguists, logicians, artists, evolutionary biologists, geographers etc., all are trying to weave a web of understanding around the same duo. However, our endeavour into a world of such endless imagination is restrained by intellectual dilemmas such as: Can humans comprehend everything? Are there any limits? Can finite thought fathom infinity? We have sought far and wide among the best minds to furnish articles that provide an overview of the above topics. We hope that, through this journey, a symphony of patterns and tapestry of intuitions will emerge, providing the reader with insights into the questions: What is Space? What is Time?

The Routledge Handbook of Tourism and the Environment,"Andrew Holden, David A. Fennell",Routledge,2012-08-21,"The Routledge Handbook of Tourism and the Environment explores and critically evaluates the debates and controversies inherent to tourism’s relationship with nature, especially pertinent at a time of major re-evaluation of our relationship with the environment as a consequence of the environmental problems we now face. It brings together leading specialists from range of disciplinary backgrounds and geographical regions, to provide state-of-the-art theoretical reflection and empirical research on this complex relationship and future direction. The book is divided in to five interrelated sections. Section one evaluates the philosophical basis, rationale and complexity of what is meant by the term ‘environment’ considering the major influences in the construction of how we understand our surroundings and the types of values we place upon them. Section two evaluates the types of eco-systems that are used as natural resources for tourism and the negative and positive impacts upon them. Section three evaluates relevant environmental policy and management mechanisms for the impacts of tourism on the natural environment. Section four focuses on the changing tourism-environment relationship, and the types of tourism that have become established in the tourism industry, market and policy. Section five, analyzes contemporary and future issues of the tourism-environment relationship, based upon themes of environmental and social welfare. This timely book will provide an invaluable resource for all those with an interest in tourism’s relationship with the natural environment, encouraging dialogue across disciplinary boundaries and areas of study. The book is international in its focus, emphasizing that issues of tourism and the natural environment are not only localized but transcend national boundaries that sometimes require both international and global responses. This is essential reading for student, researchers and academics of Tourism as well as those of Geography, Environmental Studies and Development Studies.",Business & Economics,626,5,1,en

Time-Travel Television,"Sherry Ginn, Gillian I. Leitch",Rowman & Littlefield,2015-10-08,"Stories of time travel have been part of science fiction since H. G. Wells sent his nameless hero hurtling into Earth’s distant future in The Time Machine. Time travel enables the storyteller to depict alternate realities, bring fictional characters face to face with historical figures, and depict moral and ethical dilemmas in which millions of lives (or the world as we know it) are at stake. From Doctor Who and Quantum Leap to the multiple incarnations of Star Trek, time travel has been a staple of science fiction television for more than fifty years. Time-Travel Television: The Past from the Present, the Future from the Pastsurveys the whole range of time travel stories on the small screen. The essays in this collection explore time travel series both familiar (Babylon 5, Stargate SG-1) and forgotten (The Time Tunnel, Voyagers!), as well as time-travel themed episodes and arcs in series where it is not central, such as Red Dwarf, Lost, and Heroes. Contributors to this volume consider some of the classic themes of time-travel stories: the promise (and peril) of “fixing” the past, the chance to experience (and choose) possible futures, and the potential for small changes to have great effects. Exploring time travel as a teaching tool, as a vehicle for moral lessons, and as a background for high adventure, this book offers new perspectives on many familiar programs and the first serious study of several unjustly neglected ones. Time-Travel Television is essential reading for science fiction scholars and fans, and for anyone interested in the many ways that television brings the fantastic into viewers’ living rooms.",Performing Arts,300,N/A,0,en

Travels in Paradox,"Claudio Minca, Tim Oakes",Rowman & Littlefield Publishers,2006-03-30,"This innovative volume focuses on tourism through the twin lenses of cultural theory and cultural geography. Presenting a set of innovative case studies on tourist destinations around the world, the contributors explore the paradoxes of the tourist experience and the implications of these paradoxes for our broader understanding of the problems of modernity and identity. The book examines how tourism reveals the paradoxical ways that places are both mobile and rooted, real and fake, inhabited by those who are simultaneously insiders and outsiders, and both subjectively experienced and objectively viewed. The concepts of travel and mobility long have been used to explain modern identity and social behavior, but this work pushes beyond the established literature by considering the ways that place and mobility are inherently related in unexpected, even contradictory ways. Travel, the international cast of authors contends, occurs 'in place' rather than 'between places.' Thus, instead of offering yet another interpretation of the ways modern societies are distinguished by their mobilities-in contrast to the supposed place-bound quality of traditional societies-the chapters here collectively argue for an understanding of modern identity as simultaneously grounded and mobile. This rich blend of empirical and theoretical analysis will be invaluable for cultural geographers, anthropologists, and sociologists of tourism.",Social Science,299,N/A,0,en

The Bodhisattva Path to Unsurpassed Enlightenment,Asanga,Shambhala Publications,2016-03-08,"A complete translation of Asanga's classic work on the distinguishing qualities of bodhisattvas that describes how to awaken, develop, and perfect the mind of enlightenment in the Great Vehicle, or Mahayana, Buddhist tradition. Arya Asanga, famous for having been the conduit through which the teachings contained in the Five Texts of Maitreya were received and recorded, is also considered to be the author in his own right of several other foundational works of Yogācāra philosophy. One of these, considered the definitive text of the Yogācāra school of Buddhism, is the encyclopedic synthesis of Mahayana Buddhist doctrines and practices known as the Yogācārabhūmi, or ""Stages of Spiritual Practice."" The Bodhisattvabhūmi, or ""Stages of the Bodhisattva Path,"" is one portion of that massive work, though it is considered a stand-alone text in the Tibetan traditions--for example, it is counted among the six core texts of the Kadampas. However, despite the text's centrality to the Yogācāra school and its seminal importance in the Tibetan traditions, it has remained unavailable in English except in piecemeal translations; Engle's translation will therefore be especially welcomed by scholars and students alike.",Religion,801,N/A,0,en

Black Television Travels,Timothy Havens,NYU Press,2013-04,"“Black Television Travels provides a detailed and insightful view of the roots and routes of the televisual representations of blackness on the transnational media landscape. By following the circulation of black cultural products and their institutionalized discourses—including industry lore, taste cultures, and the multiple stories of black experiences that have and have not made it onto the small screen—Havens complicates discussions of racial representation and exposes possibilities for more expansive representations of blackness while recognizing the limitations of the seemingly liberatory spaces created by globalization.” —Bambi Haggins, Associate Professor of Film and Media Studies at Arizona State University “A major achievement that makes important contributions to the analysis of race, identity, global media, nation, and television production cultures. Discussions of race and television are too often constricted within national boundaries, yet this fantastic book offers a strong, compelling, and utterly refreshing corrective. Read it, assign it, use it.” —Jonathan Gray, author of Television Entertainment, Television Studies, and Show Sold Separately Black Television Travels explores the globalization of African American television and the way in which foreign markets, programming strategies, and viewer preferences have influenced portrayals of African Americans on the small screen. Television executives have been notoriously slow to recognize the potential popularity of black characters and themes, both at home and abroad. As American television brokers increasingly seek revenues abroad, their assumptions about saleability and audience perceptions directly influence the global circulation of these programs, as well as their content. Black Television Travels aims to reclaim the history of African American television circulation in an effort to correct and counteract this predominant industry lore. Based on interviews with television executives and programmers from around the world, as well as producers in the United States, Havens traces the shift from an era when national television networks often blocked African American television from traveling abroad to the transnational, post-network era of today. While globalization has helped to expand diversity in African American television, particularly in regard to genre, it has also resulted in restrictions, such as in the limited portrayal of African American women in favor of attracting young male demographics across racial and national boundaries. Havens underscores the importance of examining boardroom politics as part of racial discourse in the late modern era, when transnational cultural industries like television are the primary sources for dominant representations of blackness. Timothy Havens is an Associate Professor of television and media studies in the Department of Communication Studies, the Program in African American Studies, and the Program in International Studies at the University of Iowa.

Temporal Points of View,"Margarita Vázquez Campos, Antonio Manuel Liz Gutiérrez",Springer,2015-08-14,"This book seeks to arrive at a better understanding of the relationships between the objective and subjective aspects of time. It discusses the existence of fluent time, a controversial concept in many areas, from philosophy to physics. Fluent time is understood as directional time with a past, a present and a future. We experience fluent time in our lives and we adopt a temporal perspective in our ways of knowing and acting. Nevertheless, the existence of fluent time has been debated for both philosophical and scientific reasons, thus creating a rift between the subjective and objective aspects of time. Starting from the basic notion of points of view, or perspectives, this book explores the relationships between objective or external time, as it has been conceptualized by science, and subjective or internal time, which is involved in our lived experiences. It establishes a general framework encompassing the nature, structure and mode of existence of points of view, in which the objective and subjective aspects of time can be integrated. The book mainly addresses researchers and postgraduates in philosophy and logic. Additionally, it offers inspiration for physicists and computer scientists involved in the modeling and simulation of complex behaviors for which the representation of internal time should be considered together with the notion of objective, external time.",Philosophy,280,N/A,0,en

Travels in India,"Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, Valentine Ball",N/A,1889,"Jean-Baptiste Tavernier (1605-89) was one of the most renowned travelers of 17th century Europe. The son of a French Protestant who had fled Antwerp to escape religious persecution, Tavernier was a jewel merchant who between 1632 and 1668 made six voyages to the East. The countries he visited (most more than once) included present-day Cyprus, Malta, Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia. In 1676 he published his two-volume Les six voyages de Jean Baptiste Tavernier (The six voyages of Jean Baptiste Tavernier). An abridged and very imperfect English translation of the book appeared in 1677. The first modern scholarly edition in English, presented here, was published in 1889, with translation, notes, and a biographical sketch of Tavernier by Dr. Valentine Ball (1843-95), a British civil servant with the Indian Geological Service. Among the most memorable chapters in the book are those that recount Tavernier's visits to the diamond mines of India and his inspection of the jewels of the Great Mogul. Tavernier was not a scholar or an educated linguist, and after his initial popularity in the 17th century his authority waned, as historians and others questioned the accuracy of his observations. In the 20th century, however, Tavernier's reputation rose, as such important historians as Lucien Febvre and Fernand Braudel used the detailed information he recorded about the prices and qualities of goods and about business and commercial practices in their pioneering studies of economic and social history. The book contains several appendices by Ball about famous diamonds (including the historic Koh-i-Noor Diamond now belonging to the British royal family), diamond mines in India and Borneo, ruby mines in Burma, and sapphire washings in Ceylon (Sri Lanka). A fold-out map shows Tavernier's voyages in India and the mines he visited.",Asia,502,5,1,en

Just Traveling,Jaco J. Hamman,Fortress Press,2021-08-17,"Just Traveling celebrates overcoming distance and seeking difference as defining human traits. Following the scriptural witness of God as the Earthroamer, the book explores the liminal qualities of traveling through six movements: anticipating, leaving, surrendering, meeting, caring, and returning. To travel is to move at the speed of being present to one's experiences, bridging distance and difference through acts of care. Drawing on personal experience as well as the wisdom of theology, anthropology, psychology, philosophy, and cultural studies, Hamman reimagines travel in a welcoming and beautiful, yet also complex and troubled world. Whether leaving home serves our wanderlust and curiosity or has personal or spiritual purposes; whether we travel a few miles or cover vast distances, we travel best when we contribute to human flourishing. Care--the compassionate reaching out to someone or something--is the practice that allows one to travel differently. The spirituality of roads is filled with hopeful restorative potential, and life is best lived with the Earthroamer.",Religion,201,N/A,0,en
Moving Forward,"Matías Herrera Dappe, Charles Kunaka, Mathilde Lebrand, Nora Weisskopf",World Bank Publications,2019-10-30,"The erosion of its competitiveness is raising concerns about the sustainability of Bangladesh's growth model based on exports of ready-made garments. To safeguard its comparative advantage in ready-made garments and diversify its exports basket, Bangladesh needs to increase its competitiveness. Improving logistics performance is an important lever with which to do so. Moving Forward: Connectivity and Logistics to Sustain Bangladesh's Success presents a comprehensive assessment of logistics performance and its main determinants. It analyzes freight demand at a spatially disaggregated level, quantifies logistics costs, including the costs of externalities, looks at the factors that determine the stock and quality of infrastructure, and examines the incentives to provide logistics services of a certain type and quality and to charge the observed prices. It also quantifies the potential impacts of removing transport and logistics inefficiencies on Bangladesh's exports and economic geography using a spatial general equilibrium model. Bangladesh's congested, unreliable, and unsophisticated logistics system imposes high costs on the economy. Making it efficient requires a holistic system-wide approach that is based on a comprehensive strategy; improves the quality, capacity, and management of infrastructure; improves the quality and integration of logistics services; and achieves seamless regional connectivity. Moving Forward will be of interest to policy makers, private sector practitioners, and academics with an interest in the performance of Bangladesh's transport and logistics sectors.",Business & Economics,159,N/A,0,en

Traveling While Married,Mary-Lou Weisman,Algonquin Books,2003-04-25,"Ah travel! New scenery, exciting adventures, time alone with a loved one. Truth is, travel can make or break a relationship. Just negotiating when to leave for the airport can be tricky: she insists on arriving hours ahead of flight time, he likes the excitement of a photo finish. But as Mary-Lou Weisman sees it, ""The inevitable rage with which we begin each trip only helps us to better appreciate the good times that lie ahead."" Or maybe not. When people have jet lag, can't speak the language, figure out the money, or maintain intestinal regularity, they get cranky. And since they don't know anybody else in Kyoto to take it out on, they take it out on each other. Alas, couples therapy is rarely available on vacation, which is why we need this hilarious and truthful take on travel and togetherness. Using her own misadventures--from honeymoon through Elderhostel--Weisman exposes all the gender landmines: Destinations: He wants to outrun molten lava down a volcano, she prefers raking gravel in a Buddhist monastery. Motivations: She longs for a change of scenery, he hopes for a change of self. Preparations: She keeps a file of required sights, he won't be bullied by travel guides. Accommodations: She divides every hotel room in half so he'll know on which side of the bed to throw his wet towel. Inclinations: She shops a country, he eats it. This is the real skinny on what happens when Mars and Venus hit the road. With a sly wink, a comic nod, and just the right amount of optimism, Weisman shows us that despite the shortcomings of one's beloved, harmonious travel is possible.",Travel,191,4,14,en

Your head hurts. You’re mildly annoyed as you get the kids ready for school and dress for work yourself. Meanwhile, an epic war is being fought, just below your skin. Millions are fighting and dying for you to be able to complain as you head out the door. But most of us never really stop to ask: What even is our immune system? Second only to the human brain in its complexity, it is one of the oldest and most critical facets of life on Earth. Without it, you would die within days. In Immune, Philipp Dettmer, the brains behind the most popular science channel on YouTube, takes readers on a journey through the fortress of the human body and its defenses. There is a constant battle of staggering scale raging within us, full of stories of invasion, strategy, defeat, and noble self-sacrifice. In fact, in the time you’ve been reading this, your immune system has probably identified and eradicated a cancer cell that started to grow in your body. Each chapter delves into an element of the immune system, including defenses like antibodies and inflammation as well as threats like bacteria, allergies, and cancer, as Dettmer reveals why boosting your immune system is actually nonsense, how parasites sneak their way past your body’s defenses, how viruses work, and what goes on in your wounds when you cut yourself. Enlivened by engaging full-color graphics and immersive descriptions, Immune turns one of the most intricate, interconnected, and confusing subjects—immunology—into a gripping adventure through an astonishing alien landscape. Immune is a vital and remarkably fun crash course in what is arguably, and increasingly, the most important system in the body.",Science,369,5,2,en

Computing Our Way to Paradise?,Robert Rattle,Rowman & Littlefield,2010-01-16,"Rattle's new book challenges key assumptions concerning the role of Internet and communication technologies (ICTs) in globalization processes.

ICTs have been promoted as the next economic wave with the potential to generate jobs, wealth, and prosperity to surpass that of the industrial era. It is assumed the environmental impacts will be negligible or even beneficial in this shift towards a service economy.

"Secwépemc People, Land, and Laws","Marianne Ignace, Ronald E. Ignace",McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP,2017-10-31,"Secwépemc People, Land, and Laws is a journey through the 10,000-year history of the Interior Plateau nation in British Columbia. Told through the lens of past and present Indigenous storytellers, this volume detail how a homeland has shaped Secwépemc existence while the Secwépemc have in turn shaped their homeland. Marianne Ignace and Ronald Ignace, with contributions from ethnobotanist Nancy Turner, archaeologist Mike Rousseau, and geographer Ken Favrholdt, compellingly weave together Secwépemc narratives about ancestors’ deeds. They demonstrate how these stories are the manifestation of Indigenous laws (stsq'ey') for social and moral conduct among humans and all sentient beings on the land, and for social and political relations within the nation and with outsiders. Breathing new life into stories about past transformations, the authors place these narratives in dialogue with written historical sources and knowledge from archaeology, ethnography, linguistics, earth science, and ethnobiology. In addition to a wealth of detail about Secwépemc land stewardship, the social and political order, and spiritual concepts and relations embedded in the Indigenous language, the book shows how between the mid-1800s and 1920s the Secwépemc people resisted devastating oppression and the theft of their land, and fought to retain political autonomy while tenaciously maintaining a connection with their homeland, ancestors, and laws. An exemplary work in collaboration, Secwépemc People, Land, and Laws points to the ways in which Indigenous laws and traditions can guide present and future social and political process among the Secwépemc and with settler society.",Social Science,641,N/A,0,en
Imagined Australia,Renata Summo-O'Connell,Peter Lang,2009,"From Terra Nullius to Land of Opportunities and Last Frontier, the European dream has constructed and deconstructed Australia to feed its imagination of new societies. At the same time Australia has over the last two centuries forged and re-invented its own liaisons with Europe arguably to carve out its identity. From the arts to social sciences, to society itself, a complex dynamic has grown between the two continents in ways that invite study and discussion. A transnational research group has begun its collective investigation project of which this first volume is the outcome. The book is a substantial multidisciplinary collection of current research and offers critical perspectives on culture, literature and history around themes at the heart of the Imagined Australia project. The essays instigate reflection, discovery and discussion of how reciprocal imagining between Australia and Europe has articulated itself and ways and dimensions in which a relationship between communities, imagined and not, has unfolded.",Art,416,N/A,0,en

Unstuck,Rachael Herron,HGA Publishing,N/A,"Get ready to become delightfully unstuck. Bestselling author Rachael Herron is stuck. She and her partner have lived in their beloved East Oakland home for 15 years, almost as long as they’ve been married. But the house is in a rough area, and they’re tied to a mortgage she’s not sure they’ll ever be able to pay off. So when the whispered longing for adventure grows into a bellow she can’t ignore, Rachael decides to utilize not only her dual citizenship but also her impulsive nature. She and her partner will abandon their standard-issue American life and move to the far-distant shores of Aotearoa New Zealand. It’ll be easy, she thinks. It’ll be fun! They’ll ditch the mortgage and pack a couple of bags, traveling light and fast to find a new life. She’ll say goodbye to everyone she knows and loves, board the plane using a one-way ticket, and surely, that will solve everything. But even though she hasn’t bargained on the difficult realities behind relocations made with no final destination in mind, she can’t begin to imagine the untold surprises that will unfurl along her way. In this no-holds-barred love story, a delightful cross between Eat, Pray, Love and Under the Tuscan Sun, Rachael chronicles the messy, enchanting, and growth-demanding challenges of relocation and personal resurrection. “Herron’s jaunty prose will have readers breezily flipping through the pages as she enriches the narrative with indelible metaphors. This true story shows that making a big move can be a daunting but worthwhile and fascinating endeavor.” – Kirkus Reviews “The story of Herron’s move to the other side of the world in Unstuck made me feel everything: curiosity, grief, transformation and joy. I loved every moment of this glorious, heart-warming book.” - Monna McDiarmid, author of After Everything",Humor,234,N/A,0,en

"LITTLEPAGE MANUSCRIPTS – Complete Trilogy: Satanstoe, The Chainbearer & The Redskins",James Fenimore Cooper,e-artnow,2016-07-05,"This carefully crafted ebook: ""LITTLEPAGE MANUSCRIPTS – Complete Trilogy: Satanstoe, The Chainbearer & The Redskins"" is formatted for your eReader with a functional and detailed table of contents. The Littlepage Manuscripts follow three generations of a Dutch-originated family settling in America, beginning in the mid-eighteenth century. The trilogy is a fictional biography of the Littlepage family which explores the 18th century colony of New York. Novels focus mainly on issues of land ownership and the displacement of American Indians as the United States moves westward. Critical to the trilogy of these novels, is the sense of expansion through the measuring and acquisition of land by civilization. Narratives in these fictional manuscripts reveal a lot about the mentality of the people at that point in history. Satanstoe is the first novel of the trilogy with Mr. Cornelius Littlepage as the main narrator. His writings and descriptions paint the idyllic picture of the life of Dutch colonists. The Chainbearer is the second book in a trilogy, narrated by Mordaunt Littlepage. The title represents the man who carries the chains in measuring the land, helping civilization to grow from the wilderness. Here is described cultural lack of understanding Native Americans had for European concepts of land ownership. The Redskins is the final part of the trilogy with Mr. Hugh Roger Littlepage as narrator. This book closes the series of the Littlepage Manuscripts, which have been given to the world as containing a fair account of the comparative sacrifices of time, money, and labor, made respectively by the landlord and the tenants, on a New York estate. James Fenimore Cooper (1789-1851) was a prolific and popular American writer of the early 19th century. His historical romances of frontier and Indian life created a unique form of American literature. His best-known works are five historical novels of the frontier period known as the Leatherstocking Tales.",Fiction,1721,N/A,0,en

A Freewheelin' Time,Suze Rotolo,Crown,2009-05-12,"“The girl with Bob Dylan on the cover of Freewheelin’ broke a forty-five-year silence with this affectionate and dignified recalling of a relationship doomed by Dylan’s growing fame.” –UNCUT magazine Suze Rotolo chronicles her coming of age in Greenwich Village during the 1960s and the early days of the folk music explosion, when Bob Dylan was finding his voice and she was his muse. A shy girl from Queens, Suze was the daughter of Italian working-class Communists, growing up at the dawn of the Cold War. It was the age of McCarthy and Suze was an outsider in her neighborhood and at school. She found solace in poetry, art, and music—and in Greenwich Village, where she encountered like-minded and politically active friends. One hot July day in 1961, Suze met Bob Dylan, then a rising musician, at a concert at Riverside Church. She was seventeen, he was twenty; they were both vibrant, curious, and inseparable. During the years they were together, Dylan transformed from an obscure folk singer into an uneasy spokesperson for a generation. A Freewheelin’ Time is a hopeful, intimate memoir of a vital movement at its most creative. It captures the excitement of youth, the heartbreak of young love, and the struggles for a brighter future in a time when everything seemed possible.",Biography & Autobiography,386,N/A,0,en

Intelligence collected at the time concluded that the Americans had only three options to effectively force the Imperial Japanese Military into surrender: encirclement, blockade, and bombardment; isolating Japan from its forces in China, Korea, and Formosa; or engaging Japan through a full-scale amphibious invasion.

Hydrogeology,"Kevin M. Hiscock, Victor F. Bense",John Wiley & Sons,2021-11-08,"HYDROGEOLOGY Hydrogeology: Principles and Practice provides a comprehensive introduction to the study of hydrogeology to enable the reader to appreciate the significance of groundwater in meeting current and future environmental and sustainable water resource challenges. This new edition has been thoroughly updated to reflect advances in the field since 2014 and includes over 350 new references. The book presents a systematic approach to understanding groundwater starting with new insights into the distribution of groundwater in the Earth’s upper continental crust and the role of groundwater as an agent of global material and elemental fluxes. Following chapters explain the fundamental physical and chemical principles of hydrogeology, and later chapters feature groundwater field investigation techniques in the context of catchment processes, as well as chapters on groundwater quality and contaminant hydrogeology, including a section on emerging contamination from microplastic pollution. Unique features of the book are chapters on the application of environmental isotopes and noble gases in the interpretation of aquifer evolution, and a discussion of regional characteristics such as topography, compaction and variable fluid density on geological processes affecting past, present and future groundwater flow regimes. The last chapter discusses future challenges for groundwater governance and management for the long-term sustainability of groundwater resources, including the role of managed aquifer recharge, and examines the linkages between groundwater and climate change, including impacts on cold-region hydrogeology. Given the drive to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, the interaction of groundwater in the exploitation of energy resources, including renewable resources and shale gas, is reviewed. Throughout the text, boxes and a set of colour plates drawn from the authors’ teaching and research experience are used to explain special topics and to illustrate international case studies ranging from transboundary aquifers and submarine groundwater discharge to the hydrogeochemical factors that have influenced the history of malting and brewing in Europe. The appendices provide conversion tables and useful reference material, and include review questions and exercises, with answers, to help develop the reader’s knowledge and problem-solving skills in hydrogeology. This highly informative and accessible textbook is essential reading for undergraduate and graduate students primarily in earth sciences, environmental sciences and physical geography with an interest in hydrogeology or groundwater topics. The book will also find use among practitioners in hydrogeology, soil science, civil engineering and landscape planning who are involved in environmental and resource protection issues requiring an understanding of groundwater.",Technology & Engineering,796,N/A,0,en

Invasive fungal infections have been increasing in many patient populations, including: those with AIDS; transplant recipients; and the elderly. As these populations grow, so does the diversity of fungal pathogens. Paralleling this development, there have been recent launches of several new antifungal drugs and therapies. Clinical Mycology offers a comprehensive review of this discipline. Organized by types of fungi, this volume covers microbiologic, epidemiologic and demographic aspects of fungal infections as well as diagnostic, clinical, therapeutic, and preventive approaches.

System-specific PI Control Theory for Fluid and Motion Systems,Kalman I. Krakow,Universal-Publishers,2006,"A system-specific feedback control theory for fluid process control and for motion control has been developed to enable analytical tuning. The system-specific theory enables the determination of the coefficients required to implement (i.e., tune) a proportional-integral (PI) control system analytically from physical characteristics of the fluid or motion system. PI control is essentially PID control with the derivative (D) coefficient set equal to zero. (A derivative coefficient is not essential and may have a detrimental effect on system response characteristics.) System-specific theory, based on the fundamental algorithm for PID control systems, was developed from a 'back-to-basics' perspective considering digital, not analog, control of fluid systems and motion systems independently. For additional information, visit www.control-innovation.com ControlProblems is an application containing numerical system models corresponding to the problems presented in Chapters 23 though 27 of this book. The problems represent typical systems that may be analyzed with system-specific PI control theory. The application enables validation of proportional integral (PI) coefficient calculations as well as investigation of system response characteristics with various PI coefficients. Numerical data for the problems is presented in the ControlProblems application. This data may be changed by the user to simulate different PI coefficients, modulated capacities, complete response intervals, signal update intervals, loads, etc. Suitability of user-specified PI coefficients may be evaluated from simulated system response characteristics. System response characteristic for default PI coefficients may be used for comparison. The application is designed for computers running a Windows® 98, or later, operating system. The download is a zip file - ControlProblems.zip - containing the application in a file titled ControlProblems.exe, files required to run the exe file, and files required to install and remove the application. The following download and setup procedure is required. * The download should be saved in its own folder, e.g., C:\ControlProblems or C:\Temp. * The files contained in the zip file should be extracted to the same folder. * Run setup.exe to install the application.

The moment Ambrose Brody steps into a fortune-teller's tent, he is whisked into a quest that spans millennia with his best friend, an enigmatic carnival girl, and an unusual family heirloom that drops them into the middle of the nineteenth century! The year 1852 is a dangerous time for three non-white children, and they must work together to dodge slave-catchers and save ancestors from certain death--all while figuring out how to get back to the future. Fortunately, they have a guide in the helpful hints embedded in an ancient Chinese text called the I-Ching, which they interpret using Morse Code. But how can a three-thousand-year-old book be sending messages into the future through a code developed in the 1830s?

Situating itself at this remarkable turning-point in Indonesian history, it shows that local artists have not been mere victims or products of globalization, but virtual migrants who self-consciously steer the electronic media on their worldwide travels. The book gives an analysis of relevant case-studies and historical debates on culture and representation in Indonesia and the West, and also provides an overview of early developments and recent trends in the Indonesian and West Javanese media landscapes. With its focus on Sundanese language and culture, it is a pioneering and gap-filling complement to the existing literature on media.",History,232,N/A,0,en

Pham,Macmillan,2000-09-02,"Winner of the Kiriyama Pacific Rim Book Prize A New York Times Notable Book of the Year Winner of the Whiting Writers' Award A Seattle Post-Intelligencer Best Book of the Year Catfish and Mandala is the story of an American odyssey--a solo bicycle voyage around the Pacific Rim to Vietnam--made by a young Vietnamese-American man in pursuit of both his adopted homeland and his forsaken fatherland. Andrew X. Pham was born in Vietnam and raised in California. His father had been a POW of the Vietcong; his family came to America as ""boat people."" Following the suicide of his sister, Pham quit his job, sold all of his possessions, and embarked on a year-long bicycle journey that took him through the Mexican desert, around a thousand-mile loop from Narita to Kyoto in Japan; and, after five months and 2,357 miles, to Saigon, where he finds ""nothing familiar in the bombed-out darkness."" In Vietnam, he's taken for Japanese or Korean by his countrymen, except, of course, by his relatives, who doubt that as a Vietnamese he has the stamina to complete his journey (""Only Westerners can do it""); and in the United States he's considered anything but American. A vibrant, picaresque memoir written with narrative flair and an eye-opening sense of adventure, Catfish and Mandala is an unforgettable search for cultural identity.",Biography & Autobiography,356,3.5,2,en

The Wisdom of Anxiety,Sheryl Paul,Hachette UK,2019-06-27,"'We have to shift from a mindset of shame, which sees anxiety as evidence of brokenness, to a mindset of curiosity, which recognizes that anxiety is evidence of our sensitive heart, our imaginative mind and our soul's desire to grow towards wholeness.' Three million people are thought to suffer from anxiety in the UK, and it is an issue that affects a growing number of people across all ages. For anyone troubled by obsessive thoughts, insomnia and other manifestations of anxiety, counsellor Sheryl Paul offers shelter in the storm. In The Wisdom of Anxiety, Paul reveals that anxiety, like any emotion, is a signal - a clear bodily invitation to heal and renew your trust in your choices, self-image and core values. Weaving together practical exercises with personal stories, Paul offers medication-free approaches for accessing the gifts in different kinds of anxiety, and especially the anxiety summoned by life's transitions, for example a career change, becoming parents or becoming carers for loved ones. Chapters include recognising the symptoms of anxiety, its origins, the myth of 'normal', the expectation of happiness and a timeline of healing that includes exercises for the body and mind. There are also chapters on parenting in an age of anxiety and the vulnerability of connection and relationships.",Health & Fitness,218,N/A,0,en

Ford Model T Coast to Coast,Tom Cotter,Quarto Publishing Group USA,2018-05-15,"Driverless cars are on the horizon, but before the world falls asleep in the driver’s seat, let’s take a look back down the road from whence we have come. Ford Model-T Coast-to-Coast, documents the cross-country adventure of two brave drivers as they pilot a century-old Model-T on a 3,000-mile journey from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Coast. The book is as much a contemplation of early-20th century American life as it is a fond farewell to the automotive age. Can the car still be the vehicle of freedom and discovery, when we’re no longer in command? Or will we finally be able to fully appreciate the scenery rushing past? Accompanied by Michael Alan Ross’ evocative photography, author Tom Cotter stops in small towns, meets local people and hears their stories about cars, travel, and life. Cotter and Ross also explore back roads adjacent to his main route, the Lincoln Highway—the first transcontinental road. Significant cross-country runs, such as those by speed-record setter Cannonball Baker, and literary adventurers such as Jack Kerourac, John Steinbeck and Bill Bryson are considered in light of the driverless future. Cotter also drives some of the same roads that a young Edsel Ford traveled in his father’s Model T upon high school graduation in 1917. In addition to the central road trip, Cotter also visits interesting automotive and transport museums as well as “keepers of the flame” such as Model-T clubs, mechanics, junkyards and collectors across the country. He also records the numerous trials and tribulations in keeping a 100-year-old car operating on a 3,000-mile journey, something the driverless car of the future is unlikely to encounter. Join Cotter on his ""slow drive across a fast country."" You'll be glad you did.",Transportation,227,N/A,0,en

Conversations on Ethical Leadership,Ingrid Leman Stefanovic,University of Toronto Press,2023-09-12,"Highlighting ethical leadership strategies, Conversations on Ethical Leadership explores what makes for strong, well-informed, morally sound decision-making at all levels of an organization. In addressing a range of challenges faced by universities and applying those lessons to the broader community of the public and private sectors, Ingrid Leman Stefanovic and her contributors tackle a host of issues related to advancing ethics, diversity, inclusiveness, and the art of moral leadership. Each chapter, written by an author with roots in the academy, includes a subsequent commentary by a community leader who highlights the broader takeaways that emerge for society from the university experience. In this way, the book becomes a conversation between the academic and non-academic worlds about issues that affect any prominent organization. It offers a unique range of novel and timely topics, from responsibility-centred budgeting to post-pandemic planning, responsiveness to climate change, Indigenous leadership, free speech, academic integrity, and much more. In doing so, Conversations on Ethical Leadership ultimately reveals how we can build and preserve an ethically responsible sense of purpose at our post-secondary learning institutions and beyond.",Education,238,N/A,0,en

The Armstrongs' A-Z Guide to Life,"Ann Armstrong, John Armstrong",Random House,2009-07-28,"Have you ever wondered how typewriters can rival commercial radio? Why, according to John, it's best to shave only once a week, and with old fashioned soap and water? And what the various repercussions of spring and its extra hour of daylight bring? The BBC created a fantastically cult television series when they filmed the daily operations of John and Ann's double glazing firm U-Fit, the third largest in Coventry. It was here we were first introduced to John's misanthropic musings and no-nonsense attitude to management and his wife Ann's doting loyalty. Now their individual and highly entertaining personalities have been brought to the page, as they ruminate on various aspects of life from asbos to Buddhism, and Chekov to Maltesers.",Humor,226,N/A,0,en

Geocomplexity and the Physics of Earthquakes,"John Rundle, John B. Rundle, Donald L. Turcotte, William Klein",American Geophysical Union,2000-01-10,"Published by the American Geophysical Union as part of the Geophysical Monograph Series, Volume 120. Earthquakes in urban centers are capable of causing enormous damage. The January 16, 1995 Kobe, Japan earthquake was only a magnitude 6.9 event and yet produced an estimated $200 billion loss. Despite an active earthquake prediction program in Japan, this event was a complete surprise. Similar scenarios are possible in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and other urban centers around the Pacific plate boundary. The development of forecast or prediction methodologies for these great damaging earthquakes has been complicated by the fact that the largest events repeat at irregular intervals of hundreds to thousands of years, resulting in a limited historical record that has frustrated phenomenological studies. The papers in this book describe an emerging alternative approach, which is based on a new understanding of earthquake physics arising from the construction and analysis of numerical simulations. With these numerical simulations, earthquake physics now can be investigated in numerical laboratories. Simulation data from numerical experiments can be used to develop theoretical understanding that can be subsequently applied to observed data. These methods have been enabled by the information technology revolution, in which fundamental advances in computing and communications are placing vast computational resources at our disposal.",Nature,288,N/A,0,en

Travel & See,Kobena Mercer,Duke University Press,2016-02-04,"Over the years, Kobena Mercer has critically illuminated the visual innovations of African American and black British artists. In Travel & See he presents a diasporic model of criticism that gives close attention to aesthetic strategies while tracing the shifting political and cultural contexts in which black visual art circulates. In eighteen essays, which cover the period from 1992 to 2012 and discuss such leading artists as Isaac Julien, Renée Green, Kerry James Marshall, and Yinka Shonibare, Mercer provides nothing less than a counternarrative of global contemporary art that reveals how the “dialogical principle” of cross-cultural interaction not only has transformed commonplace perceptions of blackness today but challenges us to rethink the entangled history of modernism as well.",Art,299,N/A,0,en

The Consumer's Guide to Effective Environmental Choices,"Michael Brower, Warren Leon",Harmony Books,1999,"From one of the most prestigious nonprofit organizations devoted to environmental issues comes a clear, practical, and rational overview of the relationship between consumers and the environment. Paper or plastic? Bus or car? Old house or new? Cloth diapers or disposables? Some choices have a huge impact on the environment; others are of negligible importance. To those of us who care about our quality of life and what is happening to the earth, this is a vastly important issue. In these pages, the Union of Concerned Scientists help inform consumers about everyday decisions that significantly affect the environment. For example, a few major decisions--such as the choice of a house or vehicle--have such a disproportionately large affect on the environment that minor environmental infractions shrink by comparison. This book identifies the 4 Most Significant Consumer-Related Environmental Problems, the 7 Most Damaging Spending Categories, 11 Priority Actions, and 7 Rules for Responsible Consumption.

Reclaiming Travel,"Ilan Stavans, Joshua Ellison",Duke University Press,2015-05-09,"Based on a controversial opinion piece originally published in the New York Times, Reclaiming Travel is a provocative meditation on the meaning of travel from ancient times to the twenty-first century. Ilan Stavans and Joshua Ellison seek to understand why we travel and what has come to be missing from our contemporary understanding of travel. Engaging with canonical and contemporary texts, they explore the differences between travel and tourism, the relationship between travel and memory, the genre of travel writing, and the power of mapmaking, Stavans and Ellison call for a rethinking of the art of travel, which they define as a transformative quest that gives us deeper access to ourselves. Tourism, Stavans and Ellison argue, is inauthentic, choreographed, sterile, shallow, and rooted in colonialism. They critique theme parks and kitsch tourism, such as the shantytown hotels in South Africa where guests stay in shacks made of corrugated metal and cardboard yet have plenty of food, water and space. Tourists, they assert, are merely content with escapism, thrill seeking, or obsessively snapping photographs. Resisting simple moralizing, the authors also remind us that people don’t divide neatly into crude categories like travelers and tourists. They provoke us to reflect on the opportunities and perils in our own habits. In this powerful manifesto, Stavans and Ellison argue that travel should be an art through which our restlessness finds expression—a search for meaning not only in our own lives but also in the lives of others. It is not about the destination; rather, travel is about loss, disorientation, and discovering our place in the universe.",Travel,118,N/A,0,en

Oh Crap! Potty Training,Jamie Glowacki,Simon and Schuster,2015-06-16,"From potty-training expert and social worker Jamie Glowacki, who’s already helped over half a million families successfully toilet train their preschoolers, comes a newly revised and updated guide that’s “straight-up, parent-tested, and funny to boot” (Amber Dusick, author of Parenting: Illustrated with Crappy Pictures). Worried about potty training? Let Jamie Glowacki, potty-training expert, show you how it’s done. Her six-step, proven process to get your toddler out of diapers and onto the toilet has already worked for tens of thousands of kids and their parents. Here’s the good news: your child is probably ready to be potty trained EARLIER than you think (ideally, between 20–30 months), and it can be done FASTER than you expect (most kids get the basics in a few days—but Jamie’s got you covered even if it takes a little longer). If you’ve ever said to yourself: -How do I know if my kid is ready? -Why won’t my child poop in the potty? -How do I avoid “potty power struggles”? -How can I get their daycare provider on board? -My kid was doing so well—why is he regressing? -And what about nighttime?! Oh Crap! Potty Training can solve all of these (and other) common issues. This isn’t theory, you’re not bribing with candy, and there are no gimmicks. This is real-world, from-the-trenches potty training information—all the questions and all the answers you need to do it once and be done with diapers for good.",Family & Relationships,186,N/A,0,en

Traveling Heavy,Ruth Behar,Duke University Press,2013-04-24,"Traveling Heavy is a deeply moving, unconventional memoir by the master storyteller and cultural anthropologist Ruth Behar. Through evocative stories, she portrays her life as an immigrant child and later, as an adult woman who loves to travel but is terrified of boarding a plane. With an open heart, she writes about her Yiddish-Sephardic-Cuban-American family, as well as the strangers who show her kindness as she makes her way through the world. Compassionate, curious, and unafraid to reveal her failings, Behar embraces the unexpected insights and adventures of travel, whether those be learning that she longed to become a mother after being accused of giving the evil eye to a baby in rural Mexico, or going on a zany pilgrimage to the Behar World Summit in the Spanish town of Béjar. Behar calls herself an anthropologist who specializes in homesickness. Repeatedly returning to her homeland of Cuba, unwilling to utter her last goodbye, she is obsessed by the question of why we leave home to find home. For those of us who travel heavy with our own baggage, Behar is an indispensable guide, full of grace and hope, in the perpetual search for connection that defines our humanity.",Biography & Autobiography,194,N/A,0,en

Shaping the Law of Obligations,,Oxford University Press,2023-11-30,"Ewan McKendrick has been an instrumental figure in shaping the law of obligations, both as a practitioner and as a professor at the University of Oxford and University College London. On the occasion of his retirement from the Oxford Law Faculty, this volume presents a collection of essays in his honour. The contributions pay tribute to and reflect the breadth of Ewan McKendrick's scholarship and published work. Many are comparative in nature, reflecting a key element of his work. The volume is divided into four parts: contract, tort, unjust enrichment, and commercial law, with each of the 23 essays discussing a particular complex question or idea in its area. Topics include duress, good faith, frustration, the illegality defence, contractual interpretation, the basis for different forms of damages, the role of contracts in family life, corporate liability, the Marex tort, receivables financing, the regulation of international commercial contracts, the sale of goods, the development of transnational commercial law, mistakes of law, and implied terms. All 25 of the contributors have either been taught by, or worked closely with Ewan McKendrick (or, in some cases, both); and are all leading academics and/or practitioners, including two current members of the United Kingdom Supreme Court and a Justice of the High Court of Australia.",Law,555,N/A,0,en

Semantics,Igor Mel’čuk,John Benjamins Publishing Company,2015-01-14,"This book presents an innovative and novel approach to linguistic semantics, starting from the idea that language can be described as a mechanism for the expression of linguistic Meanings as particular surface forms, or Texts. Semantics is specifically that system of rules that ensures a transition from a Semantic Representation of the Meaning of a family of synonymous sentences to the Deep-Syntactic Representation of a particular sentence. Framed in the terms of Meaning-Text linguistics, the present volume closes the publication of the three volume series. It discusses in detail several linguistic notions crucial to the development of Meaning-Text models of natural languages: semantic and syntactic actants, government pattern, lexical functions, linguistic connotations, phrasemes, the meaning of grammatical cases, and linguistic dependencies. The notions under analysis are illustrated from a variety of languages. Reflecting the author’s life-long dedication to the study of the semantics and syntax of natural language, this book is a paradigm-shifting contribution to the language sciences, whose originality and daring will make it essential reading for linguists, anthropologists, semioticians, and computational linguists.",Language Arts & Disciplines,567,N/A,0,en

Company Law,Eva Micheler,Oxford University Press,2021,"This book advances a real entity theory of company law. In this theory the company is a legal entity allowing an organization to act autonomously in law, and company law establishes procedures facilitating autonomous organizational decision-making. The theory builds on the insight that organizations or firms are a social phenomenon outside of the law and that they are autonomous actors in their own right. They are more than the sum of the contributions of their participants and they act independently of the views and interests of their participants. The real entity theory advanced in this book explains company law as it stands at a positive level. Companies are liable in tort and crime. The statute creates roles for shareholders, directors, a company secretary, and auditors and so facilitates a process leading to organizational action. The law also integrates the interests of creditors and stakeholders. The book states the law as of 1 August 2021.",Law,321,N/A,0,en

An Introduction to Geophysical Exploration,"Philip Kearey, Michael Brooks, Ian Hill",John Wiley & Sons,2013-04-16,"This new edition of the well-established Kearey and Brooks text is fully updated to reflect the important developments in geophysical methods since the production of the previous edition. The broad scope of previous editions is maintained, with even greater clarity of explanations from the revised text and extensively revised figures. Each of the major geophysical methods is treated systematically developing the theory behind the method and detailing the instrumentation, field data acquisition techniques, data processing and interpretation methods. The practical application of each method to such diverse exploration applications as petroleum, groundwater, engineering, environmental and forensic is shown by case histories. The mathematics required in order to understand the text is purposely kept to a minimum, so the book is suitable for courses taken in geophysics by all undergraduate students. It will also be of use to postgraduate students who might wish to include geophysics in their studies and to all professional geologists who wish to discover the breadth of the subject in connection with their own work.",Science,292,5,1,en

The Constitution Goes to College,Rodney A. Smolla,NYU Press,2011-04-11,"American college campuses, where ideas are freely exchanged, contested, and above all uncensored, are historical hotbeds of political and social turmoil. In the past decade alone, the media has carefully tracked the controversy surrounding the speech of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at Columbia, the massacres at Virginia Tech, the dismissal of Harvard’s President Lawrence Summers, and the lacrosse team rape case at Duke, among others. No matter what the event, the conflicts that arise on our campuses can be viewed in terms of constitutional principles, which either control or influence outcomes of these events. In turn, constitutional principles are frequently shaped and forged by campus culture, creating a symbiotic relationship in which constitutional values influence the nature of universities, which themselves influence the nature of our constitutional values. In The Constitution Goes to College, Rodney A. Smolla—a former dean and current university president who is an expert on the First Amendment—deftly uses the American university as a lens through which to view the Constitution in action. Drawing on landmark cases and conflicts played out on college campuses, Smolla demonstrates how five key constitutional ideas—the living Constitution, the division between public and private spheres, the distinction between rights and privileges, ordered liberty, and equality—are not only fiercely contested on college campuses, but also dominate the shape and identity of American university life. Ultimately, Smolla compellingly demonstrates that the American college community, like the Constitution, is orderly and hierarchical yet intellectually free and open, a microcosm where these constitutional dichotomies play out with heightened intensity.",Law,240,N/A,0,en

"Translation, Travel, Migration",Loredana Polezzi,Routledge,2016-04-08,"The connection between travel and translation is often evoked in contemporary critical theory, both practices seen as metaphors of mobility and flux linked to globalized 'post-modern' society. Travel is a multiple activity, encompassing temporary and voluntary displacement, repeated movement, exile, economic migration, diaspora. Places of origin are often plural and unstable, in spite of the enduring appeal of traditional labels such as 'mother country' or 'patrie'. The multiple interfaces between translation, travel and migration are the focus of all contributions in this special issue. Starting from different points of view, and using a variety of methodologies, the authors raise fundamental questions about the way in which we perceive the link between language, national or ethnic identity, and individual voice. Topics range from the interaction between travel, travel narratives and translation in early English representations of China, to the special role played by interpreters in mediating the first contact between a literate and a non-literate culture; from the multiple functions and audiences addressed by contemporary Romani literature and its translation, to the political as well a cultural implications of translating popular music across the Bosporus. A number of the articles focus on detailed textual analysis, covering the intersection between exile, self-translation and translingualism in the work of Manuel Puig; the uses and limitations of translation in the works of migrant authors; or the impact on figurations of Europe of experimental work embracing polylingualism. Collectively, these contributions also underline the importance of a closer examination of our assumptions about who the translators and the interpreters are, and what roles they play in our society.",Language Arts & Disciplines,249,N/A,0,en

The Chronic Pain Couple,Karra Eloff,Exisle Publishing,2022-07-06,"The struggle to maintain joy & a fulfilling relationship while coping with chronic illness and pain is a serious problem for millions of people today. Australian entrepreneur and health professional Karra Eloff draws on academic research and her own pursuit of joy in spite of suffering to bring this trailblazing, compassionate, low-energy and practical path to a remarkable new normal, for you and your chosen human/partner. On average, one in five adults suffer from chronic pain. In older people, the number rises to three in five. Most of these people don’t realise they don’t have to settle for a survival-based coexistence with their partner or bury their hopes for success and joy under a mountain of heat packs or duvets. Chronic illness or pain, according to Karra, need not hold you back from experiencing personal joy and success. It is possible to forge a path to remarkable—to move the dial of a relationship challenged with chronic pain from embattled and exhausted to joyful and passion-filled. This is possible through small, practical changes that require little energy but make a big impact in the areas of: • Communication • Mental health • Intimacy • Personal Success If you experience chronic pain or love someone with a chronic illness this book is for you. If you are a health professional seeking practical advice for people with chronic pain, this book is for you.",Health & Fitness,235,N/A,0,en

Going First Class?,Vered Amit,Berghahn Books,2011,"People travel as never before. However, anthropological research has tended to focus primarily on either labor migration or on tourism. In contrast, this collection of essays explores a diversity of circumstances and impetuses towards contemporary mobility. It ranges from expatriates to peripatetic professionals to middle class migrants in search of extended educational and career opportunities to people seeking self development through travel, either by moving after retirement or visiting educational retreats. These situations, however, converge in the significant resources, variously of finances, time, credentials or skills, which these voyagers are able to call on in embarking on their respective journeys. Accordingly, this volume seeks to tease out the scope and implications of the relatively privileged circumstances under which these voyages are being undertaken.",Business & Economics,171,N/A,0,en

Isaac Newton,James Gleick,Vintage,2007-12-18,"Isaac Newton was born in a stone farmhouse in 1642, fatherless and unwanted by his mother. When he died in London in 1727 he was so renowned he was given a state funeral—an unheard-of honor for a subject whose achievements were in the realm of the intellect. During the years he was an irascible presence at Trinity College, Cambridge, Newton imagined properties of nature and gave them names—mass, gravity, velocity—things our science now takes for granted. Inspired by Aristotle, spurred on by Galileo’s discoveries and the philosophy of Descartes, Newton grasped the intangible and dared to take its measure, a leap of the mind unparalleled in his generation. James Gleick, the author of Chaos and Genius, and one of the most acclaimed science writers of his generation, brings the reader into Newton’s reclusive life and provides startlingly clear explanations of the concepts that changed forever our perception of bodies, rest, and motion—ideas so basic to the twenty-first century, it can truly be said: We are all Newtonians.",Biography & Autobiography,290,4,1,en

Madgermanes,Birgit Weyhe,V&q Books,2021,"'Madgermanes' is what the Mozambican workers once contracted out to East Germany are called today. At the end of the 1970s, some 20,000 of them were sent from the People's Republic of Mozambique to the GDR to labour for their socialist sister country. After the Berlin Wall fell, almost all of them lost their residency status. Decades later, they are still waiting for most of their wages to be paid. Birgit Weyhe depicts their search for belonging and a place to call home, caught between two cultures and two states that no longer exist. Based on extensive interviews, she creates three fictitious narrators and transforms their stories into a visual language that skilfully interweaves African and European narrative traditions. Winner of the Berthold Leibinger Foundation Comic Book Prize and the Max and Moritz Prize for Best German Comic 'The book is a great document and a monument to the injustice that befell me and other contract workers in East Germany.'

The Traveling Salesman Problem,"David L. Applegate, Robert E. Bixby, Vašek Chvátal, William J. Cook",Princeton University Press,2011-09-19,"This book presents the latest findings on one of the most intensely investigated subjects in computational mathematics--the traveling salesman problem. It sounds simple enough: given a set of cities and the cost of travel between each pair of them, the problem challenges you to find the cheapest route by which to visit all the cities and return home to where you began. Though seemingly modest, this exercise has inspired studies by mathematicians, chemists, and physicists. Teachers use it in the classroom. It has practical applications in genetics, telecommunications, and neuroscience. The authors of this book are the same pioneers who for nearly two decades have led the investigation into the traveling salesman problem. They have derived solutions to almost eighty-six thousand cities, yet a general solution to the problem has yet to be discovered. Here they describe the method and computer code they used to solve a broad range of large-scale problems, and along the way they demonstrate the interplay of applied mathematics with increasingly powerful computing platforms. They also give the fascinating history of the problem--how it developed, and why it continues to intrigue us.",Mathematics,606,N/A,0,en

Tunisia,Oscar Scafidi,Bradt Travel Guides,2023-06-26,"Written by long-term resident, adventurer and experienced travel writer Oscar Scafidi, this brand new Bradt publication is the most up-to-date, comprehensive travel guidebook to Tunisia produced by a mainstream publisher. Taking account of this North African country’s recent political and social flux, and covering each of the nation’s 24 governorates, the book’s listings for hotels, restaurants and activities cater for all types of travellers and budgets. Complemented by 80 detailed maps and advice on navigating bureaucracy, this guide provides all the practical information you need to visit or explore here. The birthplace of the Arab Spring in 2010, Tunisia is readily accessible from European cities. From relaxing on Mediterranean beaches to camel-trekking or quad-biking in the Sahara Desert and marvelling at the moonscapes of Chott el Djerid salt lake, this fascinating nation crams much excitement and interest into a small area. In the 2,000-year-old capital of Tunis, originally a Berber settlement, you can haggle in the ancient Medina, browse artefacts at the Bardo National Museum or enjoy fresh seafood at waterfront restaurants. Archaeology afficionados will hardly know where to begin in Africa’s fourth-richest country for UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the remnants of Ancient Carthage, perhaps, or superbly preserved Roman ruins, such as the world’s second-largest amphitheatre of El Jem? Djerba, where Berbers, Muslims and the world’s oldest Jewish community have co-existed for centuries, is a world-renowned kitesurfer’s paradise. Sunseekers have over 1,000km of coastline on which to bask – why not sip cocktails at the upmarket resort of Gammarth, just north of Tunis – while hedonists can party at a mammoth 30-hour rave in the desert at Ong Jmal. Meanwhile, film buffs can make pilgrimages to sets used in the Star Wars movies or explore canyons used by Steven Spielberg’ for an Indiana Jones film, and culture vultures can visit Islamic sites such as the Ribat of Monastir fort or 7th-century city of Kairouan. With a language appendix covering Tunisian Arabic and French, detailed context that helps visitors travel with awareness and sensitivity, and in-depth travel information, Bradt's Tunisia is an indispensable practical companion to exploring this exciting country.",Travel,428,N/A,0,en
"Have Brides, Will Travel","William W. Johnstone, J.A. Johnstone",Pinnacle,2019-09-24,"JOHNSTONE. WHERE IT’S NEVER QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT. In this rollicking new series, the Johnstones cordially invite you to the biggest, baddest event of the season—one that gives a whole new meaning to “shotgun wedding” . . . Here come the brides. And the bullets . . . Bo Creel and Scratch Morton are lifelong drifters who keep one eye on the horizon, one finger on the trigger, and one foot out the door. Roaming the West is what keeps them young, or so Scratch tells Bo. But when they save the life of Cyrus Keegan—the owner of a matrimonial agency—they receive an unexpected proposal that’s hard to resist. Keegan needs to deliver five mail order brides to a mining town in New Mexico Territory. All Scratch and Bo have to do is get these gals to the church on time—and alive, if possible . . . The job seems easy enough—and the brides-to-be are even easier on the eyes. Cecilia, Beth, Luella, Rose, and Jean all need good husbands. But their prospects look bad when the journey to the altar includes Mexican banditos, scheming silver robbers, and one overbearing rancher who won’t take no for an answer. Bo and Scratch promised to keep the ladies safe—and keep their hands to themselves—but it could be the last vow they’ll ever make . . . Live Free. Read Hard.",Fiction,401,N/A,0,en
Rwanda,Philip Briggs,Bradt Travel Guides,2023-12-06,"Now into its eighth edition and written by Philip Briggs, the world’s leading author of African guidebooks, Bradt’s Rwanda has been the go-to guide for visitors to the ‘Land of a Thousand Hills’ for more than 20 years. Still the only standalone guide in English to this increasingly popular destination, it remains in a class of its own for in-depth information. With fresh research into developments across the country, Bradt’s Rwanda includes expanded coverage of Gishwati-Mukura National Park, which opened to tourism in 2021, and up-to-date details of rapidly modernising Kigali, considered Africa’s cleanest city. Rwanda continues to change and develop at an unprecedented pace – no country has a higher proportion of female parliamentarians – and there’s hardly a more accessible part of Africa. It’s no less intriguing for the convenience, however, and Rwanda’s superlative natural attractions constantly improve, with growing animal populations, as in Akagera National Park, where Africa’s Big Five (rhino, lion, leopard, elephant and buffalo) can be seen. This new edition also includes extensive maps and natural history information, while details of kayak and canoe excursions on Lake Kivu and the Mukungwa River complement advice about staying on tea plantations at Sorwathe or Gisovu. It contains everything you need to know about tracking mountain gorillas in Volcanoes National Park (workplace of primatologist Dian Fossey of Gorillas in the Mist fame) and chimpanzees in Nyungwe National Park (East Africa’s largest surviving montane forest, harbouring numerous endemic birds and primates) and Gishwati-Mukura (which is also the only location for the rare golden monkey outside the Virunga mountains). Also covered are Nyanza, with its hilltop Rukari King’s Palace Museum, and the Ethnographic Museum of Rwanda, the top cultural site in Butare (Huye). A chapter on nearby cities and national parks provides key necessary information to take an excursion into neighbouring DRC, including how to see lowland gorillas. As not only the most in-depth guide available in English, but also the guide with the longest history in the country itself, Bradt’s Rwanda is the indispensable companion for visitors, including wildlife enthusiasts and Africa aficionados.",Travel,368,N/A,0,en

FOUR JOHNSTONE WEDDINGS—AND A FUNERAL If anyone can get a shipment of brides to the church on time, it’s Bo Creel and Scratch Morton. But this time, they’ll have to cross hell and high water to escort four marriage-bound beauties to a remote gold mining town in Alaska. The brides-to-be include a dangerously attractive widow, her sweet-hearted niece, and two of their friends. The roadblocks to the altar include a lecherous saloon owner, a lovesick sailor, and a gang of hired guns. And that’s just for starters . . . The real trouble begins when they reach the Alaskan boomtown. It’s a hotbed of gold and greed, as wild as any Texas frontier. It’s clear to Bo and Scratch that the ladies’ “eligible bachelors” are definitely not as advertised. But—to Bo and Scratch’s surprise—neither are their mail-order brides. Before anyone starts exchanging vows and tossing rice, this gold-hungry wedding party will be swapping lead. And the RSVPs will be RIPs . . . Live Free. Read Hard.",Fiction,368,N/A,0,en

It questions a mercantile structure that by necessity disallows the presence of ocean as a real space in order to flatten the world into a Pangaea of capital. The project is presented in two volumes, released in conjunction with an exhibition of Marina Zurkow's work (with collaborators Sarah Rothberg, Surya Mattu, and others) at bitforms gallery in New York City in February 2016.This book, More&More (A Guide to the Harmonized System), is an experimental ""brick"" of a book that intervenes in the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (also known as the HS Code). The HS Code is the internationally accepted standard of product classification, which codifies the way nations conduct import/export. All legal trade products (and illegal ones that find loopholes) are shipped using this system.

Language and Ecology in Southern and Eastern Arabia,"Janet C.E. Watson, Jon C.

This volume examines the expressions of, and threats and challenges to, this relationship in southern and eastern Arabia. Exploring the ways in which indigenous languages reflect the close relationship between people and their natural environment, this book presents an overview of the key threats and challenges, and introduces the methodologies used to investigate them. Across the chapters, case studies are presented dealing with language, gesture and ecology, the significance of naming, the role of narratives in the language–ecology relationship, and conservation and revitalisation of bio-cultural diversity in Arabia. Taking a multidisciplinary view, this book argues for the central role that language plays in facing the challenges and threats to bio-cultural diversity, and presents methods for the study of the language–nature relationship that can be applied globally.",Language Arts & Disciplines,297,N/A,0,en

The beaches are glorious sweeps of white sand, broken by rocky coves nested by storks, or backed by caramel coloured sandstone cliffs. The towns and villages of the interior appear little-changed since medieval times - clusters of sugar-cube houses tumble down hills from heavy-set castles. There are palaces and there are myriad megalithic monuments - lost in the rolling countryside in the olive groves, or among orange trees and withered cork oaks. Wild boar and lynx roam the extensive forests and heathlands - which offer wonderful hiking and hill walking. And the food. fresh Atlantic bream, sizzling prawns, forest-reared pork and dozens of glorious wines with which to wash it down.

The Presidency of Benjamin Harrison,"Homer Edward Socolofsky, Allan B. Spetter","Lawrence, Kan. : University Press of Kansas",1987,"Benjamin Harrison was an early proponent of American expansion in the Pacific, a key figure in such landmark legislation as the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and the McKinley Tariff, and one of the Gilded Age's most eloquent speakers. Yet he remains one of our most neglected and least understood presidents. In this first interpretive study of the Harrison administration, the authors illuminate our twenty-third president's character and policies and rescue him from the long shadow of his charismatic secretary of state, James G. Blaine. An Ohio native and Indiana lawyer, Harrison opened the second century of the American presidency in a rapidly industrializing and expanding nation. His inaugural address reflected the nation's optimism: ""The masses of our people are better fed, clothed, and housed than their fathers were. The facilities for popular education have been vastly enlarged and more generally diffused. The virtues of courage and patriotism have given proof of their continued presence and increasing power in the hearts and over the lives of our people."" But the burdens and realities of his office soon imposed themselves upon Harrison. The biggest blow came at midterm with the Republicans' devastating losses in the 1890 congressional elections. In an era of congressional dominance, those losses eroded Harrison's position as a legislative advocate—at least, for domestic issues. His impact in foreign affairs was more lasting. One of the highlights of this study is its revealing look at Harrison's visionary foreign policy, especially toward the Pacific. Socolofsky and Spetter convincingly demonstrate that although Harrison's ambition to acquire the Hawaiian Islands was not realized during his presidency, his foreign policy was a major step toward American control of Hawaii and American expansion in the Far East.",Biography & Autobiography,288,N/A,0,en

Re?ection on the e?ectiveness of proof brings out a number of questions that have always been latent in the informal understanding of the subject. What makes a symbolic constr- tion signi?cant? What makes an assumption reasonable? What makes a proof reliable? G ̈ odel, Church and Turing, in di?erent ways, achieve a deep und- standing of the notion of e?ective calculability involved in the nature of proof. Turing’s work in particular provides a “precise and unquestionably adequate” de?nition of the general notion of a formal system in terms of a machine with a ?nite number of parts. On the other hand, Eugene Wigner refers to the - reasonable e?ectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences as a miracle. Where should the boundary be traced between mathematical procedures and physical processes? What is the characteristic use of a proof as a com- tation, as opposed to its use as an experiment? What does natural science tell us about the e?ectiveness of proof? What is the role of mathematical proofs in the discovery and validation of empirical theories? The papers collected in this book are intended to search for some answers, to discuss conceptual and logical issues underlying such questions and, perhaps, to call attention to other relevant questions.",Philosophy,285,4,1,en

Onomastics in Interaction With Other Branches of Science. Volume 3. General and Applied Onomastics. Literary Onomastics. Chrematonomastics. Reports,"Urszula Bijak, Paweł Swoboda, Justyna B. Walkowiak",Wydawnictwo UJ,2023-12-08,"Onomastics is an area of scholarly interest that has grown considerably in importance in recent years. Consequently, the 27th International Congress of Onomastic Sciences, held in 2021 in Kraków, Poland, gathered scholars from all over the world, active in all subfields of onomastic enquiry, as well as those exploring the areas bordering on other disciplines of the humanities. It thus became a venue for presenting state-of-the-art research in the study of proper names, proposing novel approaches and opening new vistas for future research. The present work is the third of the three volumes of conference proceedings that are the fruit of the congress. Being the most diverse thematically, it contains contributions on the general and applied aspects of onomastics, onymy in literature and other cultural texts, and chrematonyms. It ends with two reports. The volume comprises 30 individual articles, contributed by 35 scholars. The first section, devoted to general and applied onomastics, features texts concerned with ever-interesting questions relevant to all practitioners of the discipline: the essence of properhood, the meaning of proper names, and onomastic terminology. Scholars whose papers focused on applied onomastics were interested in problems occasioned by the translation of onyms, by their pronunciation in cross-cultural contact, and by the use of exonyms, drawing for exemplification on the Hungarian, German and Czech language material respectively. Literary onomastics in its broad definition constitutes by far the largest part of the volume. Contributors to this section represent diverse literatures, including Scottish, Russian, Polish, Czech and Nigerian. The scope and internal subdivisions of literary onomastics are discussed and the activities of the Italian Society for Literary Onomastics are presented. The name Dracula is analysed in depth, and so is the Old Prussian onym Patollo. Some researchers take a step into the wider realm of culture. Their attention is attracted by the names of spirits in the beliefs adhered to in Southwest China, by the proper names in a medieval Scottish document, by the onyms that personify hunger in Italian wartime epistolography, and by toponyms in video games. The third section deals with chrematonyms as diverse as names of railway locomotives in Britain, logonyms in Slovakia and perfume names in a Slovak online shop. The naming patterns of Chinese restaurants in Czechia are studied too, as well as the names of travel agencies in Germany, Ukraine and Poland. Finally, the reader is presented with two reports. One outlines new tendencies in Nordic socio-onomastics, while the other presents the new paradigm in the publication of “Onoma”, the journal of the ICOS. The book is a must not only for onomasticians, but also for researchers in related disciplines, ranging from history, via human geography or philosophy of language, to social studies. However, professionals active in naming will find it useful as well, since it provides a much-needed supranational perspective and enables cross-cultural comparisons.",Language Arts & Disciplines,576,N/A,0,en

Travel Connections,Jennie Germann Molz,Routledge,2012-08-06,"Living in a world that is increasingly ‘on the move’ means that many of us now rely on mobile devices, social media, and networking technologies to coordinate togetherness with our social networks even when we are apart. Nowhere is this phenomenon more evident than in the emerging practices of ‘interactive travel’. Today’s travellers are more likely than ever to pack a laptop or a mobile phone and to use these devices to stay in touch with friends and family members – as well as to connect with strangers and other travellers – while they are on the road. New practices such as location-aware navigating, travel blogging, flashpacking and Couchsurfing now shape the way travellers engage with each other, with their social networks, and with the world around them. Travel Connections prompts a rethinking of the key paradigms in tourism studies in the digital age. Interactive travel calls into question longstanding tourism concepts such as landscape, the tourist gaze, hospitality, authenticity and escape. The book proposes a range of new concepts to describe the way tourists inhabit the world and engage with their social networks in the twenty-first century: smart tourism, the mediated gaze, mobile conviviality, re-enchantment and embrace. Based on intensive fieldwork with interactive travellers, Travel Connections offers a detailed account of this emerging phenomenon and uncovers the new forms of mediated and face-to-face togetherness that become possible in a mobile world. This book will be of interest to students and scholars of sociology, tourism and hospitality, new media, cosmopolitanism studies, mobility studies and cultural studies.",Social Science,218,N/A,0,en

Whistle Stop,Philip White,ForeEdge from University Press of New England,2014-11-04,"President Harry Truman was a disappointment to the Democrats, and a godsend to the Republicans. Every attempt to paint Truman with the grace, charm, and grandeur of Franklin Delano Roosevelt had been a dismal failure: Truman's virtues were simpler, plainer, more direct. The challenges he faced--stirrings of civil rights and southern resentment at home, and communist aggression and brinkmanship abroad--could not have been more critical. By the summer of 1948 the prospects of a second term for Truman looked bleak. Newspapers and popular opinion nationwide had all but anointed as president Thomas Dewey, the Republican New York Governor. Truman could not even be certain of his own party's nomination: the Democrats, still in mourning for FDR, were deeply riven, with Henry Wallace and Strom Thurmond leading breakaway Progressive and Dixiecrat factions. Finally, with ingenuity born of desperation, Truman's aides hit upon a plan: get the president in front of as many regular voters as possible, preferably in intimate settings, all across the country. To the surprise of everyone but Harry Truman, it worked. Whistle Stop is the first book of its kind: a micro-history of the summer and fall of 1948 when Truman took to the rails, crisscrossing the country from June right up to Election Day in November. The tour and the campaign culminated with the iconic image of a grinning, victorious Truman holding aloft the famous Chicago Tribune headline: ""Dewey Defeats Truman.""",History,341,N/A,0,en

Urban Rhythms and Travel Behaviour,"Dr Stefan Schönfelder, Prof Dr Kay W Axhausen","Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.",2012-11-28,"The recent availability of longitudinal data on individual trip making and activity behaviour has provided analysts with new insights into the structures and motives of daily life travel. Multi-week travel diary data-sets and GPS observations are exciting sources of information for the description and modelling of the variability of individual travel patterns. Through an analysis of these strong new data sets, this book questions what are the most suitable methodological tools to represent the structures of long-term travel behaviour. It also examines what the data tells us about the travellers' motives and looks at how planning should translate the findings into forecasting tools and transport strategies. In doing so, the multifaceted and ambiguous character of daily life travel is revealed, illustrating how, while sound routines in time and space seem to dominate daily life, individuals show a considerable amount of variability and flexibility in travel and activity behaviour.",Political Science,252,N/A,0,en

The Head Trip,Jeff Warren,Vintage Canada,2009-03-18,"A world at once familiar and unimaginably strange exists all around us, and within us – it is the vast realm of consciousness. In The Head Trip, science journalist Jeff Warren explores twelve distinct, natural states of consciousness available to us in a twenty-four-hour day, each state offering its own kind of knowledge and insight – its own adventure. The hypnagogic state, when our minds hover between waking and sleeping, can be a rich source of creativity and even compassion. Then there’s the Watch, an almost magical waking experience in the middle of the night that has been all but lost to electric light and modern sleep patterns. Daydreaming and trance, lucid dreaming, the Zone, and the Pure Conscious Event – from sleep laboratory to remote northern cabin, neurofeedback clinic to Buddhist retreat, Warren visits them all. Along the way, he talks to neuroscientists, chronobiologists, anthropologists, monks, and many others who illuminate his stories with cutting-edge science and age-old wisdom. On this trip, all are welcome and no drugs are required: all you need to pack are a functioning cerebrum and an open mind. Replete with stylish graphics and brightened by comic panels conceived and drawn by the author, The Head Trip is an instant classic, a brilliant and original description of the shifting experience of consciousness that’s also a practical guide to enhancing creativity and mental health. This book does not just inform and entertain – it shows how every one of us can expand upon the ways we experience being alive.",Psychology,402,5,1,en

Balkan Departures,"Wendy Bracewell, Alex Drace-Francis",Berghahn Books,2009,"In writings about travel, the Balkans appear most often as a place travelled to. Western accounts of the Balkans revel in the different and the exotic, the violent and the primitive − traits that serve (according to many commentators) as a foil to self-congratulatory definitions of the West as modern, progressive and rational. However, the Balkans have also long been travelled from. The region's writers have given accounts of their travels in the West and elsewhere, saying something in the process about themselves and their place in the world. The analyses presented here, ranging from those of 16th-century Greek humanists to 19th-century Romanian reformers to 20th-century writers, socialists and 'men-of-the-world', suggest that travellers from the region have also created their own identities through their encounters with Europe. Consequently, this book challenges assumptions of Western discursive hegemony, while at the same time exploring Balkan 'Occidentalisms'.",History,182,N/A,0,en

Introduction to Constraint Databases,Peter Revesz,Springer Science & Business Media,2006-04-18,"Differing from other books on the subject, this one uses the framework of constraint databases to provide a natural and powerful generalization of relational databases. An important theme running through the text is showing how relational databases can smoothly develop into constraint databases, without sacrificing any of the benefits of relational databases whilst gaining new advantages. Peter Revesz begins by discussing data models and how queries may be addressed to them. From here, he develops the theory of relational and constraint databases, including Datalog and the relational calculus, concluding with three sample constraint database systems -- DISCO, DINGO, and RATHER. Advanced undergraduates and graduates in computer science will find this a clear introduction to the subject, while professionals and researchers will appreciate this novel perspective on their subject.",Computers,406,N/A,0,en

The Millennium Development Goals, continued as Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs), are effective instruments and have, in recent years, brought many positive changes in numerous countries around the world. Most notably, it has fundamentally changed our way of approaching the tangled set of challenges: States today undertake to achieve concrete development goals; transparency and accountability to citizens and the global public has become a matter of course; and cooperation between the political, economic and societal spheres is no longer questioned. However, in addition to the global pandemic situation it has challenged the business world to develop an outstanding strategy to face extreme uncertainty. Using digital technology and its advancement is believed to be one of the main keys for taking up this challenge. The 3rd Conference in Managing Digital Industry, Technology and Entrepreneurship (the 3rd CoMDITE) has brought forward discussions on implementation of digital technology in strategic, operation, finance, marketing, human resources management, and entrepreneurship around sustainable future issues.

Primary goals of this book are to acquaint students, researchers and developers of information systems with the basic concepts and major issues of Ontological Engineering, as well as to make ontologies more understandable to those computer science engineers that integrate ontologies into their information systems. We have paid special attention to the influence that ontologies have on the Semantic Web.

Introduction to Databases,Peter Revesz,Springer Science & Business Media,2009-12-12,"Introduced forty years ago, relational databases proved unusually succe- ful and durable. However, relational database systems were not designed for modern applications and computers. As a result, specialized database systems now proliferate trying to capture various pieces of the database market. Database research is pulled into di?erent directions, and speci- ized database conferences are created. Yet the current chaos in databases is likely only temporary because every technology, including databases, becomes standardized over time. The history of databases shows periods of chaos followed by periods of dominant technologies. For example, in the early days of computing, users stored their data in text ?les in any format and organization they wanted. These early days were followed by information retrieval systems, which required some structure for text documents, such as a title, authors, and a publisher. The information retrieval systems were followed by database systems, which added even more structure to the data and made querying easier. In the late 1990s, the emergence of the Internet brought a period of relative chaos and interest in unstructured and “semistructured data” as it wasenvisionedthateverywebpagewouldbelikeapageinabook.However, with the growing maturity of the Internet, the interest in structured data was regained because the most popular websites are, in fact, based on databases. The question is not whether future data stores need structure but what structure they need.",Computers,754,N/A,0,en
Astrology Math Made Easy,Kevin B. Burk,Serendipity Press,2005,"Don't Panic! This workbook is designed to help you to overcome your fears about astrology math. If you didn't have at least some fears about learning how to calculate charts by hand, you wouldn't be reading this book. This is nothing to be ashamed of. Unless you have kids in high school, the last time you were presented with an algebra problem was probably when you were in high school. And face it: you probably hated it then, too. This will be much easier for you than it was in high school. For one thing, you're allowed (and even expected) to use a calculator here. Math is, in fact, your friend. Granted, it's the kind of friend that wakes you up in the middle of the night, raids your refrigerator and then passes out on your living room floor, but it's still your friend. And if you're serious about learning astrology, you do have to be able to do the math-or at the very least understand how the math is done. This workbook will teach you all of the astrology math you will ever need.","Body, Mind & Spirit",124,N/A,0,en

It would take a lifetime of clinical experience to encounter the whole range of the orofacial disorders and to become familiar with the varied radiographic appearances of the same condition. As there is no real substitute for personal experience, it is hoped that a collection and interpretation of radiographs will help to accelerate the learning process and will provide a reference for less common clinical conditions. It is not an easy task to interpret a good quality radiograph and so it is impossible to interpret a radiograph, which is not of good quality.

Simulation of Industrial Processes for Control Engineers,Philip J Thomas,Elsevier,1999-07-13,"Computer simulation is the key to comprehending and controlling the full-scale industrial plant used in the chemical, oil, gas and electrical power industries. Simulation of Industrial Processes for Control Engineers shows how to use the laws of physics and chemistry to produce the equations to simulate dynamically all the most important unit operations found in process and power plant.The book explains how to model chemical reactors, nuclear reactors, distillation columns, boilers, deaerators, refrigeration vessels, storage vessels for liquids and gases, liquid and gas flow through pipes and pipe networks, liquid and gas flow through installed control valves, control valve dynamics (including nonlinear effects such as static friction), oil and gas pipelines, heat exchangers, steam and gas turbines, compressors and pumps, as well as process controllers (including three methods of integral desaturation). The phenomenon of markedly different time responses (""stiffness"") is considered and various ways are presented to get around the potential problem of slow execution time. The book demonstrates how linearization may be used to give a diverse check on the correctness of the as-programmed model and explains how formal techniques of model validation may be used to produce a quantitative check on the simulation model's overall validity.The material is based on many years' experience of modelling and simulation in the chemical and power industries, supplemented in recent years by university teaching at the undergraduate and postgraduate level. Several important new results are presented. The depth is sufficient to allow real industrial problems to be solved, thus making the book attractive to engineers working in industry. But the book's step-by-step approach makes the text appropriate also for post-graduate students of control engineering and for undergraduate students in electrical, mechanical and chemical engineering who are studying process control in their second year or later.",Science,415,4,1,en

"Abstraction, Reformulation, and Approximation","Berthe Y. Choueiry, Toby Walsh",Springer,2003-06-26,"This volume contains the proceedings of SARA 2000, the fourth Symposium on Abstraction, Reformulations, and Approximation (SARA). The conference was held at Horseshoe Bay Resort and Conference Club, Lake LBJ, Texas, July 26– 29, 2000, just prior to the AAAI 2000 conference in Austin. Previous SARA conferences took place at Jackson Hole in Wyoming (1994), Ville d’Est ́erel in Qu ́ebec (1995), and Asilomar in California (1998). The symposium grewout of a series of workshops on abstraction, approximation, and reformulation that had taken place alongside AAAI since 1989. This year’s symposium was actually scheduled to take place at Lago Vista Clubs & Resort on Lake Travis but, due to the resort’s failure to pay taxes, the conference had to be moved late in the day. This mischance engendered eleventh-hour reformulations, abstractions, and resource re-allocations of its own. Such are the perils of organizing a conference. This is the ?rst SARA for which the proceedings have been published in the LNAI series of Springer-Verlag. We hope that this is a re?ection of the increased maturity of the ?eld and that the increased visibility brought by the publication of this volume will help the discipline grow even further. Abstractions, reformulations, and approximations (AR&A) have found - plications in a variety of disciplines and problems including automatic progr- ming, constraint satisfaction, design, diagnosis, machine learning, planning, qu- itative reasoning, scheduling, resource allocation, and theorem proving. The - pers in this volume capture a cross-section of these application domains.",Computers,342,N/A,0,en

There is convincing evidence that computational approaches to linguistics can benefit from research on the nature of human language, including from the perspective of its evolution. This book addresses various topics in computational theories of human language, covering grammar, syntax, and semantics. The common thread running through the research presented is the role of computer science, mathematical logic and other subjects of mathematics in computational linguistics and natural language processing (NLP).

Object-oriented Programming Featuring Graphical Applications in Java,Michael Jay Laszlo,Addison Wesley,2002,"The goal of this book is to explore the principle ideas of object-oriented programming using the Java programming language. It begins teaching the object-oriented power of Java by relying on textual commands instead of emphasizing the AWT or Swing libraries, providing the reader with a simple, generic introduction to the OO concepts using Java (without the language details getting in the way of the concept presentation). The author provides a thorough introduction to the three fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming: Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. The presentation of OO theory is augmented by interleaved examples that illustrate these concepts. Most of these program examples are 2-D graphics programs that provide an intuitive context for the issues that must be addressed when learning OOP. Additionally, since graphics programming is one of the strengths of the Java development environment, the examples produce interesting and unexpected images that engage and motivate the reader. It contains a concise introduction to using Design Patterns particularly the Template Method, Iterator, and Composite design patterns which relate to the graphics examples in the book and uses UML class diagrams to show the static structure of systems and sequence diagrams to show object interactions. This book is appropriate for readers who are new to object-oriented (but have experience with a non-object-oriented language) and for programmers who want to learn the graphical elements and capabilities of Java.",Computers,484,N/A,0,en

The essays do so in a way that appreciates the entanglement of representations and travel at a juncture in theoretical work that recognizes the limits of representation, things that lie outside of representation and the continuing power of representation. The emphasis is on the myriad ways travelers/scholars employ representation in their writing/analyses as they re-think the intersections between travelers, fields of representation, imagination, emotions and corporeal experiences in the past, the present and the future.",Social Science,249,N/A,0,en

The Poet X,Elizabeth Acevedo,HarperCollins,2018-03-06,"Winner of the National Book Award for Young People’s Literature, the Michael L. Printz Award, and the Pura Belpré Award! Fans of Jacqueline Woodson, Meg Medina, and Jason Reynolds will fall hard for this astonishing New York Times-bestselling novel-in-verse by an award-winning slam poet, about an Afro-Latina heroine who tells her story with blazing words and powerful truth. Xiomara Batista feels unheard and unable to hide in her Harlem neighborhood. Ever since her body grew into curves, she has learned to let her fists and her fierceness do the talking. But Xiomara has plenty she wants to say, and she pours all her frustration and passion onto the pages of a leather notebook, reciting the words to herself like prayers—especially after she catches feelings for a boy in her bio class named Aman, who her family can never know about. With Mami’s determination to force her daughter to obey the laws of the church, Xiomara understands that her thoughts are best kept to herself. So when she is invited to join her school’s slam poetry club, she doesn’t know how she could ever attend without her mami finding out. But she still can’t stop thinking about performing her poems. Because in the face of a world that may not want to hear her, Xiomara refuses to be silent. “Crackles with energy and snaps with authenticity and voice.” —Justina Ireland, author of Dread Nation “An incredibly potent debut.” —Jason Reynolds, author of the National Book Award Finalist Ghost “Acevedo has amplified the voices of girls en el barrio who are equal parts goddess, saint, warrior, and hero.” —Ibi Zoboi, author of American Street This young adult novel, a selection of the Schomburg Center's Black Liberation Reading List, is an excellent choice for accelerated tween readers in grades 6 to 8.

Reactor Dosimetry,"David W. Vehar, James Michael Adams",ASTM International,2008,"""The latest edition of this popular ASTM series provides an extensive overview of the latest advances in reactor dosimetry. As operating nuclear power reactors have aged and continue to operate on extended operating licenses, new pressure vessel surveillance techniques have been required. Eastern European pressurized water reactors, especially those of the VVER-440 type, continue to have greater concerns about steel embrittlement, because of higher neutron radiation exposures than most Western European and US reactors. Accordingly, broader dosimetry studies are being made on the VVER reactors through retrospective dosimetry, ex-vessel dosimetry, and careful re-analysis of previously reported data.""--Publisher's website.",Science,536,N/A,0,en

Travel and Travail,"Patricia Akhimie, Bernadette Andrea",University of Nebraska Press,2019-01-01,"Popular English travel guides from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries asserted that women who wandered too far afield were invariably suspicious, dishonest, and unchaste. As the essays in Travel and Travail reveal, however, early modern women did travel, often quite extensively, with no diminution of their moral fiber. Female travelers were also frequently represented on the English stage and in other creative works, both as a reproach to the ban on female travel and as a reflection of historical women’s travel, whether intentional or not. Travel and Travail conclusively refutes the notion of female travel in the early modern era as “an absent presence.” The first part of the volume offers analyses of female travelers (often recently widowed or accompanied by their husbands), the practicalities of female travel, and how women were thought to experience foreign places. The second part turns to literature, including discussions of roving women in Shakespeare, Margaret Cavendish, and Thomas Heywood. Whether historical actors or fictional characters, women figured in the wider world of the global Renaissance, not simply in the hearth and home.",History,384,N/A,0,en
Travel and Transformation,"Dr Emma Waterton, Dr Garth Lean, Dr Russell Staiff","Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.",2014-08-28,"Travel and tourism have a long association with the notion of transformation, both in terms of self and social collectives. What is surprising, however, is that this association has, on the whole, remained relatively underexplored and unchallenged, with little in the way of a corpus of academic literature surrounding these themes. Instead, much of the literature to date has focused upon describing and categorising tourism and travel experiences from a supply-side perspective, with travellers themselves defined in terms of their motivations and interests. While the tourism field can lay claim to several significant milestone contributions, there have been few recent attempts at a rigorous re-theorization of the issues arising from the travel/transformation nexus. The opportunity to explore the socio-cultural dimensions of transformation through travel has thus far been missed. Bringing together geographers, sociologists, cultural researchers, philosophers, anthropologists, visual researchers, literary scholars and heritage researchers, this volume explores what it means to transform through travel in a modern, mobile world. In doing so, it draws upon a wide variety of traveller perspectives - including tourists, backpackers, lifestyle travellers, migrants, refugees, nomads, walkers, writers, poets, virtual travellers and cosmetic surgery patients - to unpack a cultural phenomenon that has captured the imagination since the very first works of Western literature.",Business & Economics,253,N/A,0,en

The impact on tourism destinations and businesses, as well as on traveler behavior, will be significant. Recent events require further analysis not only of how travel safety may be improved but also how security issues may be seen in terms of tourism marketing and management so that the industry is able to better respond to such challenges.In this, an era of turbulent global relationships, the need for destination marketing organizations to demonstrate that they are safe for tourists has become increasingly important.

International Handbook on Transport and Development,"R. Hickman, D. Bonilla, M. Givoni, D. Banister",Edward Elgar Publishing,2015-08-28,"In the last forty years or so the research field exploring the relationship and interaction between transport and development has developed rapidly. While sophistication in analysis has increased, understanding the effective integration of transport and development often remains poor in theory and in practice - with sometimes devastating effects. This Handbookprovides a comprehensive analysis of both the current and emerging thinking in this field, drawing on multidisciplinary thinking in transport planning, transport, urban and spatial economics, and the wider social sciences. With 45 chapters from leading international authors, the book is organised around three main themes: - urban structure and travel - transport and spatial impacts - wider dimensions in transport and development. The chapters each present commentary on key issues within these themes, presenting the debate on the impacts of urban structure on travel, the impacts of transport investment on development, and social and cultural change on travel. A multitude of competing inter-disciplinary perspectives are considered - leaving the reader with an invaluably comprehensive and critical understanding of the field. This major Handbookwill serve as a guide for undergraduates and graduate students, researchers, consultants, and also practitioners and policy makers, wishing to find a comprehensive and original reference to research on transport and development.

Little is known about the marketing efforts and practices, along with the successes and challenges, countries in the East and Southeast Asia have been experiencing. This book aims to address this oversight by exploring the marketing approaches, techniques and tools used by various countries in the region both collectively and individually to manage their tourism offerings and position them in the global tourism market: China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Macau, Mongolia, Myanmar, Vietnam.

Technological Innovation and International Competitiveness for Business Growth,"João J. M. Ferreira, Sérgio J. Teixeira, Hussain G. Rammal",Springer Nature,2020-10-22,"This book explores how companies combine technological innovation and competitive actions that create new opportunities for business growth in the international market. The complexity of designing today’s technology platforms requires profound knowledge in multiple areas. Technology development and commercialization as an ongoing competitive process involves enabling and inhibiting mechanisms, which govern the speed and acceleration of technological innovation. To compete more effectively, potential competitors are using coopetition and pooling their resources for shared gain in areas where they do not compete directly. Thus, a thorough examination of the current paradigms, theories, and frameworks is needed to increase our understanding of the technology-innovation-competitiveness linkages of business growth. This book brings together recent developments and methodological contributions within technological innovation, international competitiveness, and business growth that bridge the existing gaps and simultaneously advances the debate on this research topic.",Business & Economics,433,N/A,0,en

The Routledge Handbook of Tourism Marketing,Scott McCabe,Routledge,2014-01-03,"Tourism has often been described as being about ‘selling dreams’, tourist experiences being conceptualized as purely a marketing confection, a socially constructed need. However, the reality is that travel for leisure, business, meetings, sports or visiting loved ones has grown to be a very real sector of the global economy, requiring sophisticated business and marketing practices. The Routledge Handbook of Tourism Marketing explores and critically evaluates the current debates and controversies inherent to the theoretical, methodological and practical processes of marketing within this complex and multi-sector industry. It brings together leading specialists from range of disciplinary backgrounds and geographical regions to provide reflection and empirical research on this complex relationship. The Handbook is divided in to nine inter-related sections: Part 1 deals with shifts in the context of marketing practice and our understanding of what constitutes value for tourists; Part 2 explores macromarketing and tourism; Part 3 deals with strategic issues; Part 4 addresses recent advances in research; Part 5 focuses on developments in tourist consumer behaviour; Part 6 looks at micromarketing; Part 7 moves on to destination marketing and branding issues; Part 8 looks at the influence of technological change on tourism marketing; and Part 9 explores future directions. This timely book offers the reader a comprehensive synthesis of this sub-discipline, conveying the latest thinking and research. It will provide an invaluable resource for all those with an interest in tourism and marketing, encouraging dialogue across disciplinary boundaries and areas of study. This is essential reading for Tourism students, researchers and academics as well as those of Marketing, Business, Events Management and Hospitality Management.",Business & Economics,523,4,1,en

The higher levels of consumption, employment, and cost reduction generated by the implementation of digital technologies motivates entrepreneurs to expand their activity and promotes the emergence of new entrepreneurs. Positive outcomes can be generated by the implementation of innovation leaders to higher competition and new markets, incentivizing entrepreneurs to introduce new innovations to react to these higher levels of competition, which are accompanied by their corresponding value creation. Analyzing the Relationship Between Innovation, Value Creation, and Entrepreneurship is a pivotal reference source that analyzes the theoretical and empirical aspects of innovation as a factor that enhances value creation and the role of entrepreneurship. While highlighting topics such as data management, social enterprise, and digital marketing, this publication explores enhanced economic growth and the methods of higher levels of consumption in society.

Culture and Cultures in Tourism,"Andres Artal-Tur, Metin Kozak",Routledge,2020-06-29,"According to the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), international tourists engaging in cultural activities accounted for more than 500 million of international tourist numbers in 2017. City tourism relies on culture as a major product, providing benefits not only for interested visitors, but also for the local resident population. New trends in tourism include ""experiential tourism"", where the interactions between tourists and residents become a key part of the tourism experience and overall customer satisfaction. New technologies and IT applications allow tourists to design their own trip, given the presence of global companies like Trip Advisor, Booking.com and AirBnB. This comprehensive volume explores new trends in cultural tourism, demonstrating how and why culture has become a central factor in tourism. The authors analyse a wide range of relevant issues, including: how heritage-based and cultural tourism could contribute to the sustainability of destinations; the increase of religious travels to and within Arab countries; and how cultural tourism fosters understanding among people and cultures, and could even potentially help to consolidate peace at a regional level. The book also analyses interactions between hosts (the local residents) and guests (the cultural visitors), revisiting the pioneer hippy travelling experiences in Turkey of the 1960s and how they shaped youth culture. This book will be of great interest to students and researchers of cultural tourism. The chapters were originally published in the journal Anatolia.",Business & Economics,283,N/A,0,en

The Collected Essays of Richard E. Quandt,Richard E. Quandt,Edward Elgar Publishing,1992-01-01,"Professor Richard Quandt has made a major contribution to the development of economics in the 20th century. The range and significance of his work has long required a collection of his essays which will allow his contribution to be assessed as a whole. Despite an early interest in microeconomic theory, Richard Quandt has devoted most of his career to econometrics and, in particular, modal split estimation. More recently his work has focused on the econometrics of disequilibrium models with reference to both free market and planned economies. As well as outlining his many articles in microtheory, general econometrics, disequilibrium modeling, financial economics and the economics of planned economies, this collection should have a particular value for all scholars interested in the emergence of the new economies in Eastern Europe, a subject to which Professor Quandt has applied himself in recent years. This book includes an introduction by Professor Quandt describing his early life in Budapest and the circumstances which led him to study economics in America.",Business & Economics,876,N/A,0,en

"Case Based Research in Tourism, Travel, Hospitality and Events","Marianna Sigala, Anastasia Yeark, Rajka Presbury, Marcela Fang, Karen A. Smith",Springer Nature,2022-01-05,"This book consolidates international, contemporary and topical case study based research in tourism, travel, hospitality and events. Case studies can make learning more attractive and interesting as well as enable students to understand the theory better and develop their analytical and problem-solving skills. Using industry as an open living lab, case study based research infuses scholars into real-world industry challenges and inspires them to theorise and advance our knowledge frontiers. The book includes international case studies that can help tourism scholars build and advance (new) theories and enrich their educational practices. Case studies are accompanied with a teaching note guiding scholars to integrate case studies into instruction. Dr Kirsten Holmes, Chair, Council for Australasian Tourism and Hospitality Education (CAUTHE) There is a vital need for contemporary and well-structured case studies for use in tourism teaching. By including case studies from Australasia and key destination regions in Asia, Europe, and the Caribbean, the book is helpful for tertiary teachers globally. Professor Xander Lub, President, EuroCHRIE The book inspires educators and students. The cases provide context to students’ learning and demonstrate the richness and variation of the industry. The book also clearly demonstrates how research can inform our teaching. Professor Brian King, Chair, THE-ICE Assessment Panel The book includes cases under five themes: experiences, operations, technologies, strategy and marketing, and destinations. The book provides subject lecturers with a structure to guide students of applying theory into practice. Dr Paul Whitelaw, Academic Director, Southern Cross University This book marks a significant contribution to hospitality, tourism and events pedagogy at undergraduate and postgraduate level. At a time when the industry is demanding that our graduates have a strong grasp of “real world issues”, the case study approach provides an accessible, meaningful and relatable means by which students can engage in real world issues.",Business & Economics,503,N/A,0,en

The Travel Diaries of Albert Einstein,Albert Einstein,Princeton University Press,2018-05-29,"The first publication of Albert Einstein’s travel diary to the Far East and Middle East In the fall of 1922, Albert Einstein, along with his then-wife, Elsa Einstein, embarked on a five-and-a-half-month voyage to the Far East and Middle East, regions that the renowned physicist had never visited before. Einstein's lengthy itinerary consisted of stops in Hong Kong and Singapore, two brief stays in China, a six-week whirlwind lecture tour of Japan, a twelve-day tour of Palestine, and a three-week visit to Spain. This handsome edition makes available, for the first time, the complete journal that Einstein kept on this momentous journey. The telegraphic-style diary entries--quirky, succinct, and at times irreverent—record Einstein's musings on science, philosophy, art, and politics, as well as his immediate impressions and broader thoughts on such events as his inaugural lecture at the future site of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, a garden party hosted by the Japanese Empress, an audience with the King of Spain, and meetings with other prominent colleagues and statesmen. Entries also contain passages that reveal Einstein's stereotyping of members of various nations and raise questions about his attitudes on race. This beautiful edition features stunning facsimiles of the diary's pages, accompanied by an English translation, an extensive historical introduction, numerous illustrations, and annotations. Supplementary materials include letters, postcards, speeches, and articles, a map of the voyage, a chronology, a bibliography, and an index. Einstein would go on to keep a journal for all succeeding trips abroad, and this first volume of his travel diaries offers an initial, intimate glimpse into a brilliant mind encountering the great, wide world.",Science,378,N/A,0,en

""[Grann is] one of the preeminent adventure and true-crime writers working today.""—New York Magazine After stumbling upon a hidden trove of diaries, acclaimed writer David Grann set out to determine what happened to the British explorer Percy Fawcett and his quest for the Lost City of Z. For centuries Europeans believed the Amazon, the world’s largest rain forest, concealed the glittering kingdom of El Dorado. Thousands had died looking for it, leaving many scientists convinced that the Amazon was truly inimical to humankind. In 1925 Fawcett ventured into the Amazon to find an ancient civilization, hoping to make one of the most important discoveries in history. Then he vanished. Over the years countless perished trying to find evidence of his party and the place he called “The Lost City of Z.” In this masterpiece, journalist David Grann interweaves the spellbinding stories of Fawcett’s quest for “Z” and his own journey into the deadly jungle.

Atrium II, Cincinnati, OH 45202 Artificial intelligence (AI) programs represent knowledge in a fashion similar to human knowledge and the activities of an AI system are closer to human behavior than that of traditional systems. Thus, AI enables the computer to act more like a human instead of making the human think and act more like a computer. This capability combined with applying human factors concepts to the interface can greatly improve the human-computer interface. This paper provides an intro duction to artificial intelligence and then proposes a number of methods for using AI to improve the human-machine inter action. AN INTRODUCTION TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE Definition There are many definitions of artificial intelligence (AI) running from the very general to the very detailed. Perhaps the most well accepted general definition is that by Elaine Rich: ""Artificial intelligence is the study of how to make computers do things at which, at the moment, people are better"", (Rich, 1983). A good example of a detailed definition is provided by the Brattle Research Corporation; ""In simplified terms, artificial intelligence works with pattern matching methods which attempt to describe objects, events or pro cesses in terms of their qualitative features and logical and compu tational relationships,"" (Mishkoff, 1985).",Psychology,312,N/A,0,en

All They Will Call You,Tim Z. Hernandez,University of Arizona Press,2017-01-28,"All They Will Call You is the harrowing account of “the worst airplane disaster in California’s history,” which claimed the lives of thirty-two passengers, including twenty-eight Mexican citizens—farmworkers who were being deported by the U.S. government. Outraged that media reports omitted only the names of the Mexican passengers, American folk icon Woody Guthrie penned a poem that went on to become one of the most important protest songs of the twentieth century, “Plane Wreck at Los Gatos (Deportee).” It was an attempt to restore the dignity of the anonymous lives whose unidentified remains were buried in an unmarked mass grave in California’s Central Valley. For nearly seven decades, the song’s message would be carried on by the greatest artists of our time, including Pete Seeger, Dolly Parton, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, and Joan Baez, yet the question posed in Guthrie’s lyrics, “Who are these friends all scattered like dry leaves?” would remain unanswered—until now. Combining years of painstaking investigative research and masterful storytelling, award-winning author Tim Z. Hernandez weaves a captivating narrative from testimony, historical records, and eyewitness accounts, reconstructing the incident and the lives behind the legendary song. This singularly original account pushes narrative boundaries, while challenging perceptions of what it means to be an immigrant in America, but more importantly, it renders intimate portraits of the individual souls who, despite social status, race, or nationality, shared a common fate one frigid morning in January 1948.",Biography & Autobiography,241,N/A,0,en

For Gideon Lewis-Kraus, it promises a different kind of escape. Determined to avoid the fear and self-sacrifice that kept his father, a gay rabbi, closeted until midlife, he has moved to anything-goes Berlin. But the surfeit of freedom there has begun to paralyze him, and when a friend extends a drunken invitation to join him on an ancient pilgrimage route across Spain, Lewis-Kraus packs his bag, grateful for the chance to wake each morning with a sense of direction. Irreverent, moving, hilarious, and thought-provoking, A Sense of Direction is Lewis-Kraus’s dazzling riff on the perpetual war between discipline and desire, and its attendant casualties. Across three pilgrimages and many hundreds of miles, he completes an idiosyncratic odyssey to the heart of a family mystery and a human dilemma: How do we come to terms with what has been and what is—and find a way forward, with purpose?",Biography & Autobiography,386,N/A,0,en

For years he explored the Amazon and came to believe that its jungle concealed a large, complex civilization, like El Dorado. Obsessed with its discovery, he christened it the City of Z. In 1925, Fawcett headed into the wilderness with his son Jack, vowing to make history. They vanished without a trace. For the next eighty years, hordes of explorers plunged into the jungle, trying to find evidence of Fawcett's party or Z. Some died from disease and starvation; others simply disappeared. In this spellbinding true tale of lethal obsession, David Grann retraces the footsteps of Fawcett and his followers as he unravels one of the greatest mysteries of exploration. ‘A wonderful story of a lost age of heroic exploration’ Sunday Times ‘Marvellous ...

Before meeting Josh, Jaquy spent her life struggling with sickness due to Celiac Disease and severe food allergies, never feeling confident to travel to foreign countries where she didn't speak the language. Over time that shifted with experience and support which inspired them to travel the world together. After a few years of domestic travel, lecturing at allergy free expos and learning how to turn the burden of food allergies into a blessing, Josh and Jaquy planned a month trip to adventure through Vietnam with the intention of creating content that would teach others with food allergies how to safely navigate Asia. With only a week away from their trip Jaquy got terribly sick. Knowing that the problem wasn't food related, Jaquy was thrown into a wave of panic and they nearly had to cancel their plans. After discovering that it was an adverse hormonal reaction to having her IUD taken out, they planned and packed accordingly. With suitcases packed to the brim with protein powders, vitamins, and chia seeds, they took the leap. Their trip was filled with delicious and life-changing adventure at times and plagued by non-food related sickness at others, but the journey and mission were preserved and the memories and tips are stored in this book. Discover how they managed to travel around Vietnam, eating incredibly delicious meals, cooking in hostels and sharing food with locals, all the while never having one food allergy related issue.

Indeed, of the nearly 2,000 travelers whom I have interviewed over nearly five decades, I've collected and chronicled the phenomenal, the good, the wonderful, and the fascinating of all sorts of aspects of hotels and lodging of travelers' stays. I've recorded as well for posterity their best stories in the form of ebooks, paperbacks, and audiobooks, just about anything and everything noteworthy that defines what the hotel and lodging aspects of their travel experience are all about. And along with these stories I've chronicled as well some of the not-so-good and not-so-wonderful sorts of risks and dangers of travel that travelers sometimes face with regard to their hotels and lodging. You might say I've studied and analyzed as best as I could the essence of travel safety and security while traveling abroad to countries around the world. The books in my True Travel Tales series include travel stories of just about anything and everything to do with lodging -- all the sorts of situations that travelers may face in their adventures about their stays in hotels and lodges. Many stories are about the good and wondrous aspects of travel. And sometimes stories may even include the fascinating as well as sometimes the paranormal and psychic aspects of travel, too, and, yes, even the occasional strange and the bizarre. In all, this is a book on the psychology of travel with a focus on hotels and lodging in travel.

Using extensive passages from Jay-Z’s lyrics, 'Made in America' examines the rapper’s role as a poet, an aesthete, an advocate for racial justice and a business, man, but devotes much of its energy to Hova the Hustler."" —Allison Stewart, The Washington Post ""Dyson's incisive analysis of JAY-Z's brilliance not only offers a brief history of hip-hop's critical place in American culture, but also hints at how we can best move forward."" —Questlove JAY-Z: Made in America is the fruit of Michael Eric Dyson’s decade of teaching the work of one of the greatest poets this nation has produced, as gifted a wordsmith as Walt Whitman, Robert Frost and Rita Dove. But as a rapper, he’s sometimes not given the credit he deserves for just how great an artist he’s been for so long. This book wrestles with the biggest themes of JAY-Z's career, including hustling, and it recognizes the way that he’s always weaved politics into his music, making important statements about race, criminal justice, black wealth and social injustice. As he enters his fifties, and to mark his thirty years as a recording artist, this is the perfect time to take a look at JAY-Z’s career and his role in making this nation what it is today. In many ways, this is JAY-Z’s America as much as it’s Pelosi’s America, or Trump’s America, or Martin Luther King’s America.

Like the wails made by a hand trembling over the theremin, SOLAR TRAUMA's musical forms and anxieties slide and swerve. Unflinchingly fretful and frequently hilarious, these poems enumerate the radial, radical horrors the body can endure and inflict: ""and when I cease // . . . // I become the body / from which I believe I already act // and split and split again / a dehiscence a thing a skin // essentially a constellation of threats."" This body of concern has no limit: think The Thing meets critical theory meets parenting meets polar devastation meets the internet; think of how to let anything go: ""how can we get rid of this thing can we just throw it away what happens to it when // we do.""",American poetry,0,5,1,en

I wish I could tell everyone who thinks we're ruined, Look closer...and you'll see something extraordinary, mystifying, something real and true. We have never been what we seemed. When beautiful, reckless Southern belle Zelda Sayre meets F. Scott Fitzgerald at a country club dance in 1918, she is seventeen years old and he is a young army lieutenant stationed in Alabama. Before long, the ""ungettable"" Zelda has fallen for him despite his unsuitability: Scott isn't wealthy or prominent or even a Southerner, and keeps insisting, absurdly, that his writing will bring him both fortune and fame. Her father is deeply unimpressed. But after Scott sells his first novel, This Side of Paradise, to Scribner's, Zelda optimistically boards a train north, to marry him in the vestry of St. Patrick's Cathedral and take the rest as it comes. What comes, here at the dawn of the Jazz Age, is unimagined attention and success and celebrity that will make Scott and Zelda legends in their own time. Everyone wants to meet the dashing young author of the scandalous novel—and his witty, perhaps even more scandalous wife. Zelda bobs her hair, adopts daring new fashions, and revels in this wild new world. Each place they go becomes a playground: New York City, Long Island, Hollywood, Paris, and the French Riviera—where they join the endless party of the glamorous, sometimes doomed Lost Generation that includes Ernest Hemingway, Sara and Gerald Murphy, and Gertrude Stein. Everything seems new and possible. Troubles, at first, seem to fade like morning mist. But not even Jay Gatsby's parties go on forever. Who is Zelda, other than the wife of a famous—sometimes infamous—husband? How can she forge her own identity while fighting her demons and Scott's, too?",Fiction,391,5,2,en

For here comes essayist Helen Andrews.""--Terry Castle With two recessions and a botched pandemic under their belt, the Boomers are their children's favorite punching bag. But is the hatred justified? Is the destruction left in their wake their fault or simply the luck of the generational draw? In Boomers, essayist Helen Andrews addresses the Boomer legacy with scrupulous fairness and biting wit. Following the model of Lytton Strachey's Eminent Victorians, she profiles six of the Boomers' brightest and best. She shows how Steve Jobs tried to liberate everyone's inner rebel but unleashed our stultifying digital world of social media and the gig economy. How Aaron Sorkin played pied piper to a generation of idealistic wonks. How Camille Paglia corrupted academia while trying to save it. How Jeffrey Sachs, Al Sharpton, and Sonya Sotomayor wanted to empower the oppressed but ended up empowering new oppressors. Ranging far beyond the usual Beatles and Bill Clinton clichés, Andrews shows how these six Boomers' effect on the world has been tragically and often ironically contrary to their intentions. She reveals the essence of Boomerness: they tried to liberate us, and instead of freedom they left behind chaos.",Political Science,258,N/A,0,en

How did a question about chicken wings turn into a bra fight (no, not a bar fight or a bra fight)? How did a roll of toilet paper lead to tears, resentment, and a stint in the guest bedroom? With their trademark sense of humor and complete vulnerability, Penn and Kim share their 10 most common Fight Fails and how to combat them. Throughout the book, they offer scripts for how to start, continue, and successfully close hard conversations. Couples will emerge equipped to engage and understand, not do battle—and maybe laugh a little more along the way. In Everybody Fights, couples will learn how to: Use ""magic words"" for healthy conflict resolution Address unspoken and unrealistic expectations Banish the three Ds of unhealthy communication—distraction, denial, and delay Carry individual baggage while helping your partner deal with theirs Penn and Kim want you to know you're not alone. Everybody fights. Marriage is messy. Marriage is work. But marriage is worth it. Fight for it!",Family & Relationships,251,5,1,en

Touring China,Yajun Mo,Cornell University Press,2021-12-15,"In Touring China, Yajun Mo explores how early twentieth century Chinese sightseers described the destinations that they visited, and how their travel accounts gave Chinese readers a means to imagine their vast country. The roots of China's tourism market stretch back over a hundred years, when railroad and steamship networks expanded into the coastal regions. Tourism-related businesses and publications flourished in urban centers while scientific exploration, investigative journalism, and wartime travel propelled many Chinese from the eastern seaboard to its peripheries. Mo considers not only accounts of overseas travel and voyages across borderlands, but also trips within China. On the one hand, via travel and travel writing, the unity of China's coastal regions, inland provinces, and western frontiers was experienced and reinforced. On the other, travel literature revealed a persistent tension between the aspiration for national unity and the anxiety that China might fall apart. Touring China tells a fascinating story about the physical and intellectual routes people took on various journeys, against the backdrop of the transition from Chinese empire to nation-state.",History,282,N/A,0,en

The Mezzanine,Nicholson Baker,Open Road + Grove/Atlantic,2010-07-13,"A National Book Critics Circle Award–winner elevates the ordinary events that occur to a man on his lunch hour into “a constant delight” of a novel (The Boston Globe). In this startling, witty, and inexhaustibly inventive novel, New York Times–bestselling author Nicholson Baker uses a one-story escalator ride as the occasion for a dazzling reappraisal of everyday objects and rituals. From the humble milk carton to the act of tying one’s shoes, The Mezzanine at once defamiliarizes the familiar world and endows it with loopy and euphoric poetry. Baker’s accounts of the ordinary become extraordinary through his sharp storytelling and his unconventional, conversational style. At first glance, The Mezzanine appears to be a book about nothing. In reality, it is a brilliant celebration of things, simultaneously demonstrating the value of reflection and the importance of everyday human experiences. “A very funny book . . . Its 135 pages probably contain more insight into life as we live it today than anything currently on the best-seller list.” —The New York Times “Captures the spirit of American corporate life and invests it with a passion and sympathy that is entirely unexpected.” —The Seattle Times “Among the year’s best.” —The Boston Globe “Baker writes with appealing charm . . . [He] clowns and shows off . . . rambles and pounces hard; he says acute things, extravagant things, terribly funny things.” —Los Angeles Times Book Review “Wonderfully readable, in fact gripping, with surprising bursts of recognition, humor and wonder.” —The Washington Post Book World",Fiction,190,N/A,0,en
Street Sounds,Ziad Fahmy,Stanford University Press,2020-08-25,"As the twentieth century roared on, transformative technologies—from trains, trams, and automobiles to radios and loudspeakers—fundamentally changed the sounds of the Egyptian streets. The cacophony of everyday life grew louder, and the Egyptian press featured editorials calling for the regulation of not only mechanized and amplified sounds, but also the voices of street vendors, the music of wedding processions, and even the traditional funerary wails. Ziad Fahmy offers the first historical examination of the changing soundscapes of urban Egypt, highlighting the mundane sounds of street life, while ""listening"" to the voices of ordinary people as they struggle with state authorities for ownership of the streets. Interweaving infrastructural, cultural, and social history, Fahmy analyzes the sounds of modernity, using sounded sources as an analytical tool for examining the past. Street Sounds also reveals a political dimension of noise by demonstrating how the growing middle classes used sound to distinguish themselves from the Egyptian masses. This book contextualizes sound, layering historical analysis with a sensory dimension, bringing us closer to the Egyptian streets as lived and embodied by everyday people.",History,395,N/A,0,en

Non-Representational Methodologies,Phillip Vannini,Routledge,2015-02-11,"Non-representational theory is one of the contemporary moment’s most influential theoretical perspectives within social and cultural theory. It is now widely considered to be the logical successor of postmodern theory, the logical development of post-structuralist thought, and the most notable intellectual force behind the turn across the social and cultural sciences away from cognition, meaning, and textuality. And yet, it is often poorly understood. This is in part because of its complexity, but also because of its limited treatment in the few volumes chiefly dedicated to it. Theories must be useful to researchers keen on utilizing concepts and analytical frames for their personal interpretive purposes. How useful non-representational theory is, in this sense, is yet to be understood. This book outlines a variety of ways in which non-representational ideas can influence the research process, the very value of empirical research, the nature of data, the political value of data and evidence, the methods of research, the very notion of method, and the styles, genres, and media of research.",Social Science,205,N/A,0,en

From the myth of Laodamia in Ancient Greece to twenty-first century TV shows such as Westworld, robots in human form have captured our imagination, our hopes and our fears.
