"SELF HELP: THE SECRET OF SELF CONFIDENCE, THE ULTIMATE TO BUILDING SELF CONFIDENCE AND ABUNDANT MIND",Rufus Ordor,BookRix,2022-11-24,"HOW TO GET SELF-CONFIDENCE is the central issue when tackling about the development of self-confidence in an individual who, for long, have believed that his self-worth is deficient. It goes without saying that those confident individuals can bear themselves better than those who have lower sense of the ""self"". They are the achievers, the people of the limelight, the center of society. They walk straight, speak their meanings very well and influence people, both subtly and obviously. In short, they are those who care recognizable even from afar. Sometimes, self-confident people are very much loved by society. It is perhaps due to their charisma or they are, by nature very amiable. However, there are those self-confident individuals who, just by leaving makes the room lighter. These are two very dissimilar displays of self-confidence. One, destroys a person's credibility and the other intensifies his personality. And obviously, you would not want the consequences of being too confident of yourself that the people no longer see you as effective, instead they see you as annoyance to their daily affairs. Self-confidence comes from within. Outside stimulation may help but it would all still boil down to knowing yourself and using that knowl- edge to gain confidence. To get self-confidence, you must realize that your limitations must not limit you and your attributes must not destroy you. Instead, use all these factors to develop a personality that would be productive for you and all those that surround you.",Young Adult Fiction,42,N/A,0,en

The Self-Help Myth,Erica Kohl-Arenas,Univ of California Press,2015-12-01,"""The Self-Help Myth reveals how philanthropy maintains systems of inequality by attracting attention to the behaviors and responsibilities of poor people while shifting the focus away from structural inequities and relationships of power that produce poverty. The book features foundation investments in addressing migrant poverty in California's Central Valley, simultaneously one of the wealthiest agricultural production regions in the world and home to the poorest people in the United States. The case studies show how compromises between foundation staff and community organizers produce programs that ask farmworkers to help themselves while excluding strategies that address the role of industrial agriculture in creating and maintaining regional poverty. Through archival and ethnographic case studies of foundation investments leading up to the historic Farm Worker Movement, to large scale foundation-driven initiatives to improve conditions in agricultural communities during the 1990s and 2000s, foundations set firm boundaries around definitions of self-help - excluding labor organizing, immigrant rights, and advocacy approaches that hold industry accountable for the enduring abuses of farmworkers and immigrants. Processes of professionalization and institutionalization required to maintain philanthropic relationships further frustrate nonprofit organizational staff increasingly accountable to foundations and not to the people they aim to represent and serve.""--Provided by publisher.",Social Science,272,N/A,0,en

Looking through the Speculum,Judith A. Houck,University of Chicago Press,2024-01-19,"Highlights local history to tell a national story about the evolution of the women’s health movement, illuminating the struggles and successes of bringing feminist dreams into clinical spaces. The women’s health movement in the United States, beginning in 1969 and taking hold in the 1970s, was a broad-based movement seeking to increase women’s bodily knowledge, reproductive control, and well-being. It was a political movement that insisted that bodily autonomy provided the key to women’s liberation. It was also an institution-building movement that sought to transform women’s relationships with medicine; it was dedicated to increasing women’s access to affordable health care without the barriers of homophobia, racism, and sexism. But the movement did not only focus on women’s bodies. It also encouraged activists to reimagine their relationships with one another, to develop their relationships in the name of personal and political change, and, eventually, to discover and confront the limitations of the bonds of womanhood. This book examines historically the emergence, development, travails, and triumphs of the women’s health movement in the United States. By bringing medical history and the history of women’s bodies into our emerging understandings of second-wave feminism, the author sheds light on the understudied efforts to shape health care and reproductive control beyond the hospital and the doctor’s office—in the home, the women’s center, the church basement, the bookshop, and the clinic. Lesbians, straight women, and women of color all play crucial roles in this history. At its center are the politics, institutions, and relationships created by and within the women’s health movement, depicted primarily from the perspective of the activists who shaped its priorities, fought its battles, and grappled with its shortcomings.",Medical,385,N/A,0,en

Interrogating Gendered Pathologies,"Erin Clark, Michelle F. Eble",University Press of Colorado,2020-09-01,"Interrogating Gendered Pathologies points out and critiques unjust patterns of pathology. Erin A. Frost and Michelle F. Eble assemble a transdisciplinary approach from/to technologies, rhetorics, philosophies, epistemologies, and biomedical data to consider the effects of biomedicine’s gendered norms on people’s lives. Using a range of complementary and intersectional theoretical approaches, contributors ask questions about rhetoric’s role in healthcare and how it differs depending on patient embodiment and the ways nonnormative bodies are pathologized. These chapters engage common narratives about the ways in which gender in healthcare is secondary and highlights the stories of people who have battled to prioritize their own bodies through extraordinary difficulties. Employing a multiplicity of voices, the book represents a number of different perspectives on what it might look like to return health and medical data to embodied experience, to consider the effects of gendered and intersectional biomedical norms on lived realities, and to subvert the power of institutions in ways that move us toward biomedical justice. This collection contributes to the burgeoning field of health and medical rhetorics by rhetorically and theoretically intervening in what are often seen as objective and neutral decisions related to the body and to scientific and medical data about bodies. Interrogating Gendered Pathologies will be of interest to feminist scholars in the field of rhetoric and writing studies, specifically those in the rhetorics of health and medicine, as well as scholars of technical communication, feminist studies, gender studies, technoscience studies, and bioethics.

Learning from Resilient People,Morley D. Glicken,SAGE Publications,2006-05-03,"This comprehensive core textbook analyzes how resilient people navigate the troubled waters of life’s traumas and identifies how learning about resilience may help cultivate this quality in other, less resilient, people. Author Morley D. Glicken explains the inner self-healing processes of resilient people and helps individuals training in the helping professions to learn to use these processes in working with their clients. Key Features: Presents Current Research on Resilience: The most current data is provided on a variety of common physical, social, and emotional problems experienced by people and the way in which resilient people cope with those problems. In addition, an entire chapter summarizes what we know about resilience and how it can be applied to clinical practice. Provides Engaging Case Examples: Wonderful and honestly written stories from resilient people about how they cope so well with their traumas illustrate how therapy using resilience can work. From this perspective, therapy draws from strength rather than deficit or psychopathology. There is also a chapter on resilient communities, not often discussed in literature, which supports the idea that communities can help people increase their resilience. Examines Resilience Across the Life Cycle: The meaning and definitions of resilience is discussed as well as how it functions throughout the life cycle and through multiple life events. This book also clarifies the erroneous notion that resilient people are endlessly resilient and helps recognize resilience as an actual and real attribute, and not one that makes people seem super human. Intended Audience: This is an ideal textbook for undergraduate and graduate courses in Psychology, Counseling, Social Work, Psychiatric Nursing, Marriage and Family Counseling, and Criminal Justice that teach direct practice techniques, approaches, and theories. It is also a valuable resource for practitioners, administrators, teachers, mental health workers, and family service agencies.?",Social Science,536,N/A,0,en
Today’s Priorities in Mental Health,"S.H. Fine, R. Knell, T.Y. Lin",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Two themes seem to emerge repeatedly when reading through this volume. One is 'consensus' and the other is 'search'. There was a strong consensus during the Congress that children and families were the major and foremost concern of all present, regardless of their geographic origin or professional background. This concern was often expressed in terms of commitment to or as goal for the international mental health movement for the years to come. The second theme, 'search', represents an effort to translate this concern into activities: search for concrete, immediate goals, for ways and means of translating into actual programs and projects, for interested people to carry on the work and better ways to train them to do the work well, for ways to obtain support, and lastly, search for ways of coordinating efforts of people in different parts of the world. All these and other matters are taken up in the discussions in this volume. The complexity of problems encountered in a rapidly changing world and the diversity of resources available in different parts of the world, make the task of searching difficult and sometimes confusing. In spite of the earnest efforts made, the results may be inconclusive and some of those pro posed can be regarded only as hypotheses or ideas for experimentation.",Medical,226,N/A,0,en

Recovery the Native Way,Dr. Alf H. Walle,IAP,2008-11-01,"In recent years, there has been a growing awareness that Native clients who suffer from substance abuse often face challenges that are distinct from those experienced by the mainstream population. For a number of years, I have been involved in research involving Native alcoholism and I have recently published a book on the subject titled The Path of Handsome Lake: A Model of Recovery for Native People. My book argues that many different Native cultures (in America and elsewhere) face similar challenges and disruptions because their cultures are often under great stress and/or because people are alienated from their heritage. The dyfunctional responses of many different Native people are similar because they are subjected to similar pressures. In a nutshell, due to contact with the outside world, Native cultures often experience disruptive transitions, and (in some instances) entire cultures or ways of life may face extinction. Under such circumstances, the culture loses the ability to support people and help them cope with the pressures of life. Cultural decline itself often causes additional trauma. Combined, these pressures can trigger dysfunction within the Native community. The obvious antidote for such maladies is to help Native substance abusers to reconnect with their heritage in positive and constructive ways. My earlier book and this one are inspired by the life and work of nineteenth century Iroquois leader Handsome Lake who developed a method to help Native people embrace their heritage as they recovered from substance abuse. Because my earlier book was scholarly and not focused on practitioner issues, using it within a therapeutic context may be difficult. Here, I adapt my ideas so they can be applied to therapy in a systematic and productive manner. The total program of therapy is presented in three volumes. The first is a short overview of the program that has been written at about a 10th-grade reading level. My goal is to provide a wide range of clients (as well as those who pursue self-help work) with an easily understood description of the program. The second document is a consumable workbook designed to be used with the reader. The workbook can be used both within the context of therapy and by those seeking strategies of self-help. The volume you are reading is a guide for therapists to consult when using this method to help Native clients. It is hoped that all three of these texts will play a significant role in the therapy and recovery of Native substance abusers.",Education,92,N/A,0,en
Practicing Social Justice in Libraries,"Alyssa Brissett, Diana Moronta",Taylor & Francis,2022-09-30,"Practicing Social Justice in Libraries provides practical strategies, tools, and resources to library and information workers and students who wish to drive change in their classrooms, institutions, and communities and incorporate social justice into their everyday practice. With contributions from a diverse group of librarians, who have experience working in different types of institutions and roles, the book showcases the actions information professionals, largely from historically marginalized groups, are taking to create a more socially responsible environment for themselves and their communities. The chapters reflect on personal experiences, best practices for programming, professional development, effective collaboration, building inclusive community partnerships, anti-racist practices in the classroom, and organizational culture. Exploring how and why library workers are incorporating anti-racist and anti-oppressive work within their everyday roles, the book demonstrates that library workers are increasingly sending messages of protest and advocating for equity, justice, and social change. Highlighting their experiences of marginalization and exclusion, contributors also reflect upon the impact social justice work has on their mental health, careers, and personal lives. Practicing Social Justice in Libraries is essential reading for library and information workers and students who are searching for practical ways to implement more inclusive practices into their work",Psychology,182,N/A,0,en

New Frontiers of Philanthropy,Lester M. Salamon,Oxford University Press,2014-06-13,"The resources of both governments and traditional philanthropy are either barely growing or in decline, yet the problems of poverty, ill-health, and environmental degradation balloon daily. It is therefore increasingly clear that we urgently need new models for financing and promoting social and environmental objectives. Fortunately, a significant revolution appears to be underway on the frontiers of philanthropy and social investing, tapping not only philanthropy, but also private investment capital, and providing at least a partial response to this dilemma. This book examines the new actors and new tools that form the heart of this revolution, and shows how they are reshaping the way we go about supporting solutions to social and environmental problems throughout the world. With contributions from leading experts in the field, New Frontiers of Philanthropy provides a comprehensive analysis of the many new institutions that have surfaced on this new frontier of philanthropy and social investment; the new tools and instruments these institutions are bringing to bear; the challenges that these actors and tools still encounter; and the steps that are needed to maximize their impact. The result is a powerful and accessible guide to developments that are already bringing significant new resources into efforts to solve the world's problems of poverty, ill-health, and environmental degradation; unleashing new energies and new sources of ingenuity for social and environmental problem-solving; and generating new hope in an otherwise dismal scenario of lagging resources and resolve.

How Are You “Being”?,Frederick J. Streets,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2024-07-23,"COVID-19 forced clergy to attend to the needs of their congregations in new ways. But it also encouraged them to look again at how they attended to their own needs. Self-awareness and self-care are often imperative for clergy well-being, which in turn affects the well-being of their congregations. During the pandemic, clergy gained new insight into how they were ""being""--how they might access internal and external resources that allowed them to thrive not only as pastors but also beyond their professional role. This book is based on multifaceted surveys of clergy personal responses to the pandemic. It encourages readers to consider the importance of an ethic of clergy well-being. Its practical examples and self-care protocol for clergy are intended to foster discussion within individual contexts. This is an important read for clergy, lay leaders, denominational stewards, and seminary and divinity school students and faculty as they engage in discerning the future needs of leaders of the church.",Religion,91,N/A,0,en
Being Single in India,Sarah Lamb,Univ of California Press,2022-06-14,"A free open access ebook is available upon publication. Learn more at www.luminosoa.org. Today, the majority of the world's population lives in a country with falling marriage rates, a phenomenon with profound impacts on women, gender, and sexuality. In this exceptionally crafted ethnography, Sarah Lamb probes the gendered trend of single women living in India, examining what makes living outside marriage for women increasingly possible and yet incredibly challenging. Featuring the stories of never-married women as young as 35 and as old as 92, the book offers a remarkable portrait of a way of life experienced by women across class and caste divides, from urban professionals and rural day laborers, to those who identify as heterosexual and lesbian, to others who evaded marriage both by choice and by circumstance. For women in India, complex social-cultural and political-economic contexts are foundational to their lives and decisions, and evading marriage is often an unintended consequence of other pressing life priorities. Arguing that never-married women are able to illuminate their society's broader social-cultural values, Lamb offers a new and startling look at prevailing systems of gender, sexuality, kinship, freedom, and social belonging in India today.",Social Science,236,N/A,0,en

"Heart Failure, An Issue of Critical Nursing Clinics",Jennifer Kitchens,Elsevier Health Sciences,2016-01-07,"Heart failure is the only cardiovascular disease that is increasing. The impact on the critical care environment and the health care system, as a whole, is significant from both a cost and burden to the system perspective. There are 6.5 million hospital days a year and nearly $40 billion dollars in yearly health care costs attributed to heart failure in the United States. There are more Medicare monies spent for diagnosing and treating heart failure than any other Diagnosis Related Group. There is a 24% hospital re-admission rate for this diagnosis which leads to financial implications for health care systems.The human cost is also significant. Less than half of Americans diagnosed with heart failure survive greater than 5 years. The ongoing health care needs and cost of this chronic disease takes a significant toll on patients’ finances, time and quality of life. Over $2.9 billion dollars is spent annually on the pharmaceutical management of heart failure in the United States. This diagnosis is the leading cause of hospitalization for patients who are 65 years of age and older. Few health care providers in the critical care environment are not affected by heart failure on a routine basis. Caring for these patients and their families is both a challenging and yet a rewarding experience. This edition will provide critical care nurses with a comprehensive heart failure review which is essential in caring for this challenging population given the dynamic health and critical care environments.",Medical,193,N/A,0,en

Theory of Social Constructivism. The United Nations Security Council in Libya,Christian Graf,GRIN Verlag,2014-08-14,"Seminar paper from the year 2014 in the subject Politics - Topic: Peace and Conflict, Security, grade: 1,3, University of Bamberg, language: English, abstract: The United Nations (UN) in international relations is considered to be a supranational organization. Currently the UN consist of 193 Member States and it stresses out four main purposes, which are maintaining peace and security, developing friendly relations amongst states, helping states to work together and being a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations (cf. www.un.org/en/aboutun). Additionally the UN is seen as a collective security system, which offers states to settle down any disputes and for solving social, economic, humanitarian and ecological problems on international level (cf. Gareis/Varwick 2006: 85). According to this purposes, the UN has acted and authorized multilateral interventions in many states, which were affected by conflicts. The Libyan conflict in 2011, as an example, was one of the cases where the UN has responded to. The actions and the multilateral intervention in Libya leaves questions. How does the UN shape the behavior of its Member States and why does the UN act in general? The theory of social constructivism by Alexander Wendt, can provide an explanation to these questions. The theory defines balances of power between states and explains the behavior of states. Furthermore it claims that international relations are social and the international system is constituted by ideas (cf. Jackson/Sorensen 2006: 162). But the main question which shall be discussed in this term paper is therefore: „How can the theory of social constructivism explain the actions by the United Nations Security Council in Libya?“ First of all core assumptions of social constructivism has to be discussed in order to explain further analysis of this term paper. After the illustration of the core assumptions of social constructivism, the powers and functions of the UN Security Council shall be described, because the Security Council, as one of the most important main body of the UN, is the only executive body that act regarding any threat of peace and security. Thereafter the situation in Libya, as the empirical example have to be mentioned. What exactly happened in Libya and what did the UN especially the Security Council do? Altogether with the core assumptions of social constructivism, the theoretical knowledge of the Security Council and the information of the Libyan conflict, the main question shall be answered. At the end the conclusion shall summarize the term paper ́s outcome of the analysis.",Political Science,21,N/A,0,en

Is You Okay?,"GloZell Green, Nils Parker",HarperCollins,2016-06-07,"A fun, inspiring memoir from “the Queen of YouTube” about her journey from anonymity in Florida to massive popularity on the Internet, filled with the unlikeliest of stories that are as poignant as they are hilarious “Is you okay? Is you good? Cuz I want to know!” Eager to entertain, dedicated to making people laugh, comedian and video superstar GloZell Green is game for any challenge, no matter how silly, gross, or absurd. Her crazy video stunts have propelled her into the ranks of legendary funny ladies such as Ellen DeGeneres, Whoopi Goldberg, Tina Fey, Carol Burnett, Lucille Ball, and Phyllis Diller—and made her an inspiring icon for a new generation. With this funny and liberating book, GloZell uses the stories from her winding journey to unbelievable success to help her fans and young women everywhere navigate the obstacles we all face in life, while helping them find the greatness unique to each of them, inside and out. Is You Okay? speaks truth about the elements of life we wrestle with every day—empowerment, love, body image, school, work, family, relationships, failure, success. GloZell introduces some of her most outlandish, funny, and unforgettable video challenges and uses each to explore a serious yet common hurdle. Sharing formative stories and insights from her own life, she encourages young women to learn to love their body, break free of their shell, and carve out their own identity. Making the connection between hilarious physical challenges and meaningful personal challenges, GloZell shows that we’re all in this together. “Everything isn’t just gonna be okay. It doesn’t just have to be good,” she reminds us. “It can be great (even with a spoonful of pepper in your mouth).”",Self-Help,157,N/A,0,en

How to Help Yourself With Self-Help,Martin Meadows,Meadows Publishing,2019-06-12,"Are Self-Help Books Good for Anything? Have you ever bought a self-help book, read it cover to cover, only to find that nothing changed for you? How many hours have you wasted this way, expecting to improve your life by simply being inspired by something you read? The hard truth is that it’s easy to read self-help, but difficult to implement it in real life. First you need to figure out what exactly to read, and then you need to know what exactly to do with the advice you find inside. The world of self-help has a lot of traps, and throughout my years as a voracious reader, I’ve fallen into probably all of them. Now, as both a reader and an author of self-help books, I’d like to share with you some advice on how to use self-help books in a way that will actually help you achieve real-world results. Here are some of the topics I cover in my short guide How to Help Yourself With Self-Help: - The 5 most common pitfalls of self-help and how to avoid them (you’ve probably fallen victim to most of them). - Tips on how to identify what specific area of your life you should target first in order to benefit the most from reading self-help. - What confirmation bias is, why it’s dangerous, and how to escape it to stay flexible and enjoy consistent personal growth. - How to interpret the advice you get from a book and tailor it to your life circumstances (cookie-cutter approaches don’t work). - Why it’s sometimes better to skip self-help books and what to read instead to help you achieve your goals and become a better person. Don’t let another self-help title become just another book on your shelf. Learn how to read in a more strategic way and, more importantly, act on the advice you get. This short guide can be your first step toward the new you.",Self-Help,40,N/A,0,en
Positive Psychology for Overcoming Depression,Miriam Akhtar,Duncan Baird Publishers,2013-01-01,"Miriam Akhtar introduces a major breakthrough in the treatment of depression' - Dr Chris Johnston, GP and Action for Happiness campaigner Expert author Miriam Akhtar explains how following the principles of Positive Psychology - cultivating positive emotions - can help you overcome depression and live a happier, more fulfilled life. The book begins by explaining the principles of Positive Psychology, which include savouring positive events, expressing gratitude for everyday experiences we may take for granted, practising meditation, developing optimism and cultivating resilience in the face of difficulties. It then goes on to focus on how these principles can help people cope with one of the most widespread problems in society today - depression. Akhtar explains, in friendly and accessible language, how Positive Psychology can help to prevent depression arising or, if you are already experiencing the blues, how the easy and straightforward exercises can reduce your symptoms and allow the sun to shine on your life once more. Throughout the book she brings these concepts to life by providing real-life case studies that show you how you can work her ideas into your daily routine.",Self-Help,163,N/A,0,en

Stand Firm,Svend Brinkmann,Polity,2017-03-13,"The pace of modern life is accelerating. To keep up, we must keep on moving and adapting – constantly striving for greater happiness and success. Or so we are told. But the demands of life in the fast lane come at a price: stress, fatigue and depression are at an all-time high, while our social interactions have become increasingly self-serving and opportunistic. How can we resist today's obsession with introspection and self-improvement? In this witty and bestselling book, Danish philosopher and psychologist Svend Brinkmann argues that we must not be afraid to reject the self-help mantra and 'stand firm'. The secret to a happier life lies not in finding your inner self but in coming to terms with yourself in order to coexist peacefully with others. By encouraging us to stand firm and get a foothold in life, this vibrant anti-self-help guide offers a compelling alternative to life coaching, positive thinking and the need always to say 'yes!'",Social Science,0,N/A,0,en

The Oxford Handbook of Eating Disorders,W. Stewart Agras M.D.,Oxford University Press,2010-07-06,"Oxford Handbooks offer authoritative and up-to-date reviews of original research in a particular subject area. Specially commissioned chapters from leading figures in the discipline give critical examinations of the progress and direction of debates, as well as a foundation for future research. Oxford Handbooks provide scholars and graduate students with compelling new perspectives upon a wide range of subjects in the humanities, social sciences, and sciences. A rich source of authoritative content that supports reading and study in the field, The Oxford Handbook of Eating Disorders reviews current research and clinical developments through synthetic chapters written by experts from various fields of study and clinical backgrounds. Epidemiologic studies suggest that eating disorders are not only common but have increased in prevalence in recent decades, and this handbook refines and updates the state of research. The book is divided into four sections: phenomenology and epidemiology of the eating disorders, approaches to understanding the disorders, assessment and comorbidities of the disorders, and prevention and treatment. The first section deals with classification and epidemiology of the disorders, considerations for revisions to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, and the somewhat neglected topic of eating disorders in childhood and early adolescence. The second section describes research basic to understanding the eating disorders and addresses biological factors, psychosocial risk factors, cultural factors, and the effects of behaviors such as dieting and eating and weight concerns in the genesis of the eating disorders. The third section describes assessment of the eating disorders, medical and psychological comorbidities, and medical management. The final section deals with various treatment modalities that have been found successful, including psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacologic approaches; an overview of evidence-based treatment for the eating disorders; and a consideration of what we know about cost-effectiveness of existing treatments. The multiple perspectives and breadth of scope offered by The Oxford Handbook of Eating Disorders make it an invaluable resource for clinicians, researchers, and educators, as well as scholars and students.",Psychology,516,N/A,0,en

Windows onto Jewish Legal Culture,"Hanina Ben-Menahem, Arye Edrei, Neil S. Hecht",Routledge,2020-06-30,"This book opens windows onto various aspects of Jewish legal culture. Rather than taking a structural approach, and attempting to circumscribe and define ‘every’ element of Jewish law, Windows onto Jewish Legal Culture takes a dynamic and holistic approach, describing diverse manifestations of Jewish legal culture, and its general mind-set, without seeking to fit them into a single structure. Jewish legal culture spans two millennia, and evolved in geographic centers that were often very distant from one another both geographically and socio-culturally. It encompasses the Talmud and talmudic literature, the law codes, the rulings of rabbinical courts, the responsa literature, decisions taken by communal leaders, study of the law in talmudic academies, the local study hall, and the home. But Jewish legal culture reaches well beyond legal and quasi-legal institutions; it addresses, and is reflected in, every aspect of daily life, from meals and attire to interpersonal and communal relations. Windows onto Jewish Legal Culture gives the reader a taste of the tremendous weight of Jewish legal culture within Jewish life. Among the facets of Jewish legal culture explored are two of its most salient distinguishing features, namely, toleration and even encouragement of controversy, and a preference for formalistic formulations. These features are widely misunderstood, and Jewish legal culture is often parodied as hair-splitting argument for the sake of argument. In explaining the epistemic imperatives that motivate Jewish legal culture, however, this book paints a very different picture. Situational constraints and empirical considerations are shown to provide vital input into legal determinations at every level, and the legal process is revealed to be attentive to context and sensitive to cultural concerns.",Law,700,N/A,0,en

Carpenter, PhD, RN, NE-BC, CNE",Springer Publishing Company,2023-01-25,"Three-time recipient of the AJN Book of the Year Award! The completely revised fifth edition of this authoritative text encompasses the most current middle range theories for graduate nursing students and researchers. User-friendly and consistently organized, it helps readers to understand the connection of research to larger conceptual models in nursing. The fifth edition presents three new theories, a revised chapter on concept-building, two published examples demonstrating the concept-building process, and a new section on the application of middle range theory that addresses its use for practice, and education. Additional new features include the fresh perspectives of a third editor, a two-color design to enhance readability, and discussion questions concluding each chapter.

Each theory is consistently organized by purpose, historical development, primary concepts, the relationships among concepts, and its use in nursing practice and research. Understanding of concepts is enhanced by the book's use of the ladder of abstraction for each theory to explain its relationship to philosophical, conceptual, and empirical theory dimensions.

Leading Peer Support and Self-Help Groups: A Pocket Resource for Peer Specialists and Support Group Facilitators,Charles Drebing,Lulu.com,2016,"There were more visits to peer support/self-help groups last year, than there were visits to the offices of mental health professionals. Peer support groups have exploded in popularity, as the public and the healthcare community recognize that they provide an effective complement to formal care, and improve the chance that many participants will have better healthcare outcomes. Few peer support/self-help group leaders have more than minimal training in how to lead a group successfully. This is unfortunate, as leading a self-help group is often challenging. This pocket resource is designed to provide easy access to key information and strategies to help Peer Specialists and other lay group leaders develop and expand their group facilitation skills so they can lead healthy thriving peer support groups.",Health & Fitness,225,N/A,0,en

The ‘How’ of Self-Care for Teachers,Narelle Lemon,Taylor & Francis,2024-08-20,"Providing insights, ideas, strategies and compassion, this book offers a new way of looking at self-care for educators experiencing exhaustion and stress, or who may simply be feeling more tired than they should be. Drawing on personal experiences of burnout, as well as research in wellbeing literacy, self-care and positive psychology, Narelle Lemon presents a new framework for self-care. Designed especially for teachers of any discipline or sector, the framework is based on five key dimensions: self-compassion, mindful awareness, habits, time, and empowerment. Evidence-based and easy to follow, these dimensions scaffold the tools and strategies offered in the book, allowing the reader to create their own toolbox based on what resonates with them most. The book is designed to be flexible, so the reader is encouraged to follow the recommendations as closely as they wish, or to take inspiration for their own ideas, acknowledging that tools will change over time and across contexts. The practical tools in this book are further supported by reflective prompts, as well as opportunities for extension with tips for leaders, working groups and the education sector more broadly. Written by a teacher for teachers, this book gives you not only the tools but also the permission to look after yourself. It will show you that self-care is an act of self-love, self-compassion, and self-awareness, and that it is relational and you need to care for you in order to care for others.",Education,312,N/A,0,en

By highlighting the clinical diagnosis and management of sleep disorders, this volume provides a valuable resource for all those involved in health care of older individuals. The changes in sleep patterns that occur during normal aging are described, followed by authoritative chapters on the presentation of various age-related sleep disorders. The book deals with the range of therapeutic measures available for managing these disorders and gives insight to potential areas of research that have emerged in the last few years, such as the study of circadian rhythms in later life, sleep patterns associated with co-morbidities and the use of quality-of-life measurement tools to determine sleep quality as we age. This volume is relevant to sleep disorders specialists, psychiatrists, geriatricians and gerontologists, and any professionals and researchers working in the interdisciplinary areas of sleep and aging.",Medical,471,N/A,0,en

Housing for Low-income Urban Families,Orville F. Grimes,Baltimore : Published for the World Bank [by] Johns Hopkins University Press,1976,"The considerable importance of housing to the urban and national economy contrasts sharply with housing conditions and official policies that exist in many developing countries. For all but the middle- and upper-income groups, housing is usually costly in relation to income and the quality of dwellings available. Cramped, crowded, and unsanitary settlements are the lot of low-income families, conditions that debilitate their energy and reduce national productivity. Families in illegal dwellings constantly face the threat of eviction as well as scarcities of water, sewerage, and transport. Often, under the banner of slum clearance, low-income groups are removed to higher-quality dwellings located far from income-earning opportunities and asked to pay rents they cannot afford. This study is intended to contribute to the discussions of housing policy options among urban planners and policymakers in developing countries. It does not attempt to analyze the optimal allocation of investment in urban areas or to suggest what place housing should have in such investment. There is no argument for a shift of capital and other resources from other sectors into housing. Instead, the principal intention is to achieve a better understanding of the workings of the urban housing market, especially as it affects low-income families, so as to bring about an improved use of the resources already used for housing and to allow new resources to be used effectively.",Business & Economics,206,N/A,0,en

Self-Help and Civic Culture,Anne B. Rodrick,Routledge,2019-06-04,"First published in 2004. The nineteenth century witnessed a flowering of the culture of self-improvement that was reflected in a plethora of institutes, societies and journals that sprang up across Britain with the goal of spreading knowledge and learning to a wide spectrum of society. The prophets of self-improvement believed that not only was self-improvement a laudable goal in its own right, but more importantly, it would contribute towards a general improvement in society. In an age in which direct participation in the political processes was restricted to a minority, education and self-improvement could act as an alternative force by creating a sophisticated and knowledgeable population. In other words, self-improvement was also seen as a way of creating active and responsible citizens. Focusing on the city of Birmingham, and drawing on both local and national sources, Self Help and Civic Culture explores the changing nature of self improvement and citizenship in Victorian Britain. By approaching the concept of citizenship from a new perspective, provincial identity and its relationship to wider ideas of 'Englishness' and 'Britishness', a distinct ideal of citizenship is elucidated that adds further nuance to current scholarship. By drawing together various issues of citizenship, self-improvement, class and political power, this work brings a new perspective to the on-going attempts to determine who could claim the full rights, duties, privileges and responsibilities of the larger social body, thus illuminating the relationship between culture and power in nineteenth century England.",History,270,N/A,0,en
Self-Help in Mental Health,"T. Mark Harwood, Luciano L'Abate",Springer,2009-11-24,"Self-help is big business, but alas not a scienti c business. The estimated 10 billion—that’s with a “b”—spent each year on self-help in the United States is rarely guided by research or monitored by mental health professionals. Instead, marketing and metaphysics triumph. The more outrageous the “miraculous cure” and the “r- olutionary secret,” the better the sales. Of the 3,000 plus self-help books published each year, only a dozen contain controlled research documenting their effectiveness as stand-alone self-help. Of the 20,000 plus psychological and relationship web sites available on the Internet, only a couple hundred meet professional standards for accuracy and balance. Most, in fact, sell a commercial product. Pity the layperson, or for that matter, the practitioner, trying to navigate the self-help morass. We are bombarded with thousands of potential resources and c- tradictory advice. Should we seek wisdom in a self-help book, an online site, a 12-step group, an engaging autobiography, a treatment manual, an inspiring movie, or distance writing? Should we just do it, or just say no? Work toward change or accept what is? Love your inner child or grow out of your Peter Pan? I become confused and discouraged just contemplating the choices.",Psychology,320,N/A,0,en

"Self-help Housing, the Poor, and the State in the Caribbean","Robert B. Potter, Dennis Conway",Univ. of Tennessee Press,1997,"This collection of essays represents the first in-depth, scholarly treatment of housing policies and conditions throughout the Caribbean. The contributors consider both the performance of the state and the autonomous activities of the poor, making this volume an invaluable contribution to future planning and debate.The essays, each dealing with a specific island or group of islands, collectively address four main themes: the history of housing provision since colonization, current housing conditions, state policies toward housing provision, and the changing relationships between governments, international funding agencies, the private housing sector, and the peoples' responses. These investigations not only highlight the often alarming problems that Caribbean nations face in providing adequate housing for the poor but also implicate governments in past and present failures and poor performances. However, the essays are also filled with useful insights about the ways in which progressive housing policies can be formulated and implemented. For example, the volume suggests that the Caribbean's rich heritage of folk and vernacular architectural styles should be taken into serious account in future planning efforts.In a concluding synthesis chapter, the volume editors argue that a more progressive future is attainable if all parties exhibit the political will that the poor have already demonstrated.",Business & Economics,324,N/A,0,en

When you're a child of the favela, in the Valley of Steel, you know that Fate comes like a whirlwind, lifting some to great heights and slapping others down with no reason. Ivan, rescued first from an orphanage in the slums of Rio de Janeiro and then from the bleak streets of Ipatinga in Brazil's Valley of Steel, has been favored by Fate. When a call from Brazil interrupts his privileged life in America, he learns his best friend has committed suicide in the rugged Valley of Steel and only he knows the real reasons why. This is the story of one man's journey home after a self-inflicted exile. The story of a boy who saw more than any child should, and the man he grew into--and how that man came back to the Valley of Steel to avenge his childhood and stare down the demons of his past. It is a story of survival, redemption, and joy. Of childhood memories that burn in the soul--and what happens when one man has courage enough to fan the flames and face the fire.

United States Code,,N/A,2013,"Preface 2012 edition: The United States Code is the official codification of the general and permanent laws of the United States. The Code was first published in 1926, and a new edition of the code has been published every six years since 1934. The 2012 edition of the Code incorporates laws enacted through the One Hundred Twelfth Congress, Second session, the last of which was signed by the President on January 15, 2013. It does not include laws of the One Hundred Thirteenth Congress, First session, enacted between January 3, 2013, the date it convened, and January 15, 2013. By statutory authority this edition may be cited ""U.S.C. 2012 ed."" As adopted in 1926, the Code established prima facie the general and permanent laws of the United States. The underlying statutes reprinted in the Code remained in effect and controlled over the Code in case of any discrepancy. In 1947, Congress began enacting individual titles of the Code into positive law. When a title is enacted into positive law, the underlying statutes are repealed and the title then becomes legal evidence of the law. Currently, 26 of the 51 titles in the Code have been so enacted. These are identified in the table of titles near the beginning of each volume. The Law Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives continues to prepare legislation pursuant to 2 USC 285b to enact the remainder of the Code, on a title-by-title basis, into positive law. The 2012 edition of the Code was prepared and published under the supervision of Ralph V. Seep, Law Revision Counsel. Grateful acknowledgment is made of the contributions by all who helped in this work, particularly the staffs of the Office of the Law Revision Counsel and the Government Printing Office. -- John. A.

The Making of a Refugee,Tasoulla Hadjiyanni,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2002-03-30,"Through an examination of interviews provided by 100 children of refugees in Cyprus, born after their family's displacement, Hadjiyanni illustrates the formation of a refugee consciousness, an identity adopted by many children who never experienced the actual displacement of their family. Focusing on the process by which a child born into a refugee family develops a refugee identity, the book identifies nine dimensions that inform this consciousness. Establishing the family as the primary transmitter of the refugee identity and the child as its constructor, the author points to the power of homeplace in forming and supporting such an identity. The book challenges the notion that refugee consciousness is a separate identity and a crisis by reinterpreting it as a resistance to adversity. Shedding new light on what it means to be a refugee, this work is a welcome addition to the field. Beginning with a discussion of the meaning of the term refugee, and how it has been adopted by the children of some refugees in Cyprus, the author moves to an examination of the meaning of past and present to the formation of a refugee consciousness. She then looks to the causes of such identity formation, focusing on the transference of identity from parent to child, and the effects of past loss on children who have not actually experienced displacement. Housing issues are also examined as a contributing factor, as refugee housing is typically distinct, and constrained, compared to housing for native citizens of a community. The author concludes her work with a discussion of the implications of the Cyprus example for both the future and for general refugee studies.",Education,263,N/A,0,en

The Oxford Handbook of Substance Use and Substance Use Disorders,Kenneth J. Sher,Oxford University Press,2016-07-13,"Substance use and substance use disorders (SUDs) have been documented in a number of cultures since the beginnings of recorded time and represent major societal concerns in the present day. The Oxford Handbook of Substance Use and Substance Use Disorders provides comprehensive reviews of key areas of inquiry into the fundamental nature of substance use and SUDs, their features, causes, consequences, course, treatment, and prevention. It is clear that understanding these various aspects of substance use and SUDs requires a multidisciplinary perspective that considers the pharmacology of drugs of abuse, genetic variation in these acute and chronic effects, and psychological processes in the context of the interpersonal and cultural contexts. Comprising two volumes, this Handbook also highlights a range of opportunities and challenges facing those interested in the basic understanding of the nature of these phenomena and novel approaches to assess, prevent, and treat these conditions with the goal of reducing the enormous burden these problems place on our global society. Chapters in Volume 1 cover the historical and cultural contexts of substance use and its consequences, its epidemiology and course, etiological processes from the perspective of neuropharmacology, genetics, personality, development, motivation, and the interpersonal and larger social environment. Chapters in Volume 2 cover major health and social consequences of substance involvement, psychiatric comorbidity, assessment, and interventions. Each chapter highlights key issues in the respective topic area and raises unanswered questions for future research. All chapters are authored by leading scholars in each topic. The level of coverage is sufficiently deep to be of value to both trainees and established scientists and clinicians interested in an evidenced-based approach.",Psychology,793,N/A,0,en

Declarative Agent Languages and Technologies II,"João Leite, Andrea Omicini, Paolo Torroni, Pinar Yolum",Springer Science & Business Media,2005-06-16,"The second edition of the workshop on Declarative Agent Languages and Te- nologies (DALT 2004) was held July 2004 in New York City, and was a great success. We saw a signi?cant increase in both the number of submitted papers and workshop attendees from the ?rst meeting, held July 2003 in Melbourne. Nearly 40 research groups worldwide were motivated to contribute to this event by submitting their most recent research achievements, covering a wide variety of the topics listed in the call for papers. More than 30 top researchers agreed to join the Program Committee, which then collectively faced the hard task of selecting the one-day event program. The fact that research in multi-agent systems is no longer only a novel and promising research horizon at dawn is, in our opinion, the main reason behind DALT’s (still short) success story. On the one hand, agent theories and app- cations are mature enough to model complex domains and scenarios, and to successfully address a wide range of multifaceted problems, thus creating the urge to make the best use of this expressive and versatile paradigm, and also pro?t from all the important results achieved so far. On the other hand, bui- ing multi-agent systems still calls for models and technologies that could ensure system predictability, accommodate ?exibility, heterogeneity and openness, and enable system veri?cation.",Computers,301,N/A,0,en
A Guide to Conducting Prevention Research in the Community,James G Kelly,Routledge,2014-02-04,"This provocative and useful volume is a step-by-step guide to assist professionals in implementing valid and useful community research and creating preventive interventions that have positive and lasting effects on the development of the community. The authors--including James G. Kelly, one of the fathers of prevention--offer valuable suggestions for developing community processes to assist the prevention researcher and the community in designing research that is embedded in the community. Experts focus on the topics that can help establish and sustain effective long-term working relationships with community members. Numerous examples illustrate how the collaborative working relationship can create the variety of resources that are needed to eventually implement policy changes stimulated by the research and help to sustain the impact of the research findings after the research has been completed. This exciting book illustrates how community research related to the prevention of mental illness and the promotion of mental health can be scientific and objective, as well as a positive collaboration between the research staff and community members. Focus upon community needs Emphasize educational activities to support the prevention research Identify points of policy impact before the research begins Enhance the development of social networks and social support systems for the development of competencies Provide criteria for the selection of systemic variables for the research Include reference to the multiple levels of a community which may affect the research topic Specify ways in which participants can identify and own the research topic Outline criteria for assessing the side effects of the prevention research In order to better understand the needs, values, commitments, and resources of the community in which he or she is working, the researcher is encouraged to select research topics derived from underlying community needs, educated the public about prevention, identify points of policy impact, and determine the informal social networks that enhance the development of social competencies in the community. The benefits of the collaborative relationship between prevention researchers and the community are strongly emphasized.

"Social Support Networks, Coping and Positive Aging Among the Community-Dwelling Elderly in Hong Kong",Susu Liu,Springer,2019-01-04,"The dramatically increasing aging population of Hong Kong has elicited new risks and opportunities to facilitate a positive life for older adults. This book offers a holistic review of gerontological theories and literature, and constructs a conceptual framework of social support networks, coping and positive aging. In light of the implications of the convoy model of social support to depict an indigenous landscape of positive aging in Hong Kong, this is one of the very few empirical studies that adopts both quantitative research and qualitative research. The research consisted of a pilot study of in-depth interviews with 16 older Hong Kong Chinese and a main study surveying 393 older members of District Elderly Community Center. The results of the study indicate that family and peer support constitute the mainstay of support networks of the elderly, and that family and peer support are associated with positive aging. Moreover, the study shows that it is the depth of emotional closeness, namely, close interaction and intimacy with social partners that makes the greatest contribution to positive aging. Additionally, problem coping and emotion coping are found to mediate the relationship between social support networks and positive aging. There is potential in bringing more domestic helpers into elderly care and improving the service quality such that the goal of Aging in Place can be promoted in Hong Kong. Intended for researchers in social work, gerontology and positive psychology, it is also essential reading for graduates and social work professionals interested in this area.

Self-Care for Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents,Lindsay C. Gibson,New Harbinger  Publications,2021-09-01,"From the author of the New York Times bestseller, Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents, this essential guide offers daily, practical ways to help you heal the invisible wounds caused by immature parents, nurture self-awareness, trust your emotions, improve relationships, and stop putting others’ needs ahead of your own. If you grew up with an emotionally immature, unavailable, or selfish parent, you probably still struggle with anger, sadness, resentment, or shame. As a child, your emotional needs were not met, your feelings were dismissed, and you likely took on adult levels of responsibility in an effort to compensate for your parent’s behavior. Somewhere along the way, you lost your sense of self. And without this strong sense of self, you may feel like your own well-being isn’t valuable. In this compassionate guide—written just for you, not them—you’ll find tips and tools to help you set boundaries with others, honor and validate your emotions, and thrive in the face of life’s challenges. You’ll discover how to protect yourself from hurtful behavior, stop making excuses for others’ limitations, forge healthier relationships, and feel more confident in your life. Most importantly, you’ll learn how to stop putting others’ needs before your own, and manage daily stressors with competence, clarity, and optimism. Self-care means honoring and respecting the self. But when you grow up with emotionally immature parents, you are taught that setting limits is selfish and uncaring. You are taught to seek approval instead of authenticity in relationships. And you are taught that empathy and emotional awareness are liabilities, rather than assets. But there’s another way to go through life—one in which you can take care of yourself, first and foremost. Let this book guide you toward a new way of being.",Self-Help,351,N/A,0,en

Revitalising Deprived Urban Neighbourhoods,"Colin C. Williams, Jan Windebank",Routledge,2017-03-02,"Governments in Western Europe and North America have placed job creation initiatives at the heart of their policy for revitalizing deprived neighbourhoods. However, relying on this alone is problematic and these governments are becoming increasingly interested in finding ways of enabling communities to help themselves. Drawing upon original, in-depth studies of self-help activities in both deprived and affluent neighbourhoods in UK cities, this book examines why the populations of deprived neighbourhoods are more likely to be excluded not only from the labour market but also from adopting self-help practices in response to their situation. It also identifies the barriers which discourage participation in self-help projects. A combination of policies are advocated, bringing together innovative bottom-up initiatives such as LETS, time currencies and Employee Mutuals, with top-down policies such as Active Citizens’ Credits. This book instead suggests a fresh and positive approach towards revitalizing deprived neighbourhoods based on seeking the full-engagement, rather than merely the full-employment, of deprived populations.",Social Science,196,N/A,0,en

Juggling Money,Hotze Lont,Brill,2005,"This social-anthropological study, focusing on urban Indonesia, examines a variety of financial self-help organizations (arisan and simpan pinjam) as instruments for dealing with financial difficulties related to illness, death, and unemployment. The author devotes ample attention to the embedding of these associations, and their participants, in a changing socio-economic and cultural environment, and to the important issues of agency, exclusion, trust, and social conflict. The book not only explains the workings of these fascinating collective arrangements, but also provides an interesting window on living conditions and social relations in an Indonesian urban community. Indonesianists will find here a detailed description of an omnipresent aspect of Javanese socio-economic life, the only thorough analytical study of which has become somewhat outdated (C. Geertz, The rotating credit association: An instrument for development, Cambridge 1956). In this UN Year of Microcredit, experts on informal finance and microfinance will value the explanation of the workings of financial self-help organizations, and its policy implications.

You must be intentional about your personal growth and development. Mr. Calhoun details the transformation necessary to happen for achieving some of life's best. Being a best-selling author, Mr. Calhoun, now has enhanced his writings to carry variously labels of ""leadership"", ""personal development"" and ""self-help"", as well as consulting. Mr. Calhoun's idea of self-improvement, however, was different from the torrent of positive-thinking verbiage that dominates the market today. He was raised in the middle to lower income neighborhoods of Dallas, Texas. His early life including drug, alcohol addiction, and trouble with the law. His rise from not enough to more than enough came with challenges that many did not face. He is an advocate of controlling your destiny with the help of a 'higher power'. He believes that life is 5% what happens to you and 95% of how you handle what happens to you. Attitude if not everything is the most important thing. Life greatest lessons are experienced through struggle and difficulties. Difficulties and struggles were there to weed out the impurities which will keep you from fulfilling your God-given destiny. You are a leader and everything rises and falls on leadership. His thought process is they are there to weed out the weak and build what Mr. Calhoun calls the Winning Factor, which is you. Some of Mr. Calhoun heroes are the Apostle Paul, John Maxwell, and countless others. If you are lost and need to know where to go it is good to have a map and/or GPS.

Get Out of Your Mind and Into Your Life,Steven C. Hayes,New Harbinger  Publications,2005-11-01,"Get ready to take a different perspective on your problems and your life—and the way you live it. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a new, scientifically based psychotherapy that takes a fresh look at why we suffer and even what it means to be mentally healthy. What if pain were a normal, unavoidable part of the human condition, but avoiding or trying to control painful experience were the cause of suffering and long-term problems that can devastate your quality of life? The ACT process hinges on this distinction between pain and suffering. As you work through this book, you’ll learn to let go of your struggle against pain, assess your values, and then commit to acting in ways that further those values. ACT is not about fighting your pain; it’s about developing a willingness to embrace every experience life has to offer. It’s not about resisting your emotions; it’s about feeling them completely and yet not turning your choices over to them. ACT offers you a path out of suffering by helping you choose to live your life based on what matters to you most. If you’re struggling with anxiety, depression, or problem anger, this book can help—clinical trials suggest that ACT is very effective for a whole range of psychological problems. But this is more than a self-help book for a specific complaint—it is a revolutionary approach to living a richer and more rewarding life. Learn why the very nature of human language can cause suffering Escape the trap of avoidance Foster willingness to accept painful experience Practice mindfulness skills to achieve presence in the moment Discover the things you really value most Commit to living a vital, meaningful life This book has been awarded The Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies Self-Help Seal of Merit — an award bestowed on outstanding self-help books that are consistent with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles and that incorporate scientifically tested strategies for overcoming mental health difficulties.

PSP(sm),Watts S. Humphrey,Addison-Wesley Professional,2005-03-03,"Most software-development groups have embarrassing records: By some accounts, more than half of all software projects are significantly late and over budget, and nearly a quarter of them are cancelled without ever being completed. Although developers recognize that unrealistic schedules, inadequate resources, and unstable requirements are often to blame for such failures, few know how to solve these problems. Fortunately, the Personal Software Process (PSP) provides a clear and proven solution. Comprising precise methods developed over many years by Watts S. Humphrey and the Software Engineering Institute (SEI), the PSP has successfully transformed work practices in a wide range of organizations and has already produced some striking results. This book describes the PSP and is the definitive guide and reference for its latest iteration. PSP training focuses on the skills required by individual software engineers to improve their personal performance. Once learned and effectively applied, PSP-trained engineers are qualified to participate on a team using the Team Software Process (TSP), the methods for which are described in the final chapter of the book. The goal for both PSP and TSP is to give developers exactly what they need to deliver quality products on predictable schedules. PSPSM: A Self-Improvement Process for Software Engineers presents a disciplined process for software engineers and anyone else involved in software development. This process includes defect management, comprehensive planning, and precise project tracking and reporting. The book first scales down industrial software practices to fit the needs of the module-sized program development, then walks readers through a progressive sequence of practices that provide a sound foundation for large-scale software development. By doing the exercises in the book, and using the PSP methods described here to plan, evaluate, manage, and control the quality of your own work, you will be well prepared to apply those methods on ever larger and more critical projects. Drawing on the author’s extensive experience helping organizations to achieve their development goals, and with the PSP benefits well illustrated, the book presents the process in carefully crafted steps. The first chapter describes overall principles and strategies. The next two explain how to follow a defined process, as well as how to gather and use the data required to manage a programming job. Several chapters then cover estimating and planning, followed by quality management and design. The last two chapters show how to put the PSP to work, and how to use it on a team project. A variety of support materials for the book, as described in the Preface, are available on the Web. If you or your organization are looking for a way to improve your project success rate, the PSP could well be your answer.",Computers,466,N/A,0,en
Coming Back to the Present,"Audrey N. Hall, George C. Hall",N/A,2023-09,"In Coming Back to the Present, you learn how to practice proven mindfulness skills, which you can use to live a more rich, full, meaningful life. As a mindfulness-based program for stress reduction based on more than 20 years of research and practice at some of the best hospitals in the United States, such as the Hospitals of the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Michigan Medical Center, and the US Department of Veteran's Affairs, you will learn to cope with stress using proven mindfulness, acceptance, and behavior change strategies. These mindfulness-based techniques will allow you to change your behavior - without first changing or eliminating your thoughts and feelings. This is an important difference between our book and many other self-help books. Unfortunately, this belief (e.g., you must change your thoughts before you change your behavior) is a common error many make, which obstructs and obscures your ability to recognize positive results. In contrast, our focus here is on learning and practicing only the most useful, helpful, effective coping strategies, which work for you in the long-term. To do so, we recommend that you build nine core skills, your starting repertoire, which help you build a special awareness - that you have a choice when you are under stress: you can come back to the present moment, here, or stay in the past or future, there. By practicing the techniques in this workbook, you can accomplish the following: Develop awareness, compassion, loving-kindness, generosity, curiosity, openness, gratitude. Give yourself opportunities to experience safer, more pleasant interactions and experiences in all areas of your life. Feel more confident and better about yourself, gain more hope. Develop an 'I can do anything I set my mind-to' attitude. Practice exercises are provided to help you learn and apply a broad range of different mindful-creative exercises and meditations: Concentrative meditations Creative meditations Grounding and centering meditations Heart-centered meditations Mantras Mindfulness meditations Movement meditations Reflective meditations, and Visual meditations The exercises, many written as poems by author and poet, Audrey Hall, provide a rich tapestry of metaphors images and stories to highlight this topic in a fun and accessible fashion. The poems are followed by intriguing, reflective questions to challenge you, inspire you, and outline concrete steps you can take to bring these insights into your everyday life. A self-survey is included, which you can use to help assess, monitor, and measure your progress. The survey provides a professional, statistical reliable and valid measure of your skills. Each question on the survey was certified by a statistics institute and determined to have significant impact. Using the survey, you are encouraged to chart your progress and recognize the gains you have made from beginning to end.

"Self-Help, Private Debt Collection and the Concomitant Risks",,N/A,2015,"The book shows that self-help in commercial law is a fast, inexpensive and efficient alternative to court enforcement. Self-help remedies and private debt collection are largely but not exclusively features of common law jurisdictions, since remnants of private enforcement can still be found in contract law in civilian systems. The book argues that - despite their usefulness - self-help and private debt collection entail significant risks, especially for consumer debtors. This means that private enforcement needs to be accompanied by the introduction of tailor-made consumer-debtor protection regulation. Specific attention is given to factoring, which functions in many instances as a form of pseudo-private debt collection and which has been exploited to bypass sector-specific consumer protection regulations.",,0,N/A,0,en

Eifert",New Harbinger  Publications,2010-11-01,"So many of us postpone pursuing our goals and dreams because we think we'll get to them later, when we have more time or feel we're worthy of them.

The Oxford Handbook of Hoarding and Acquiring,"Randy O. Frost, Gail Steketee",Oxford University Press,2013-12-06,"Hoarding involves the acquisition of and inability to discard large numbers of possessions that clutter the living area of the person collecting them. It becomes a disorder when the behavior causes significant distress or interferes with functioning. Hoarding can interfere with activities of daily living (such as being able to sit in chairs or sleep in a bed), work efficiency, family relationships, as well as health and safety. Hoarding behavior can range from mild to life-threatening. Epidemiological findings suggest that hoarding occurs in 2-6% of the adult population, making it two to three times more common than obsessive-compulsive disorder. The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) now includes Hoarding Disorder as a distinct disorder within the OCD and Related Anxiety Disorders section, creating a demand for information about it. The Oxford Handbook of Hoarding and Acquiring is the first volume to detail the empirical research on hoarding. Including contributions from all of the leading researchers in the field, this comprehensive volume is divided into four sections in addition to introductory and concluding chapters by the editors: Phenomenology, Epidemiology, and Diagnosis; Etiology; Assessment and Intervention; and Hoarding in Special Populations. The summaries of research and clinical interventions contained here clarify the emotional and behavioral features, diagnostic challenges, and nature of the treatment interventions for this new disorder. This handbook will be a critical resource for both practitioners and researchers, including psychiatrists, psychologists, neurologists, epidemiologists, social workers, occupational therapists, and other health and mental health professionals who encounter clients with hoarding problems in their practice and research.",Psychology,433,N/A,0,en

Improving the Effectiveness of the Helping Professions,Morley D. Glicken,SAGE Publications,2004-08-28,"The current practice of counseling, psychotherapy, and most helping professions often relies on clinical wisdom with little evidence of what actually works. Clinical wisdom is often a justification for beliefs and values that bond people together as professionals but often fails to serve clients since many of those beliefs and values may be comforting, but they may also be inherently incorrect. Improving the Effectiveness of the Helping Professions: An Evidence-Based Approach to Practice covers the use of research and critical thinking to assist helping professionals make the most effective choices in treating clients with social and emotional problems. The use of evidence-based practice (EBP) comes at a time when managed care and concerns over health care costs coincide with growing concerns that psychotherapy, case management, and counseling may not be sufficiently effective ways of helping people in social and emotional difficulty. Improving the Effectiveness of the Helping Professions provides an easy-to-read, inclusive approach covering EBP with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and terrorism, bereavement, substance abuse, mental illness, and problems experienced by older adults, among others. This text critically reviews the literature on self-help groups, religious involvement, and spirituality. It also includes sources to find best evidence, a simple overview of research concepts, a chapter on critical thinking, and numerous relevant case studies showing the application of EBP. Improving the Effectiveness of the Helping Professions is ideally suited for undergraduate and graduate students in social work, psychology, counseling, criminal justice, psychiatric nursing, and psychiatry.

Working With Troubled Men,Morley D.

Many more women than men seek counseling and therapy, and to some extent standard services have evolved in response to female styles of communicating and problem-solving. Practitioners frequently feel frustrated and baffled by their male clients because they seem unresponsive to treatment approaches that work so well for women. But many men benefit from therapy when practitioners understand male socialization and the ways men communicate and problem-solve. Too many men today are doing badly and are in real need of help. Almost half of America's male children grow up in single parent homes headed by mothers, where they seldom have male mentors or role models. Fewer men than women attend or graduate from college, and increasing levels of binge drinking and date rape on campuses paint a discouraging picture of men on campus. Male violence continues to be a serious problem in many American communities, with male youth violence continuing at epidemic levels. Men die younger than women overall and in much higher proportions from suicide, homicide, and cirrhosis of the liver.",Health & Fitness,336,N/A,0,en

Person Centered Medicine, as a concept and global programmatic movement developed in collaboration with the World Medical Association, World Health Organization, International Council of Nurses and 30 other institutions over a decade of annual Geneva Conferences, places the whole person as the center of health and as the goal and protagonist of health actions.

Bowling Alone: Revised and Updated,Robert D. Putnam,Simon & Schuster,2020-10-13,"*The basis for the documentary Join or Die—now streaming on Netflix!* Updated to include a new chapter about the influence of social media and the Internet—the 20th anniversary edition of Bowling Alone remains a seminal work of social analysis, and its examination of what happened to our sense of community remains more relevant than ever in today’s fractured America. Twenty years, ago, Robert D. Putnam made a seemingly simple observation: once we bowled in leagues, usually after work; but no longer. This seemingly small phenomenon symbolized a significant social change that became the basis of the acclaimed bestseller, Bowling Alone, which The Washington Post called “a very important book” and Putnam, “the de Tocqueville of our generation.” Bowling Alone surveyed in detail Americans’ changing behavior over the decades, showing how we had become increasingly disconnected from family, friends, neighbors, and social structures, whether it’s with the PTA, church, clubs, political parties, or bowling leagues. In the revised edition of his classic work, Putnam shows how our shrinking access to the “social capital” that is the reward of communal activity and community sharing still poses a serious threat to our civic and personal health, and how these consequences have a new resonance for our divided country today. He includes critical new material on the pervasive influence of social media and the internet, which has introduced previously unthinkable opportunities for social connection—as well as unprecedented levels of alienation and isolation. At the time of its publication, Putnam’s then-groundbreaking work showed how social bonds are the most powerful predictor of life satisfaction, and how the loss of social capital is felt in critical ways, acting as a strong predictor of crime rates and other measures of neighborhood quality of life, and affecting our health in other ways. While the ways in which we connect, or become disconnected, have changed over the decades, his central argument remains as powerful and urgent as ever: mending our frayed social capital is key to preserving the very fabric of our society.",History,592,N/A,0,en

L. M. Montgomery's Emily of New Moon,"Yan Du, Joe Sutliff Sanders",Univ. Press of Mississippi,2024-04-23,"Contributions by Yoshiko Akamatsu, Carol L. Beran, Rita Bode, Lesley D. Clement, Allison McBain Hudson, Kate Lawson, Jessica Wen Hui Lim, Lindsey McMaster, E. Holly Pike, Katharine Slater, Margaret Steffler, and Anastasia Ulanowicz Lucy Maud Montgomery (1874–1942) was a Canadian author best known for writing the wildly popular Anne of Green Gables. At the time of its publication in 1908, it was an immediate bestseller and launched Montgomery to fame. Less known than the dreamy and accidentally mischievous Anne Shirley is Emily Byrd Starr, the title character in the trilogy that followed much later in Montgomery’s professional career, Emily of New Moon. Published in 1923, Emily of New Moon is the first in a series of novels about an orphan girl growing up on Prince Edward Island, a story that mirrors Anne’s but intentionally resists many of the defining qualities of Montgomery's most famous creation. Despite being overshadowed by the immense popularity of Anne of Green Gables, the Emily of New Moon trilogy has become a subject of endless fascination to fans and scholars around the world. The trilogy was conceived during an important phase in Montgomery’s career during which she turned from Anne and plunged into more intricate aspects of gender, adolescence, nature, and authorship. While the novels have attracted rich critical attention since their publication, book-length studies proved surprisingly scarce. L. M. Montgomery’s ""Emily of New Moon"": A Children’s Classic at 100 is the first scholarly volume exclusively dedicated to the trilogy, coalescing different research perspectives. It offers a fresh point of entrance into a well-loved classic at its one-hundredth anniversary.",Literary Criticism,148,N/A,0,en

Principally from the Original Soho Mss,Samuel Smiles,Good Press,2019-12-11,"This is an invaluable work on Boulton and Watt, an early British engineering and manufacturing firm in the business of designing and producing marine and stationary steam engines. It was founded in 1775 as a partnership between the Scottish engineer James Watt and the English manufacturer Matthew Boulton to exploit Watt's patent for a steam engine with a different condenser. The firm played a significant role in Industrial Revolution and evolved to be a prominent producer of steam engines in the 19th century. This work was a result of the memoirs of Boulton and Watt. The writer described the formation and evolution of the company as well as details on how they planned and carried out the operations in simple terms. It's a perfect read for people curious to learn about the engineering practices in the olden days.",History,330,N/A,0,en

The Applied Psychologist,"James Hartley (Ph. D.), Alan Branthwaite",N/A,2000,"""Written in a clear and accessible style, the book should appeal to psychology students who want to get an idea of what it is like to work in applied psychology and the skills need to do this. This is especially the case as the book contains highly practical guide to pursuing career opportunities and where to find information on relevant courses."" Tom Merrill, Psychology Student, University of Leeds, UK Review of the first edition: ""... a nice combination of theory and practice which should be of interest to two main audiences - psychology students trying to get some ideas about their choice of career, and practising psychologists who might like to dip into the book from time to time to broaden their horizons."" R. J. Ashton - School Psychology International * What do psychologists do? * What skills do psychologists have? * What contributions can they make to solving people's problems? Are there different kinds of psychologists doing different kinds of jobs or do applied psychologists share a common set of skills to be deployed in different contexts? The fully revised and updated second edition of this highly successful book takes the latter view. It brings a fresh perspective by suggesting that applied psychologists have many similar skills that can be used in different ways in different circumstances. The editors identify seven roles used by most applied psychologists, embracing the psychologist as counsellor, colleague, expert, tool-maker, detached investigator, theoretician and agent for change. In this book fifteen leading applied psychologists describe several aspects of their work in order to emphasise these different roles. Although the content of this book is very varied - covering work-based counselling, cancer treatment, police psychology, text design, driving behaviour, sports psychology, market research, fire-fighter stress, autism, bullying, and work with refugees - the theme is simple: applied psychologists have many similar skills in the roles they play. Students of psychology everywhere will find this book to be an essential point of reference on applied psychology. Its clear and accessible style is enhanced by discussion questions and suggestions for further reading at the end of each chapter. The text also contains a useful and highly practical guide to pursuing career opportunities and where to find information on relevant courses.",Medical,298,N/A,0,en

Break Your Self-Help Addiction,Brian D. Ridgway,Morgan James Publishing,2017-07-18,"Discover what keeps you stuck—and prepare for a miraculous breakthrough. What if self-improvement is a booby-trap? And what if there is actually a way to change one’s life—in all areas, all at once—by finding and shifting the one hidden issue that has been creating all of the stuckness all along? Coming out of an abusive childhood and then living with the outcomes of that ongoing pain, Brian D. Ridgway invested over $300,000 and tens of thousands of hours over thirty-plus years on self-help, personal development, and business/money/success courses—as his life got worse and worse. Finding himself in desperate circumstances, suicidal and stuck, he experienced an awakening that took him from homeless to living the dream in Hawaii in less than ninety days. In that awakening, he was given the Level 5 Paradigm. Since that “miracle moment,” he has been able to help people around the world to take their first steps into true freedom—and in this book, he tells his story.",Self-Help,141,N/A,0,en

Ten Days to Self-Esteem,"David D. Burns, M.D.",Harper Perennial,1993-10-29,"Ten Days to Self-esteem The Leader's Manual To date, Dr. David Burns's classic Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy has sold more than two and a half million copies. Many people are unaware of the real secret of this book's phenomenal success. Published studies have shown that two thirds of the depressed people who have read Dr. Burns's Feeling Good recovered on their own in just four weeks without any professional treatment at all! Even more astonishing is the fact that 77% of these readers maintained their positive outlook for at least two years after reading Feeling Good. That's why Feeling Good has become a perennial best-seller -- because this book provides hope, compassion, and actual healing for people suffering from depression. Now Dr. Burns offers a powerful new tool with the creation of his Ten Days to Self-esteem: The Leader's Manual. This book, along with the accompanying participant's workbook (Ten Days to Self-esteem), will show you how to develop exciting short-term groups -- based on the principles in Feeling Good -- that will help people from all walks of life overcome depression and develop greater self-esteem and greater joy in daily living. Extensive pilot testing of this program reveals that the groups are suitable for high-functioning, sophisticated people with mild mood problems as well as for less educated people and those with severe- emotional difficulties. The groups can be conducted by mental health professionals in a variety of settings, including: hospitals and clinics day treatment programs high schools and universities corporations twelve-step programs as well as other self-help organizations churches and synagogues correctional facilities HMOs and EAPs This is a time of great challenge for mental health professionals because of severe cutbacks in funding for psychiatric and psychological services. HMOs and other managed health care providers are asking, ""Can you provide quality outpatient treatment in only a handful of sessions? Can you provide a meaningful and healing inpatient experience in a matter of days instead of weeks or months?"" This book reveals an entirely new, cost-effective model for helping the majority of people quickly and compassionately. This ten-session training program includes topics such as: ""The Price of Happiness"" (Step 1) ""How to Break Out of a Bad Mood"" (Step 4) ""Self-esteem -What Is It? How Do I Get It?"" (Step 7) ""The Perfectionist's Script for Self-defeat"" (Step 8) ""A Prescription for Procrastinators"" (Step 9) ""Self-esteem and Spirituality"" (Step 10) This Leader's Manual contains clear and detailed instructions for every session in the program. Even if you do not have extensive group experience, the manual will show you how to make your very first group a resounding success. As you develop the program, you will be breaking new ground for people suffering from depression, loneliness, anxiety, and addictions who wish to enrich their lives and feel good about themselves once again!",Self-Help,248,N/A,0,en
Mental Health Self-Help,"Louis D. Brown, Scott Wituk",Springer Science & Business Media,2010-08-05,"Building on earlier patient-empowerment movements, consumer- and advocate-driven mental health self-help (MHSH) initiatives currently outnumber traditional mental health organizations. At the same time, this apparent success raises significant questions about their short-term efficacy and their value to lasting recovery. Mental Health Self-Help assembles the state of the evidence on the effectiveness of MHSH, beginning with the individual and larger social factors behind the expansion of consumer-directed services. Clearly organized and accessibly written, the book traces the development and evolution of MHSH as both alternative and adjunct to traditional mental health structures, offers research-based perspectives on the various forms of MHSH, and identifies potential areas for consumer initiatives to work with—and help improve—mental health systems. Contributors weigh strengths and limitations, raise research and methodology questions, and discuss funding and training issues to give readers a deeper understanding of the field and an informed look at its future impact on mental health treatment. Individual chapters cover the spectrum of contemporary self-help initiatives in mental health, including: • Online mutual aid groups. • Consumer-run drop-in centers. • Family and caregiver groups. • Certified peer support specialists. • Consumer advocacy initiatives. • Technical assistance organizations. • Professional/self-help collaborations.

Self-Care Is Not Selfish,"Tasheka Cox, Tasheka N Cox Ed D",N/A,2019-10-22,"I wrote this book to help those of us who give so much to others, give something back to ourselves. As moms, wives, daughters, career women, friends, and everything else between, we don't always leave space for our own needs because we get so busy tending to everyone else's needs. Our families, friends, and society expect so much from us, but what happens when we find ourselves not having much else to give because we've already given out so much?I know the answer to this question because I have experienced firsthand the results of putting everyone else's needs in front of my own and getting caught up in the busyness of life. As a psychotherapist, a mom, a wife, a daughter, a sister, and a friend, I am always tending to someone else's needs. Don't get me wrong; I love all my roles, but sometimes they are exhausting, especially when I neglect my own needs in favor of taking care of those of others. Many women whom I encounter in personal and professional contexts are willing to drop everything to help someone who calls on them for assistance. They will do that even if it means giving up time, they had planned to spend doing something for themselves. Why is that? Do we get some badge of honor when we prioritize everyone else's needs before our own? Do we feel a sense of satisfaction when people compliment us for always being there for them? We bust our butts to make things happen for others and leave little time and energy to make something happen for ourselves. Prioritizing time for ourselves may sound a bit counterintuitive because many of us have been raised to be nurturers, givers, go-getters, and selfless with our time. Listen, I was raised the same way, so I get it. But at what personal cost are we expending all our energy on everyone and everything around us? I know that all this is easier said than done, but at some point, we have to say enough is enough and realize that self-care is NOT selfish! As a matter of fact, self-care is one of the most selfless things we can do for ourselves. Practicing self-care can be life-changing for women. We can't pour from empty cups. We can't give to others when we barely have enough to give to ourselves. I made this workbook because I wanted women to take part in their own self-care journeys. The journey in this workbook is broken into three sections. Section One will allow you to notice where you are on your self-care journey by doing a short self-assessment. After discovering where you are, Section Two will allow you to embark on a six-week self-care journey. Section Three will help you express how you feel about where you are on your journey and determine what you can do to stay on your journey by integrating self-care into your life.",,56,N/A,0,en

Thinking For Results,"Christian D Larson, Christian D. Larson",N/A,2023-12-05,"Thinking For Results is a book by American New Thought leader Christian D. Larson, first published in 1912. It is a short self-help book that encourages you to change your way of thinking in order to become more successful in life. Larson discusses various ways in which to do this, how people should keep a positive mind, have end goals in sight, live in accordance with natural laws, and accept that mental conceptions will improve with greater concentration on the good things in one's life. Man is as he thinks he is, and what he does is the result of the sum total of his thought. The average person, however, thinks at random and therefore lives at random and does not know from day to day whether good or evil lies in his path. What he finds in his path is invariably the result of his own thinking, but as he does not know what results different kinds of thought produce he creates both good and evil daily not knowing that he necessarily does either of these. When he knows what each mental state will produce, however, and has gained the power to think as he likes under all sorts of circumstances, then he will have fate, destiny, environment, physical conditions, mental conditions, attainments, achievements and in fact everything in his own hands. You never think scientifically unless you think for a purpose; it is therefore purposeless thinking that you must avoid. To train the mind to think only in the right states of mind we must learn to distinguish between right and wrong mental states, though this is a matter that becomes very simple when we understand that the difference between right and wrong states of mind is found in this, that the former tends to relate the mind properly to the laws, the principles and the powers of life, while the latter tends to prevent that relationship.",,0,N/A,0,en

The Science of Getting Rich,Wallace D Wattler,N/A,2017-08-17,"AUTHOR'S PREFACE This book is pragmatical, not philosophical; a practical manual, not a treatise upon theories. It is intended for the men and women whose most pressing need is for money; who wish to get rich first, and philosophize afterward. It is for those who have, so far, found neither the time, the means, nor the opportunity to go deeply into the study of metaphysics, but who want results and who are willing to take the conclusions of science as a basis for action, without going into all the processes by which those conclusions were reached. It is expected that the reader will take the fundamental statements upon faith, just as he would take statements concerning a law of electrical action if they were promulgated by a Marconi or an Edison; and, taking the statements upon faith, that he will prove their truth by acting upon them without fear or hesitation. Every man or woman who does this will certainly get rich; for the science herein applied is an exact science, and failure is impossible. For the benefit, however, of those who wish to investigate philosophical theories and so secure a logical basis for faith, I will here cite certain authorities. The monistic theory of the universe, the theory that One is All, and that All is One; That one Substance manifests itself as the seeming many elements of the material world -is of Hindu origin, and has been gradually winning its way into the thought of the western world for two hundred years. It is the foundation of all the Oriental philosophies, and of those of Descartes, Spinoza, Leibnitz, Schopenhauer, Hegel, and Emerson. The reader who would dig to the philosophical foundations of this is advised to read Hegel and Emerson for himself. In writing this book I have sacrificed all other considerations to plainness and simplicity of style, so that all might understand. The plan of action laid down herein was deduced from the conclusions of philosophy; it has been thoroughly tested, and bears the supreme test of practical experiment; it works. If you wish to know how the conclusions were arrived at, read the writings of the authors mentioned above; and if you wish to reap the fruits of their philosophies in actual practice, read this book and do exactly as it tells you to do.",,156,N/A,0,en

He draws on a survey of voluntary agencies helping disabled people in four welfare democracies (the United States, England, Israel, and the Netherlands) to explain the virtues and flaws of different patterns of government-voluntary relationships in coping with the growing demand for human services. Kramer concludes that many of the most cherished beliefs about the voluntary sector have little basis in fact. The most innovative agencies, for example, are not the smallest, but rather among the largest, most bureaucratized, and most professionalized. Government funding does not necessarily constrain agency autonomy. And giving voluntary agencies the primary responsibility for social services can reduce, not increase, citizen participation. This comparative analysis of the distinctive competence, vulnerability, and potential of the voluntary agency should replace some of the myths that guide public policy and the day-to-day activities of social service agencies.

Self-Help Books,Sandra K. Dolby,University of Illinois Press,2005-04-06,"Understanding instead of lamenting the popularity of self-help books Based on a reading of more than three hundred self-help books, Sandra K. Dolby examines this remarkably popular genre to define ""self-help"" in a way that's compelling to academics and lay readers alike. Self-Help Books also offers an interpretation of why these books are so popular, arguing that they continue the well-established American penchant for self-education, they articulate problems of daily life and their supposed solutions, and that they present their content in a form and style that is accessible rather than arcane. Using tools associated with folklore studies, Dolby then examines how the genre makes use of stories, aphorisms, and a worldview that is at once traditional and contemporary. The overarching premise of the study is that self-help books, much like fairy tales, take traditional materials, especially stories and ideas, and recast them into extended essays that people happily read, think about, try to apply, and then set aside when a new embodiment of the genre comes along.",Psychology,220,2.5,2,en

Individuation and Liberty in a Globalized World,Stefano Carpani,Taylor & Francis,2022-06-07,"What is the best way to understand the narratives of self-identity at the beginning of the 21st century? This interdisciplinary collection brings together perspectives from analytical psychology, sociology, psychiatry, psychosocial studies, and psychoanalysis to consider questions about individuation and freedom in our unhinged world. The contributors discuss the meaning of, and need for, individuation in individualized and liquid societies. The book begins with a comparison of three approaches: C.G. Jung’s individuation, Ulrich Beck’s individualization, and Zygmunt Bauman’s liquidity. This sets the tone for further consideration of topics including guilt, social media, global nomads, and surveillance. Theoretical reflections are enhanced by clinical material, and the book emphasizes the connections between sociology and psychoanalysis, offering significant insights into the importance of psychosocial approaches.

Theoretical Nursing,Afaf Ibrahim Meleis,Lippincott Williams & Wilkins,2011,"""An additional assumption was that the processes for theory development were new to nursing and hence, nurses in graduate programs learned strategies for advancing knowledge from other disciplines. This assumption was debunked with the knowledge that nurses were always engaged in knowledge development, driven by their experiences in clinical practice. Because of these assumptions, most of the early writing about theory development was about outlining strategies that should be used, rather than strategies that have already been used in the discipline to develop theories. Theorists themselves did not uncover or adequately discuss ways by which they developed their theories, therefore the tendency was to describe processes that were based on theories developed in other disciplines, mainly the physical and social sciences. And an implicit assumption was made that there should be a single strategy for theory development, some claiming to begin the process from practice, and others believing it should be driven by research""--Provided by publisher.",Medical,688,4,1,en

Contract Law in Electronic Commerce,Ralf Holthöfer,diplom.de,2001-01-31,"Inhaltsangabe:Abstract: This paper was written during my studies at Georgia State University, Atlanta in Fall 2000 in the context of an exchange program between Georgia State University and Technische Universität Darmstadt. Its subject is the new contract law in electronic commerce. The paper starts with an illustration of the situation of legal uncertainty prior to the establishment of a specific contract law in electronic commerce. Many laws governing contract formation were drafted before the existence of electronic messaging and did not adequately address the challenges of electronic transactions. Furthermore, electronic transactions were often hindered by the diversity of state laws. This situation was considered to place some severe legal obstacles to the development of electronic commerce. In 1997, President Clinton and Vice President Gore unveiled their Framework for Global Electronic Commerce. This issue defined the main goals for the future development of both domestic and global electronic commerce. The general objective was to establish a Uniform Commercial Code for this ascending sector of commerce in order to facilitate and enforce electronic transactions. The legislative efforts to achieve those goals recently resulted in two uniform acts, the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA), and the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-sign Act). The paper deals with these new legislative approaches. Aside from the presentation of the scopes of the different acts the paper focuses on their fundamental principles and major provisions. Furthermore, it discusses the new enactments in the context of a selection of fundamental legal issues raised by electronic commerce. This discussion finally shows that, although there have been a number of serious endeavors to achieve the above mentioned goals by drafting several electronic commerce statutes, the recent enactments relating to contract law in electronic commerce are not able to achieve the goals set out in the Framework for Global Electronic Commerce. There still remain significant legal obstacles that prohibit electronic commerce from reaching its full potential.

Every chapter is an original research essay written by a broad spectrum of scholars with expertise in the subject, providing an application of the most recent insights into analysis of particular topics or application of particular critical frameworks to one or more African literary works.

The intent of this book is to serve as a practical resource for professionals and also as a di dactic text for students. In addition,·the volume seeks to make a theoret ical contribution to the field by presenting, for the first time in book form, a behavioral-ecological perspective in community mental health. We present behavioral-ecology as an emerging perspective that is concerned with the interdependence of people, behavior, and their sociophysical environments. Behavioral-ecology attributes mental health problems to transactions between persons and their settings, rather than to causes rooted exclusively within individuals or environments. In this vol ume we advance the notion of behavioral-ecology as an integration of two broad perspectives--behauioral approaches as derived from the indi vidual psychology of learning, and ecological approaches as encompassing the study of communities, environments, and social systems. Through the programs brought together in this book we are arguing for a merging of these two areas for purposes of advancing theory, research, and prac tice in community mental health.",Psychology,521,N/A,0,en

Residential Environments,"Juan I. Aragones, Guido Francescato, Tommy Gärling",Praeger,2002,"Housing fulfills a basic human need for shelter. It protects us from the weather and from hostile intruders. Often it is an expression of personal identity and social status. A home is a major personal financial investment and housing is an important part of the economy. The home is also invested with profound psychological and social meaning. It helps meet our needs to feel rooted and to belong. It is a center of privacy, a refuge from the world, and at the same time the place where we interact with our family, friends, and acquaintances. As such the home is an important factor in personal and social development, particularly in childhood. Because of the complex role of housing in human life, residential environments are an important area of study in a wide variety of fields, including anthropology, architecture, economics, environmental design, geography, psychology, and sociology. The dwelling is the nucleus around which the discourse about residential environments is articulated, but it is not its only component. Residential environments also involve other elements such as the neighborhood, neighbors, and the larger urban community. This multidisciplinary study of residential environments conveys the complex nature of people's experiences with thier residences, neighborhoods, and communities.",Political Science,288,N/A,0,en

Brazil's Modern Architecture,"Elisabetta Andreoli, Adrian Forty",Phaidon Press Limited,2004,"Brazil's architecture is strikingly distinct from Latin America as a whole and diverse in itself. Yet coverage of the architecture of twentieth-century Brazil is all too often confined to the work of one man (Oscar Niemeyer) or the buildings of two cities (Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo). In Brazil's Modern Architecture, a new generation of Brazilian cities and historians sets the record straight, providing a truly comprehensive survey and analysis of twentieth-century Brazilian architecture. This tome embodies a vivid re-interpretation of Brazilian architecture throughout the course of the twentieth century: from the first modern houses of the 1920s and Le Corbusier's seminal visits to the country, through the well-known 'heroic' period of the 1940s-1950s to its post-1964 crisis, and up to contemporary developments. Works are examined from the 'inside' by explaining the cultural context that is crucial to a truly nuanced understanding of Brazilian architecture. With bold originality, this book clarifies the often paradoxical relation between Brazil's political, social and economic history and its architectural development. Transcending past convention, it identifies - with unprecedented insight - the momentous architectural breakthroughs of twentieth-century Brazil with its tumultuous historical life. Where previous studies saw disintegration, this volume illustrates the often unrecognized threads of continuity between the most recent architectural work and that of the high-Modernist era of the mid-century. Presented with elegant flair and argued with lively sophistication, Brazil's Modern Architecture is accessible and thought-provoking for the reader, and groundbreaking for the history of architecture.",Architecture,248,N/A,0,en

The Abcs of Self-Care,Sheri E. Betts,Balboa Press,2021-09-21,"Creating a happier, healthier, and more peaceful life is as simple as a-b-c with this practical and interactive guide to making self-care a lifestyle. In the same way that 26 letters can create an entire language, The ABCs of Self-Care offers an easy-to-follow alphabet of tools and techniques that can create an entirely new way of living, regardless of your starting point.

""For the last 20 years I've dedicated my personal and professional life to the importance of self-care by teaching from my own experience,"" writes Cheryl Richardson. ""In the past, I've sacrificed my health and my relationships for work, given to others at the expense of my own needs, and watched my dreams slip through the cracks of a busy life. As a result, I've learned a lot about what it takes to put an end to the madness. . . . From years of personal experience, as well as coaching great men and women, I've come to understand that selfishness leads to selflessness. When we care deeply for ourselves, we naturally begin to care for others - our families, our friends, our greater global community, and the environment - in a healthier and more effective way. We tell the truth. We make choices from love instead of guilt and obligation. And we soon realize that we're all connected and that our individual actions affect a greater whole.""

Chapters include ""End the Legacy of Deprivation,"" ""Find Your Passion,"" ""The Absolute No List,"" and ""Does That Anger Taste Good?"" (Hint: it really doesn't.)",Self-Help,138,5,1,en

The book Modeling and Simulation uses exactly the same approach except that the traditional mental model is translated into a computer model, and the simulations of alternative outcomes under varying conditions are programmed on the computer. The advantage of this method is that the computer can track the multitude of implications and consequences in complex relationships much more quickly and reliably than the human mind. This unique interdisciplinary text not only provides a self contained and complete guide to the methods and mathematical background of modeling and simulation software (SIMPAS) and a collection of 50 systems models on an accompanying diskette.

Tired as F*ck,Caroline Dooner,HarperCollins,2022-02-08,"Blending memoir and blistering social observations, the author of The F*ck It Diet looks back at her desperate attempts to heal her hunger, anxiety, and imperfections through extreme diets, culty self-help methods, and melodramatic bargains with the universe. Offering a frank and funny critique of the cultural forces that are driving us mad, Caroline Dooner examines how treating ourselves like never ending self-improvement projects is a recipe for burnout. We have become unknowingly complicit in perpetuating our own exhaustion because we are treating ourselves like machines. But even phones need to f*cking recharge. Caroline takes a good hard look at the dark side of self-help, and explains how she eventually used a radical period of rest to push back against cultural expectations and reclaim some peace. Tired As F*ck empowers us to say no to the things that exhaust us. It inspires us to carve out time to slow down, feel okay about doing less, and honor our humanity. This is not a self-help book, it’s a cautionary tale. It’s an honest look at the dogma of wellness and spiritual self-improvement culture and revels in the healing power of rest and letting shit go.",Psychology,278,N/A,0,en

"Yeah, No. Not Happening.",Karen Karbo,HarperCollins,2020-05-19,"The author of the acclaimed, bestselling In Praise of Difficult Women delivers a hilarious feminist manifesto that encourages us to reject “self-improvement” and instead learn to appreciate and flaunt our complex, and flawed, human selves. Why are we so obsessed with being our so-called best selves? Because our modern culture force feeds women lies designed to heighten their insecurities: “You can do it all—crush it at work, at home, in the bedroom, at PTA and at Pilates—and because you can, you should. We can show you how!” Karen Karbo has had enough. She’s taking a stand against the cultural and societal pressures, marketing, and media influences that push us to spend endless time, energy and money trying to “fix” ourselves—a race that has no finish line and only further increases our send of self-dissatisfaction and loathing. “Yeah, no, not happening,” is her battle cry. In this wickedly smart and entertaining book, Karbo explores how “self-improvery” evolved from the provenance of men to women. Recast as “consumers” in the 1920s, women, it turned out, could be seduced into buying anything that might improve not just their lives, but their sense of self-worth. Today, we smirk at Mad Men-era ads targeting 1950s housewives—even while savvy marketers, aided and abetted by social media “influencers,” peddle skin care “systems,” skinny tea, and regimens that promise to deliver endless happiness. We’re not simply seduced into dropping precious disposable income on empty promises; the underlying message is that we can’t possibly know what’s good for us, what we want, or who we should be. Calling BS, Karbo blows the lid off of this age-old trend and asks women to start embracing their awesomely imperfect selves. There is no one more dangerous than a woman who doesn’t care what anyone thinks of her. Yeah, No, Not Happening is a call to arms to build a posse of dangerous women who swear off self-improvement and its peddlers. A welcome corrective to our inner-critic, Karbo’s manifesto will help women restore their sanity and reclaim their self-worth.",Self-Help,238,N/A,0,en

Buy Yourself the F*cking Lilies,Tara Schuster,Hachette UK,2023-03-07,"By the time she was in her late twenties, Tara Schuster was a rising TV executive who had worked for The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and helped launch Key & Peele to viral superstardom. By all appearances, she had mastered being a grown-up. But beneath that veneer of success, she was a chronically anxious, self-medicating mess. No one knew that her road to adulthood had been paved with depression, anxiety, and shame, owing in large part to her minimally parented upbringing. She realized she'd hit rock bottom when she drunk-dialed her therapist pleading for help. Buy Yourself the F*cking Lilies is the story of Tara's path to re-parenting herself and becoming a 'ninja of self-love'. Through simple, daily rituals, Tara transformed her mind, body and relationships, and shows how to: * fake gratitude until you actually feel gratitude * excavate your emotional wounds and heal them with kindness * identify your self-limiting beliefs, kick them to the curb, and start living a life you choose * silence your inner frenemy and shield yourself from self-criticism * carve out time each morning to start your day empowered, inspired, and ready to rule * create a life you truly, totally f*cking LOVE This is the book Tara wished someone had given her and it is the book many of us desperately need: a candid, hysterical, addictively readable, practical guide to growing up (no matter where you are in life) and learning to love yourself in a non-throw-up-in-your-mouth-it's-so-cheesy way.",Self-Help,335,N/A,0,en

"Yeah, No. Not Happening",Karen Karbo,Harper Wave,2020-04-20,"The author of the acclaimed, bestselling In Praise of Difficult Women delivers a hilarious feminist manifesto that encourages us to reject ""self-improvement"" and instead learn to appreciate and flaunt our complex, and flawed, human selves. Why are we so obsessed with being our so-called best selves? Because our modern culture force feeds women lies designed to heighten their insecurities: ""You can do it all--crush it at work, at home, in the bedroom, at PTA and at Pilates--and because you can, you should. We can show you how!"" Karen Karbo has had enough. She's taking a stand against the cultural and societal pressures, marketing, and media influences that push us to spend endless time, energy and money trying to ""fix"" ourselves--a race that has no finish line and only further increases our send of self-dissatisfaction and loathing. ""Yeah, no, not happening,"" is her battle cry. In this wickedly smart and entertaining book, Karbo explores how ""self-improvery"" evolved from the provenance of men to women. Recast as ""consumers"" in the 1920s, women, it turned out, could be seduced into buying anything that might improve not just their lives, but their sense of self-worth. Today, we smirk at Mad Men-era ads targeting 1950s housewives--even while savvy marketers, aided and abetted by social media ""influencers,"" peddle skin care ""systems,"" skinny tea, and regimens that promise to deliver endless happiness. We're not simply seduced into dropping precious disposable income on empty promises; the underlying message is that we can't possibly know what's good for us, what we want, or who we should be. Calling BS, Karbo blows the lid off of this age-old trend and asks women to start embracing their awesomely imperfect selves. There is no one more dangerous than a woman who doesn't care what anyone thinks of her. Yeah, No, Not Happening is a call to arms to build a posse of dangerous women who swear off self-improvement and its peddlers. A welcome corrective to our inner-critic, Karbo's manifesto will help women restore their sanity and reclaim their self-worth.",Self-Help,240,N/A,0,en

Find Your F*ckyeah,Alexis Rockley,Chronicle Prism,2019-09-17,"A bold guide to finding your unique purpose and uncensored self, Find Your F*ckyeah disrupts today's warm, fuzzy brand of #selfcare and ""Just be you!"" personal growth trends, translating the hard science of happiness for a generation that speaks emoji. Despite everything society says, you are not a living brand, you do not have to have one passion/purpose/calling, and no amount of #selfcare is going to change your life. In Find Your F*ckyeah, Alexis Rockley uses guided scientific experiments and refreshing wit to prove why one-size-fits-all success formulas and trendy morning routines won't keep us happy—and shows us how to find what will. Rockley tackles the social programming and biological defaults that fuel our limiting beliefs head on, showing how they keep us trapped in a cycle of boredom, stress, and burnout. In our attempt to present a hireable, friendable, dateable, and acceptable version of ourselves to the world, we spend much of our lives unintentionally censoring who we really are—and in the process, shoving what we truly want deep into our subconscious. For anyone tired of feeling the pressure to be better, do more, and work faster to find happiness—to self-optimize, shut up, and fit in—Find Your F*ckyeah offers the tools to finally take our lives off autopilot and find joy where we're at, right now. A must-read if any of this sounds like you: • You regularly bounce back and forth between boredom and stress, only to level out at a vegetative, exhausted state • You find yourself annoyed that your time isn't your own because you're busy making a living • You like having time to yourself, but hate being alone without an Internet connection • You sometimes feel confident in the life choices you've made (i.e., education, career, relationships), but you can't help feeling like where you're ""at"" in life is somehow. not enough • You want practical advice on how to be happier, but you're annoyed by the vague, generic advice of traditional self-help books",Self-Help,0,N/A,0,en

The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck,Mark Manson,HarperCollins,2016-09-13,"#1 New York Times Bestseller Over 10 million copies sold In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be ""positive"" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people. For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. ""F**k positivity,"" Mark Manson says. ""Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it."" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—""not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault."" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.",Self-Help,197,4,17,en

Summary,Essentialinsight Summaries,N/A,2019-10-29,"""No matter where you go, there's a five-hundred-pound load of shit waiting for you. And that's perfectly fine. The point isn't to get away from the shit. The point is to find the shit you enjoy dealing with."" - Mark Manson Summary of The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life by Mark Manson Mark Manson's book The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck shares his counterintuitive approach for obtaining a good life. The principles presented are not the typical self-help ideas. Instead, he proposes that prioritizing what is important and giving less thought to everything else can actually lead to a more fulfilling and healthier life. What to take from this book? The key to being happy in life is not avoiding pain. In reality, Manson contends that it involves embracing pain and learning how to deal with it. Happiness also pertains to choosing what to truly care about and narrowing one's focus on what matters most.

If you're tired of the wishful thinking approach and want to seriously fix your attitude, outlook, and mindset, you've picked up the right book.

The seven steps covered in this book are backed by two things you can't live without: science and common sense. Each one is an effective means to a more positive outlook and is guaranteed to show results. The only catch? You have to put up with my positive but cheeky attitude to learn what they are.

Tinnitus,"David M. Baguley, Marc Fagelson",Plural Publishing,2015-11-20,"Tinnitus: Clinical and Research Perspectives summarizes contemporary findings from basic and clinical research regarding tinnitus mechanisms, effects, and interventions. The text features a collection of international authors, active researchers, and clinicians who provide an expansive scope of material that ensures relevance for patients and professionals. Reviews and reports of contemporary research findings underscore the text's value for classroom use in audiology and otolaryngology programs. Patients and students of audiology will benefit from the text's coverage of tinnitus mechanisms, emerging practice considerations, and expectations for outcomes--for example, recent successes of cognitive behavioral therapy, neuromodulation, and hearing aid use. These and other topics, such as the effects of noise and drugs on tinnitus, are reported in a way that enhances clinicians' ability to weave such strategies into their own work. The influence of tinnitus on all aspects of life is explored, from art to medicine and communication to isolation, thereby providing clinicians and patients a deeper understanding of and greater facility managing a tinnitus experience. Finally, this text includes case studies that provide a practical view of tinnitus effects and management approaches. The editors hope that the consideration of mechanisms, interventions, and outcomes resonates with patients, clinicians, and students of audiology. Chapters such as Tinnitus in Literature, Film, and Music make clear the ubiquity of the tinnitus experience and reinforce for patients that while tinnitus may be isolating, it is a shared experience. Other chapters, such as Musical Hallucination, andAcoustic Shock, address problems experienced by patients who experience not only tinnitus, but unusual auditory system behaviors that may be confused with tinnitus, or that can exacerbate a patients emotional response to tinnitus. Chapters covering conditions that complicate tinnitus management provide clinical findings that support intervention strategies. Subtypes of tinnitus that require medical attention are reviewed in order to clarify sources of the sounds, as well as the appropriate referrals that should follow the identification of such sensations.",Medical,385,N/A,0,en

Frost, Gail Steketee",N/A,2014,"Hoarding involves the acquisition of and inability to discard large numbers of possessions that clutter the living area of the person collecting them. It becomes a disorder when the behavior causes significant distress or interferes with functioning. Hoarding can interfere with activities of daily living (such as being able to sit in chairs or sleep in a bed), work efficiency, family relationships, as well as health and safety. Hoarding behavior can range from mild to life-threatening. Epidemiological findings suggest that hoarding occurs in 2-6% of the adult population, making it two to three times more common than obsessive-compulsive disorder. The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) now includes Hoarding Disorder as a distinct disorder within the OCD and Related Anxiety Disorders section, creating a demand for information about it. The Oxford Handbook of Hoarding and Acquiring is the first volume to detail the empirical research on hoarding. Including contributions from all of the leading researchers in the field, this comprehensive volume is divided into four sections in addition to introductory and concluding chapters by the editors: Phenomenology, Epidemiology, and Diagnosis; Etiology; Assessment and Intervention; and Hoarding in Special Populations. The summaries of research and clinical interventions contained here clarify the emotional and behavioral features, diagnostic challenges, and nature of the treatment interventions for this new disorder. This handbook will be a critical resource for both practitioners and researchers, including psychiatrists, psychologists, neurologists, epidemiologists, social workers, occupational therapists, and other health and mental health professionals who encounter clients with hoarding problems in their practice and research.",Medical,433,N/A,0,en

A Terrible Thing to Waste,David Hamilton Golland,University Press of Kansas,2024-08-08,"Arthur Fletcher (1924–2005) was the most important civil rights leader you've (probably) never heard of. The first black player for the Baltimore Colts, the father of affirmative action and adviser to four presidents, he coined the United Negro College Fund's motto: ""A Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Waste."" Modern readers might be surprised to learn that Fletcher was also a Republican. Fletcher's story, told in full for the first time in this book, embodies the conundrum of the post–World War II black Republican—the civil rights leader who remained loyal to the party even as it abandoned the principles he espoused. The upward arc of Fletcher's political narrative begins with his first youthful protest—a boycott of his high school yearbook—and culminates with his appointment as assistant secretary of Labor under Richard Nixon. The Republican Party he embraced after returning from the war was ""the Party of Lincoln""—a big tent, truly welcoming African Americans. A Terrible Thing to Waste shows us those heady days, from Brown v. Board of Education to Fletcher's implementing of the Philadelphia Plan, the first major national affirmative action initiative. Though successes and accomplishments followed through successive Republican administrations—as chair of the US Commission on Civil Rights under George H. W. Bush, for example, Fletcher's ability to promote civil rights policy eroded along with the GOP's engagement, as New Movement Conservatism and Nixon's Southern Strategy steadily alienated black voters. The book follows Fletcher to the bitter end, his ideals and party in direct conflict and his signature achievement under threat. In telling Fletcher's story, A Terrible Thing to Waste brings to light a little known chapter in the history of the civil rights movement—and with it, insights especially timely for a nation so dramatically divided over issues of race and party.",Political Science,408,N/A,0,en

Mental Health in the Digital Age,"Dr Elias Aboujaoude, Dr Vladan Starcevic",Oxford University Press,2015-04-01,"The Internet and related technologies have reconfigured every aspect of life, including mental health. Although the negative and positive effects of digital technology on mental health have been debated, all too often this has been done with much passion and few or no supporting data. In Mental Health in the Digital Age, Elias Aboujaoude and Vladan Starcevic have edited a book that brings together distinguished experts from around the world to review the evidence relating to this area. The first part of the book addresses threats resulting from the growing reliance on, and misuse of, digital technology; it also looks at how some problematic behaviors and forms of psychopathology have been shaped by this technology. This section reviews problematic Internet and video game use, effects of violent video games on the levels of aggression and of online searches for health-related information on the levels of health anxiety, use of digital technology to harm other people, and promotion of suicide on the Internet. The second part of Mental Health in the Digital Age examines the ways in which digital technology has boosted efforts to help people with mental health problems. These include the use of computers, the Internet, and mobile phones to educate and provide information necessary for psychiatric treatment and to produce programs for psychological therapy, as well as use of electronic mental health records to improve care. Mental Health in the Digital Age is a unique and timely book because it examines comprehensively an intersection between digital technology and mental health and provides a state-of-the-art, evidence-based, and well-balanced look at the field. The book is a valuable resource and guide to an area often shrouded in controversy, as it is a work of critical thinking that separates the hype from the facts and offers data-driven conclusions. It is of interest particularly to mental health professionals, but also to general audience.",Medical,305,N/A,0,en

Guide for Advanced Nursing Care of the Adult with Congenital Heart Disease,"Serena Francesca Flocco, Hajar Habibi, Federica Dellafiore, Christina Sillman",Springer Nature,2022-12-01,"The aim of this book is to provide one central resource for nurses within the adult spectrum of life-long congenital heart disease care who are seeking expert guidance for their practice, regardless of clinical setting. Over the past 50 years, advances in surgical techniques and medical therapies have drastically improved the number of congenital heart disease patients surviving into adulthood, with the result being that there are now more adults then children living with congenital heart disease. In the past three decades, recognition of this new cardiology subspecialty has given way to formalized programs, standards of care, and multidisciplinary expertise. Indeed Nursing care of adult patients with congenital heart disease (ACHD) is a relatively new medical subspecialty with limited knowledge and guidance available and also an important component of the multidisciplinary care team. Nursing care of the ACHD encompasses a holistic approach to the physical, psychological, social, and spiritual wellbeing of these unique individuals across their lifespan. Understanding the intricacies for the various heterogeneous defect types, the transition from pediatric to adult care, the unique educational and self-care needs, life-events such as pregnancy/reproduction, advanced heart failure, and end-of-life care helps prepare the nurse caring for the ACHD patient. Nurses as a first point of care for the ACHD patients play a pivotal role in the education and empowerment of the ACHD patient population and provide an invaluable role in the multidisciplinary team and with this guide nurses can feel confident in the quality of the care they provide. This book aims to introduce nursing focused care to wider audiences, nurses, medical technicians, and physicians who are involved in the management and treatment of ACHD patients. Improving care and the quality of life for adult congenital heart disease patients with a multidisciplinary team-based approach, including nursing care, should be a central goal for all ACHD programs.",Medical,325,N/A,0,en

Annual Review of Cybertherapy and Telemedicine 2012,"B.K. Wiederhold, G. Riva",IOS Press,2012-09-14,"Healthcare delivery systems have evolved greatly in recent years thanks to technological advances. Shifts in care, diagnosis and treatment have decreased the importance of traditional methods of care delivery and new ways have been developed to monitor and treat heart disease, inflammation and infection, cancer, diabetes and other chronic conditions. Monitoring techniques, in combination with imaging and telemetrics, can provide real-time, continuous evaluation of many conditions, and technology has not only helped to extend our lifespan but has contributed to an improved quality of life for all citizens. This book examines and summarizes current and emerging trends in cybertherapy. It is divided into five main sections: critical reviews; evaluation studies; original research; clinical observations; and work in progress. The book underlines the progress cybertherapy has made in treating a variety of disorders; it also explores the challenges still to be faced, including the development of easy-to-use and more affordable hardware and software, as well as objective measurement tools. It also highlights the need to address potential side effects, and the importance of implementing more controlled studies to evaluate the strength of cybertherapy in comparison to traditional therapies, and will be of interest to all those involved in the delivery of healthcare today.",Medical,364,1,1,en

Sample Book Insights: #1 Binge eating is when a person eats large amounts of food in a short period of time. It is a major problem for many people, and not just those in the Western world. #2 The meaning of the word binge has changed over the years. It has been in common use since the mid-nineteenth century when it meant chiefly a heavy drinking bout, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. However, today dictionaries often define a binge in terms of overeating. #3 People often describe a feeling of altered consciousness during a binge. They feel as if they are in a trance, and their behavior seems almost automatic. They eat quickly and dry out the food by drinking a lot of water. #4 The typical binge is done in secret. Some people are so ashamed of their binge eating that they go to great lengths to hide it, including by eating in a relatively normal manner when they are with others.",Health & Fitness,42,N/A,0,en

Self Help Books,Vic Johnson,N/A,2012-07-01,"Reviews: ""Pay attention to him and his material, you will be glad you did."" Bob Proctor, best-selling author and star of The Secret. Description: It's vitally important that you read books. As Mark Twain wrote, ""The man who does not read good books has no advantage over the man who cannot read them."" And many would agree that ""personal development"" books are the ones to focus on if you're trying to improve yourself, your position in life and your quality of life. But which ones should you read? There are tens of thousands to choose from. Vic Johnson, a veteran personal development author, speaker and trainer, answers that question for us in ""Self Help Books: The 101 Best Personal Development Classics."" From an 1,100 page ""encyclopedia of success"" to a 28-page speech that became a classic more than a hundred years ago, Vic identifies the publication dates of the classics, the major theme(s) of the book and then some solid reasons to add them to your reading list. Along the way he also shares valuable anecdotes on his personal lessons learned from these authors (some of whom have mentored him). This is quick and easy reading that takes the guesswork out of choosing the books to add to your library as well as helping you prioritize your reading.",,92,N/A,0,en

Self-Help (llustrated),Samuel Smiles,Laurus - Lexecon Kft.,2011,"A bestseller immediately after its publication in 1859, Self-Help propelled its author to fame and rapidly became one of Victorian Britain's most important statements on the allied virtues of hard work, thrift, and perseverance. Interpreted by some as a paean to personal avarice, Smiles's most celebrated book is in fact a practical and engaging tribute to the working- and lower-middle classes, in whom he identified the capacity for self-improvement and for whom he tirelessly advocated the right of social advancement. Part practical guide, part proverbial testament, part secular hagiography, this literary hybrid turns biography into an inspirational medium that awakens the reader to their own potential and instills the desire to succeed. Smiles's book is the precursor of today's motivational and self-help literature, although its vision is significantly more cosmopolitan than that of most books in an ever-expanding genre.",Self-Help,358,N/A,0,en

We must have an experience of what we cannot do in order to break through to what we can. It is in the crisis of our inability to do anything, or at least not enough, that we experience, for perhaps the first time, an ability that is ""beyond us."" We find ourselves doing ""more than we ever dreamed we could."" It is also the area where religion begins. And that is the second thesis of the book -- namely, that in the critical experiences we all face, religion can happen. We can be ""boound back"" to who we are, which is what the word religion means at its root. We can be whole. Religion is for achievers, which is why so many business and labor and political and professional people in America are currently intrigued by religion. - Preface.",Religion,146,N/A,0,en

Helping Yourself Help Others,Rosalynn Carter,University of Arkansas Press,2023-07-17,"“A practical, highly informative, and sympathetic guide.” —The Washington Post Most of us will become a caregiver at some point in our lives. And we will assume this role for the most personal reason imaginable: wanting to help someone we love. But we may not know where to start, and we may be afraid of losing ourselves in this daunting task. Former first lady Rosalynn Carter, a longtime advocate for caregivers and mental health, knows firsthand the challenges of this labor of love. Drawing upon her own experiences and those of hundreds of others whose stories she gathered over many decades, Mrs. Carter offers reassuring, practical advice to any caregiver who has faced stress, anxiety, or loneliness. Helping Yourself Help Others, reissued here with a new foreword, is as relevant as ever.

"Caring for You, Caring for Me","David H. Haigler, Kathryn B. Mims, Jack A. Nottingham",University of Georgia Press,1998,"Caring for persons with chronic illnesses or disabilities is a rewarding endeavor, but it often places extreme demands on those providing care. Caregivers need both education and support to understand their caregiving roles and to cope with the difficult situations they face. All too often there is a chasm between professionals who are part of the formal caregiving system and family members, friends, and neighbors who provide daily care. The Caring for You, Caring for Me education and support program is a valuable tool for use in providing caregivers with education and support. The program is designed to bring formal (professional) and informal (lay/family) caregivers together to gain a better understanding of each other's perspectives on what it means to be a caregiver, with the hope that in the process both will learn to do it better. The program is based on caregiving research and the expertise of frontline caregivers. The Leader's Guide contains everything needed to conduct a ten-hour education and support program for caregivers: informational content, layouts for overhead transparencies, and suggested group activities. The companion Participant's Manual supports the presentation, providing a workbook for class activities, a suggested reading list, and a compendium of national sources of help for caregivers. Caring for You, Caring for Me was developed by the Rosalynn Carter Institute under the guidance of the West Central Georgia Caregivers' Network (CARE-NET). The Rosalynn Carter Institute was established in 1987. Its mission is to understand the process of caregiving and discover new ways to benefit both formal and informal caregivers. The Institute supports the premise that caregivers and care receivers can be served most effectively through the collaborative efforts of formal and informal caregivers, academicians, public and private services, and organizations representing caregivers and recipients of care.",Medical,112,N/A,0,en

Bowling Alone: Revised and Updated,Robert D. Putnam,Simon and Schuster,2001-08-01,"Once we bowled in leagues, usually after work -- but no longer. This seemingly small phenomenon symbolizes a significant social change that Robert Putnam has identified in this brilliant volume, Bowling Alone, which The Economist hailed as ""a prodigious achievement."" Drawing on vast new data that reveal Americans' changing behavior, Putnam shows how we have become increasingly disconnected from one another and how social structures -- whether they be PTA, church, or political parties -- have disintegrated. Until the publication of this groundbreaking work, no one had so deftly diagnosed the harm that these broken bonds have wreaked on our physical and civic health, nor had anyone exalted their fundamental power in creating a society that is happy, healthy, and safe. Like defining works from the past, such as The Lonely Crowd and The Affluent Society, and like the works of C. Wright Mills and Betty Friedan, Putnam's Bowling Alone has identified a central crisis at the heart of our society and suggests what we can do.",History,592,N/A,0,en

In Pathways through Crisis, he draws on his two decades of work in ethnography and with crisis centers in the Los Angeles area to study the kinds of informal organizations that arise at the grass-roots level in order to deal with severe crises. This ground-breaking examination of responses to urban disaster suggests how both informal and formal organizations can be developed to serve people under extreme duress.",Social Science,281,N/A,0,en

Integrative Rheumatology,"Randy Horwitz M.D., Daniel Muller M.D.",Oxford University Press,2010-10-12,"Integrative Rheumatology offers a new and much-needed perspective in disease and symptom management, blending conventional medicine with alternative approaches not typically included in a Western medical practice. While conventional treatments can provide considerable symptomatic relief and can even slow the progression of many rheumatologic conditions, integrative treatment incorporating lifestyle interventions, mind-body approaches, and practices such as acupuncture and meditation into conventional medical therapies can improve quality of life, reduce medication dosages, and are generally better tolerated. In this book, researchers and clinicians highlight specific gaps in conventional rheumatologic care and examine how alternative approaches may be ideally suited to address these missed opportunities. Here, the authors introduce topics not typically addressed in conventional rheumatology texts, including nutritional therapies, exercise, herbal medicine, mind/body approaches, Ayurveda, and energy medicine. The contributors, all of whom have a background in academic medicine, share the approaches that they have found most effective in their own practices, basing their work on the best scientific evidence available. Ultimately, an understanding of complementary and alternative approaches to healing can help clinicians care for their patients using the best proven therapies to modify disease progress and relieve pain and disability.",Medical,375,N/A,0,en

Planning Ideas That Matter,"Bishwapriya Sanyal, Lawrence J. Vale, Christina D. Rosan",MIT Press,2012-07-06,"Leading theorists and practitioners trace the evolution of key ideas in urban and regional planning over the last hundred years Over the past hundred years of urbanization and suburbanization, four key themes have shaped urban and regional planning in both theory and practice: livability, territoriality, governance, and reflective professional practice. Planning Ideas That Matter charts the trajectories of these powerful planning ideas in an increasingly interconnected world. The contributors, leading theorists and practitioners, discuss livability in terms of such issues as urban density, land use, and the relationship between the built environment and natural systems; examine levels of territorial organization, drawing on literature on regionalism, metropolitanism, and territorial competition; describe the ways planning connects to policy making and implementation in a variety of political contexts; and consider how planners conceive of their work and learn from practice. Throughout, the emphasis is on how individuals and institutions—including government, business, professional organizations, and universities—have framed planning problems and ideas. The focus is less on techniques and programs than on the underlying concepts that have animated professional discourse over the years. The book is recommended for classroom use, as a reference for scholars and practitioners, and as a history of planning for those interested in the development of the field.",Architecture,433,N/A,0,en

Hawkeye Pierce, Radar O'Reilly, Trapper John McIntyre, Sherman Potter, Margaret (Hot Lips) Houlihan, B.J. Hunnicutt, Frank Burns, Charles Emerson Winchester, Max Klinger--these and the many other characters who populated the MASH 4077 used the Korean War as a backdrop to comment on many of the social issues of their day. Using a unique blend of comedy and drama, the show's first three seasons (1972-1975) focused on the anti-Vietnam War sentiment that consumed much of America. As Vietnam ended, M*A*S*H moved on to concentrate on other contemporary issues--the women's movement, the rise of the religious right in American politics, the new narcissism that marked the early 1980s, the heightened awareness of underage or excessive alcohol use, and the increased emphasis on family in American life.

The Routledge International Handbook of Global Therapeutic Cultures,"Daniel Nehring, Ole Jacob Madsen, Edgar Cabanas, China Mills, Dylan Kerrigan",Routledge,2020-08-24,"The Routledge International Handbook of Global Therapeutic Cultures explores central lines of enquiry and seminal scholarship on therapeutic cultures, popular psychology, and the happiness industry. Bringing together studies of therapeutic cultures from sociology, anthropology, psychology, education, politics, law, history, social work, cultural studies, development studies, and American Indian studies, it adopts a consciously global focus, combining studies of the psychologisation of social life from across the world. Thematically organised, it offers historical accounts of the growing prominence of therapeutic discourses and practices in everyday life, before moving to consider the construction of self-identity in the context of the diffusion of therapeutic discourses in connection with the global spread of capitalism. With attention to the ways in which emotional language has brought new problematisations of the dichotomy between the normal and the pathological, as well as significant transformations of key institutions, such as work, family, education, and religion, it examines emergent trends in therapeutic culture and explores the manner in which the advent of new therapeutic technologies, the political interest in happiness, and the radical privatisation and financialisation of social life converge to remake self-identities and modes of everyday experience. Finally, the volume features the work of scholars who have foregrounded the historical and contemporary implication of psychotherapeutic practices in processes of globalisation and colonial and postcolonial modes of social organisation. Presenting agenda-setting research to encourage interdisciplinary and international dialogue and foster the development of a distinctive new field of social research, The Routledge International Handbook of Global Therapeutic Cultures will appeal to scholars across the social sciences with interests in the advance of therapeutic discourses and practices in an increasingly psychologised society.",Psychology,446,N/A,0,en

It helps readers better understand the process of change and the role of the environment in creating change. Insightful chapters encourage practitioners, scholars, and students to plan change in organizations, utilize models of change and organizational development in real life, and evaluate change and its results and impacts. This much-needed book addresses a variety of topics, including: the uses of force field analysis in assessing prospects for organizational change planned change in voluntary and government social service agencies interorganizational coordination of services to children in state custody early stages in the creation of self-help organizations organization and community transformation organizational development in public social services strategic and structural change in human service organizations a developmental approach to program evaluation Many readers will find the information in Organizational Change and Development in Human Service Organizations to be extremely beneficial in their daily work.

The Anorexia Workbook,"Michelle Heffner, Georg H. Eifert",New Harbinger  Publications,2004-05-01,"Statistics suggests that as many as 2.5 percent of American women suffer from anorexia; of these, further research indicates that one in ten of these will die from the disorder. This is the only book available that addresses the particular needs of anorexics with the techniques of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), a revolutionary new psychotherapy. The authors of this book are pioneering researchers in the field of ACT, with numerous research articles to their credit Despite ever-widening media attention and public awareness of the problem, American women continue to suffer from anorexia nervosa in greater numbers than ever before. This severe psychophysiological condition-characterized by an abnormal fear of becoming obese, a persistent unwillingness to eat, and severe compulsion to lose weight-is particularly difficult to treat, often because the victims are unwilling to seek help. The Anorexia Workbook demonstrates that efforts to control and stop anorexia may do more harm than good. Instead of focusing efforts on judging impulses associated with the disorder as 'bad' or 'negative,' this approach encourages sufferers to mindfully observe these feelings without reacting to them in a self-destructive way. Guided by this more compassionate, more receptive frame of mind, the book coaches you to employ various acceptance-based coping strategies. Structured in a logical, step-by-step progression of exercises, the workbook first focuses on providing you with a new understanding of anorexia and the ways you might have already tried to control the problem. Then the book progresses through techniques that teach how to use mindfulness to deal with out-of-control thoughts and feelings, how to identify choices that lead to better heath and quality of life, and how to redirect the energy formerly spent on weight loss into actions that will heal the body and mind. Although this book is written specifically as self-help for anorexia sufferers, it includes a clear and informative chapter on when you need to seek professional treatment as well as advice on what to look for in a therapist.",Self-Help,210,N/A,0,en

Ever wonder why some people are smart and others not? The perception of intelligence is what truly matters sometimes. Some people will benefit from the impression they make on others, when others perceive them as intelligent, whilst others will be intelligent, yet others will not perceive them as so, and they will suffer. The real question should be: 'How do I make myself seem intelligent as a gifted genius?' The answer is: 'By learning how to instantly memorize anything and be able to recall it at will anytime you must!' Pain is a more complicated phenomenon than most people realize, one that involves the body and the mind. Certainly most of us understand that pain begins with an external or internal stimulus, such as touching a hot stove or tearing a muscle. The body recognizes this stimulus and transfers the information along fibres to the brain, where it is recognized as pain and then felt as an unpleasant sensation. However, science also tells us that pain is not only about these sensations and the physical processes, but also that there is a level of psychology involved.",Self-Help,202,N/A,0,en

In order to attract a life partner and build a healthy intimate relationship, you must first become a good partner to yourself. This book offers twenty invaluable lessons that will help you explore and commit to your own emotional and psychological well-being so you can be ready, resilient, and confident in love. Many of us enter into romantic relationships full of expectation and hope, only to be sorely disappointed by the realization that the partner we’ve selected is a flawed human being with their own neuroses, history, and desires. Most relationships end because one or both people haven’t done the internal work necessary to develop self-awareness and take responsibility for their own experiences. We’ve all heard “You can’t love anyone unless you love yourself,” but amid life’s distractions and the myth of perfect, romantic love, how exactly do you do that? In Loving Bravely, psychologist, professor and relationship expert Alexandra H. Solomon introduces the idea of relational self-awareness, encouraging you to explore your personal history to gain an understanding of your own relational patterns, as well as your strengths and weaknesses in relationships. By doing so, you’ll learn what relationships actually require, beyond the fairytale notions of romance. And by maintaining a steady but gentle focus on yourself, you’ll build the best possible foundation for making a loving connection. By understanding your past relationship experiences, cultivating a strong sense of self-awareness, and determining what it is you really want in a romantic partner—you’ll be ready to find the healthy, lasting love your heart desires.",Family & Relationships,250,N/A,0,en

Self-help in America,Alfred Hyman Katz,Twayne Publishers,1993,"""By its very definition, self-help suggests a person's autonomous effort to solve a problem. Yet, as Alfred H. Katz argues in this sociohistorical introduction to the self-help culture, what links America's diverse self-help organizations is the shared belief that the group experience itself allows the individual to work through his or her problem and live a normal life."" ""Taking personal testimonials in tandem with scholarly research, Katz analyzes what he calls the ""phenomenon"" of self-help in the United States, where possibly as many as 730,000 such groups with at least 10 to 15 million members currently operate. That programs managed by human-services professionals and agencies have failed to address particular public needs is attested to by the rapid rate at which self-help groups have been forming over the last 20 years, according to Katz. Although Katz uses social movement criteria in looking at why and how self-help groups work, he notes that the huge diversity among such groups and their lack of a unifying political force renders the description social trend more accurate."" ""To highlight the respective characteristics of the two main types of self-help groups, 12-step and non-12-step, Katz compares a successful example of the former - Adult Children of Alcoholics - with one of the latter - the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill. The ideology of Alcoholics Anonymous - that personal change can only be achieved through spiritual belief or conversion, as reflected in its listing of the 12 steps members must take toward recovery from addiction - is where the first category gets its name. This type of group's near-universal meeting format and rituals, and its refrain from engaging in any sociopolitical activity, stands in marked contrast to non-12-step groups, which do not expect their members to pursue a phased path of personal growth and change and whose structures vary considerably."" ""In addition to exploring the leadership, ideology, and growth patterns of both types of groups, Katz looks at the populist tendencies among non-12-step groups that prompt members to take social action to shape public policy. One of the most controversial issues in self-help - to what degree human-services professionals should be involved in a particular group, if in fact at all - Katz addresses in a thorough and unbiased manner. Likewise, he fairly considers the potential effectiveness of government involvement in U.S. self-help groups by comparing the situations of Canada, Great Britain, and Germany."" ""Katz concludes this clear and concise overview of self-help by returning to the question of whether this collective behavior - however diverse its motivating forces - constitutes a social movement. As a social scientist, however, Katz finds the theoretical question of self-help secondary to the fact that the success of such groups holds the promise of a better social life for the world's billions of people.""--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Building Self-Confidence with Encouraging Words,"Judy H. Wright - Life Educator, Judy H. Wright",Totalrecall Publication Incorporated,2009-02-01,"Self-Help / Personal Growth / Parenting Words can be deadly weapons or protective layers of love. They can bruise and batter a person, no matter how old, in the heart and spirit just like physical blows can cause damage to the outside of the body. Because these bruises to the spirit are not readily apparent, many think that the damage is easily repaired. However, while verbal abuse may be long forgotten or dismissed by the offender, the words and memory are lodged in the cells and memory of the child or person who was emotionally assaulted.

Sometimes they forget that the most effective teaching method is to model behavior. Do it for them and their future. Start your journey today Build your self-confidence and become all that you were meant to be! Author Judy H. Wright Judy is a parent educator, family coach, and personal historian who has written more than 20 books, hundreds of articles and speaks internationally on family issues, including end of life. She works with Head Start organizations and child care resource centers. The symbol of the artichoke has great meaning for Judy in her teaching and writing. As she works with families, she sees that frequently only the outer edges are exposed and they can be prickly and sometimes bitter to the taste. But, as you expose the artichoke and people to warmth, caring, and time, gradually the leaves begin to open and expose the real treasure-the heart. The artichoke also became a teaching lesson when Judy, with her young family, moved into military housing in California to find Artichokes in their yard. Given that it takes two years for the vegetable to flower, the original gardener never got to see the seeds of her labor. Many times, our actions and reactions in life are felt by people we will never meet, but we plant the seeds of kindness anyway. You will enjoy Judy's approachable manner, wonderful storytelling andcommon-sense solutions gleaned from working with hundreds of families and organizations just like yours. Your encounter with Judy will leave you feeling inspired, entertained and especially motivated.",Self-Help,204,N/A,0,en

The Jael Finishing School for Ladies,Jaime Hope McArdle,"Christian Faith Publishing, Inc.",2021-10-06,"Inspired by the story of Jael and Deborah in the book of Judges, Jaime Hope McArdle shares her personal journey to a life of purpose and freedom through finding identity as a daughter of the Creator King. She takes on the old stories and passages of the Bible with fresh eyes asking how they impact her life today and challenges her readers to consider becoming freedom fighters-beginning in their own lives and then becoming a force for transformation in the world around them. With chapters titled ""A Danger to the Gates of Hell"" and ""Freedom Fighter,"" Jaime uncovers the spiritual battle raging under the surface in the world around us and challenges women to reconsider what being in prison looks like and to find the courage to try the door because it cannot be locked. In ""The Healing"" and ""Daughter of a King,"" she walks through revelation of a true identity that is the right of every woman who will ""Choose This Day."" This new identity defies the cultural norms for women with ""The Greatest Love of All"" and calls women to see their power is not in becoming more like men or in manipulation through sexuality. She encourages the power to change the ""Operating Systems"" that directs everyday life and challenges to accept a new ""Assignment"" to see life as a daily adventure to bringing love, forgiveness, grace, and freedom to a world growing darker each year. Finally, the assurance of ""Getting It Wrong"" to know the promise that God will have his way. And as we attempt to follow his call on our life, we can make mistakes and learn. In our triumphs and failures, his grace brings all things together for our good.

Chained to the Desk in a Hybrid World,Bryan E. Robinson,NYU Press,2023-05-02,"A step-by-step guide to reestablishing work-life balance Americans love a hard worker. The employee who toils eighteen-hour days and eats meals on the run between appointments is usually viewed with a combination of respect and awe. But for many, this lifestyle leads to family problems, a decline in work productivity, and, ultimately, physical and mental burnout. Intended for anyone touched by what Robinson calls “the best-dressed problem of the twenty-first century,” Chained to the Desk in a Hybrid World provides an inside look at the impact of work stress on those who live and work with workaholics—partners, spouses, children, and colleagues—as well as the appropriate techniques for clinicians who treat them. This groundbreaking book builds on the research included in three previous editions of Chained to the Desk from the best-selling author and widely respected family therapist Bryan E. Robinson. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of working from home, Robinson finds that the agonies of work stress have only become more challenging. Recent years have seen an unprecedented shift to remote work, which has made it significantly harder to maintain the already delicate work-life balance, weakened as it is by smartphones and other technology. The result is that many workaholics are more stressed and burnt out than ever before in their work, despite being constantly in the presence of family. Chained to the Desk in a Hybrid World both counsels and consoles. It provides a step-by-step guide to help readers spot, understand, and ultimately recover from workaholism.",Psychology,247,N/A,0,en

Integrity.... When No One's Looking,Marvin Soskil,Page Publishing Inc,2022-05-04,"We all have freedom of choice. Nobody is telling you what you must do. It is your conscience that you have to live with! As we look around us these days, do you notice how the world has changed? We went from better to worse, worse to horrific and we're heading from horrific to dread? We can have the power to control situations, only if we raise the levels of our own consciousness and get back to basics. Remember when we wore white shirts and black ties for assembly? When your parents told you to do something you didn't ask why, you just did it? When No One is Looking is about bringing ""Integrity"" back into our lives and being more conscious of decisions we make and actions we take which can make this a better world. ""The most influential tool we have in your entire arsenal is your integrity."" - Zig Zigler ""Only a person with integrity has the ability to command a long time respect and admiration, young or old, rich or poor. It doesn't matter what you have now, you can live with integrity and elegance and you can take utmost pride in that. That is because integrity is something you decide to have. It is a principle you chose to live by. Each of us will someday, be judged by our standard of life, not by the standard of living; by our measure of giving, not by our measure of wealth; by our simple goodness, not by seeming greatness"" - William Arthur Ward",Self-Help,202,N/A,0,en

Be.You.Tiful,sunita k. mani,Partridge Publishing,2016-10-14,"Wouldnt it be awesome if you could have a conversation with someone about anything no matter how tricky the topic and still not be judged? Growth and conversations go hand in hand. Both represent each other. In a classical conversation, our aspirations, our thoughts, our sense of responsibility can all shift because we begin to perceive life differently after meeting different people. This allows us to arrive at new interpretations and choices that truly make greater sense and impact. As we dwell in a technology-driven era, our conversations are endangered because we have abandoned face-to-face conversations in the name of mere connections. If you are wanting, struggling, trying to find a place where you can learn and have conversations (even the hard ones), if you are ready to deepen your awareness, develop emotional flexibility, or simply tease your curiosity, this book is for you. In the book Be.you.tiful, author and counselor Sunita K. Mani offers practical guidelines on how to deal with everyday issuesbig or small, addiction, infatuation, career, body image, parents, friendships, and more. It contains chunks of conversations related to different aspects that define the life of a young adult.

Empowering Users through Design,David Bihanic,Springer,2015-01-12,"At the crossroads of various disciplines, this collective work examines the possibility of a new end-user “engagement” in ongoing digital/technological products and services development. It provides an overview of recent research specifically focused on the user’s democratic participation and empowerment. It also enables readers to better identify the main opportunities of participatory design, a concept which encourages the blurring of the role between user and designer. This allows people to escape their status as “end-user” and to elevate themselves to the level of creator. This book explores new avenues for rethinking the processes and practices of corporate innovation in order to cope with current socio-economic and technological changes. In so doing, it aims to help companies renew industrial models that allow them to design and produce new ranges of technological products and services by giving the user an active role in the development process, far beyond the basic role of consumer. Intended for designers, design researchers and scientists interested in innovation and technology management, this book also provides a valuable resource for professionals involved in technology-based innovation processes.",Technology & Engineering,304,N/A,0,en

"Handbook of Psychology and Health, Volume I","Robert J. Gatchel, Andrew Baum, Jerome E. Singer",Routledge,2021-09-30,"Originally published in 1982, this volume deals with behavioral medicine and clinical psychology. Much of what psychologists had been able to contribute to the study and treatment of health and illness had, to this point, been derived from clinical research and behavioral treatment. This volume presents some of this work, providing a fairly comprehensive view of the overlap between behavioral medicine and clinical psychology. Its purpose was to present some of the traditional areas of research and practice in clinical psychology that had directly and indirectly contributed to the development of behavioral medicine. Before the ‘birth’ of behavioral medicine, which subsequently attracted psychologists from many different areas ranging from social psychology to operant conditioning, the chief link between psychology and medicine consisted of the relationship, albeit sometimes fragile and tumultuous, between clinical psychology and psychiatry. Many of the behavioral assessment and treatment methods now being employed in the field of behavioral medicine were originally developed in the discipline of clinical psychology.",Psychology,402,N/A,0,en

ABC of Multimorbidity,"Stewart Mercer, Chris Salisbury, Martin Fortin",John Wiley & Sons,2014-05-12,"ABC of Multimorbidity is the first title to provide primary care practitioners with a practical approach to the complex issues of treating and managing patients with more than one morbidity. Ageing populations and earlier diagnosis of chronic conditions mean more people are living longer with multimorbidity. However, treatment guidelines are often designed for treatment in isolation of other morbidities. Multimorbidity management therefore requires a more patient centred approach and greater knowledge and coordination of existing services. Effective multimorbidity management both improves overall patient well-being and reduces the overall demand on health services. ABC of Multimorbidity examines how multimorbidities can be addressed within primary care, from the GP and family physician consultation through to the effective use of a range of health care services. It addresses complex issues such as polypharmacy, mental health, patient safety, patient involvement in self-management, and the role of the practitioner. It then provides guidance on how multimorbidities can be best treated and managed within primary care through specific interventions to improve outcomes. From an international, primary care editor and contributor team, ABC of Multimorbidity is a practical resource for general practitioners, family physicians, practice and specialist nurses, and others caring for multimorbid patients. It is also relevant for junior doctors, medical trainees and students.",Medical,70,N/A,0,en

Revolutionizing Women's Healthcare,Hannah Dudley-Shotwell,Rutgers University Press,2020-03-13,"Winner of the 2021 Frances Richardson Keller-Sierra Prize from the Western Association of Women Historians (WAWH)​ Revolutionizing Women’s Healthcare is the story of a feminist experiment: the self-help movement. This movement arose out of women’s frustration, anger, and fear for their health. Tired of visiting doctors who saw them as silly little girls, suffering shame when they asked for birth control, seeking abortions in back alleys, and holding little control over their own reproductive lives, women took action. Feminists created “self-help groups” where they examined each other’s bodies and read medical literature. They founded and ran clinics, wrote books, made movies, undertook nationwide tours, and raided and picketed offending medical institutions. Some performed their own abortions. Others swore off pharmaceuticals during menopause. Lesbian women found “at home” ways to get pregnant. Black women used self-help to talk about how systemic racism affected their health. Hannah Dudley-Shotwell engagingly chronicles these stories and more to showcase the creative ways women came together to do for themselves what the mainstream healthcare system refused to do.",Social Science,201,N/A,0,en

Orlinsky",Oxford University Press,2005-01-27,"The Psychotherapist's Own Psychotherapy: Patient and Clinician Perspectives lifts a curtain that has long shrouded the intimate alliances between therapists and those of their patients who share the same profession. In this unique volume, distinguished contributors explore the multi-faceted nature of the psychotherapy of psychotherapists from ""both sides of the couch."" The first-person narratives, clinical wisdom, and research findings gathered together in this book offer guidance about providing effective treatments to therapist patients. Part I presents multiple theoretical positions that justify and guide the work of therapists' therapists. In Part II, eminent therapists write eloquently and intimately about their own experiences as patients. Their personal reflections offer valuable insights about what is healing and educational about psychotherapy. These narratives are followed by several chapters reviewing scientific research on therapists in personal therapy, including the first report of relevant findings from a major international survey of psychotherapists. In Part III, celebrated therapists from different theoretical orientations offer guidance on conducting therapy with fellow therapists. They reflect on the many challenges, dilemmas, and rewards that arise when two people do the same work. Their chapters offer wisdom and warnings about such issues as power dynamics, boundary maintenance, therapist self-disclosure, the termination process, and the post-termination phase of the relationship. These first-hand accounts are enhanced by research overviews on coducting personal treatment, including a new study of American therapists commissioned for the book. The Psychotherapist's Own Psychotherapy: Patient and Clinician Perspectives is an essential resource for practitioners and students of all orientations and disciplines.",Psychology,446,N/A,0,en

Understanding the High-Functioning Alcoholic,Sarah A. Benton,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2009-02-27,"Who is the typical alcoholic among the 12.5 million living in the United States now? Many, if not most of us when asked that question, would envision a skid row bum or someone at least out of work or with little education locked into a low-skill, low-paying job. But that is not accurate, according to the results of a national study released in June, 2007 by the National Institutes of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. The NIAAA determined that alcoholics in the United States really fall into five subtypes, including nearly 20 percent who are highly functional alcoholics, well-educated with good incomes. They include corporate presidents, powerful politicians, police, lawyers, doctors, scientists, and other highly-skilled, highly-educated people who are middle- to high-income and by most accounts successful. In this unprecedented book, mental health counselor Sarah Benton takes us into the worlds and minds of so-called high-functioning alcoholics, to understand how people so intelligent and achievement-oriented get drawn into states in which they secretly cannot control their liquor consumption but still manage to excel in their careers. The book includes a look at celebrity alcoholics like singer Eric Clapton and actor/comedian Robin Williams, as well as alcoholics in high positions including Chris Albrecht, former Chairman and CEO of HBO. Other high-profile people included in this book are Miss USA 2007 Tara Conner and football legend Joe Namath. With her own story of alcoholism and her recovery woven into the text, Benton takes us into the lives and challenges of these well-educated and successful people, seeking to understand how, when, and why they became addicted, as well as the reasons their alcoholism is, for most, so hard to admit, cope with, and recover from.",Self-Help,222,N/A,0,en

Holistic Engagement,"Loretta Pyles, Gwendolyn Adam",Oxford University Press,2015-12-10,"This text offers innovation and a call to action for educators -- engage fully to engage students fully. With stories from the classroom, Holistic Engagement invites and challenges social work, human services and counseling educators to seek meaning in their methods and content in the processes of teaching. Empirically grounded, the authors propose a new model for advancing pedagogy to draw from many ways of knowing and wisdom across traditions. Through rich analysis of globalization, higher education and the social work profession, as well as first person accounts, they co-create a story of holistic pedagogies being employed across the globe. Aiming toward transformative social work practice, the authors discuss the ways that they engage with the whole person (body, mind, heart, culture and spirit) and reveal how such participatory pedagogies strengthen presence, attunement, empathy, professional self-care and the integrative capabilities of social work students and human service professionals. Drawing from a wide range of literature and traditions, from Freire's critical pedagogy to the neuroscience of mindfulness, these engaging essays have much to offer both seasoned and new social work educators, while creating an integrative and realistic conceptual home for them. The authors discuss the uses of theatre, the arts, ritual, mindfulness, critical dialogue, yoga and many other methods that upend the traditional social work classroom. These approaches are used at the undergraduate and graduate levels in a range of courses, including policy, theory and practice. The auto-ethnographical nature of many of the essays will invite educators to reflect on their own pedagogies as they consider the rewards and risks of going beyond the cognitive and engaging the whole person.",Social Science,313,N/A,0,en

Managing your Mental Health during your PhD,Zoë J. Ayres,Springer Nature,2022-09-14,"This book explores the PhD experience as never before and provides a “survival guide” for current and prospective PhD students. The book investigates why mental health issues are so common among the postgraduate population, going beyond the statistics, looking at lived experience of both the author and as well as current PhD students, who have found balancing mental wellness with the PhD endeavour challenging. The author discusses tips and tricks she wished she had known at the start of her PhD process for managing mental health, such as managing imposter feelings, prioritising workload, and self-care strategies to help others throughout their own journey. The book goes beyond typical mental health discussions (where the focus for improving mental health is placed on PhD students to become “more resilient”) and explores some of the often unspoken environmental factors that can impact mental health. These include the PhD student-supervisor relationship, the pressure to publish, and deep systemic problems in academia, such as racism, bullying and harassment. Finally, the book is a call to action, providing tangible improvements from the author’s perspective that university institutions can make to ensure that academia is a place for all to thrive.",Psychology,206,N/A,0,en

The Visual Imperative,Lindy Ryan,Morgan Kaufmann,2016-03-14,"Data is powerful. It separates leaders from laggards and it drives business disruption, transformation, and reinvention. Today's most progressive companies are using the power of data to propel their industries into new areas of innovation, specialization, and optimization. The horsepower of new tools and technologies have provided more opportunities than ever to harness, integrate, and interact with massive amounts of disparate data for business insights and value – something that will only continue in the era of the Internet of Things. And, as a new breed of tech-savvy and digitally native knowledge workers rise to the ranks of data scientist and visual analyst, the needs and demands of the people working with data are changing, too. The world of data is changing fast. And, it's becoming more visual. Visual insights are becoming increasingly dominant in information management, and with the reinvigorated role of data visualization, this imperative is a driving force to creating a visual culture of data discovery. The traditional standards of data visualizations are making way for richer, more robust and more advanced visualizations and new ways of seeing and interacting with data. However, while data visualization is a critical tool to exploring and understanding bigger and more diverse and dynamic data, by understanding and embracing our human hardwiring for visual communication and storytelling and properly incorporating key design principles and evolving best practices, we take the next step forward to transform data visualizations from tools into unique visual information assets. - Discusses several years of in-depth industry research and presents vendor tools, approaches, and methodologies in discovery, visualization, and visual analytics - Provides practicable and use case-based experience from advisory work with Fortune 100 and 500 companies across multiple verticals - Presents the next-generation of visual discovery, data storytelling, and the Five Steps to Data Storytelling with Visualization - Explains the Convergence of Visual Analytics and Visual discovery, including how to use tools such as R in statistical and analytic modeling - Covers emerging technologies such as streaming visualization in the IOT (Internet of Things) and streaming animation",Computers,322,N/A,0,en

Superheroes and Superegos,Sharon Packer MD,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2009-12-14,"This comprehensive collection of essays written by a practicing psychiatrist shows that superheroes are more about superegos than about bodies and brawn, even though they contain subversive sexual subtexts that paved the path for major social shifts of the late 20th century. Superheroes have provided entertainment for generations, but there is much more to these fictional characters than what first meets the eye. Superheros and Superegos: Analyzing the Minds Behind the Masks begins its exploration in 1938 with the creation of Superman and continues to the present, with a nod to the forerunners of superhero stories in the Bible and Greek, Roman, Norse, and Hindu myth. The first book about superheroes written by a psychiatrist in over 50 years, it invokes biological psychiatry to discuss such concepts as ""body dysmorphic disorder,"" as well as Jungian concepts of the shadow self that explain the appeal of the masked hero and the secret identity. Readers will discover that the earliest superheroes represent fantasies about stopping Hitler, while more sophisticated and socially-oriented publishers used superheroes to encourage American participation in World War II. The book also explores themes such as how the feminist movement and the dramatic shift in women's roles and rights were predicted by Wonder Woman and Sheena nearly 30 years before the dawn of the feminist era.",Social Science,293,N/A,0,en

Ponderosa Resort Volume 3: Books 7-9,Tawna Fenske,Tawna Fenske,2023-09-13,"The Ponderosa Resort Romantic Comedy Series invites you to small-town Central Oregon where two sisters work to get their reindeer ranch up and running while the siblings down the road transform their late father’s ranch into a luxury resort (all while getting to know each other because they grew up with different moms. Er, Dad got around). Fans of laughter, tears, and tingly bits will love this series from a USA Today bestselling author. This boxed set contains books 7-9 in the Ponderosa Resort series. About Captain Dreamboat (book 7) The problem with being the family do-gooder? Sometimes you need to be bad. Or selfish, or whatever it’s called when I lock lips with Blanka Pavlo in a hospital hallway. I’m nuts about the sexy science goddess, but it’s a dick move to ditch a lifetime of rescue work staying here instead of heading back out on the high seas. But it turns out donating an organ gets you grounded a while. A few months at my family’s resort means more time with Blanka, and more chances she’ll notice I suck at self-care. She has a point, and also a plan. That’s how I end up tied to my headboard with balloon animals, adopting a homely cat, and joining Blanka for a bubble bath that’s way steamier than any fully-clothed event ought to be. It’s almost enough to make a guy forget why he’s spent a lifetime struggling to cancel out the sins of dear ol’ dad. Almost. About Snowbound Squeeze (book 8) A SPECIAL PONDEROSA RESORT NOVELLA! Rule one when seeking a secret mountain hideaway: Be certain the cabin’s unoccupied. Also, make sure there’s no blizzard coming. I’ve screwed up all of that before I get the key in the door, which shouldn’t be a shock. God knows I’ve messed up plenty of things lately. Is it too much to want a hideout from Hollywood headlines in a place no one knows my name? Maybe not, since Gretchen Laslo has zero clue who I am. That’s the upside of being snowed-in with a stunning professor whose impressive list of appliances includes two ice cream makers and no television. The downside? Cocoa and blanket forts lead to toe-curling sex, which leads to me kinda-sorta forgetting to tell her the paparazzi’s on my tail. It’s a matter of time before she finds out. When that happens, our wintry romance will melt faster than two snowmen boning in a sauna. About Dr. Hot Stuff (book 9) Racing heart? Check. Damp palms? Check. All signs indicate I’ve got it bad for Lady Isabella Blankenship. It could be contagious, since Iz shows all the same symptoms. But what’s got her pulling back anytime things blaze between us? I know a modern-day duchess might have baggage from finding out she’s the illegitimate child of a dead American philanderer with more kids than morals. But Izzy’s on edge, and there’s more to it than run-of-the-mill culture shock. Turns out I’m not the only guy drawn to her. She’s shadowed 24/7 by protective siblings, an amorous pig named Kevin, and a deadly-looking stranger skulking around Ponderosa Resort. It’s more drama than I’ve seen since my days as an Army doc, so I’m happy to lend Iz a shoulder or any body part she needs. But what are my odds of diagnosing what ails Izzy before my royal crush makes a run for it?",Fiction,655,N/A,0,en

Luckenbach, MA, DD, associate minister and author of I Only Walk On Water When It Rains The grief that accompanies the loss of a loved one is crippling. In Feeling Left Behind, author Kim Murdock relates and empathizes with that pain because she’s been there. She knows what it feels like to be woefully blindsided by music or at the grocery store, to reconsider the future alone, and to connect with a person who is no longer alive. You will relate to her chapters as she describes: • The crushing desire to freeze time and isolate yourself • The unstable phase of “firsts”― first holidays, birthdays, anniversaries • The anger and sadness at seeing other couples • The loss of self, empathy, security, and tolerance • The heartbreaking sadness of getting rid of their belongings • And so much more This is not a step-by-step guide on how to grieve. Kim outlines every detail of her experience as well as the experiences of her widow/widower friends to show you that you are not alone. You are normal. And you deserve as much time as possible to figure out how to survive in your own way.

Living with Hearing Difficulties,Dafydd Stephens,John Wiley & Sons,2009-10-12,"Living with Hearing Difficulties is a source-book for professionals who encounter and support individuals with hearing difficulties. It will also be of interest to people with hearing difficulties themselves and those close to them. The book highlights the concept of audiological enablement as being an interactive process requiring the active involvement of both clinician and patient. The thirteen chapters encompass four sections which broadly follow the categories of the World Health Organization's ICF (2001): Section 1 addresses types of hearing disorders, the impairments they cause and also the process of help seeking. Section 2 deals with the effects of hearing impairment on communication and psychosocial functioning. Section 3 considers the individual in their environment; their family, work, and leisure. Section 4 elaborates on the process of enablement in a non-prescriptive manner. The authors approach the problems and needs from the standpoint of what the patient/client is seeking. Enablement is seen as a team effort between the professionals, the patient and their family in an ever-changing environment. This entails using any relevant techniques to ensure the well-being of the individual with hearing impairment; that end remains very much their goal. The book also has a companion website www.wiley.com/go/stephens which hosts additional downloadable documents as well as a demonstration of the concept of the signal-to-noise ratio.",Medical,255,N/A,0,en

Understanding Burnout Recovery Among Native-Born Korean Missionaries,Hannah Kyong-Jin Cho,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2020-01-29,"In this timely book, Cho provides mission scholars, sending churches, and mission agencies with an understanding of Korean missionaries' burnout recovery process. Her study of Korean missionary burnout recovery included thirty-nine research participants who had experienced burnout in missionary service and who subsequently recovered. Participants reported a variety of physical, emotional, and spiritual symptoms, as well as relational difficulties experienced during burnout. Cho describes how their self-help approach, characterized by independent, religious self-effort, brought only temporary relief. Through self-care, however, they experienced genuine recovery. Self-care that leads to lasting recovery is holistic and grace-based, characterized by a correct understanding of the roles of God and others in their lives and engagement in authentic community for interdependent care. This study also gives insightful recommendations to missionary member care systems, mission agencies, and other sending organizations in an Asian cultural context about how to care for Korean missionaries. It is also intended for counselors of home churches so that they can provide better member care for burned-out missionaries. Lastly, this study advances research into contextually appropriate paradigms and strategies helpful to cross-cultural missionaries in the area of both Korean missionaries and non-Western studies in missionary member care.",Religion,195,N/A,0,en

Resilient Grandparent Caregivers,"Bert Hayslip, Jr., Gregory C. Smith",Routledge,2012-11-12,"The study of grandparents raising grandchildren, now almost two decades old, has tended to have a negative bias, emphasizing the difficulties such people face and the negative impact that grandparent caregiving has on them physically, socially, and emotionally. This edited book seeks to reverse this trend by taking a positive approach to understanding grandparent caregivers, focusing on their resilience and resourcefulness. This method reflects a strengths-based approach and the importance of benefit-finding and positive coping. Chapters feature information from both qualitative and quantitative studies and are written by a diverse range of professionals, such as counselors, psychologists, geriatric social workers, and nurse practitioners, to provide multidisciplinary persepctives for practitioners working with grandparent caregivers. Part one discusses the positive qualities that custodial grandparents possess – resilience, resourcefulness, and benefit finding. The second part considers the sociocultural aspects of resilience and resourcefulness in grandparent caregivers. Finally, part three presents strengths-based interventions for working with custodial grandparents. Practitioners will find this to be a valuable resource in their work and the field as a whole, stimulating positive changes in attitudes toward and practices with grandparent caregivers.",Psychology,283,N/A,0,en

Excavating the current treatments available for alcohol moderation, the book offers step-by-step processes of engaging clients and their families, self-assessments, and alcohol moderation tools. In addition to using it in conjunction with Practicing Alcohol Moderation: A Comprehensive Workbook, readers would benefit from the Alcohol Moderation Assessment which predicts who may be able to successfully drink in moderation as well as developing and monitoring an Alcohol Moderation Plan. The text uses recognized alcohol moderation resources throughout the world as well as real-life case studies to address typical clinician, client, and family member questions. It challenges the traditional recommendation that drinkers experiencing problems are “alcoholics.” This guide is a resource for all who overdrink or know people who struggle with their alcohol use. Through its medium, a broad range of health care providers receive a step-by-step process on how to practice alcohol moderation, how to put tools into practice, case examples, and answers to the most commonly asked questions.",Psychology,210,N/A,0,en

Stand Tall,"Dewey Bozella, Tamara Jones",HarperCollins,2016-12-06,"The inspiring story of one man’s fight against his wrongful incarceration and his eventual triumph—both inside and outside the boxing ring. In the late 1970s, Dewey Bozella was wrongfully convicted of murdering Emma Crapser, a ninety-two-year-old resident of Poughkeepsie, New York. Sentenced to twenty years to life in prison, Bozella fiercely maintained his innocence throughout his ordeal at Sing Sing Correctional Facility, and even refused the prosecutor’s offer of freedom in exchange for an admission of guilt. But in 2009, more than a quarter century later, Dewey Bozella would reclaim his identity and his humanity when his conviction was vacated. In this raw and uplifting memoir, Bozella takes us through the trials, tribulations, and joys of his life inside prison and, eventually, as a free man. While at Sing Sing, he took up boxing to channel his anger, and eventually became the prison’s light-heavyweight champion. Bozella also met and married the love of his life from behind bars, lost countless parole hearings, and spent agonizing time on a cell block with both his brother’s murderer and, it turned out, the true crim-inal in whose place Bozella served so much time. But Bozella never gave up. After he was refused parole and had his sentence extended, the Innocence Project caught word of his case. Thanks to his undying faith, stalwart persistence, and the aid of a young pro bono attorney at the Innocence Project who doggedly worked toward Bozella’s release when all hope seemed lost, he was released from prison in 2009. Shortly thereafter, he won his professional boxing debut against Larry Hopkins, started an afterschool athletics program for at-risk youth, and was awarded the Arthur Ashe Award for Courage. An incredibly uplifting underdog story, Stand Tall recounts one man’s perseverance in the face of injustice and his difficult road to freedom.",Biography & Autobiography,172,N/A,0,en

You're Not what I Expected,Polly Young-Eisendrath,William Morrow,1993,"""What happens when the romance fades? Are lovers inevitably fated to disillusionment? Jungian analyst Polly Young-Eisendrath's You're Not What I Expected suggests a new and hopeful ending to the story about love between the sexes."" ""A licensed psychologist in private practice, Dr. Young-Eisendrath follows four struggling couples through therapy and locates the psychological predicament at the root of failure-bound relationships: Actual lovers either don't correspond to their partners' idealized ""dream lovers"" or they exhibit traits reminiscent of previous unhappy experiences."" ""Husbands ultimately fail to grow into the model ""Hero"" or they resemble their wives' ""Terrible Fathers."" Wives who abandon the role of ""Maiden Lover"" metamorphose into a twentieth-century witch, the ""Terrible Mother."" Polly Young-Eisendrath points the way to ""mature dependence"": an intimacy built on equality. You're Not What I Expected shows couples that dialogue is at the heart of friendship and trust.""--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Subjectivity and Suffering in American Culture,Steven M. Parish,Palgrave MacMillan,2008-06-15,"Winner of The Boyer Prize from the Society for Psychological Anthropology!!! This book explores the experience of suffering in order to shed light on the nature of the human self. Using an intimate life history approach, it examines ways people struggle to cope with experiences that can shatter their lives: a diagnosis of cancer, the death of a spouse, a parent’s mental illness. The volume takes readers deep into private worlds of suffering in American culture, and invites reflection on what the subjectivity of suffering tells us about being human. Addressing universal themes in a way that fully recognizes the individuality of those who experience a personal crisis, Parish shows how individuals personalize the cultural and psychological resources in which they find their possible selves.",Philosophy,248,N/A,0,en

Feeding the World's Population,,N/A,1984,"Abstract: This most comprehensive review of the world's food supply status since the Rome 1974 World Food Conference records and analyzes major world food activities and programs over the past 10 years, surveys food situations currently faced world-wide and regionally, and provides a prognosis for feeding the world's populations. Global food grain inventories and food production are more comfortable, relative to food demand, than predicted 10 years ago. However, agricultural prices and production levels are too variable to accurately and quantitatively project the world food situation over the coming 10-year period. The report examines what has happened during the past decade in areas of agricultural development, production trade, and aid, and focuses on changes that have taken place in the major geographical regions of the Third World. Public policy proposals made at the 1974 Conference are reviewed, and the evolution of both institutions and policies for agricultural development and food aid promotion is examined and discussed. The evolution of analytical thinking on the dynamics of agricultural change over the past decade is reviewed in detail. (wz).",Agricultural innovations,792,N/A,0,en

Brewerton, Amy Baker Dennis",Springer,2014-07-08,"Eating disorders, addictions, and substance use disorders are each challenging in their own right, but they also commonly co-occur, causing major challenges for clinicians. This book presents cutting-edge research on the overlap of these complex disorders and reviews integrative assessment strategies and treatment approaches, including enhanced cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, abstinence approaches, motivational enhancement, mindfulness meditation, and pharmacotherapy. The issue of whether eating-disordered behaviors such as dieting, binge eating, and excessive exercise are merely other forms of addictive behavior is examined. The authors argue both for and against the concept of food addiction in research, clinical treatment, and public policy. The book will be of interest to psychiatrists, addiction medicine physicians, mental health/substance abuse clinicians, dieticians, researchers, and those affected by the disorders.",Medical,694,N/A,0,en

Mental Health at the Crossroads,Janet E. Williams,Routledge,2017-03-02,"This book is a challenge to the enduring status and domination of bio-medical approaches in mental health services. Contributors from four continents argue that this domination, along with modernization and multidisciplinary work, will not improve people's lives unless social and psychological perspectives are appreciated and integrated. This implies new forms of relationships and social arrangements. Mental Health at the Crossroads: the Promise of the Psychosocial Approach is a timely analysis of the psychosocial approach as it resonates across the discipline divide, considering the past and future development. It is written from the perspectives of service users and carers, managers, practitioners, educators, researchers and policy makers, illustrated with case studies from Australia, Brazil, Italy, UK and the USA. This book presents an alternative approach to conventional thinking in mental health, providing a fascinating and valuable resource for those seeking new perspectives, grounded in theory with practice examples, in order to influence the current agenda and change practice.",Medical,262,N/A,0,en

Urban Informality,"Ananya Roy, Nezar AlSayyad",Transnational Perspectives on Space and Place,2004,"The turn of the century has been a moment of rapid urbanization. Much of this urban growth is taking place in the cities of the developing world and much of it in informal settlements. This book presents cutting-edge research from various world regions to demonstrate these trends. The contributions reveal that informal housing is no longer the domain of the urban poor; rather it is a significant zone of transactions for the middle-class and even transnational elites. Indeed, the book presents a rich view of 'urban informality' as a system of regulations and norms that governs the use of space and makes possible new forms of social and political power. The book is organized as a 'transnational' endeavor. It brings together three regional domains of research--the Middle East, Latin America, and South Asia--that are rarely in conversation with one another. It also unsettles the hierarchy of development and underdevelopment by looking at some First World processes of informality through a Third World research lens.",Business & Economics,360,N/A,0,en

Approach To Self Improvement,James J Manson,Independently Published,2019-05-14,"The Healthiest Approach to Self-Improvement is a book that explains the signals in your life and when you see the same warning signs over and over, take note and start making self-improvement. Don't wait until none of your clothes fit anymore before adopting some self-improvement in a healthier lifestyle. You have a lot more chance of success when you see the first signs that there is a problem in different aspects of your life. If your favorite jeans seem to be getting harder to fasten up, then start to make improvements in your diet to lose unwanted pounds. The same principle applies to everything in your life. Don't wait until you experience pain and hopelessness before using the power of self-improvement.Don't wait until your world starts falling apart. Many of us do that because change isn't always easy, but ignoring change only worsens the situation. There is no need to resist or fear change. Remember if you continue to do the same things in the same way, you will get the same results. So face it and do something about it. Self-improvement can be exhilarating and freeing. It can empower you. Making positive changes through self-improvement will lead to much more happiness, control, and contentment in your life.Self-improvement doesn't mean you need to change everything in your life. Look at the areas that are not making you happy. For example, if you need to lose a few pounds, join a gym or exercise class a few nights a week. Or buy a fitness CD, and grab a friend to work out together. Make it something that is fun, and you will begin to look forward to self-improvement. If you lack confidence or you feel your communications skills are weak, there are so many resources to help you in those areas. There are hundreds of self-improvement books, courses, audio CD's, and videos that can help you boost your confidence and help you understand how to communicate more effectively.The chapters of this book include the following: -What is Self-Improvement?-What Can Self-Improvement Do For You?-The Why, How and What of Self Improvement-Self-Improvement and Its Benefits-Self-Improvement - Achieving Your Dream-5 Steps to a Solid Self Improvement Plan-The Easy Self Improvement Tip You Will Not Read About-Steps Toward Your Self Improvement!-Tapping Into Your Self-Improvement Power-Self-Improvement - 5 Hot Tips for Self-Improvement-7 Hot Tips for Self-Improvement-Self-Improvement - Benefits of Learning Self-Mastery-Self-Improvement and Its Benefits-Self-Improvement Tips to Improve Different Areas of Your Life-Importance of Self-ImprovementThe beauty of self-improvement is, it is something you can do in the privacy of your own home with plenty of books, courses and CD's that you can choose from. Carve out your path and method to make empowering self-improvements. When you start seeing the encouraging results that happen to you because you decided to unlock the power of self-improvement, you will soon realize that it's only the beginning of a much happier road in your life that puts you in control.",,110,N/A,0,en
Self-Care for the Mental Health Practitioner,Alfred J. Malinowski,Jessica Kingsley Publishers,2014-09-21,"Dr. Alfred J. Malinowski's book provides a comprehensive resource on self-care for those working in the field of psychotherapy. Beginning with an exploration of the role and duties of the mental health practitioner, Dr. Malinowski describes how the demands of practice can lead therapists to diminished psychological well-being.

He presents a number of self-care techniques and strategies and explains how they can be applied to maintain psychological, spiritual, physical and social well-being. A final section explores the need for additional training for psychotherapists in the area of the hazards and self-care, both in graduate courses for future clinicians and to help experienced therapists continue learning and practicing self-care principles in their daily lives.

Mindfulness, a simple yet powerful way of paying attention to your most difficult emotions and life experiences, can help you break the cycle of chronic unhappiness once and for all.

Levy, Ph.D., Professor and Chair, University of Maryland Baltimore County While the term ""self-help"" is sometimes used to refer to a low-cost, solitary activity, more often it refers to an organized social activity that in the United States alone involves 7.5 million people. Alcoholics Anonymous by itself enrolls huge numbers of people and has an enormous impact on the professional treatment system for alcoholics. In the mental health field, a vigorous consumer and family movement--including groups such as the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill and National Depressive and Manic-Depressive Association--involves hundreds of thousands of members and has caught the attention of the professional system. Understanding the Self-Help Organization provides detailed, comprehensive coverage of this phenomenon. This comprehensive volume focuses attention on three critical areas: public policy and self-help, participation--particularly by minorities--in self-help, and explanatory frameworks.

If you have GAD, you may experience excessive and uncontrollable worry about daily life events, including your finances, family, health, future, and even minor concerns like traffic, work, or household issues. You aren’t alone. GAD is one of the most commonly diagnosed mental health issues facing our society today. Unfortunately, this chronic condition can cause such excessive worrying that it can be difficult to live your life—and can even manifest in a number of physical symptoms, including sleep and concentration problems, fatigue, irritability, and feelings of restlessness. So, how can you take charge of your anxiety before it takes over your life? Based in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), this book provides real, proven-effective solutions. Written by three renowned anxiety experts, the book offers practical exercises and strategies to help soothe your worst worries, fears, and panic.

It proceeds from the premise that self-care is a powerful philosophical, biological, and psychological basis for nursing practice in a variety of settings. Cultural issues are stressed throughout the volume, including a section on cross-cultural communication and cultural influences on learning styles. The book is divided into four sections: the historical and theoretical aspects of self-care; the components of health such as nutrition, activity, and stress management; and the impact of self-care in light of health care reform, changing health care settings, and the concept of health communities. Health care professionals as well as students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels will find the volume imminently practical and relevant to their work.",Health & Fitness,384,N/A,0,en

Mastering Self-Motivation,Michael J. Provitera,Business Expert Press,2012-12-07,"The surge of motivational titles flooding bookstore shelves amid the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression is evidence of our society’s growing obsession with self-improvement. Recently two areas of growing interest among academics have been positive organizational behavior and psychological capital. While books on these subjects have led to a new understanding of motivation, they have limited their focus to two ends of a continuum. This book pays heed to the extensive research and careful conclusions of academicians, and then crosses into the realm of self-help and massmarket literature. It has nine chapters that blend topics being taught over two decades in the classroom and practiced in management consulting. Each chapter invites you to learn both theoretical and practical concepts and encourages you to apply this knowledge to the workplace. This book thus seeks to mediate market-driven self-help dreams and academic literature, and provides theoretical concepts that can enhance individual motivation presented in a comprehensive and enjoyable manner. This is the first motivational book that brings together the academic and popular literature to bridge the gap between common sense and theoretical concepts.",Business & Economics,148,N/A,0,en

Addiction and Recovery in the UK,"Jeffrey D. Roth, David Best",Routledge,2013-09-13,"Addiction and Recovery in the UK captures the essence of the emerging addictions recovery movement and in particular the emerging evidence base that had been gathered around the umbrella of the Recovery Academy UK. The Recovery Academy was established with the aim of creating a forum for people in recovery, practitioners, commissioners and academics working together to describe and understand the principles of recovery as applied across the UK. Following the first annual conference, researchers who had been involved in academic research on recovery and innovative services and activities that had been evaluated were invited to outline UK initiatives. This book, the result of their contributions, is a vibrant collection of diverse theories and models, critiques and innovations, ranging from two linked papers describing the growing recovery movement in Edinburgh to a recovery walking group in Wales and a model for peer activities in the North of England. The projects are typically ‘community up’ projects whose essence has been captured within this book, and which together paint a picture of vitality and growth in the UK recovery movement.

Facilitating Challenging Groups,Nina W. Brown,Routledge,2014-01-23,"Groups—like the people in them—come in all forms, and often they don’t fit a standard mold. Single-session, leaderless, and open groups are three of the most common kinds of nonstandard groups, but participants and facilitators of these kinds of groups have few, if any, resources at their disposal when they try to confront the unique challenges that their group structures present. Facilitating Challenging Groups confronts these challenges head on and offers activities, tools, tips, and techniques vital to everyone from the smallest self-help group to the largest human-relations training session. Readers will come away from this book with a deep understanding of each group’s unique needs, the leader’s role where applicable, and concrete strategies for developing the two traits most important to any successful group: universality and hope.",Psychology,125,N/A,0,en
Psychosocial Factors in Arthritis,Perry M. Nicassio,Springer,2015-11-27,"This book provides an integrative approach for the management and care of the arthritis patient. Many different psychological, social, and behavioral factors have been shown to affect the quality of life of arthritis patients beyond the effects of the disease and the response to medications and treatments. The book establishes a biopsychosocial framework for understanding the interplay between psychological and physical aspects of rheumatic disease and summarizes the research about the psychosocial aspects that affect patients with arthritis, including stress, social support, doctor-patient communication, and sleep patterns. It explores the practice of incorporating psychological and behavioral approaches in the rheumatology clinic in order to surmount the problems of access and enhance the quality of care, promotes a comprehensive perspective on the numerous issues affecting persons with arthritis, and provides clinical guidelines for management. Psychosocial Factors in Arthritis is a valuable resource for behavioral medicine researchers, behavioral clinicians, and a range of arthritis professionals, including rheumatologists, nurses, and other allied health service practitioners.",Medical,298,N/A,0,en
Evidence-Based Counseling and Psychotherapy for an Aging Population,Morley D. Glicken,Academic Press,2009-08-01,"At a time when the mental health difficulties/disorders of the elderly are coming to the fore of many practitioners' patient rosters, naming and treating those problems is still too often handled as an art as much as a science. Inconsistent practices based on clinical experience and intuition rather than hard scientific evidence of efficacy have for too long been the basis of much treatment. Evidence-based practices help to alleviate some of the confusion, allowing the practitioner to develop quality practice guidelines that can be applied to the client, identify appropriate literature that can be shared with the client, communicate with other professionals from a knowledge-guided frame of reference, and continue a process of self-learning that results in the best possible treatment for clients. The proposed volume will provide practitioners with a state-of-the-art compilation of evidence-based practices in the assessment and treatment of elderly clients. As such it will be more clinically useful than anything currently on the market and will better enable practitioners to meet the demands faced in private and institutional practice. Focusing on the most current research and best evidence regarding assessment, diagnosis, and treatment, the volume covers difficulties including, but not limited to: social isolation/loneliness, elder abuse/neglect, depression and suicidal inclinations, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, dementias, prolonged bereavement, patients with terminal illnesses. Because concrete research evidence is so often not used as the basis for practice, this book provides a timely guide for clinicians, social workers, and advanced students to a research-oriented approach to serving the mental health needs of elderly adults. - Fully covers assessment, diagnosis & treatment of the elderly, focusing on evidence-based practicesConsolidates broadly distributed literature into single source and specifically relates evidence-based tools to practical treatment, saving clinicians time in obtaining and translating information and improving the level of care they can provide - Detailed how-to explanation of practical evidence-based treatment techniques - Gives reader firm grasp of how to more effectively treat patients - Chapters directly address the range of conditions and disorders most common for this patient population - i.e. social isolation, elder abuse/neglect, depression, anxiety disorders, terminal illnesses/disabilites, bereavement, substance abuse, and dementias - Prepares readers for the conditions they will encounter in real world treamtent of an elderly patient population - Cites numerous case studies and provides integrative questions at the end of each chapter - Exposes reader to real-world application of each treatment discussed - Offers reader easy base for further study of subject, saving clinicians time",Psychology,423,N/A,0,en

With more than 40 contributors from art, history, science, natural history, and specialty museums across the country, the book asks probing questions about museum-school relationships, suggests new paradigms, and offers creative approaches.

(K)information,Maren Klotz,Campus Verlag,2014-05-15,"Openness about sperm and egg donation and the regulation of donor anonymity or non-anonymity are new phenomena. How do affected families, clinics, and regulators deal with information about gamete donors and the donation itself? And how does this knowledge management contribute to the creation and enactment of kinship? Addressing these questions in Germany and Britain, this ethnography makes a comparative contribution to the empirical and theoretical analysis of kin-formation and social change. Maren Klotz reveals a contemporary renegotiation of the values of privacy, information-sharing, and connectedness as they relate to the social, clinical, and regulatory management of kinship information. Transparency, not genetics, is the moral imperative, and instead of an unambiguously discernible ""geneticization,"" her findings on donor non-anonymity and parental openness display a pattern of ""transparentization."" This pattern represents a shift in authority over kinship away from the sometimes highhanded reproductive medical profession towards concerned groups, parents-by-donation, and policymakers. Bekommt ein Paar ein Kind mithilfe von gespendeten Ei- und Samenzellen, stellt sich die Frage, wie diese Familie mit dem Wissen um die Spende im Alltag umgeht. Maren Klotz untersucht, wie Verwandtschaft vor diesem Hintergrund konstruiert wird. Sie zeichnet ein Bild von Familiengründung im 21.

WHO guideline on self-care interventions for health and well-being,World Health Organization,World Health Organization,2021-07-31,"Self-care interventions are among the most promising and exciting new approaches to improve health and well-being, both from a health systems perspective and for people who use these interventions. The World Health Organization (WHO) uses the following working definition of self-care: Self-care is the ability of individuals, families and communities to promote health, prevent disease, maintain health, and cope with illness and disability with or without the support of a health worker. The scope of self-care as described in this definition includes health promotion; disease prevention and control; self-medication; providing care to dependent persons; seeking hospital/specialist/primary care if necessary; and rehabilitation, including palliative care. It includes a range of self-care modes and approaches. While this is a broad definition that includes many activities, it is important for health policy to recognize the importance of self-care, especially where it intersects with health systems and health professionals. Worldwide, an estimated shortage of 18 million health workers is anticipated by 2030, a record 130 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance, and disease outbreaks are a constant global threat. At least 400 million people worldwide lack access to the most essential health services, and every year 100 million people are plunged into poverty because they have to pay for health care out of their own pockets. There is an urgent need to find innovative strategies that go beyond the conventional health sector response. While ""self-care"" is not a new term or concept, self-care interventions have the potential to increase choice, when they are accessible and affordable, and they can also provide more opportunities for individuals to make informed decisions regarding their health and health care. In humanitarian settings, for example, due to lack of or limited health infrastructure and medical services in the crisis-affected areas, self-care could play an important role to improve health-related outcomes. Self-care also builds upon existing movements, such as task sharing, which are powerful strategies to support health systems.",Medical,186,N/A,0,en

Supporting Leaders for School Improvement Through Self-Care and Wellbeing,"Bradley W. Carpenter, Julia Mahfouz, Kerry Robinson",IAP,2024-01-01,"School leadership instability is particularly problematic for scholars and practitioners concerned with PK-12 school improvement, as second only to teachers, campus leadership has been identified as a primary factor in students' academic success (Young et al., 2007). Yet, while principals play an indispensable role in students' academic success, the job has become considerably more stressful as the role of a school leader continues to evolve. Specifically, added responsibilities, increased work intensity, and the ever-present menace of high stakes accountability have intensified the stress levels encountered by today's school leaders (Carpenter & Brewer, 2012; Chaplain, 2001; Darmody & Smyth, 2016; Wang, et al., 2018). This intensification negatively impacts a school’s teaching staff and its students, as the overall quality of the school experience can deteriorate if principals are unable to meet their potential due to the burnout and fatigue associated with chronic stress (Darmody & Smyth, 2016; Devos, et al., 2007). For principals to fully realize their ability to serve as catalysts for school improvement, they should be allowed to prioritize physical, mental, cognitive, and emotional health. Desired levels of wellbeing occur in the absence of chronic physical, social, psychological, emotional, economic, and cognitive distress (La Placa, et al., 2013). As authors in this volume demonstrate, many school leaders have commenced specific practices targeting cognitive, emotional, and behavioral wellbeing to cope with occupational stress and flourishing- or, at the very least, surviving in such a challenging environment. Among coping strategies leaders have adopted include mindfulness and other wellbeing interventions/strategies intended to facilitate healthier lifestyles, relieve stress, and improve personal resilience (Aviles & Dent, 2015; Mahfouz, 2018; Wells, 2015). Recently, there has been a call to consider educational leadership through a positive human flourishing lens. Research in this area focuses on integrating wellbeing practices in professional development programs for teachers and school administrators to highlight the positive effects of personal and collective wellbeing in schools (Cherkowski & Walker, 2014). For example, empirical studies have examined how incorporating mindfulness practice promotes positive adaptive skills, stress resilience, and social and emotional skills needed in a school environment (Abenavoli, et al., 2013; Benn, et al., 2012; Dvor a kova et al., 2017; Jennings, 2015; Meiklejohn et al., 2012; Mahfouz et al., 2018). New understandings about the relationship between school administrators' wellbeing and school improvement efforts should ignite interest within the field. As such, this book’s chapters are organized into four distinct sections that provide: (a) an overview of the field (Section I), (b) an empirical argument for why such research is essential (Section II), (c) wellbeing models to be considered for use in the PK-12 setting (Section III), and, (d) specific wellbeing practices and frameworks currently being in PK-12 (Section IV).",Education,416,N/A,0,en

The City in the Developing World,"Robert B. Potter, Sally Lloyd-Evans",Routledge,2014-09-25,"The City in the Developing World is a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to urbanisation in developing countries. The goal of this text is to place an understanding of the developing world city in its wider global context. First, this is done by developing the concept of social surplus product as a key to understanding the character of the contemporary Third World city. Second, throughout this text, the city in developing areas is centrally placed in the context of global, social, economic, political and cultural change. Thus, the important themes of globalisation, modernity and postmodernity are examined both in relation to the structure of sets of towns and cities which make up the national or regional urban system, and in respect of ideas and concepts dealing with the morphology, structure and social patterning of individual urban areas. The City in the Developing World is a core text for second and third year undergraduates in the fields of geography, development studies, planning, economics and the social sciences, taking options which deal with development issues, development theory, gender and development and Third World development.",Science,306,N/A,0,en

Mental health-substance use is a complex and varied phenomenon, and this volume stresses an appreciation that interventions that work for one individual or family may prove ineffective for another. It therefore explores the needs of individuals and carers, the nature of the therapeutic relationship, and the theory and application of a variety of interventional techniques; these include group therapy, cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), motivational interviewing (MI), brief interventions and many more.

Improving the Effectiveness of the Helping Professions,Morley D. Glicken,SAGE,2005,"The current practice of counselling, psychotherapy, and most helping professions often relies on clinical wisdom with little evidence of what actually works. Clinical wisdom is often a justification for beliefs and values that bond people together as professionals but often fails to serve clients since many of those beliefs and values may be comforting, but they may also be inherently incorrect. Improving the Effectiveness of the Helping Professions: An Evidence-Based Approach to Practice covers the use of research and critical thinking to assist helping professionals make the most effective choices in treating clients with social and emotional problems. The use of evidence-based practice (EBP) comes at a time when managed care and concerns over health care costs coincide with growing concerns that psychotherapy, case management, and counseling may not be sufficiently effective ways of helping people in social and emotional difficulty.",Medical,356,N/A,0,en

Broadening the Base of Addiction Mutual Support Groups,"Jeffrey Roth, William White, John Kelly",Routledge,2016-04-08,"Mutual-help groups have proliferated, diversified and adapted to emerging substance-related trends over the past 75 years, and have been the focus of rigorous research for the past 30 years. This book reviews the history of mutual support groups for addiction that have arisen as adjuncts or alternatives to Twelve Step Programs, including secular mutual support groups like Secular Organization for Sobriety, Smart Recovery and Women for Sobriety, and faith-based mutual support groups like Celebrate Recovery. It also considers the mutual support groups attended by families and friends of addicts. These mutual support groups are examined in terms of their histories, theoretical underpinnings and intended communities. The structures common in mutual support groups have influenced the rise of a new recovery advocacy movement and new recovery community institutions such as recovery ministries, recovery community centers, sober cafes, sober sports clubs, and recovery-focused projects in music, theatre and the arts. This volume explores how collectively, these trends reflect the cultural and political awakening of people in recovery and growing recognition and celebration of multiple pathways of long-term addiction recovery.

Cancer and Self-help,"Mark A. Chesler, Barbara K. Chesney",N/A,1995,"Written for and about the special population of parents of children with cancer, this book explores the remarkable effectiveness of self-help groups and profiles their rapid rise as a resource complementing traditional health care. Mark A. Chesler and Barbara K. Chesney draw on their own experience as members of such groups and on a combined thirty years of research on self-help. They provide essential information for families of children with cancer (and other chronic life-threatening illnesses), for health-care professionals working with them, and for scholars of self-help and psychosocial processes in health care--including explanations of how self-help groups function, why they are effective, and how they can be created and maintained. The authors show that, through self-help groups, parents can learn coping skills, find personal affirmation and mutual support, and share the wisdom gained from their experiences. Chesler and Chesney find that group participation improves parents' coping capabilities in the face of terrible odds and fosters an increased sense of empowerment as they care and advocate for their children in an increasingly complex health care system. Cancer and Self-Help distills the experiences of more than fifty self-help groups and their members over twelve years. It also places cancer self-help groups in a larger context, comparing them to other social movement organizations and to other strategies for personal coping or change. The book includes the voices of individual parents and professionals recounting their experiences; detailed examples of group activities, programs, operating procedures, and organizational structures; fundamental, how-to information on forming a self-help group; comments on the roles and dilemmas of health care professionals in these groups and on the medical care system as a whole, and interpretations of these individual and organizational dynamics.",Health & Fitness,424,N/A,0,en

Cancer and Self-help,"Mark A. Chesler, Barbara K. Chesney",Univ of Wisconsin Press,1995,"Written for and about the special population of parents of children with cancer, this book explores the remarkable effectiveness of self-help groups and profiles their rapid rise as a resource complementing traditional health care. Mark A. Chesler and Barbara K. Chesney draw on their own experience as members of such groups and on a combined thirty years of research on self-help. They provide essential information for families of children with cancer (and other chronic life-threatening illnesses), for health-care professionals working with them, and for scholars of self-help and psychosocial processes in health care--including explanations of how self-help groups function, why they are effective, and how they can be created and maintained. The authors show that, through self-help groups, parents can learn coping skills, find personal affirmation and mutual support, and share the wisdom gained from their experiences. Chesler and Chesney find that group participation improves parents' coping capabilities in the face of terrible odds and fosters an increased sense of empowerment as they care and advocate for their children in an increasingly complex health care system. Cancer and Self-Help distills the experiences of more than fifty self-help groups and their members over twelve years. It also places cancer self-help groups in a larger context, comparing them to other social movement organizations and to other strategies for personal coping or change. The book includes the voices of individual parents and professionals recounting their experiences; detailed examples of group activities, programs, operating procedures, and organizational structures; fundamental, how-to information on forming a self-help group; comments on the roles and dilemmas of health care professionals in these groups and on the medical care system as a whole, and interpretations of these individual and organizational dynamics.",Health & Fitness,420,N/A,0,en
Self-Help Books,Sandra K. Dolby,University of Illinois Press,2010-10-01,"Understanding instead of lamenting the popularity of self-help books Based on a reading of more than three hundred self-help books, Sandra K. Dolby examines this remarkably popular genre to define ""self-help"" in a way that's compelling to academics and lay readers alike. Self-Help Books also offers an interpretation of why these books are so popular, arguing that they continue the well-established American penchant for self-education, they articulate problems of daily life and their supposed solutions, and that they present their content in a form and style that is accessible rather than arcane. Using tools associated with folklore studies, Dolby then examines how the genre makes use of stories, aphorisms, and a worldview that is at once traditional and contemporary. The overarching premise of the study is that self-help books, much like fairy tales, take traditional materials, especially stories and ideas, and recast them into extended essays that people happily read, think about, try to apply, and then set aside when a new embodiment of the genre comes along.",Social Science,210,N/A,0,en

The Bootstrap Fallacy,Robert K. Hudnut,N/A,1978,"It is the thesis of this book that we cannot move from achieving to superachieving except through crisis. We must have an experience of what we cannot do in order to break through to what we can. It is in the crisis of our inability to do anything, or at least not enough, that we experience, for perhaps the first time, an ability that is ""beyond us."" We find ourselves doing ""more than we ever dreamed we could."" It is also the area where religion begins. And that is the second thesis of the book -- namely, that in the critical experiences we all face, religion can happen. We can be ""boound back"" to who we are, which is what the word religion means at its root. We can be whole. Religion is for achievers, which is why so many business and labor and political and professional people in America are currently intrigued by religion. - Preface.",Christian life,146,N/A,0,en

Self-Care Secrets,Marc K Smith,Independently Published,2023-12-14,"Stop Stress from Stealing Your Spark: Unleash the Power of Self-Care with ""Self-Care Secrets"" Stressed to the max? Feeling like your mind's a hamster on a wheel and your mood's gone AWOL? You're not alone. In today's fast-paced world, mental health often takes a backseat to deadlines, to-do lists, and the relentless pursuit of ""more."" But what if there was a secret weapon you could wield against the stress monster, a practical guide to unlocking inner peace and mental resilience? Introducing ""Self-Care Secrets: Transform Your Mind, Mood, and Mental Health with Stress-Relieving Strategies"", your passport to a calmer, happier you. Meet John: A corporate warrior, John juggled spreadsheets and deadlines like a pro. But beneath the surface, his anxiety was a tightly coiled spring, threatening to snap. Sleep was a distant memory, his mood a rollercoaster, and his mind a jumble of racing thoughts. He felt like a shadow of his former self, disconnected from joy and purpose. Then, he stumbled upon ""Self-Care Secrets."" This is not your average self-help book. It's not about fluffy platitudes or one-size-fits-all solutions. It's a treasure trove of proven, science-backed strategies that actually work, tailored to the unique challenges of modern life. Imagine: Waking up with a sense of calm, not a cortisol-fueled panic attack. Taming the anxiety monster with simple, yet powerful techniques.

The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck (Smiths UK),Mark Manson,Harper Collins Publisher Incorporated,2017-12-14,"A self-help guide for millennials--superstar blogger Mark Manson shows us how to accept our faults, discover just how much pain we can tolerate, and stop deluding ourselves so that we can be better, happier people. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a self-help book aimed squarely at the millennial crowd, the ones who got gold medals for coming ninth in the running races. It posits that there are a limited number of fucks to give, so we better work out which ones we care about. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k--profane, direct, funny--is a response to the orgy of delusional positive thinking that goes on, both within the personal development industry and American culture at large. Manson's book makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that our ability to improve our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but rather on our ability to learn how to stomach lemons better. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and instead start confronting the painful truths, we begin to find in ourselves a spontaneous emergence of classic virtues such as courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness. The key demo for this book is the Millennials. They have different political beliefs, different life priorities, different buying habits, and different sexual/romantic behavior to all previous generations. They are known for being cynical, super ADHD, and entitled, but thanks to the Internet they also happen to be the most well-informed generation (they read more news than anybody else), so what would the generation-defining self-help book of today look like? The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k--alternative and anti-establishment--is that book. It says, ""Fuck positivity, because let's be honest, shit is fucked and we have to live with it."" It also says, ""We actually are extremely limited, so we should get to know our limitations rather than ignore them."" And it says, ""No, not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault."" Bottom line: the majority of what is shown through media and pop culture is manufactured and artificial. Money is nice, but giving a shit about what you do with your life is better. Wealth comes not from a big bank account but from a wealth of experience. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k delivers this message with bitchslap and gusto--along with a series of cool stories intermingled with the usual irreverent potty humor. This book is a much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk.",,224,N/A,0,en

Self-care in Social Work,"Kathy Cox, Sue Steiner",N A S W Press,2013,"Social workers encounter a number of unique forms of occupational stress on a daily basis. The more thoroughly they understand the stressors they face, the better-prepared social workers will be able to manage them successfully. Self-Care in Social Work is a guide to promote effective self-care tailored to the needs of social workers, including both individual and organizational approaches. On a personal level, it goes beyond the typical prescriptions to exercise, eat well, sleep more, and get a massage or meditate. In fact, the book is based on the premise that self-care should not be an add-on activity only happening in the rare instance there is some free time. Instead, it is conceptualized as a state of mind and considered an integral part of a social worker's training. In Self-Care in Social Work, the reader is taught how to approach individually oriented self-care through the development of self-awareness, self-regulation, and self-efficacy. At the organizational level, readers are guided through a process of learning about areas of match and mismatch between themselves and their agency structure and culture. The book is timely in that the economic downturn has put pressure on agencies to do more with less, which ultimately leads to stress. Burnout, compassion fatigue, and vicarious trauma are topics that students, instructors, practitioners, and administrators are concerned about. A practical guide to stress management and approaches to self-care, this book includes narratives gathered from both students and practitioners in the field. It is an excellent resource for social workers, counselors, and mental health professionals in education.--Back cover.",Social service,185,N/A,0,en

Decolonize Self-Care,"Alyson K. Spurgas, Zoe Meleo Erwin",Decolonize That!,2022-10-25,"Decolonize Self-Care emerges out of a careful exploration of seemingly casual trends on social media, and in the world at large, in which health and wellness had expansive markets. Capitalism itself seemed to be working in a new way--rather than markets operating under the signs of ""competition,"" ""assertiveness,"" and ""aggression"" (associated with masculinity)--""softness,"" ""gentleness,"" ""empathy,"" and ""compassion"" (associated with femininity) appeared to have a new and valuable place within the logic of the free market. Influencers on Instagram and celebrities hawked jade yoni eggs to promote feminine health, elixirs and mindfulness practices to enhance brain power and sexual desire, and clean eating and functional medicine to rid the body of toxins and impurities. These trends often involved ""Eastern,"" ""holistic,"" or ""alternative"" frameworks and techniques, promising increased health and wellness. To this end, ""self-care""--the broad theme bringing all of these trends together--appears to have become a keyword of our times. The promises of the self-care industry were ones that we feel attracted to and wary of all at once. Beyond concerns about the evidence base for products that promised increased health and wellness, the authors are skeptical of the politics and political economy surrounding these remedies. The markets--and marketers--were increasingly upper/middle-class cisgendered white women. And this demographic shift was often hailed as feminist. In Decolonize Self-Care, Spurgas and Meleo-Erwin argue that self-care has become big business with global markets valued at 4.2 trillion dollars (according to data published by the Global Wellness Institute in 2017). These wellness markets are dominated by elite white women in the global north. More specifically, elite white heterosexual womanhood per se is waged by the self-care industry to sell products, goods, and services. In effect, the self-care and wellness markets rely not just on inspiration but aspiration to generate profits. That elite white women are, by and large, the movers and shakers in these markets is ironic given the fact that much of the self-care and wellness industry traffics in vague notions of ""the East"" or indigeneity in marketing materials. In some cases, self-care and wellness goods, products, and services do have origins in the global south and indigenous cultures. Yet such populations typically do not benefit from the sale of these products by the self-care and wellness industries. Moreover, insatiable global north demand for them can impede local access to them. Self-care industry offers the illusion of change while keeping in place and bolstering the conditions--namely systems of racism, misogyny, cissexism, heterosexism, ableism, and colonialism--which have caused the need for self-care in the first place. Capitalism cannot be reformed to be more humane or able to provide care. Thus, the authors consider what damage is done when entrepreneurs, corporations, celebrities, and publics continue to invest in the reform of capitalism.",Political Science,220,N/A,0,en

Recovery Groups,Linda Farris Kurtz DPA,Oxford University Press,2014-10-31,"This book focuses on community self-help and support groups specifically in the context of recovery movements in addiction and mental health care. The idea of groups of recovering people meeting together may seem like a simple one and not one requiring much effort and thought; however, as this book will show, this is not the case. In Recovery Groups: A Guide to Creating, Leading, and Working with Groups for Addictions and Mental Health Conditions Linda Kurtz breaks down the recovery movement for addictions and mental health care into three sections. In the first section recovery concepts are broken down into two fields: how they differ and how they come together. The second section focuses on methods of working with independent self-help groups and leadership in support groups. Kurtz touches on the study of helping mechanisms, social climate, group teachings, group structure, and how to use each of these to improve group performance. In the third section of the book, Kurtz examines social and community actions from members involved in Twelve-Step fellowships and consumer survivor organizations.

Indeed, some say being masculine is bad for men's health. But is the situation so simple? This deeply engaging book explores both the psychological and sociological factors that affect men and their health. It investigates how notions of 'maleness' impact on the individual's approach to health and take-up of services, and provides clear foundations for best practice in care. Part 1 of the book explores and sets the theoretical scene. It asks why disparate fields have not previously been brought together and what theoretical frameworks could be utilised to assist in this process. Parts 2 and 3 consider empirical work in relation to men, health and illness, providing critical rather than simply descriptive accounts. Bringing together an international collection of contributors, Men, Masculinities and Health provides fresh ideas for practice; creating a fertile terrain for future debate that will excite all those interested in gender issues.",Medical,236,N/A,0,en

This case concerned the procedures followed, and decisions made, by the Executive and Supreme Court of the United States leading up to execution of a Paraguayan national by the Commonwealth of Virginia in May 1998.

Self-Help (Classic Reprint),Samuel Smiles,Forgotten Books,2017-05-22,"Excerpt from Self-Help Heaven helps those who help themselves is a well tried maxim, l embodying in a small compass the results of vast human experience. The spirit of self-help is the root of all genuine growth in the individual; and, exhibited in the lives of many, it constitutes the true source of national vigor and strength. Help from without is often enfeebling in its effects, but help from within invariably invigorates. Whatever is done for men or Classes, to a certain extent takes away the stimulus and necessity of doing for them selves; and where men are subjected to over-guidance and over-government, the inevitable tendency is to render them comparatively helpless.

Self-help Skills for People with Autism,"Stephen R. Anderson, Amy L. Jablonski, Marcus L. Thomeer",N/A,2007,"Learning self-help skills -- eating, dressing, toileting, and personal hygiene -- can be challenging for people with autism, but is essential for independence. This book thoroughly describes a systematic approach that parents (and educators) can use to teach basic self-care to children, ages 24 months to early teens, and even older individuals. With an encouraging tone, the authors -- behaviour analysts and psycholo-gists -- emphasise that it's worthwhile to devote the extra time and effort now to teach skills rather than have your child be forever dependent on others. The many case studies throughout the book depict individuals with deficits in specific self-care tasks, and demonstrate how a coordinated and system-atic approach is effective in teaching more complex skills. For example, a 12-year-old with the self-feeding skills of a toddler, who was excluded from the school cafeteria, is taught to stay at the table to eat a full meal using utensils. A chapter is devoted to each of the four skill areas (eating, dressing, toileting, personal hygiene) offering detailed insight and specific instruction strategies. Ap-pendices contain forms to complete for task analyses, instructional plans, and data collection. With the information in this book, parents can immediately start teaching their child, or refer back to the book to fine-tune skills as their child develops.",Education,187,N/A,0,en

The Warrior's Meditation,Richard L. Haight,N/A,2021-12-16,"The Warrior's Meditation, by award-winning author of The Unbound Soul, Richard L. Haight, teaches the original, instinctive, non-religious form of meditation that has been all but lost to the world. Richard L. Haight, master of four samurai arts, shares the best-kept secret in self-improvement, cognitive development, and stress-relief in the world. You may wonder how the Samurai's experience bears any resemblance to your modern life. After all, no armies or assassins seem to be trying to attack you or your town. In one way, we are not so different from the Samurai. With our busy lives, we don't have time to spend hours a day in meditation. Instead, we need a meditation that allows our actions in a high-pressure, fast-paced world to flow from a depth of awareness. The Warrior's Meditation helps you access and express from that depth naturally.Surprisingly, a significant body scientific research verifies the benefits associated with regular meditation practice. Below are some of the benefits associated with daily meditation: ? Boosts health through improved immune function, decreased cellular inflammation and pain. ? Boosts happiness by increasing positive emotion while decreasing anxiety, depression, and stress. ? Improves your ability to introspect, which provides a more holistic, grounded life perspective. ? Improves your social life as it increases emotional intelligence and compassion while reducing feelings of insecurity. ? Improves your brain by increasing grey matter in areas related to paying attention, positive emotions, emotional regulation, and self-control. ? Reduces emotional reactivity. ? Improves memory, creativity and abstract thinking.The Warrior's Meditation is unlike any other meditation. This method is flexible in application, which allows it to blend with whatever your day has in store. Through short, daily sessions, the many scientifically verified cognitive and physical health benefits of daily meditation will open up to you through your active life. No longer do you need to retreat from life to meditate, for with The Warrior's Meditation, you can bring calm, clear awareness and vibrant life with you wherever you are. Eventually, you will fully embody meditation as a way of being, not just a doing.",,0,N/A,0,en
Real Self-Care,Pooja Lakshmin,Random House,2023-02-23,"'A bracingly honest, galvanising and necessarily provocative look at ""self-care"" through a political and feminist lens' Pandora Sykes 'This isn't just another self-help book. A clear-eyed look at the way social systems drain our energy, and a concrete set of principles to rely on as we declare independence from these systems' Martha Beck 'A helpful and timely book that every woman needs' Julia Samuel What does self-care really mean? From puppy yoga to gua shas, we are promised pastel-coloured 'quick fixes' to long-term social problems that cause burnout and stress. But the truth is you can't meditate your way out of a 40-hour work week with no childcare. So when these promises prove empty, we are made to feel like failures within a system that is failing us. Now, psychiatrist Dr. Pooja Lakshmin offers a sustainable practice for real self-care. Based on her clinical and personal experience, Dr Lakshmin's revolutionary framework reimagines self-care as an ongoing, internal process that involves making difficult decisions in line with your values, putting boundaries in place, treating yourself with compassion and asserting your power. Practising it has the power to change your relationships, your workplace, and our broken systems. Her work serves as a wake-up call, reminding us that wellbeing is not a product to buy, but a way to be. It is time to let go of the illusions of wellness and start practising real self-care. Because the result - having ownership over your life - is nothing less than a personal and social revolution.",Self-Help,135,N/A,0,en

But from the off this delightfully dry, wise and pragmatic book offers something quite different - a sober, somewhat stern, but ultimately generous guide to living in a world blighted by modernity and taxes. Nostalgic, funny and charming, this book somewhat bad-temperedly insists the reader not get ideas above his or her station - yet it ends up delivering a bracing, empowering guide to knowing yourself and living well (despite it all). Oliver Burkeman called this book ""a place of stability and solid ground amid the rushing omnibuses"".

As a shy person, you may also experience panic attacks that make it even more likely that you’ll avoid social situations. With The Mindfulness and Acceptance Workbook for Social Anxiety and Shyness, the authors’ acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) program for overcoming shyness has become available to the public for the first time. This program has been found to be highly effective in research studies for the treatment of social anxiety disorder and related subclinical levels of shyness. In the first section, you will confront performance fears, test anxiety, shy bladder, and interpersonal fears—fundamental symptoms of social anxiety. The second part helps you learn psychological flexibility to improve your ability to accept the feelings, thoughts, and behavior that may arise as you learn to work past your anxiety. By keeping your values front and center, you will gradually learn to move beyond your fears and toward greater social confidence.

"Self Help, Inc.",Micki McGee,Oxford University Press,2005-09-08,"Why doesn't self-help help? Cultural critic Micki McGee puts forward this paradoxical question as she looks at a world where the market for self-improvement products--books, audiotapes, and extreme makeovers--is exploding, and there seems to be no end in sight. Rather than seeing narcissism at the root of the self-help craze, as others have contended, McGee shows a nation relying on self-help culture for advice on how to cope in an increasingly volatile and competitive work world. Self-Help, Inc. reveals how makeover culture traps Americans in endless cycles of self-invention and overwork as they struggle to stay ahead of a rapidly restructuring economic order. A lucid and fascinating treatment of the modern obsession with work and self-improvement, this lively book will strike a chord with its acute diagnosis of the self-help trap and its sharp suggestions for how we can address the alienating conditions of modern work and family life.",Social Science,305,N/A,0,en

Self Care Through Prayer and Forgiveness,Dr. Helen Orme,Xlibris Corporation,2011-03-29,"Forgiveness is a channel God has made for the fl ow of fresh water. The scripture state: . . . out of your belly shall fl ow rivers of living waters (John 7:38 [KJV]). Rivers of life, rivers of fresh ideas and rivers of fresh creative energy spring from the belly to refresh the heart, mind, and soul, bringing greater reasons and passion to love and give again. This depth of self-care stimulates you to the core with a new surge of the Holy Spirit and creates a divine release of laughter, joy, and peace. This invigorating state of being is nurtured by the Holy Spirit. Prayer is one of the vehicles God uses to talk to you. Forgiveness is one of His commandments. We routinely use both of these disciplines to nurture and minister to others. It's vital to use them when caring for yourself, too. Those who do, experience spiritual depth and wholeness because they are renewed in their spirit every day and abide in a fresh place. The act of letting go is another action you can take toward self-care. It is essential to self-care to release, and to let go. You can't receive anything when you're fullfull of caring and attending to others, full of unsettled concerns, emotions, or thoughts. Your ability to let go allows you to move to a place of wholeness. It creates the space you need to receive more. It is impossible to pour more into a full cup. By letting go of past experiences you create room for something new to emerge. Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them (Isa. 42:9 [KJV]).",Religion,152,N/A,0,en

For mental health professionals who must regularly guard against compassion fatigue and secondary traumatization, intentional self-care isn’t just essential; it’s a survival tool. If therapists don’t take proper care of themselves, they can’t do their work effectively. Taking up an exercise program, going on a vacation, turning to supportive social networks, while helpful remedies to the stresses of the job, are not always feasible and the results are often only short term. Synthesizing the latest thinking in mindfulness, neuroscience, energy medicine, and spiritual disciplines, Simple Self-Care for Therapists offers immediate relief in doable, bite-sized nuggets—easy exercises that can be seamlessly integrated into your current workday routine with little fuss. Over 60 restorative practices are presented—tools for (1) grounding, (2) energizing, and (3) relaxing—organized as antidotes to the most common pathologies that therapists suffer: vicarious trauma, compassion fatigue, and burnout. Bush, a therapist with over 25 years of experience, walks readers through the descriptions and simple implementation of each practice, with illuminating stories from her own professional experiences. Whether you’re in a staff meeting, conducting a therapy session, writing a progress report, or attending a workshop, these convenient exercises can be dipped into as needed. A go-to resource of self-care tools, every therapist, no matter their background or approach, now has the ability to prevent stress, avoid internalization, revive their spirit, and restore a sense of well-being.",Psychology,204,N/A,0,en

The Self-Help Compulsion,Beth Blum,Columbia University Press,2020-01-28,"Samuel Beckett as a guru for business executives? James Joyce as a guide to living a good life? The notion of notoriously experimental authors sharing a shelf with self-help books might seem far-fetched, yet a hidden history of rivalry, influence, and imitation links these two worlds. In The Self-Help Compulsion, Beth Blum reveals the profound entanglement of modern literature and commercial advice from the late nineteenth century to the present day. Blum explores popular reading practices in which people turn to literature in search of practical advice alongside modern writers’ rebukes of such instrumental purposes. As literary authors positioned themselves in opposition to people like Samuel Smiles and Dale Carnegie, readers turned to self-help for the promises of mobility, agency, and practical use that serious literature was reluctant to supply. Blum unearths a series of unlikely cases of the love-hate relationship between serious fiction and commercial advice, from Gustave Flaubert’s mockery of early DIY culture to Dear Abby’s cutting diagnoses of Nathanael West and from Virginia Woolf’s ambivalent polemics against self-improvement to the ways that contemporary global authors such as Mohsin Hamid and Tash Aw explicitly draw on the self-help genre. She also traces the self-help industry’s tendency to popularize, quote, and adapt literary wisdom and considers what it might have to teach today’s university. Offering a new history of self-help’s origins, appeal, and cultural and literary import around the world, this book reveals that self-help’s most valuable secrets are not about getting rich or winning friends but about how and why people read.",Literary Criticism,507,N/A,0,en

Howard Brockman, LCSW has written his second book, this time emphasizing the importance of self-care for the legions of people supporting and taking care of others. While there are books that have been written about the challenges to professionals such as social workers, nurses and psychologists to becoming burned out, Brockman’s book is written also for the millions of untrained non-professionals who are being recruited daily to care for their elderly parents. Do you fit into either of these categories? He describes the many influences that lead to compassion fatigue and becoming “infected” by the feelings of others. This is all about how unconscious empathy can take sensitive caregivers down a never-ending spiral to adrenal fatigue and depression. In Chapter 2, “Characteristics of High-Intensity Relaters,” Brockman describes the primary personality of those helpers whose currency is relationship and who easily fall prey to subtle energetic influences that erode their vital force. Externally referencing to others’ needs first tends to be one of their traits. Chapter 6, “Prevent Self-Sabotage,” is filled with practical ways to stay focused and positive while overcoming old, repetitive and negative inner chatter. Confronting your tyrannizing inner critic is never easy—Brockman tells you how. He identifies different types of “energy drainers” that use our energy to enliven themselves and deplete ours. He does a good job explaining how to create secure and persistent energetic boundaries with difficult and demanding people and other disruptive environments. This is perhaps the most important theme woven throughout the book, for the helper personality tends to not know how to say NO to requests from others. Learning how to establish reliable energetic boundaries is incredibly important for protecting against the interpersonal hazard he refers to as psychotoxic contamination that can become cumulative over time and generate serious long-term health consequences. Dark and heavy energy can settle into and invade the body to wreak havoc with one’s health and emotional stability. The good news is that you can effectively create these boundaries and more importantly, learn how to sustain them amidst the ongoing demands of the people you are helping. He spends a chapter on how to use specific energy psychology techniques for emergency self-care, providing fascinating case examples to illustrate how to prevent post-traumatic stress from building up to become PTSD. Brockman spends some time explaining the importance of optimizing your self-care by managing your chi, and how plants, the natural world and flower essences can support helpers to maintain their inner balance and overall harmony. In Chapter 11, “Making It Happen From Within,” you will discover well-described and powerful imagery techniques for manifesting positive self-care outcomes for yourself. Brockman then teaches you how to connect to and work with your inner guides for reliable personal and professional guidance. The power of a caregiver’s presence is highlighted in the concluding chapter, discussing how “being the blessing” actually creates collective coherence in the immediate caregiver’s environment and thus positively affects those who are being cared for. For readers who would like to measure and determine the degree of their own present health and well-being, there are two self-assessment checklists for high-intensity relaters in Appendix 2 that can also be downloaded from his website, www.DynamicEnergeticHealing.com.",,183,N/A,0,en

"Redefining Murder, Transforming Emotion",Kristen Discola,Routledge,2020-11-09,"Offering insights based on years of original research, Redefining Murder, Transforming Emotion: An Exploration of Forgiveness after Loss Due to Homicide investigates the ideas and experiences of individuals who have lost loved ones to homicide (co-victims) in order to advance our understanding of the emotional transformation of forgiveness. It stands at the crux of two vibrant, growing fields: criminal victimology and the sociology of emotion. Analysis of 36 intensive interviews with co-victims and three years of participant observation of self-help groups and other victim-centered events offers a multidimensional understanding of forgiveness. Specifically, this book answers the questions of ""What?,"" ""When?,"" ""How?,"" and ""Why?"" forgiveness occurs by exploring co-victims’ ideas about forgiveness, the differential experiences of various groups of people, the processes through which forgiveness occurs in a variety of extreme circumstances of homicide, and co-victims’ motivations toward forgiveness. The book concludes with commentary on overarching conclusions based on this work; theoretical and practical implications; suggestions for directions for future inquiry; and an in-depth account of the methodological strategies employed to gather such rich and nuanced data. This book will appeal to academics and students alike, within relevant fields, including sociology, criminology, restorative justice, victim services, psychology, and social welfare, as well as individuals seeking a better understanding of their own experiences, including co-victims or others whose lives have been altered by extreme forms of violence and upheaval. Its detailed postscript will also serve well those interested in qualitative methodology in social science research.",Political Science,219,N/A,0,en

WOMEN EMPOWERMENT THROUGH SELF-HELP GROUPS,Dr.  A. Ramalingaiah and Dr. M. Muninarayanappa,Ashok Yakkaldevi,2023-03-28,"The efforts made by the Indian development planners during the past decades are commendable in reducing poverty and other dimensions of human development. However, a number of tasks remain unfinished. Abject poverty is still a stark reality for millions of Indians. Also, wide gaps in human development among states, districts and social groups exist. There is an urgent need for more concerted efforts to achieve greater social and gender equality. Women in India are victims of a multiple socio-economic and cultural factors. They are an integral part of every economy. All round development and harmonious growth of a nation would be possible only when women are considered as equal partners in progress with men. Emancipation of women is a pre-requisite for a NATION'S ECONOMIC development and social upliftment. Poverty is the main obstacle for the improvement of the women.

I'm a dad and I'm scared.

Sufi Mysticism,Krishna Prakash Bahadur,Ess Ess Publication,1999,"Exploding the fanaticism of religions, the Sufis came with their message of love, accommodation and truth. Originating as a reaction against Islamic bigotry and persecution by the Arab Muslims, particularly the Abbasi Caliphs, they gradually spread all over the world. Unfortunately, some writers have been loath to recognise Sufism's broad mindedness and are inclined to squeeze into the narrow crevices of fanaticism and in the process to negate its effinity to asceticism, neo-platonism, Vedanta and Vaishnavism. It is often forgotten that Sufism is neither a religion, nor a specific belief, nor a school of thought. It is more a way of life, and a teaching which is essentially spiritual and aimed at discovering the real nature of the Soul. All persons, what-ever religion or belief they belong to, are candidates for the Sufi teaching, provided they have complete faith in the teacher and have been able to conquer their egos. This study of Sufism endeavours to place it in its proper perspective as a universal doctrine open to all who are spiritually ripe to receive it.",Religion,256,N/A,0,en

Evaluating Teacher Effectiveness by Self-assessment,Kirsi Tirri,N/A,1993,"The purpose of this study was to explore an American model (Harris 1986) of effective classroom teaching behaviors as a framework for teachers' professional growth. The particular focus was on the self-assessment component of the methods related to the model. An empirical approach was adopted, and comparative data were gathered from American and Finnish teachers using a common self-evaluation instrument. The study identified and analyzed cross-cultural differences and culture-specific behaviors. The analysis revealed that a complete fit between the model and the data could not be found. Discriminant analysis revealed interesting differences in the evaluation of teachers from different teaching traditions. The American teachers were found to be much more dynamic in their classroom behavior than their Finnish colleagues; Finnish teachers reflected their academic tradition well by giving much more emphasis to a ""businesslike"" type of behavior. The research is presented in eight chapters as follows: (1) Introduction; (2) Teachers' professional development; (3) The reform traditions; (4) Methods for helping teachers' professional growth; (5) The empirical framework; (6) Cross-cultural validity of the Harris model; (7) Dimensions of teacher classroom behavior; and (8) Discussions on methodology and conclusions. Appendixes provide a copy of the questionnaire in English and in Finnish, and computer listings for chapters 6 and 7. (Contains approximately 175 references.)

Straight to the Point,Julie Leibrich,Otago University Press,1993,"""Based on interviews with randomly selected former offenders, this book takes a fresh look at the course and nature of crime. It cuts across theorising, trying to understand what people actually experience, why they do what they do, and to get a picture of successful change."" ""As the Justice Department's Centennial Fellow, Dr Leibrich tracked down fifty offenders who had been sentenced to supervision in 1987 and not reoffended three years later. She asked them why not. The people who participated in the interviews did so because they wanted to, and their stories make this a moving piece of research."" ""The author soon found that 'going straight' was 'curved' - that the people she interviewed did not fall into such neat categories as 'straight' and 'crooked'. Her methodology (which she describes in detail in the appendices) needed to grapple with the many subtleties of her material and drew on different kinds of research strategies, utilising their strengths. In an exciting account of her approach to problem-solving on the basis of trial and error, and intuition, the reader gains insight into the personal experience of the research process, the pitfalls and highlights, the frustration and anxiety of data collection - 'Will I find Trinity? Is the guy I'm going to meet really okay? Do I include people who have reoffended? Does my write-up reflect people's real experience?' The result, this book, is tight and rigorous in its analysis, but does justice to the richness and warmth of the data, valuing the words and actions of the people who participated in the study.""--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

The Adult Baby Identity: A Self-help Guide (Diaper Version),Dylan Lewis,AB Discovery,2024-10-15,"Dylan Lewis' fourth book of the Adult Baby Identity quadrilogy: a self-help guide. Knowing who we are as individuals is the most important journey in our lives and for many, it is the most difficult one. Even for people we call ‘vanilla’, with no apparent kinks and oddities, it is a herculean task. But when you are an Adult Baby, it is a vastly more complex mission. Add being sissy to the mix and we are already pushing uphill and failing miserably. But if we don’t know who we are, we act as if we are someone we are not. We try to create a personality not fully our own. We create masks and in doing so, we create problems for ourselves and others around us. This is the true value of books like this and others along the same vein. ABDL is not like other identity problems. It is unique, different and requires a perspective all of its own. It is not about gender – although gender issues can be involved. It is not about sexual preference – although that can be involved as well. It is primarily about age, and being powerfully driven back to a time of life most have left behind and yet, we still literally inhabit.",Psychology,156,N/A,0,en
Help Me!,Marianne Power,Grove Press,2019-01-15,"“Consistently entertaining . . . she writes with unflinching honesty . . . Bridget Jones meets Buddha in this plucky, heartwarming, comical debut memoir.” —Kirkus Reviews (starred review) For years journalist Marianne Power lined her bookshelves with dog-eared copies of definitive guides on how to live your best life, dipping in and out of self-help books when she needed them most. Then, one day, she woke up to find that the life she hoped for and the life she was living were worlds apart—and she set out to make some big changes. Marianne decided to finally find out if her elusive “perfect existence” —the one without debt, anxiety, or hangover Netflix marathons, the one where she healthily bounced around town and met the cashmere-sweater-wearing man of her dreams—really did lie in the pages of our best known and acclaimed self-help books. She vowed to test a book a month for one year, following its advice to the letter, taking what she hoped would be the surest path to a flawless new her. But as the months passed and Marianne’s reality was turned upside down, she found herself confronted with a different question: Self-help can change your life, but is it for the better? With humor, audacity, disarming candor and unassuming wisdom, in Help Me Marianne Power plumbs the trials and tests of being a modern woman in a “have it all” culture, and what it really means to be our very best selves. “Equal parts touching and hilarious, Power’s account of the year she spent following the tenets of self-help books will make you feel better about your own flawed life.” —People",Self-Help,327,2,1,en

"I'm Dysfunctional, You're Dysfunctional",Wendy Kaminer,Addison Wesley Publishing Company,1992-06-20,"""If a Nobel Prize were awarded for clarity and sanity in a world gone mad, Wendy Kaminer would be on her way to Stockholm."" -- Newsday Anyone who's ever wondered why talking about addiction has become so fashionable, shuddered on hearing an ""adult child"" compare his upbringing with the Holocaust, or felt that admitting one's powerlessness is a frightening prospect for a participatory democracy will be delighted by this bracingly outspoken and intelligent work of social criticism. Whether she is infiltrating twelve-step meetings and codependency workshops or evaluating the claims of gurus from Shirley MacLaine to M. Scott Peck, Wendy Kaminer deftly diagnoses a national movement (and multi-million-dollar industry) with a strong tendency toward authoritarianism, a cult of victimhood, and a nasty streak of covert religiosity. Controversial, original, and brilliantly reasoned, I'm Dysfunctional, You're Dysfunctional changes the way we think about self-help -- and helps us to think for ourselves. ""Explores...the ominous effect of all this institutionalized whining on our culture and politics...an incisive and provocative argument."" -- Washington Post ""Extremely witty...Ms. Kaminer has a real gift for honing her anger to an epigrammatic edge....We can make good use of [her] skepticism."" -- The New York Times Book Review",Psychology,200,N/A,0,en

Psychology for You and Me,Valerie Jay,N/A,2017-08-17,"This book is about the power of thought. How we manage ourselves and our lives is dependent on our thinking. And our thinking is governed ultimately by the structure of our brains. By better understanding your brain and how it deals with your stress, you can begin to make sense of your anxiety within the framework of positive psychology. You can learn to manage your life constructively rather than in a negatively destructive way. There are simple psychological and biological explanations illustrated with easy to understand graphics, along with many examples covering everyday situations and problems. All of these therapies show the benefits to be had from controlled thinking. Anyone who genuinely wants to can acquire the skills of controlled thinking as presented in these pages. Psychology for You and Me puts you in the driver's seat. It gives you the option to delve as deeply into the background science as you want to. You can stick with practical suggestions and simple explanations, or go deeper into the biological detail, as for example with the reward system, neuro-plasticity and epigenetics. If you are interested, you can even find out more about the biological and evolutionary background of early human life on Earth. Valerie Jay has spent years studying neuroscience and psychology and this easily-read volume is the result.

The many types of computer-aided psychotherapy and how each might be accessed are detailed together with the pros and cons of such help and the functions it can serve. The authors review prevention as well as treatment. The book describes and summarizes 97 computer-aided self-help systems in 175 studies according to the types of problem they aim to alleviate. These include phobic, panic, obsessive-compulsive and post-traumatic disorders, depression, anxiety, eating disorders, sexual problems, smoking, alcohol and drug misuse, schizophrenia, insomnia, pain and tinnitus distress, and childhood problems such as encopresis, autism and asthma. Within each type of problem the systems are described according to whether they are used on the internet, CD-ROM, phone, handheld or other device. The final chapter shows how internet self-help systems with phone or email support allow clinics to become more virtual than physical. It also discusses methods of screening suitability and of supporting users, constraints to delivery, uptake and completion, cost-effectiveness, and the place of computer-aided self-help in healthcare provision.

Bhagvad-Gita: Treatise of Self-help,BS Murthy,Self Imprint,2011-09-16,"Bhagavad-Gita is the most beautiful, perhaps the only true philosophical song existing in any known tongue’ – so opined William von Humboldt. The spiritual ethos and the philosophical outlook that the Bhagvad - Gita postulates paves the way for the liberation of man, who, as Rousseau said, ‘being born free, is everywhere in chains’. But equally it is a mirror of human psychology, which enables man to discern his debilities for appropriate redressal. All the same, the boon of an oral tradition that kept it alive for over two millennia became its bane with the proliferation of interpolations therein. Besides muddying its pristine philosophy, these insertions affect the sequential conformity and structural economy of the grand discourse. What is worse, to the chagrin of the majority of the Hindus, some of these legitimize the inimical caste system while upholding the priestly perks and prejudices. However,. the methodical codification of interpolations carried out here, for the first time ever, puts the true character of Gita in proper perspective. Identified here are hundred and ten slokas of deviant nature and or of partisan character, the source of so much misunderstanding about this book extraordinary, in certain sections of the Hindu fold. Thus, in the long run, exposing and expunging these mischievous insertions is bound to bring in new readers from these quarters to this over two millennia old classic besides altering the misconceptions of the existing adherents. Hence, this 'Samkshipta Gita' seeks to restore to the Bhagvad Gita, its original character by ridding it of hundred and ten interpolations, which tend to keep the skeptics away from it. In this modern rendition, the beauty of the Sanskrit slokas is reflected in the rhythmic flow of the English verses of poetic proportions even as the attendant philosophy of the song that is the Gita is captured in contemporary idiom for easy comprehension.",Antiques & Collectibles,72,N/A,0,en

"Global Perspectives of COVID-19 Pandemic on Health, Education, and Role of Media","Saroj Pachauri, Ash Pachauri",Springer Nature,2023,"This open access book discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various aspects of life on a global scale. It analyzes the challenges in the healthcare system during the second wave of COVID-19, such as overstressed human resources in tertiary facilities, lack of trained healthcare workers, and inadequate infrastructure at secondary-level facilities. The book shows that there has been more disruption in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. It presents how the pandemic drove economies into recession and offers a roadmap to advance equality of access to and sustainability of resources.

Institutionalizing State Responsibility,Vincent-Joël Proulx,Oxford University Press,2016-05-06,"Since the 9/11 attacks, international organizations have become actively engaged in devising counterterrorism strategies and frameworks. This monograph examines the role UN organs can play in implementing the law of State responsibility in global security contexts, using transnational terrorism as its principal case study. The institutional mechanisms utilized by the UN in implementing State responsibility are assessed in detail, shedding light on how the ICJ, the General Assembly and the Security Council contribute to the implementation of State responsibility in the context of global security. By acknowledging the Security Council's role as a post-9/11 legislator, this book argues that the Council can play an important and sometimes determinant role in implementing a State's legal responsibility for failing to prevent terrorism, both inside and outside the Chapter VII framework. Featuring a discussion of the more controversial consequences flowing from State responsibility, this monograph also explores the prospect of injured States adopting forcible measures against responsible States for their failures to prevent terrorism. The book investigates whether self-defence and other forcible reactions, envisaged both inside and outside the Council, can be reconciled with State responsibility principles.",Law,401,N/A,0,en

Literature and Ageing,"Elizabeth Barry, Margery Vibe Skagen",Boydell & Brewer,2020,"New approaches to the topics of old age and becoming old depicted in a range of texts from modern literature. The central focus of this book is the experience of growing old as represented in literature from the mid-nineteenth century to the present day: an experience shaped by changes in longevity, a new science of senescence, the availability of state pensions, and other phenomena of recent history. The collection considers the increasing prominence of stories of ageing, challenging the idea that old age is an uneventful time outside of the parameters of literary narrative. Instead, age increasingly is the story. As the older population swells, political crises are construed as the old stealing from the young, and the rights of older people are sacrificed to the economics of care, it becomes ever more important to think about and question, as literature does, the symbolic aspects of ageing - the cultural imaginary that determines the way that society sees old age. The work in this volume explores age stories in relation to futurity, precarity and climate change. It brings to light narratives of resistance to colonial imperialism and reproductive futurism framed in terms of age; and tests the lived experience of growing old and the challenge it offers to individualistic conceptions of selfhood, work and care. The literary works examined - hailing from England, North America, Japan and the Caribbean, and including texts by Margaret Drabble, Samuel Beckett and Matthew Thomas - ask how we feel about ageing - so often the determinant of how we think about it.",Literary Criticism,233,N/A,0,en

Concepts and Controversies in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,"Jonathan S. Abramowitz, Arthur C. Houts",Springer Science & Business Media,2006-11-22,"Few syndromes in psychopathology generate as much popular curiosity and clinical exploration as does obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Since the 1970s, research on OCD has increased exponentially. Speci?c advances include an improved grasp of the heterogeneity of the disorder, identi?cation of putative subtyping schemes, and the development of increasingly sophisticated theoretical models of the etiology and maintenance. Perhaps most importantly, research has led to advances in treatment; andwhereasthe?rstlinetherapies(cognitive-behaviortherapyandserotonergicm- ication) are not entirely effective for every sufferer, they have transformed OCD from an unmanageable lifetime af?iction into a treatable problem that need not reduce quality of life. Despite the aforementioned advances, there have emerged a number of sharp disagreements concerning OCD. Differences have surfaced over phenomenological issues, etiological models, and approaches to treatment, and often occur (but not exclusively) along disciplinary lines between biologically oriented and cogniti- behaviorally oriented authorities. For example, medical approaches posit that abn- mal biological processes cause OCD, whereas psychosocial formulations emphasize the role of learning and dysfunctional cognitions. Yet because theoretical conjecture andempirical?ndingsfromwithineachtraditionaretypicallyaddressedtowardd- tinct and narrow audiences, clinicians, researchers, and students with broad interests are hindered from gaining a clear grasp of the diverse (and sometimes polarized) perspectives.",Psychology,436,5,1,en

Evaluating the Brain Disease Model of Addiction,"Nick Heather, Matt Field, Antony Moss, Sally Satel",Routledge,2022-03-07,"This ground-breaking book advances the fundamental debate about the nature of addiction. As well as presenting the case for seeing addiction as a brain disease, it brings together all the most cogent and penetrating critiques of the brain disease model of addiction (BDMA) and the main grounds for being skeptical of BDMA claims. The idea that addiction is a brain disease dominates thinking and practice worldwide. However, the editors of this book argue that our understanding of addiction is undergoing a revolutionary change, from being considered a brain disease to a disorder of voluntary behavior. The resolution of this controversy will determine the future of scientific progress in understanding addiction, together with necessary advances in treatment, prevention, and societal responses to addictive disorders. This volume brings together the various strands of the contemporary debate about whether or not addiction is best regarded as a brain disease. Contributors offer arguments for and against, and reasons for uncertainty; they also propose novel alternatives to both brain disease and moral models of addiction. In addition to reprints of classic articles from the addiction research literature, each section contains original chapters written by authorities on their chosen topic. The editors have assembled a stellar cast of chapter authors from a wide range of disciplines – neuroscience, philosophy, psychiatry, psychology, cognitive science, sociology, and law – including some of the most brilliant and influential voices in the field of addiction studies today. The result is a landmark volume in the study of addiction which will be essential reading for advanced students and researchers in addiction as well as professionals such as medical practitioners, psychiatrists, psychologists of all varieties, and social workers.",Psychology,725,N/A,0,en

Gender and Governance in Rural Services,"The World Bank, International Food Policy Research Institute",World Bank Publications,2010-01-27,"'Gender and Governance in Rural Services' provides policy-relevant knowledge on strategies to improve agricultural and rural service delivery with a focus on providing more equitable access to these services, especially for women. It focuses India, Ethiopia, and Ghana, and focuses on two public services: agricultural extension, as an example of an agricultural service, and on drinking water, as an example of rural service that is not directly related to agriculture but is of high relevance for rural women. It provides empirical microlevel evidence on how different accountability mechanisms for agricultural advisory services and drinking water provision work in practice, and analyzes factors that influence the suitability of different governance reform strategies that aim at making service provision more gender responsive. It presents major findings from the quantitative and qualitative research conducted under the project in the three countries, which are analyzed in a qualitative way to identify major patterns of accountability routes in agricultural and rural service provision and to assess their gender dimension. The book is intended for use by a wide audience interested in agricultural and rural service provision, including researchers, members of the public administration, policy makers, and staff from nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and international development agencies who are involved in the design and management of reform efforts, projects, and programs dealing with rural service provision.",Social Science,380,N/A,0,en

Making an Impact on Mental Health,"James N. Kirby, Paul Gilbert",Routledge,2020-09-22,"Advancements in research in psychological science have afforded great insights into how our minds work. Making an Impact on Mental Health analyses contemporary, international research to examine a number of core themes in mental health, such as mindfulness and attachment, and provides an understanding of the sources of mentally ill health and strategies for remediation.

"Micro Finance, Self-help Groups (SHGs) and Poverty Eradication in India",N. Mani,N/A,2014,"In India, micro finance is the provision of a diverse range of financial services and products - including small loans (micro credit), saving accounts, insurance, pensions, and money transfers - that are designed to assist those living in poverty who are not able to access financial services in the mainstream banking sector. The objective of micro finance is to help poor people escape poverty, through the support of micro entrepreneurs and small businesses. Several micro finance institutions have succeeded in reaching India's poorest of the poor by devising innovative strategies. Above all, many micro credit programs have targeted one of the most vulnerable groups in society, i.e. women who live in households that own little or no assets. By providing opportunities for self-employment, these programs have significantly increased women's security, autonomy, self-confidence, and status within the household. This book examines the objectives of micro finance in India, looking at the role of the delivering agents and their interface with the needy, promoting economic growth with greater equity.",Microfinance,0,N/A,0,en
Enforcing International Law,Math Noortmann,Routledge,2016-04-29,"Until recently, the fundamental link between two basic concepts in international law, namely the right to self-help and the obligation to settle disputes by peaceful means, has been neglected in doctrine and practice. The main issue is that international law traditionally recognizes the right of states to safeguard their own rights by resorting to countermeasures as well as the obligation to settle their disputes by accepted and recognized diplomatic and judicial procedures. Both concepts are based on their own merits, which are assumed to be valid in contemporary international law. It is the primary purpose of this study to determine which rules and principles govern the relationship between the two concepts. The book's major findings arise from an analysis of scholarly work, supported by examples from five different case studies. Drawing insights from legal as well as political science, it will be a valuable resource for students, academics and policy makers in international law, international relations and related areas.",Law,205,N/A,0,en

The Locus of Care,"Peregrine Horden, Richard Smith",Routledge,2013-01-11,"The care of the needy and the sick is delivered by various groups including immediate family, the wider community, religious organisations and the State funded institutions. The Locus of Care provides an historical perspective on welfare detailing who carers were in the past, where care was provided, and how far the boundary between family and state or informal and organised institutions have changed over time. Eleven international contributors provide a wide-ranging examination of themes, such as child care, mental health, and provision for the elderly and question the idea that there has been a recent evolutionary shift from informal provision to institutional care. Chapters on Europe and England use case studies and link evidence from ancient and medieval periods to contemporary problems and the recent past, whilst studies on China and South Africa look to the future of welfare throughout the world. By placing welfare in its historical, social, cultural and demographic contexts, Locus of Care reassesses community and institutional care and the future expectations of welfare provision.",History,301,N/A,0,en

Vocation and the Politics of Work,Jeffrey Scholes,Rowman & Littlefield,2013,"Since Martin Luther, vocations or callings have had a close relationship with daily work. It is a give-and-take relationship in which the meaning of a vocation typically negotiates with the kinds of work available (and vice-versa) at any given time. While ""vocation language"" still has currency in Western culture, today's predominant meaning of vocation has little to do with the actual work performed on a job. Jeffrey Scholes contends that recent theological treatments of the Protestant concept of vocation, both academic and popular, often unwittingly collude with consumer culture to circulate a concept of vocation that is detached from the material conditions of work. The result is a consumer-friendly vocation that is rendered impotent to inform and, if necessary, challenge the political norms of the workplace. For example, he classifies Rick Warren's concept of ""purpose"" in his best-selling book, The Purpose-Driven Life, as a functional equivalent of vocation that acts in this way. Other popular uses of vocation along with insights culled from traditional theology and consumer culture studies help Scholes reveal the current state of vocations in the West. Using recent scholarship in the field of political theology, he argues that resisting commodification is a possibility and a prerequisite for a ""political vocation,"" if it is at all able to engage the norms that regulate and undermine the pursuit of justice in many modern workplaces.",Business & Economics,192,N/A,0,en

Behavioral Therapy for Rural Substance Abusers,"Carl Leukefeld, Theodore Godlaski, James Clark, Cynthia Brown, Lon Hays",University Press of Kentucky,2014-10-17,"The problems and needs of rural substance abusers vary from those of abusers in urban areas. Accordingly, the means of treatment must acknowledge and address these differences. Despite this call for specialized care, no theoretically grounded therapy has yet been made available to rural patients. Behavioral Therapy for Rural Substance Abusers, developed and piloted over three years by University of Kentucky faculty and staff and substance abuse counselors in rural eastern Kentucky, provides a model for effective treatment for this segment of the population. A two-phase outpatient treatment, this approach combines group and individual sessions in an environment that is both comfortable and useful for the client. The success of this method lies in its regional approach to therapy. Rather than using role-playing techniques to examine old behaviors, therapy is designed around storytelling activities. Rural patients respond more positively to such time-honored traditions and thus become active participants in their own treatment. This manual offers a clear and well-constructed guide through the strategies of Structured Behavioral Outpatient Rural Therapy (SBORT). Supplemented with illustrations, sample exercises, and case studies, Behavioral Therapy for Rural Substance Abusers is a vital tool in meeting the treatment needs of an otherwise ignored rural population.",Psychology,210,N/A,0,en

Self-Help in the Digital Age,Loredana Filip,Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG,2024-09-23,"In an age where science and technology hold sway and the humanities face a crisis, this book explores the evolving role of literature. It delves into how American self-help culture shapes contemporary ideals of success, mindfulness, and happiness, with a particular focus on its influence in science communication, notably in TED talks. Moreover, it underscores the enduring relevance of literature in the digital era by analyzing speculative novels that challenge established norms, including those propagated by TED. These novels include Richard Powers' Generosity: An Enhancement, Margaret Atwood's MaddAddam trilogy and Gary Shteyngart's Super Sad True Love Story. They question the Western preference for visual perception, which perpetuates a human-centric worldview. By focusing on literary synesthesia in the readings, this book emphasizes sensory experiences and human-nonhuman interactions. It adopts the concept of research as assemblage and uses a diverse range of theories and approaches, while it foregrounds critical posthumanism and new materialism. Ultimately, it advocates for a less anthropocentric approach to reading and presents literature as a ""transdisciplinary life science"" capable of fostering a ""kinship of posthumanity.""",Computers,326,N/A,0,en
Self-Care for TEACHERS,Dr. Matthew Allen,Trafford Publishing,2013-06-12,"Designed for both individual use and professional development programs, Self-Care for Teachers provides guided reflections and practical advice for classroom teachers and educational leaders alike, and will be of immediate benefit to many who feel overwhelmed by the increasing demands of the profession and are struggling to avoid burn out and find balance. Clearly, many teachers are stretched to the breaking point, and much the same could be said of many administrators. Indeed, there is a curious conspiracy at work in overwork. Teachers typically find it almost impossible to say “no” to more work and greater expectations, just as administrators can’t help themselves asking for more. With the best of intentions, we all put students first, and sacrifice ourselves as necessary. Various remedies have been suggested, but most focus on managerial strategies or pedagogical reform—organizations and teaching rather than teachers. Dr. Allen’s approach is fundamentally different. Twenty-five years wide experience in education—beginning with a boys’ boarding school and including a university lectureship, a post at a prestigious prep school, and various teaching and administrative positions in international schools—has convinced him two simple truths. Teachers can never meet the endless demands of the profession. Not only that, but as much as we care for our students, we don’t look after ourselves very well. Consequently, he suggests that a good part of the solution to the beguiling business of overwork and its attendant maladies must be what he has come to call “self-care,” both a missing piece of pedagogy and an overlooked aspect of educational leadership. By “self-care” I simply mean learning to look after ourselves better so that we can continue to look after our students as we would like to. However much (or little) we are supported in our work and outside it, I suggest that we appoint ourselves our own “chief care givers” and consciously seek whatever it is which sustains us most. The purpose of this book is to further that initiative. Since, by self-selection, rigorous training, and long habit, educators often become used to unnecessary self-sacrifice and constant self-neglect, Self-Care for Teachers emphasizes learning—learning to look after one’s self—and is as inspirational as it is instructional, balancing inventory exercises with personal anecdotes. Self-Care for Teachers will help educators everywhere to regain their balance, reclaim their time, and renew their practice, and will be of critical importance to thousands of teachers and administrators in the IB (International Baccalaureate) Program who believe in the IB ideal of balance but require explanation and guidance to make this concept a reality in their lives and schools. Blending current research, personal experience, and literary reflections, Self-Care for Teachers at once scholarly, artful, and moving. Written in a lively and accessible style, this thought-provoking work invites readers to reconsider long-held views and values about vocation, success, balance, time, productivity, and spirituality. By reconsidering these fundaments together, educators everywhere can literally change their minds about their work as professionals and their lives as people, and move towards greater peace, productivity, and pleasure.",Poetry,269,N/A,0,en

Synoptic Problems,John S. Kloppenborg,Mohr Siebeck,2014-07-02,"This volume contains a collection of twenty-one essays of John S. Kloppenborg, with four foci: conceptual and methodological issues in the Synoptic Problem; the Sayings Gospel Q; the Gospel of Mark; and the Parables of Jesus. Kloppenborg, a major contributor to the Synoptic Problem, is especially interested in how one constructs synoptic hypotheses, always aware of the many gaps in our knowledge, the presence of competing hypotheses, and the theological and historical entailments in any given hypothesis. Common to the essays in the remaining three sections is the insistence that the literature, thought and practices of the early Jesus movement must be treated with a deep awareness of their social, literary, and intellectual contexts. The context of the early Jesus movement is illumined not simply by resort to the literary and historical sources produced by Greek and Roman elites but, more importantly, by data gathered from documentary sources available in non-literary papyri.",Religion,772,N/A,0,en

The Anatomy of Tort Law,Peter Cane,Hart Publishing,1997-06-19,"Written to be accessible to all readers with a basic knowledge of tort law, this book adopts an approach which is both easily comprehended, yet also innovative and illuminating. It sets out a new and theoretically stimulating analysis of the law of tort, in which the subject is reconceived as a system of ethical rules and principles of personal responsibility. As such it can be viewed as a series of relationships between protected interests, sanctioned conduct and sanctions. These are the ""building blocks"" of tort law. Beyond affording a means of comprehending the fragmentary nature of tort law, the book, equally importantly, seeks to develop understanding of its relationship with other areas of the law of obligations. It also permits clearer understanding of the relationship between common law and statutory torts and throws fresh light on the links between tort law and its functions.",Law,263,N/A,0,en

Suicide in Modern Literature,Josefa Ros Velasco,Springer Nature,2022-01-01,"This book analyzes the social and contextual causes of suicide, the existential and philosophical reasons for committing suicide, and the prevention strategies that modern fictional literature places at our disposal. They go through the review of Modern fictional literature, in the American and European geographical framework, following the rationales that modern literature based on fiction can serve the purpose of understanding better the phenomenon of suicide, its most inaccessible impulses, and that has the potential to prevent suicide. From the turn of the 20th century to the present, debates over the meaning of suicide became a privileged site for efforts to discover the reasons why people commit suicide and how to prevent this behavior. Since the French sociologist and philosopher Émile Durkheim published his study Suicide: A Study in Sociology in 1897, a reframing of suicide took place, giving rise to a flourishing group of researchers and authors devoting their efforts to understand better the causes of suicide and to the formation of suicide prevention organizations. A century later, we still keep on trying to reach such an understanding of suicide, the nature, and nuances of its modern conceptualization, to prevent suicidal behaviors. The question of what suicide means in and for modernity is not an overcome one. Suicide is an act that touches all of our lives and engages with the incomprehensible and unsayable. Since the turn of the millennium, a fierce debate about the state’s role in assisted suicide has been adopted. Beyond the discussion as to whether physicians should assist in the suicide of patients with unbearable and hopeless suffering, the scope of the suicidal agency is much broader concerning general people wanting to die.",Psychology,320,N/A,0,en

These are case studies depicting shared lived experiences between the nurse and patient that are studied from various theoretical perspectives. They are designed to foster a nursing student's ability to care effectively for a patient, family, or group. Each case study features a compelling scenario that engages the reader to feel and fully participate in the caring experience. The book presents a variety of situations that new and experienced nurses are likely to encounter, many of which present scenarios that require caring for a patient under difficult or complex circumstances. The book addresses the need, as defined by leading health care and nursing education organizations, for the study of nursing from a contextual, story-oriented perspective. It is based on the Barry, Gordon & King Teaching/Learning Nursing Framework, developed as a guide to uncover the art and science of nursing grounded in caring in all nursing situations. Following a description of the framework's foundational concepts, the text describes how to use nursing situations to facilitate learning. The scenarios offer detailed, practical strategies for analyzing nursing situations in ways that bring to life the simple and complex practice of nursing grounded in caring. These real-life stories also help students understand the impact of health conditions on individuals and families, thereby fostering empathy.

Self-defence in International Law,D. W. Bowett,"The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd.",2009,"Self-defense and the right to go to war. Originally published: New York: Praeger, [1958]. xv, 294 pp. Bowett observes that the use or threat of force by any state can be a delict, an approved sanction, or a measure taken in self-defense. He examines the evolution of self-defense doctrine in the nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, with the assumption of the existence of a state's unlimited 'right' to go to war. He then attempts to outline the limited and provisional effects of this right under the U.N. Charter. This book was written after Bowett's term as a United Nations legal officer from 1957-1959. ""Throughout the work there is a refusal to dogmatize or to state in absolute terms any aspect of the 'privilege' of self-defence in its present context. (...) [Bowett] is to be congratulated on producing a timely and scholarly survey of one of the most fundamental, and often abused, sovereign rights known to international law."" --K.R.

Anxious Creativity,David Trend,Routledge,2019-09-03,"Creativity is getting new attention in today’s America––along the way revealing fault lines in U.S. culture. Surveys show people overwhelmingly seeing creativity as both a desirable trait and a work enhancement, yet most say they just aren’t creative. Like beauty and wealth, creativity seems universally desired but insufficiently possessed. Businesses likewise see innovation as essential to productivity and growth, but can’t bring themselves to risk new ideas. Even as one’s ""inner artist"" is hyped by a booming self-help industry, creative education dwindles in U.S. schools. Anxious Creativity: When Imagination Fails examines this conceptual mess, while focusing on how America’s current edginess dampens creativity in everyone. Written in an engaging and accessible style, Anxious Creativity draws on current ideas in the social sciences, economics, and the arts. Discussion centers on the knotty problem of reconciling the expressive potential in all people with the nation’s tendency to reward only a few. Fortunately, there is some good news, as scientists, economists, and creative professionals have begun advocating new ways of sharing and collaboration. Building on these prospects, the book argues that America’s innovation crisis demands a rethinking of individualism, competition, and the ways creativity is rewarded.",Social Science,271,N/A,0,en
Women and Leadership in Higher Education During Global Crises,"Schnackenberg, Heidi L., Simard, Denise A.",IGI Global,2021-05-21,"Women leaders and the COVID-19 pandemic are currently trending in the news. Major news outlets are all offering their positive opinions on how world-wide women leaders have addressed the crisis and reassured their people. While this sort of press coverage is certainly uplifting, little to no research has been conducted to investigate the effectiveness of women’s leadership decisions and strategies in these difficult times. In concert with these global struggles resulting from the pandemic are the challenges faced by higher education. Many colleges and universities have all but shuttered their doors and are conducting instruction, student support, and day-to-day business almost completely online. Women academic leaders bear a great load during global crises, with the combination of maintaining work responsibilities and caring for families and personal households. It is shown that women leaders may feel overwhelmed but remain heroes in unprecedented times of crisis. Women and Leadership in Higher Education During Global Crises informs readers and expands their understanding about specific challenges, issues, strategies, and solutions that are associated with women leaders in higher education, the implications during the current pandemic and other natural disasters, and how these strategies can be used for future agility and success. The chapters will cover narratives, strategies, and initiatives that women leaders are using to lead their institutions, departments, sectors, and organizations. It ties together the unimaginable challenges, joys, struggles, and successes encountered by women in leadership in higher education and is ideal for higher education administrators, teachers, leaders, faculty, provosts, deans, program leaders, researchers, academicians, and students interested in both the challenges and successes women leaders in higher education face during global crises.",Education,256,N/A,0,en

Landmark Papers in Nephrology,"John Feehally, Christopher McIntyre, J. Stewart Cameron",OUP Oxford,2013-03-07,"Landmarks in Nephrology points the reader to some of the seminal observations which have led to the practice of nephrology as we know it today. Twenty areas of nephrology are covered by discrete chapters, with the editors selecting the ten most important papers ever published in that field. These range from observational and experimental studies from the 18th century, which laid the groundwork for our current understanding of the kidney, through to recent randomized controlled clinical trials. The papers also reflect the emergence of nephrology as a speciality in the last fifty years, stimulated particularly by the introduction of renal biopsy and the development of dialysis and transplantation as effective forms of renal replacement therapy. For each paper, there is a succinct commentary which highlights the importance of the work in its historical context, as well as a recommended reading section to encourage the interested reader to explore further. It is of course a near-impossible task to choose only two hundred papers from the whole oeuvre of nephrology. However, these chosen few are undoubtedly among the great landmarks of nephrology, reflecting the varying coincidences of brilliance, persistence, and good fortune which are necessary for progress in medical science. Encompassing the breadth, range and depth of the intellectual journey which precedes us in the development of nephrology, they provide a telling illustration of Sir Isaac Newton's words to Robert Hooke in 1675: 'If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants'.",Medical,465,N/A,0,en

Based on actor-centred and network theories, two cases of civil society alliances are analysed. The book reveals that existing civil society structures are hybrids that can oscillate between networks and organisations. Moreover, they establish informal governance spaces with state actors outside the institutional channels provided by government. The emergence of oscillating structures and the informalisation of horizontal governance represent new challenges for local decision-making processes. Co-operation and action-oriented approaches in housing seemingly need to be based on a more detailed understanding of the complex interfaces, which go far beyond the conventional ideal of partnerships and participation between sectors.",Cape Town (South Africa),396,N/A,0,en

Postfeminism in Context,"Margaret Henderson, Anthea Taylor",Routledge,2019-10-21,"Postfeminism in Context studies the representation of women in Australian popular culture over the past three decades to locate postfeminism in a specific time and place. Margaret Henderson and Anthea Taylor argue that ‘postfeminism’, as a critical term, has been too often deployed in ways that fail to account for historical and cultural specificity. This book analyses Australian popular culture – chick lit novels; ‘dramedy’ television shows; women’s magazines; YouTube beauty vlogs; self-help manuals; and newspapers – to reveal the tensions, contradictions and ambiguities that have always been constitutive of postfeminism, including in Australia. Examining how these popular forms intervene in dominant conversations about contemporary Australian femininities, Postfeminism in Context maps the ways in which various aspects of Australia’s history and national identity have shaped its postfeminism. While Henderson and Taylor identify some of the limited postfeminist tropes and patterns of representation evident in comparable locales, they also find that Australian popular culture has responded to feminism in a much more hopeful way. Adding some much-needed cultural specificity to the ongoing debate around this loaded term, Postfeminism in Context is essential reading for those interested in Australian popular culture, feminism, and the gendered politics of representation.",Social Science,353,N/A,0,en

Second, contributors investigate how nineteenth-century reading and consumption of print was framed and/or shaped by contemporaneous engagement with content disseminated in other media like advertising, the stage, exhibitions, and oral culture.",Literary Criticism,247,N/A,0,en

Residential Architecture as Infrastructure,Stephen H. Kendall,Routledge,2021-11-29,"This edited collection provides an up-to-date account, by a group of well-informed and globally positioned authors, of recently implemented projects, public policies and business activities in Open Building around the world. Countless residential Open Building projects have been built in a number of countries, some without knowledge of the original theory and methods. These projects differ in architectural style, building industry methods, economic system and social aims. National building standards and guidelines have been promulgated in several countries (Finland, China, Japan, Korea), providing incentives and guidance to Open Building implementation. Businesses in several countries have begun to deliver advanced FIT-OUT systems both for new construction and for retrofitting existing buildings, demonstrating the economic advantages of ‘the responsive, independent dwelling.’ This book also argues that the ‘open building’ approach is essential for the reactivation of the existing building stock for long-term value, because in the end it costs less. The book discusses these developments in residential architecture from the perspective of an infrastructure model of built environment. This model enables decision-makers to manage risk and uncertainty, while avoiding a number of problems often associated with large, fast-moving projects, such as separation and distribution of design tasks (and responsibility) and the ensuing boundary frictions. Residential Architecture as Infrastructure adds to the Routledge Open Building Series, and will appeal to architects, urban designers, researchers and policy-makers interested in this international review of current projects, policies and business activities focused on Open Building implementation.",Architecture,428,N/A,0,en

Patient Centered Medicine,Omur Sayligil,BoD – Books on Demand,2017-04-12,"Patient-centered medicine is not an illness-centered, a physician-centered, or a hospital-centered medicine approach. In this book, it is aimed at presenting an approach to patient-centered medicine from the beginning of life to the end of life. As indicated by W. Osler, ""It is much more important to know what sort of a patient has a disease than what sort of a disease a patient has."" In our day, if the physicians and healthcare professionals could consider more than the diseased organ and provide healthcare by comforting the patients by respecting their values, beliefs, needs, and preferences; informing them and their relatives at every stage; and comforting the patients physically by controlling the pain and relieving their worries and fears, patients obeying the rules of physicians would become patients with high adaptation and participation to the treatment.",Medical,188,N/A,0,en
Evidence-Based Practice with Emotionally Troubled Children and Adolescents,Morley D.

Governmentality Studies in Education,,BRILL,2009-01-01,"Michel Foucault’s concept of governmentality originated in a lecture series in the late 1970s at the Collège de France and soon became the basis for a range of historical and contemporary studies across the social sciences and humanities. The concept in part rests on a simple but powerful idea that links government to the freedom of the subject in a novel understanding of liberal politics. It also provides an analytics of power based on the examination of actual practices. This is the first collection to use Foucault’s concept in relation to the field of education where it has a natural home given that much educational theory and practice in the liberal tradition at least since Kant has been directed at the goals of autonomy and self-government. The volume has three sections: a general section on Foucault and governmentality with contributions from some of the world’s leading scholars in the area, including Colin Gordon, Jacques Donzelot, and Thomas Lemke; and two sections devoted to governmentality and education, the first outlining Anglo-American perspectives, the second, focusing on European perspectives, with contributions from leading scholars such as Tom Popkewitz, James Marshall, Tom Osborne, Michael Peters, Mark Olssen, Tina Besley, Hermann J.

The Redemptive Self,Dan P. McAdams,Oxford University Press,2013-01-07,"How do we as Americans define our identities? How do our stories represent who we are-our successes, our failures, our past, our future? Stories of redemption are some of the most powerful ways to express American identity and all that it can entail, from pain and anguish to joy and fulfillment. Psychologist Dan P. McAdams examines how these narratives, in which the hero is delivered from suffering to an enhanced status or state, represent a new psychology of American identity, and in turn, how they translate to understanding our own lives. In this revised and expanded edition of The Redemptive Self, McAdams shows how redemptive stories promote psychological health and civic engagement among contemporary American adults. He reveals how different kinds of redemptive stories compete for favor in American society, as presented in a dramatic case study comparing the life stories constructed by Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. McAdams provides new insight on race and religion in American narratives, offers a creative blend of psychological research and historical analysis, and explains how the redemptive self is a positive psychological resource for living a worthy American life. From the spiritual testimonials of the Puritans and the celebrated autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, to the harrowing stories of escaped slaves and the modern tales in Hollywood movies, we are surrounded by transformative stories that can inform how we make sense of our American identity. But is the redemptive life story always a good thing, and can anyone achieve it? While affirming the significance of redemptive life stories, McAdams also offers a cultural critique. Through no fault of their own, many Americans cannot achieve this revered story of deliverance. Instead, their lives are rife with contaminated plots, vicious cycles of disappointment, and endless pitfalls. Moreover, there may be a negative side to these beloved stories of redemption-they demonstrate a curiously American form of arrogance, self-righteousness, and naiveté that all bad things can be transformed. In this revised and expanded edition of the his award-winning book, McAdams encourages us to critically examine our own life stories-the good, the bad, the ups, the downs-in order to inform how we can benefit from them and shape a better future American identity.",Psychology,394,N/A,0,en

Theories of War and Peace,"Michael E. Brown, Owen R. Cote, Jr., Sean M. Lynn-Jones, Steven E. Miller",MIT Press,1998-09-15,"New approaches to understanding war and peace in the changing international system. What causes war? How can wars be prevented? Scholars and policymakers have sought the answers to these questions for centuries. Although wars continue to occur, recent scholarship has made progress toward developing more sophisticated and perhaps more useful theories on the causes and prevention of war. This volume includes essays by leading scholars on contemporary approaches to understanding war and peace. The essays include expositions, analyses, and critiques of some of the more prominent and enduring explanations of war. Several authors discuss realist theories of war, which focus on the distribution of power and the potential for offensive war. Others examine the prominent hypothesis that the spread of democracy will usher in an era of peace. In light of the apparent increase in nationalism and ethnic conflict, several authors present hypotheses on how nationalism causes war and how such wars can be controlled. Contributors also engage in a vigorous debate on whether international institutions can promote peace. In a section on war and peace in the changing international system, several authors consider whether rising levels of international economic independence and environmental scarcity will influence the likelihood of war.",Political Science,610,3,1,en

The African Poor,John Iliffe,Cambridge University Press,1987-12-25,"This history of the poor of Sub-Saharan Africa begins in the monasteries of thirteenth-century Ethiopia and ends in the South African resettlement sites of the 1980s. Its thesis, derived from histories of poverty in Europe, is that most very poor Africans have been individuals incapacitated for labour, bereft of support, and unable to fend for themselves in a land-rich economy. There has emerged the distinct poverty of those excluded from access to productive resources. Natural disaster brought widespread destitution, but as a cause of mass mortality it was almost eliminated in the colonial era, to return to those areas where drought has been compounded by administrative breakdown. Professor Iliffe investigates what it was like to be poor, how the poor sought to help themselves, how their counterparts in other continents live. The poor live as people, rather than merely parading as statistics. Famines have alerted the world to African poverty, but the problem itself is ancient. Its prevailing forms will not be understood until those of earlier periods are revealed and trends of change are identified. This is a book for all concerned with the future of Africa, as well as for students of poverty elsewhere.",History,404,N/A,0,en

Refining Russia,Catriona Kelly,OUP Oxford,2001-08-09,"Advice literature (etiquette manuals, guides to hygiene and house management, and treatises on upbringing) enjoyed massive popularity in Russia between the late eighteenth and the late twentieth centuries. It reflected changing attitudes to appropriate behaviour in private and public, to the acquisition of possessions, and not least to national identity (for many Russians, reading how-to books was seen as a way of 'learning how to be a Westerner'). Written or translated by members of the cultural elite trying to encourage what they saw as civilized behaviour, advice literature was also a conduit for changing views of mass readers and of their place in society. This important and engaging book is the first systematic exploration of this hitherto neglected genre of popular printed text. It examines the evolution of advice literature from the Enlightenment to the post-Soviet era, from translations of Fénelon and Madame de Lambert in the 1760s and of Samuel Smiles in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, to tracts by Gogol and Tolstoi, Soviet pamphlets on 'how to be cultured', and post-Soviet guides to 'window treatments'. It draws on a huge range of sources - memoirs, 'novelised conduct books' such as Anna Karenina, parody advice literature, letters, and reviews - to examine the broader significance of how-to books, and their relationship with daily life (byt) as construct and as lived reality. The result is a book that not only makes a major contribution to the study of popular culture, but also throws an unexpected and revealing light on Russian history more broadly.",Literary Criticism,482,N/A,0,en

Tragic Orphans,Carl Vadivella Belle,Institute of Southeast Asian Studies,2014-12-30,"In 1938, noting that the bulk of the Indian population formed a “landless proletariat” and despairing of the ability of the factionalized Indian community to unite in pursuit of common objectives, activist K.A. Neelakanda Ayer forecast that the fate of Indians in Malaya would be to become “Tragic orphans – of whom India has forgotten and Malaya looks down upon with contempt”. Ayer’s words continue to resonate; as a minority group in a nation dominated politically by colonially derived narratives of “race” and ethnicity and riven by the imperatives of religion, the general trajectory of the economically and politically impotent Indian community has been one of increasing irrelevance. This book explores the history of the modern Indian presence in Malaysia, and traces the vital role played by the Indian community in the construction of contemporary Malaysia. In this comprehensive new study, Carl Vadivella Belle offers fresh insights on the Indian experience spanning the period from the colonial recruitment of Indian labour to the post-Merdeka political, economic and social marginalization of Indians. While recent Indian challenges to the political status quo — a regime described as that of “benign neglect” — promoted Indian hopes of reform, change and uplift, the author concludes that the dictates of political discourse permeated by the ideologies of communalism offer limited prospects for meaningful change.",Social Science,534,N/A,0,en

"Child Murder and British Culture, 1720-1900",Josephine McDonagh,Cambridge University Press,2003-12-08,"In this wide-ranging study, Josephine McDonagh examines the idea of child murder in British culture in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Analysing texts drawn from economics, philosophy, law, medicine as well as from literature, McDonagh highlights the manifold ways in which child murder echoes and reverberates in a variety of cultural debates and social practices. She places literary works within social, political and cultural contexts, including debates on luxury, penal reform campaigns, slavery, the treatment of the poor, and birth control. She traces a trajectory from Swift's A Modest Proposal through to the debates on the New Woman at the turn of the twentieth century by way of Burke, Wordsworth, Wollstonecraft, George Eliot, George Egerton, and Thomas Hardy, among others. McDonagh demonstrates the haunting persistence of the notion of child murder within British culture in a volume that will be of interest to cultural and literary scholars alike.",Literary Criticism,308,N/A,0,en

"State, Society and the Poor in Nineteenth-Century England",Alan Kidd,Bloomsbury Publishing,1999-07-08,"Today it is impossible to separate discussion of poverty from the priorities of state welfare. A hundred years ago, most working-class households avoided or coped with poverty without recourse to the state. The Poor Law after 1834 offered little more than a 'safety net' for the poorest, and much welfare was organised through charitable societies, self-help institutions and mutual-aid networks. Rather than look for the origins of modern provision, the author casts a searching light on the practices, ideology and outcomes of nineteenth-century welfare. This original and stimulating study, based upon a wealth of scholarship, is essential reading for all students of poverty and welfare. It also contains much to interest a wider readership.",History,214,N/A,0,en

Through our investigation, we will learn the ways in which self-care routines improve our quality of life and help us overcome obstacles. Self-care is a comprehensive strategy for promoting our general health and happiness, not just self-indulgence. People who prioritize self-care improve their quality of life, develop resilience, and lower their stress levels. Nonetheless, comprehending the science underlying self-care enables us to fully appreciate its transforming power. We'll talk about the social, psychological, and physiological aspects of self-care in this conversation. We'll look into the effects of self-care activities on immunological response, hormone regulation, and brain function, including mindfulness, exercise, and social interaction. We'll also learn about the psychological processes that self-care uses to support psychological health, self-worth, and emotional control.

Expectation Examination Therapy,P. Mitchell,CreateSpace,2014-11-20,"We all have upsets but what really causes them and the negative emotions that we experience? Most people, including most in the field of psychotherapy, believe that upsets are caused by something that happened. Although that does have an influence, it is not the root cause of why we have upsets that create those negative emotions. Expectation Examination Therapy challenges that belief and gets down to the true root of what causes upsets. It explains and demonstrates with examples how to use this new self-help therapy technique to understand and resolve most upsets. It also shows how understanding expectations can help avoid many upsets before they occur. Whether the upset is short term or long term using this therapy can dissolve the upset resulting in fewer negative emotions therefore less stress on the mind and body. By reading this book you can live a less stressful life by understanding expectations and how they affect your life and those around you. You can start today.",,168,N/A,0,en

Purchasers can usually download a free scanned copy of the original book (without typos) from the publisher. Not indexed. Not illustrated. 1904 edition. Excerpt: ... AN ACCOUNT OF SOME OF THE PRINCIPAL PERSONS MENTIONED IN THIS VOLUME Adrian VI. (1459-1523) was the last of the Dutch popes. His busy and varied career comprised university work, as scholastic training was then understood, and his learning and mental and moral robustness were in the highest degree effective; association with the Inquisition as Grand Inquisitor; and constructive statesmanship, during the time that he was one of the regents of Spain after the death of Ferdinand the king. His pontificate was of only twenty-one months' duration, but even in this short period he earned the title of ""the reforming pope,"" and the enmity of those connected with the papal court who could not brook the change from the prodigal splendor of his predecessor to the frugality of Adrian's life and his honest and pious ways. His opposition to Luther (p. 276) was bitter, but he himself denied the doctrine of papal infallibility. His premature death was a real misfortune, not only because of the internal reforms he had planned and gave promise of carrying to completion, but also because it aborted his projected united front of Christendom, which would have rolled back the tide of Turkish invasion then sweeping over Europe. Alexander I. (1777-1825), Emperor of Russia, was, as the text intimates, a progressive ruler for his day and time -- the Napoleonic era. Under him Russia joined with Austria, Sweden, and England to curb Napoleon; but it was at Paris in 1815 that the Holy Alliance (see Canning) was formed, and Alexander was the Arnold-- Audubon -- Bacon 245 instigator of the plan. Relatively he advanced Russia in trade and manufactures, and within limits eased the great burden of serfdom. We have in Alexander an illustration of the impotence of even the...",,94,N/A,0,en

Holistic Self-Care Tools for Caregivers,Suchinta Abhayaratna ThD,Xlibris Corporation,2017-03-15,"Many of us are caregivers of one kind or another. We are parents who take care of our children, adults who take care of our aging parents, teachers who care for and educate our students, physical- and mental-healthcare practitioners who care for the sick and elderly. We are healers, shamans, coaches, hairdressers, aestheticians. We provide invaluable service to others but tend to forget ourselves. I am one of you. However, over the past twenty years, I have learned how important it is to be aligned with the whole of who we are. When we are fully present to ourselves, we are more present to the people we serve. In this book, I share what I learned from years of in-depth study of energy medicine. It enabled me to heal and move through my health challenges with grace and ease, using the quick, easy, and effective subtle energy tools and processes that evolved into the CHI Self-Care System. This book helps you discover the energy tools that you already have and use them to care for yourself, be healthier, and more balanced while you care for others.",Health & Fitness,116,N/A,0,en

The Exhibition of Persephone Q,Jessi Jezewska Stevens,Macmillan + ORM,2020-03-03,"A New York Times Book Review Editors’ Choice A WALL STREET JOURNAL AND VOGUE MOST ANTICIPATED BOOK OF 2020 ""A triumph of tone and intelligence. Percy Q's perspective is skewed and searching at once, and through her eyes, we see afresh not only New York's post-9/11 landscape but also the world of art, and love, and the process of becoming."" —Rivka Galchen, author of Atmospheric Disturbances Percy is pregnant. She hasn’t told a soul. Probably she should tell her husband—certainly she means to—but one night she wakes up to find she no longer recognizes him. Now, instead of sleeping, Percy is spending her nights taking walks through her neighborhood, all the while fretting over her marriage, her impending motherhood, and the sinister ways the city is changing. Amid this alienation—from her husband, home, and rapidly changing body—a package arrives. In it: an exhibition catalog for a photography show. The photographs consist of a series of digitally manipulated images of a woman lying on a bed in a red room. It takes a moment for even Percy to notice that the woman is herself . . . but no one else sees the resemblance. Percy must now come to grips with the fundamental question of identity in the digital age: To what extent do we own our own image, and to what extent is that image shaped by the eyes of others? Capturing perfectly the haunted atmosphere of Manhattan immediately after 9/11—and the simmering insanity of America ever since—Jessi Jezewska Stevens's The Exhibition of Persephone Q is a darkly witty satire about how easy it is to lose ownership of our own selves.",Fiction,183,N/A,0,en

The term “health literacy” was coined by Ratzan et al. in the 1970s providing the minimal health education required in schools, however this term is almost new and in the early phase of development. Though many attempts have been made in the past to define health literacy, WHO construed it as “the cognitive and social skills which determine the motivation and ability of individuals to gain access to, understand and use information in ways which promote and maintain good health.” Health literacy not only focuses on the individual behavior oriented communication but also on the various determinants of health such as environmental, social, and political factors, thus it is ahead in the concept of health education. If health education methods go beyond the bounds of “information diffusion” and bring about interaction, participation, and critical analysis, such kind of approach will lead to improved health literacy, personal aid, and social benefit by enabling adequate community action and contributions to the advancement of social capital.",Medical,248,N/A,0,en

This venerable psychology classic contains the following excerpt: It is of the utmost value to learn how to concentrate. To make the greatest success of anything you must be able to concentrate your entire thought upon the idea you are working on.

Finding Balance Poetry,Miss Q,N/A,2024-11-19,"For anyone struggling with mental health, poetry may be the answer you seek. From one human to another, Finding Balance Poetry seeks to connect, process, cope, and live fully. One in five Americans experiences mental illness, and despite the numbers, mental health struggles can isolate those they affect. But you don't have to feel alone, lost, or confused. Poetry can be a powerful coping mechanism if nothing else has worked. Author, poet, and mental health Professional Miss Q has waged her own battles inside her head, and nothing has helped her more than writing. Her new poetry self-help book, Finding Balance Poetry: I'm Not No Superwoman and I Don't Claim to Be, seeks to help others struggling with mental health through poetry that soothes. Within the book, Miss Q describes how readers can find balance through poetry, a skill used for both mental health prevention and intervention. Despite being overlooked, poetry can offer an outlet for self-affirmation, reflection on experiences, and empowerment. The power of poetry discussed in the book can aid readers in focusing on their body and mind's overall wellness. It creates a space to embrace uniqueness, genuineness, and empathetic regard for others' lived experiences. Finding Balance Poetry seeks, above all, to arm individuals with poetry that they can use as a coping skill when it's most needed. This, along with other self-help tools, can begin to build a sturdy foundation of self-reliance on which a bright future will rise.",Poetry,0,N/A,0,en

What Can We Learn from the Great Depression?,Dana Frank,Beacon Press,2024-10-08,"4 stories of resilience, mutual aid, and radical rebellion that will transform how we understand the Great Depression Drawing on little-known stories of working people, What Can We Learn from the Great Depression? amplifies voices that have been long omitted from standard histories of the Depression era. In four tales, Professor Dana Frank explores how ordinary working people in the US turned to collective action to meet the crisis of the Great Depression and what we can learn from them today. Readers are introduced to * the 7 daring Black women who worked as wet nurses and staged a sit-down strike to demand better pay and an end to racial discrimination * the groups who used mutual aid, cooperatives, eviction protests, and demands for government relief to meet their basic needs * the million Mexican and Mexican American repatriados who were erased from mainstream historical memory, while (often fictitious) white “Dust Bowl migrants” became enshrined * the Black Legion, a white supremacist fascist organization that saw racism, antisemitism, anti-Catholicism, and fascism as the cure to the Depression While capitalism crashed during the Great Depression, racism did not and was, in fact, wielded by some to blame and oppress their neighbors. Patriarchy persisted, too, undermining the power of social movements and justifying women’s marginalization within them. For other ordinary people, collective action gave them the means to survive and fight against such hostilities. What resulted were powerful new forms of horizontal reciprocity and solidarity that allowed people to provide each other with the bread, beans, and comradeship of daily life. The New Deal, when it arrived, provided vital resources to many, but others were cut off from its full benefits, especially if they were women or people of color. What Can We Learn from the Great Depression? shows us how we might look to the past to think about how we can shape the future of our own failed economy. These lessons can also help us imagine and build movements to challenge such an economy—and to transform the state as a whole—in service to the common good without replicating racism and patriarchy.",History,346,N/A,0,en

The Microfinance Impact,Ranjula Bali Swain,Routledge,2013-08-15,"Financial inclusion through microfinance has become a powerful force in improving the living conditions of poor farmers, rural non-farm enterprises and other vulnerable groups. In its unique ability to link the existing extensive network of India’s rural bank branches with the Self Help Groups (SHG), the National Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has covered up to 97 million poor households by March 2010 under its Self Help Group Bank Linkage Programme. Policy-makers have proclaimed SHGs as ‘‘the most potent initiative ... for delivering financial services to the poor in a sustainable manner."" This book presents a comprehensive scientific assessment of the impact of the Self Help Group Bank Linkage Programme (SBLP) on the member households. The book discusses wide-ranging topics, including the rural financial sector in India, the history and structure of the SBLP, the impact methodologies, the economic and social impact of microfinance, its role in building assets while reducing poverty and vulnerability, the role of women and their empowerment, training and accumulation of human capital and policy implications of lessons learned. The empirical results show that vulnerability of the more mature SHG members declines significantly. Vulnerability also falls for villages with better infrastructure and for SHGs that are formed by NGOs and linked by banks. The results strongly demonstrate that on average, there is a significant increase in the empowerment of the female participants. The economic impact of SBLP is found to be the most empowering. Greater autonomy and changes in social attitudes also lead to female empowerment. The investigation further reveals that training (especially business training) has a definite positive impact on assets but not on income. The impact of training can be improved through better infrastructure (as in paved roads), linkage model type, and the training organiser. Bridging the gap in the existing literature and between academics and practitioners, this book moves beyond the usual theoretical issues in the impact assessment literature and draws on new developments in methodology. It will be of interest to academics, development practitioners and students of economics, political science, sociology, public policy and development studies.",Business & Economics,161,N/A,0,en

Addiction Medicine,Bankole A. Johnson,Springer Science & Business Media,2010-10-10,"The spectrum of addiction disorders presents practitioners with numerous challenges—among them the widening gap between a growing evidence base and the translation of this knowledge into treatment outcomes. Addiction Medicine addresses this disconnect, clearly explaining the role of brain function in drug taking and other habit-forming behaviors, and applying this biobehavioral framework to the delivery of evidence-based treatment. Its state-of-the-art coverage provides clinically relevant details on not only traditional sources of addiction such as cocaine, opiates, and alcohol, but also more recently recognized substances of abuse (e.g., steroids, inhalants) as well as behavioral addictions (e.g., binge eating, compulsive gambling, hoarding). Current behavioral and medical therapies are discussed in depth, and the book’s close attention to social context gives readers an added lens for personalizing treatment. An international panel of expert contributors offers the most up-to-date information on: Diagnosis and classification Neurobiological and molecular theories of addiction Behavioral concepts of addiction Clinical aspects of addiction to a wide range of substances, including opiates, stimulants, sedatives, hallucinogens, alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine Science-based treatment options: pharmacotherapy, pharmacogenetics, potential vaccines, brief and compliance-enhancing interventions, cognitive behavioral treatment, behavioral management, and other psychosocial interventions Behavioral addictions—including compulsive eating, Internet messaging, and hypersexuality—and their treatment Addiction in specific populations, including adolescents, the elderly, pregnant women, and health care professionals Legal, disability, and rehabilitation issues At once comprehensive and integrative, Addiction Medicine is an essential text and a practice-expanding tool for psychiatrists, health psychologists, pharmacologists, social workers, drug counselors, trainees, and general physicians/family practitioners.",Medical,1611,5,1,en

Nursing Theorists and Their Work - E-Book,"Martha Raile Alligood, Ann Marriner Tomey",Elsevier Health Sciences,2013-09-30,"The most comprehensive of its kind, this classic resource in the field of nursing theory provides an in-depth look at 49 theorists of historical, international, and significant importance. Each chapter features a clear, consistent presentation of a key nursing philosophy or theory. Case studies and critical thinking activities help bridge the gap between theory and application. A case study at the end of each theorist chapter puts the theory into a larger perspective, helping you understand how the information can be applied to practice. A Major Concepts & Definitions box in each theorist chapter outlines and summarizes the theory’s most significant ideas and clarifies content-specific vocabulary. Each theorist chapter concludes with an extensive bibliography outlining numerous primary and secondary sources of information ideal for research projects. Critical Thinking Activities at the end of each theorist chapter challenge you to process the theory presented and apply it to personal and hypothetical practice situations. Introductory chapters provide you with a strong foundation in the history and philosophy of science, logical reasoning, and the theory development process. Diagrams for theories help you visualize and better understand inherently abstract concepts. Each theorist chapter is written by a scholar specializing in that particular theorist’s work — often an individual who has worked closely with the theorist. Most chapters have been reviewed and edited by the theorist for currency and accuracy, further validating the accounts set forth in the text. Theorist birth (and if applicable, death) dates help you place each individual into a time context. A new chapter introduces the theorist Afaf Meleis and covers her Transition Theory that has helped shape the theoretical development of nursing. Points for further study at the end of each chapter direct you to assets available for additional information. Need to know information is highlighted in at-a-glance summary boxes throughout to help you quickly review key concepts. Personal quotes from the theorists help you gain insight and make each complex theory more memorable.

Research on Alcoholics Anonymous and Spirituality in Addiction Recovery,"Marc Galanter, Lee Anne Kaskutas",Springer Science & Business Media,2008-12-05,"It was once taken for granted that peer-assisted groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous had no “real” value in recovery from addiction. More recently, evidence-based medicine is recognizing a spiritual component in healing—especially when it comes to addiction. The newest edition of Recent Developments in Alcoholism reflects this change by focusing on the 12-step model of recovery as well as mindfulness meditation and other spiritually oriented activity. More than thirty contributors bring together historical background, research findings, and clinical wisdom to analyze the compatibility of professional treatment and nonprofessional support, day-to-day concepts of relapse prevention, the value of community building in recovery, and much more. Among the topics covered: (1) How and why 12-step groups work. (2) The impact of the spiritual on mainstream treatment. (3) The impact of AA on other nonprofessional recovery programs. (4) AA outcomes for special populations. (5) Facilitating involvement in 12-step programs. (6) Methods for measuring religiousness and spirituality in alcohol research. Whether one is referring clients to 12-step programs or seeking to better understand the process, this is a unique resource for clinicians and social workers. Developmental psychologists, too, will find Volume 18—Research on Alcoholics Anonymous and Spirituality in Addiction Recovery a worthy successor to the series.",Medical,461,1,2,en

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,Stephen R. Covey,N/A,2017,"getAbstract Summary: Get the key points from this book in less than 10 minutes.This book was a publishing phenomenon in the early 1990s, and it deserved to be. Stephen R. Covey managed to repackage an ethical and moral tradition thousands of years in development and make it meaningful to a late twentieth century, secular audience. Most of what you find in this book you will find in Aristotle, Cicero, Benedict, Tillotson and their heirs. Covey adds a few references to psychology, a twentieth century science, and many to Viktor Frankl, a sage of the Holocaust. Covey wraps the mix in a distinctively American can-do program of easy-looking steps calling, mostly, for self-discipline. The result is a quite worthwhile, useful manual for self-improvement. getAbstract believes most readers can learn something useful from this book, though some will find the style too familiar and easy-going, and the prescriptions easier to agree with than to act upon, much less adopt as habits.Book Publisher:Copyright 1989 by Stephen R.

The Resilience Workbook,Glenn R. Schiraldi,New Harbinger  Publications,2017-11-01,"What is resilience, and how can you build it? In The Resilience Workbook, Glenn Schiraldi—author of The Self-Esteem Workbook—offers invaluable insight and outlines essential skills to help you bounce back from setbacks and cultivate a growth mindset. Why do some people sail through life’s storms, while others are knocked down? Resilience is the key. Resilience is the ability to recover from difficult experiences, such as death of loved one, job loss, serious illness, terrorist attacks, or even just daily stressors and challenges. Resilience is the strength of body, mind, and character that enables people to respond well to adversity. In short, resilience is the cornerstone of mental health. Combining evidence-based approaches including positive psychology, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness, and skills for regulating stress, The Resilience Workbook will show you how to bounce back and thrive in any difficult situation. You’ll learn how to harness the power of your brain’s natural neuroplasticity; manage strong, distressing emotions; and improve mood and overall well-being. You’ll also discover powerful skills to help you prevent and recover from stress-related conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, anger, and substance abuse disorders. When the going gets tough, you need real, proven-effective skills to manage your stress and heal from setbacks. The comprehensive and practical exercises in this workbook will help you cultivate resilience, stay calm under pressure, and face all of life’s challenges. This book has been selected as an Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies Self-Help Book Recommendation—an honor bestowed on outstanding self-help books that are consistent with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles and that incorporate scientifically tested strategies for overcoming mental health difficulties. Used alone or in conjunction with therapy, our books offer powerful tools readers can use to jump-start changes in their lives.",Self-Help,309,5,1,en

Self-Help in Mental Health,"T. Mark Harwood, Luciano L'Abate",Springer,2010-11-08,"Self-help is big business, but alas not a scienti c business. The estimated 10 billion—that’s with a “b”—spent each year on self-help in the United States is rarely guided by research or monitored by mental health professionals. Instead, marketing and metaphysics triumph. The more outrageous the “miraculous cure” and the “r- olutionary secret,” the better the sales. Of the 3,000 plus self-help books published each year, only a dozen contain controlled research documenting their effectiveness as stand-alone self-help. Of the 20,000 plus psychological and relationship web sites available on the Internet, only a couple hundred meet professional standards for accuracy and balance. Most, in fact, sell a commercial product. Pity the layperson, or for that matter, the practitioner, trying to navigate the self-help morass. We are bombarded with thousands of potential resources and c- tradictory advice. Should we seek wisdom in a self-help book, an online site, a 12-step group, an engaging autobiography, a treatment manual, an inspiring movie, or distance writing? Should we just do it, or just say no? Work toward change or accept what is? Love your inner child or grow out of your Peter Pan?

Development with Justice,Sankar Kumar Bhaumik,Taylor & Francis,2024-02-12,"Since the nation’s independence, the union and state governments of India have employed a variety of development strategies, some of which have evolved over time. The model of development implemented in Bihar in recent decades is different from its prior development strategies. Along with a number of social reform initiatives, the Bihar government implemented the “development-with-justice” model to enhance the lives and living circumstances of the most marginalized groups of the population and ensure the attainment of social justice. In light of the aforementioned context, this book offers an understanding of the various aspects of the Bihar government’s “development-with-justice” model, and the effects of its implementation on lives and quality of living conditions of the state’s underprivileged population. The book covers a wide spectrum of areas such as history of social reform measures, social justice in education, health, labour market, etc., caste- and gender-based discrimination, women’s empowerment, migrant workers, poverty, inequality, agrarian concerns, planning for development, and so on. Besides recommending policies to improve the state’s development outcomes, this book will aid researchers in identifying topics that may require additional research. Clearly researched, concise, and up-to-date, this book will be useful to the students and researchers from the fields of development economics, development studies, gender studies, sociology, political science, economic history, as well as the policy-planners in the government.",Social Science,322,N/A,0,en

"Access to Information, Technology, and Justice",Ursula Gorham,Rowman & Littlefield,2017-06-30,"Over the past fifteen years, the dramatic increase of online self-help legal re-sources, information, and tools specifically developed for use by low-income individuals without legal counsel has been promoted as one way to help those individuals who are caught in this “justice gap.” Unfortunately, however, opportunities arising from the Internet and related information and communication technologies do not accrue to everyone equally as physical, intellectual, and social barriers to information persist. Access to Information, Technology, and Justice: A Critical Intersection, as the first ever book length examination of the use of technology to expand access to justice in the United States, highlights an emerging paradox wherein the technological transformation that has created an increasing array of legal self-help resources and services is also creating barriers to access for disadvantaged individuals. Those who cannot read, those who do not speak the English language, those who are unfamiliar with the law, and those with limited digital literacy skills all find themselves at a fundamental disadvantage. The legal community has only begun to examine whether these resources and services are, in fact, meeting the needs of struggling self-help users. This book builds upon existing work in this area by undertaking an in-depth exploration of how information and communication technologies are changing – and failing to change – the legal in-formation landscape for those who most need this information. Drawing upon the ongoing collaborative efforts of legal aid organizations, libraries, courts, and non-profit organizations, this book provides a framework for removing barriers to equitable access to legal information, with the ultimate goal of encouraging continued discussion and action.",Language Arts & Disciplines,167,N/A,0,en

Therefore, the most fundamental task of all is to examine and get right the assumptions that underlie a theory. How do science's fundamental assumptions stand up to scrutiny? Science falls apart at a particular aspect of existence that can be defined exactly – at singularities. The whole logic of science collapses when singularities are encountered. This is fantastically problematic for science given that black holes are centred on singularities, photons are singularities, and the whole of the Big Bang Universe came from a Singularity. What, ontologically, are singularities? Descartes gave us the answer hundreds of years ago. Singularities are minds, and from that single fact, science is turned on its head.

But despite the importance of the social network in our country, there has been no single source of information about this critical component of our society. Even professionals in the field of social work or social services have not had a comprehensive volume addressing the myriad features of this critical societal structure. The Encyclopedia of Canadian Social Work fills this need. Over five hundred topics important to Canadian social work are covered, written by a highly diverse group of social workers covering all aspects of the field and all areas of the country. Practitioners, policy makers, academics, social advocates, researchers, students, and administrators present a rich overview of the complexity and diversity of social work and social welfare as it exists in Canada. The principal finding from this project underscores the long-held perception that there is a Canadian model of social work that is unique and stands as a useful model to other countries. The Encyclopedia of Canadian Social Work will be an important source of information, both to Canadians and to interested groups around the world. The Encyclopedia of Canadian Social Work is available in e-book version by subscription or from university and college libraries through the following vendors: Canadian Electronic Library, Ebrary, MyiLibrary, and Netlibrary.",Reference,473,N/A,0,en

"The Happy, Healthy Nonprofit","Beth Kanter, Aliza Sherman",John Wiley & Sons,2016-09-21,"Steer your organization away from burnout while boosting all-around performance The Happy, Healthy Nonprofit presents realistic strategies for leaders looking to optimize organizational achievement while avoiding the common nonprofit burnout. With a uniquely holistic approach to nonprofit leadership strategy, this book functions as a handbook to help leaders examine their existing organization, identify trouble spots, and resolve issues with attention to all aspects of operations and culture. The expert author team walks you through the process of building a happier, healthier organization from the ground up, with a balanced approach that considers more than just quantitative results. Employee wellbeing takes a front seat next to organizational performance, with clear guidance on establishing optimal systems and processes that bring about better results while allowing a healthier work-life balance. By improving attitudes and personal habits at all levels, you'll implement a positive cultural change with sustainable impact. Nonprofits are driven to do more, more, more, often with fewer and fewer resources; there comes a breaking point where passion dwindles under the weight of pressure, and the mission suffers as a result. This book shows you how to revamp your organization to do more and do it better, by putting cultural considerations at the heart of strategy. Find and relieve cultural and behavioral pain points Achieve better results with attention to well-being Redefine your organizational culture to avoid burnout Establish systems and processes that enable sustainable change At its core, a nonprofit is driven by passion. What begins as a personal investment in the organization's mission can quickly become the driver of stress and overwork that leads to overall lackluster performance. Executing a cultural about-face can be the lifeline your organization needs to thrive. The Happy, Healthy Nonprofit provides a blueprint for sustainable change, with a holistic approach to improving organizational outlook.",Business & Economics,198,N/A,0,en

This books aims to contribute to a better understanding of Chipembere in Malawi and abroad.

The autobiography includes chapters on the experience of the civil service and race discrimination; the effects of a missionary upbringing; the struggle for independence; and key public and parliamentary speeches. In a story that has only been allowed to circulate freely in Malawi recently, Chipembere recounts how the search for a politcal Messiah in the figure of Banda, and the final break with Banda unleashed personal and family tragedy as well as a nation's tragedy.",Biography & Autobiography,486,N/A,0,en

Attraction Explained,Viren Swami,Routledge,2015-12-22,"How much does appearance matter in the formation of romantic relationships? Do nice guys always finish last? Does playing hard-to-get ever work? What really makes for a good chat-up line? When it comes to relationships, theres no shortage of advice from self-help experts, pick-up artists, and glossy magazines. But modern-day myths of attraction often have no basis in fact or worse are rooted in little more than misogyny. In 'Attraction Explained', psychologist Viren Swami debunks these myths and draws on cutting-edge research to provide a ground-breaking and evidence-based account of relationship formation. At the core of this book is a very simple idea: there are no laws of attraction, no foolproof methods or strategies for getting someone to date you. But this isn't to say that theres nothing to be gained from studying attraction. Based on science rather than self-help cliches, Attraction Explained looks at how factors such as geography, appearance, personality, and similarity affect who we fall for and why.",Psychology,229,N/A,0,en

The Story Within Us,Megan Sweeney,University of Illinois Press,2012-09-11,"This volume features in-depth, oral interviews with eleven incarcerated women, each of whom offers a narrative of her life and her reading experiences within prison walls. The women share powerful stories about their complex and diverse efforts to negotiate difficult relationships, exercise agency in restrictive circumstances, and find meaning and beauty in the midst of pain. Their shared emphases on abuse, poverty, addiction, and mental illness illuminate the pathways that lead many women to prison and suggest possibilities for addressing the profound social problems that fuel crime. Framing the narratives within an analytic introduction and reflective afterword, Megan Sweeney highlights the crucial intellectual work that the incarcerated women perform despite myriad restrictions on reading and education in U.S. prisons. These women use the limited reading materials available to them as sources of guidance and support and as tools for self-reflection and self-education. Through their creative engagements with books, the women learn to reframe their own life stories, situate their experiences in relation to broader social patterns, deepen their understanding of others, experiment with new ways of being, and maintain a sense of connection with their fellow citizens on both sides of the prison fence.",Literary Criticism,291,N/A,0,en

Seven Deep Insecurities Men Don’T Want Women to Know,Sheri E. Ragland,WestBow Press,2015-09-09,"The author provides Robert Harris's compelling story of his struggles with manhood throughout his youth and adult life in part one. His journey begins with a complex childhood of poverty, uncertainty, and the fight to survive in Memphis, Tennessee. As a teenager in the streets, he dominated, ruled, and controlled individuals and relationships as a means of survival and to gain respect.

Don't Blame Us,Lily Geismer,Princeton University Press,2017-01-31,"Don't Blame Us traces the reorientation of modern liberalism and the Democratic Party away from their roots in labor union halls of northern cities to white-collar professionals in postindustrial high-tech suburbs, and casts new light on the importance of suburban liberalism in modern American political culture. Focusing on the suburbs along the high-tech corridor of Route 128 around Boston, Lily Geismer challenges conventional scholarly assessments of Massachusetts exceptionalism, the decline of liberalism, and suburban politics in the wake of the rise of the New Right and the Reagan Revolution in the 1970s and 1980s. Although only a small portion of the population, knowledge professionals in Massachusetts and elsewhere have come to wield tremendous political leverage and power. By probing the possibilities and limitations of these suburban liberals, this rich and nuanced account shows that—far from being an exception to national trends—the suburbs of Massachusetts offer a model for understanding national political realignment and suburban politics in the second half of the twentieth century.",History,386,N/A,0,en
Deep Care,Angela Hume,AK Press,2023-11-14,"The story of the radical feminist networks who worked outside the law to defend abortion. Starting in the 1970s, small groups of feminist activists met regularly to study anatomy, practice pelvic exams on each other, and learn how to safely perform a procedure known as menstrual extraction, which can empty the contents of the uterus in case of pregnancy using equipment that can be easily bought and assembled at home. This “self-help” movement grew into a robust national and international collaboration of activists and health workers determined to ensure access to reproductive healthcare, including abortion, at all costs—to the point of learning how to do the necessary steps themselves. Even after abortion was legalized in 1973 with Roe v. Wade, activists continued meeting, studying, and teaching these skills, reshaping their strategies alongside decades of changing legal, medical, and cultural landscapes such as the legislative war against abortion rights, the AIDS epidemic, and the rise of anti-abortion domestic terrorism in the 1980s and 90s. The movement’s drive to keep abortion accessible led to the first clinic defense mobilizations against anti-abortion extremists trying to force providers to close their doors. From the self-help movement sprang a constellation of licensed feminist healthcare clinics, community programs to promote reproductive health, even the nation’s first known-donor sperm bank, all while fighting the oppression of racism, poverty, and gender violence. Deep Care follows generations of activists and clinicians who orbited the Women's Choice clinic in Oakland from the early 1970s until 2010, as they worked underground and above ground, in small cells and broad coalitions and across political movements with grit, conviction, and allegiances of great trust to do what they believed needed to be done—despite the law, when required. Grounded in interviews of activists sharing details of their work for the first time, Angela Hume retells three decades of this critical, if under-recognized story of the radical edge of the abortion movement. These lessons are more pertinent than ever following the Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson decision and the devastation to abortion access nationwide.",Social Science,291,N/A,0,en

Are you trying to do it all and be it all—all the time? This radically different self-care guide will help you find the courage needed to express your deepest needs, nurture self-awareness, and be yourself in a world that expects you to be everything to everyone. If you’re like countless other women today, you probably feel overwhelmed, emotionally exhausted, anxious, stressed, frustrated, or unsatisfied. Or all of the above!

Don't Be Afraid of Loving Yourself: The Art of Loving Yourself According to Osho,Alden Clamor,Alden Clamor,2024-09-10,"A couple of years ago, on a bustling Avenue des Champs Élysées in Paris, I found myself gazing into the window of a quaint bookstore called Golden Books, my reflection staring back at me, a young man far from home, searching for answers. That day, I bought a book entitled “A Course in Miracles” that promised secrets to happiness, peace, and love. Yet, as I flipped through its pages, I realized I was looking for happiness, peace, and love in the wrong places. I cannot find love in the cro This book springs from a fundamental truth that took me from the vibrant locales of Europe back to the serene shores of the Philippines to discover that self-love is not just a state of feeling good about oneself but a profound journey toward inner freedom, peace, and fulfillment. It’s a truth that resonates across cultures, touching the hearts of those from every generation—millennials to baby boomers alike—each of us grappling with our own narratives of worthiness, happiness, love, and peace. My journey, woven through the academic halls of psychology and the compassionate wards of nursing, enriched by the profound wisdom of Osho’s teachings, has taught me that self-love transcends geographical and psychological borders. It is not confined to the corners of a mind or a specific latitude and longitude; it is a limitless, vibrant force that propels us forward. 1 DON’T BE AFRAID OF LOVING YOURSELF This book is crafted to guide you through the often tumultuous journey toward loving yourself. We all face the daunting challenges of societal expectations, the relentless pace of the digital age, and internal battles with our shadows of doubt and fear. Here, I offer not just understanding but practical pathways to navigate these trials. This book aims to illuminate the path to self-love through a blend of personal anecdotes, inspired insights from global wisdom traditions, and actionable steps.

Through the pages of this book, filled with practical and actionable steps in each chapter, you will be able to reclaim this power and make it your own again. This is not just a journey of self-discovery but a transformative adventure that promises to bring you closer to your most authentic self.

Optimizing the Self,Ole Jacob Madsen,Routledge,2015-06-19,"This book provides an analysis of the social representations of leading self-help genres, including neurolinguistic programming, cognitive self-help therapy, mindfulness, self-management, self-esteem, self-leadership and self-control. Exploring the globalised therapeutic culture of today, the book argues that psychology as ‘science’ is often abandoned to aid the individual pursuit for self-realization and self-optimization. Opposing the view that self-help culture is external to psychology, Madsen argues that it is firmly embedded within psychology, playing an important role in people’s lives. Each chapter traces and critically interprets a range of self-help philosophies and techniques, examining the claims of self-help literature to represent the most innovative psychological, medical or neurobiological research. Discussing each genre in turn, chapters examine key research alongside self-help literature to explore the effectiveness and impact of leading self-help genres in various social contexts and environments. The book offers a contemporary critical overview of issues concerning self-help, combining critical psychology with the theory of social representation to provide a broad perspective on self-help as a valid psychology. Optimizing the Self will be of interest to academics, researchers and postgraduate students in the fields of social representation, critical and cultural psychology and theory, clinical psychology, and the sociology of culture and science. The book will also be of use to critical and cultural psychologists and theorists, as well as clinical psychologists.",Psychology,290,N/A,0,en

Because doctors do not like to treat conditions they dont understand, patients are often ignored, denied pain relief, shuttled off to other experts, or filled with powerful prescription drugs that may add new and confusing symptoms.

Help from Heaven,Randal A. Wiedemann,WestBow Press,2016-01-19,"The theme in this book is that heaven is for those now alive. Instead of self-help, we need God-help. When Jesus prayed, “on earth as it is in heaven,” He was giving us a solution to earthly problems. In heaven, there are no burdens as we know them. There are no personality disorders, no interrelationship problems or feuds, no disease, no sense of tragic sadness. In fact, heaven is the blueprint for perfection in every aspect of life on earth. Without spoiling the punch line, this book is about receiving help from heaven in a way that will remove obstacles in your path so that you do not have to continually face the same problems over and over again. Only God can change our hearts and help us fix our problems at the deepest level. This change is quickened as we spend time in His presence and believe that God is able to overcome our problems. The challenge we have is waiting in His presence and believing. This book will give you tips on how to access help from heaven that is available for you right now. Your help from heaven can be instantaneous or it can take years. The time required for you to receive your help depends on you. Heaven is ready right now and Christ has done all that is required to set you free from your trouble. However, your problem may have taken years to develop. Getting out of it so that it doesn’t return to foil you the same way again may take some time too. What does that say? It says that we must never quit and never give up. In preparing to read this book, you may want to pray something like this: Lord God, I desire to enter Your presence. Please open the eyes of my heart and let Your love and truth penetrate my mind, body, soul, and spirit. May Your hand guide me and Your Spirit resonate within me as I read this book. Give me Your message and Your words. Thank You for interceding in my life with help from heaven. Amen.",Religion,136,N/A,0,en

Therapeutic Feedback with the MMPI-2,"Richard W. Levak, Liza Siegel, David S. Nichols",Routledge,2012-03-29,"Therapeutic Feedback with the MMPI-2 provides the clinician with empirically-based, practical information about how to convey the abundance of information in the MMPI-2 profile in a way that is collaborative, empathic, hopeful, and facilitates a therapeutic alliance. Readers will find this book to be as useful and applicable as the MMPI-2 itself, which is used in psychiatric hospitals; correctional settings; in evaluations for job selection, general medicine, forensic and child custody cases; and even in screenings for television, game, and reality shows. The authors expand upon this already robust test by demonstrating how therapeutic assessment and feedback can be improved upon by considering three contributions from positive psychology: that behavior can be viewed as potentially adaptive; traditional pathological and maladaptive behaviors can be reframed as understandable responses to stressors that therapeutic feedback is empathic, nonjudgmental, and mostly jargon free; humans respond to overwhelming stress in understandable ways that the therapist can give coherence and meaning to lastly, that therapeutic feedback stresses self-esteem and resilience building through self-awareness as a goal. Discussion centers around ten scales and 27 common code types. Each section addresses the complaints, thoughts, emotions, traits and behaviors associated with the profile; therapists’ notes; lifestyle and family background; modifying scales; therapy and therapeutic pitfalls; feedback statements; and treatment and self-help suggestions. The larger page size reflects the size of the MMPI-2 interpretive reports and makes it easy for clinicians to copy pages of the book to share with their clients. Therapeutic Feedback with the MMPI-2 is the most detailed volume available on MMPI-2 feedback and is a valuable addition to the bookshelf of any clinician who uses this test.",Psychology,412,N/A,0,en

Cultural Realism,Alastair Iain Johnston,Princeton University Press,2020-05-05,"Cultural Realism is an in-depth study of premodern Chinese strategic thought that has important implications for contemporary international relations theory. In applying a Western theoretical debate to China, Iain Johnston advances rigorous procedures for testing for the existence and influence of ""strategic culture."" Johnston sets out to answer two empirical questions. Is there a substantively consistent and temporally persistent Chinese strategic culture? If so, to what extent has it influenced China's approaches to security? The focus of his study is the Ming dynasty's grand strategy against the Mongols (1368-1644). First Johnston examines ancient military texts as sources of Chinese strategic culture, using cognitive mapping, symbolic analysis and congruence tests to determine whether there is a consistent grand strategic preference ranking across texts that constitutes a single strategic culture. Then he applies similar techniques to determine the effect of the strategic culture on the strategic preferences of the Ming decision makers. Finally, he assesses the effect of these preferences on Ming policies towards the Mongol ""threat."" The findings of this book challenge dominant interpretations of traditional Chinese strategic thought. They suggest also that the roots of realpolitik are ideational and not predominantly structural. The results lead to the surprising conclusion that there may be, in fact, fewer cross-national differences in strategic culture than proponents of the ""strategic culture"" approach think.",History,324,N/A,0,en

INTRO Holistic Health and Recovery,Kathleen V Russell,Holistic Health Integration United States,2023-09-10,"Holistic Health and Recovery is about an authentic relationship to self, integrating all our functionality. We tap into the mind and its emotions, along with its spirit, and the body, relating to social and economic topics. The author shares her foundations of growing up with a dysfunctional home life and how that wreaks havoc on her brain, body, and spirit. Her struggles were many and she did not understand how much they hindered her life. Like most in her situation, her attention and focus were nearly impossible through the trauma responses left in her body and mind, which would later dictate her life choices. She could not read a book that needed any attention, so her early years in school were insurmountable, and because of that, teachers viewed her as someone who just did not apply herself. Kathleen became a young bride and mother at 22. She always longed for a connection that seemed impossible to shake. Lost with a constant flow of negativity, confusion, and sadness, she lived in the shadow of life with feeling something was always wrong but had no idea what or how to change anything. Kathleen 's transformation has been a remarkable one in her determination to find a healing connection and self-worth. She has, with over 36 years in the process to date, and her lifeline is based on spiritual values she has learned and loved. Turning many corners, often with blind faith, it woke up sleeping parts of her heart and soul, all of which enabled her to focus on self-care. Her passion has been integrating the mind and spirit callings that were missed with old thinking habits of self-destruction and poor choices. Her passion has come through much healing and reflection and many collective generations of Wisdom who raised her in a spirit calling to turn on the lights will all the help and unconditional love they offered. Supremely insightful and hopeful reading that offers guidance and resources for all walks of life and healing possibilities.",,0,N/A,0,en

Patient Compliance with Medications,"Richard Schulz, Christopher Cook, Louis Roller, Jack Fincham, Jenny Gowan",CRC Press,2007-03-26,"Improve your patient’s health through a fresh view of their behaviors Patients who use over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medicine often do not take the drugs as intended, sometimes to the detriment to their health and well-being. These widespread problems cause health professionals to agonize over how to try to make sure patients comply with medication instructions. Patient Compliance with Medication: Issues and Opportunities tackles this tough issue by exploring in detail the range of noncompliance behavior, the negative impacts the behavior has on patients as well as society at large, and practical ways to influence people to take their medicine for optimum health. Respected pharmacist and author Jack Fincham and other noted experts provide insights, surprising data, and effective solutions to a challenge nearly all health professionals encounter. Patients often use drugs they get from a multitude of sources, making the capability of monitoring drug use difficult. Other problems can also interfere with a patient’s health, such as a patient borrowing drugs from family or friends—or even not taking them at all simply because he or she are unable to pay for them. Patient Compliance with Medication: Issues and Opportunities goes beyond the standard pat explanations and mostly ineffective quick solutions usually offered for the complicated noncompliance issue. Leading authorities describe the range of reasons for a patient’s behavior and provide practical strategies that strike at the root of the problem. Helpful tables, figures, and extensive references are also included. Topics in Patient Compliance with Medication: Issues and Opportunities include: the prevalence of noncompliance costs of noncompliance drug therapies that lead to noncompliance measuring compliance models to evaluate patient compliance evaluation methods ethical considerations health professionals’ roles in compliance disease state management future considerations much more Patient Compliance with Medication: Issues and Opportunities is insightful, crucial information for health professionals, educators, and students.",Medical,254,N/A,0,en

Congenital Heart Disease,"Serena Francesca Flocco, Angelo Lillo, Federica Dellafiore, Eva Goossens",Springer,2018-12-07,"This book provides the theoretical and practical basis of technical nursing in congenital heart disease; it is intended for nurses and nursing students, and for anyone involved in the treatment of these patients.

Congenital heart disease is a disorder that is present at birth, and studies show that the incidence is around eight cases per thousand live births. The heart is formed during the first four - ten weeks of gestation, and alterations to this process can affect normal development, leading to heart defects. There are various types of heart defects: abnormalities that affect a single part of the heart (for example a valve) but also, highly complex abnormalities where there is severe damage to the cardiac architecture. The seriousness of the disease and the effects on child health vary: some forms have no real impact on child health and allow a normal life, while others are incompatible with life.",Medical,302,N/A,0,en

Self-Improvement,Robert N. Johnson,OUP Oxford,2011-10-06,"Is there any moral obligation to improve oneself, to foster and develop various capacities in oneself? From a broadly Kantian point of view, Self-Improvement defends the view that there is such an obligation and that it is an obligation that each person owes to him or herself. The defence addresses a range of arguments philosophers have mobilized against this idea, including the argument that it is impossible to owe anything to yourself, and the view that an obligation to improve onself is overly 'moralistic'. Robert N. Johnson argues against Kantian universalization arguments for the duty of self-improvement, as well as arguments that bottom out in a supposed value humanity has. At the same time, he defends a position based on the notion that self- and other-respecting agents would, under the right circumstances, accept the principle of self-improvement and would leave it up to each to be the person to whom this duty is owed.",Philosophy,183,N/A,0,en

Modeling and Simulation,Hartmut Bossel,CRC Press,2018-10-08,"Models and simulations of all kinds are tools for dealing with reality. Humans have always used mental models to better understand the world around them: to make plans, to consider different possibilities, to share ideas with others, to test changes, and to determine whether or not the development of an idea is feasible. The book Modeling and Simulation uses exactly the same approach except that the traditional mental model is translated into a computer model, and the simulations of alternative outcomes under varying conditions are programmed on the computer. The advantage of this method is that the computer can track the multitude of implications and consequences in complex relationships much more quickly and reliably than the human mind. This unique interdisciplinary text not only provides a self contained and complete guide to the methods and mathematical background of modeling and simulation software (SIMPAS) and a collection of 50 systems models on an accompanying diskette. Students from fields as diverse as ecology and economics will find this clear interactive package an instructive and engaging guide.",Computers,621,N/A,0,en

Self-care: the way to find balance in life,Ulrica Lovén Wickman,Linköping University Electronic Press,2019-09-04,"Introduction: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and Crohn’s disease (CD) occur worldwide and are life-long chronic conditions. The symptoms, which include abdominal pain and frequent diarrhea, cause limitations in life. Thus, patients with IBD need self-care in accordance with their symptoms, their own commitment to maintaining health, and decisions on symptom management. To strengthen self-care, there is a need for a tool that assesses self-care in patients with IBD, which aims to support the patient dialogue about self-care. The overall aim of this thesis was to develop and evaluate a questionnaire for the clinical assessment of self-care, and to explore self-care in relation to disease activity and to health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with IBD. Design and method: The thesis includes four studies, where studies I, II and IV were conducted in Sweden, and study III was conducted in the United States (U.S.). In study I, a descriptive design, interviews were conducted with twenty adult patients, in order to explore self-care in patients with IBD. In study II, the self-care questionnaire was developed and tested with 193 patients with IBD in Sweden. In study III, a crosssectional descriptive design, the self-care questionnaire was translated into English, and the responses of 67 patients in the U.S. were evaluated. Finally, in study IV, a cross-sectional exploratory design was used to explore self-care in relation to patient characteristics, disease activity, and HRQOL among 234 patients. For a total of 421 patients, the data was analyzed using content analysis, and descriptive and analytic statistics (studies I, II, III and IV). Results: Among patients with IBD, self-care relates to symptom recognition, handling of symptoms, planning life, and seeking new options. Self-care varied according to how the patient managed daily life with regard to the symptoms of the disease (study I). Based on the results from study I, the self-care questionnaire was developed in Swedish, resulting in a valid and reliable questionnaire comprising 22 items (study II). The questionnaire was translated to English, and performed self-care activities were associated with a lower degree of well-being in relation to age and gender (study III). The patients were taking medication for IBD, paying attention to their intestinal symptoms, adapting their diet, managing their stress, planning their day and avoiding activities (studies III and IV). Self-care was more frequent in patients with CD when it came to paying attention to psychological symptoms; diet adaption; avoiding various activities including sex; and looking for new approaches to living with IBD. A greater degree of self-care activities was associated with a lower degree of HRQOL (IV). Conclusion: The results indicate the importance of identifying the total symptom experience, and of the patient’s need to discuss self-care, in order to strengthen selfcare and achieve better treatment. The self-care questionnaire can be a useful tool to benefit the discussion of self-care for the patient, and to secure health literacy, medication adherence, and HRQOL. The valid and reliable self-care questionnaire is available for patients with IBD at gastroenterology clinics or out-patient clinics, as primary care. Disease activity affects self-care, and consequently the self-care activities.",,90,N/A,0,en

Essential Lessons for the Success of Telehomecare,"Anthony P. Glascock, David M. Kutzik",IOS Press,2012,"The technology underpinning the various types of Telehomecare available has been current for more than a decade, and the time is right for an evaluation of both the technology and the effectiveness of Telehomecare as a system which contributes to the delivery of care within the home. The field is complex, encompassing multiple applications which monitor things such as task oriented behavior; lifestyle; vital signs; environmental extremes (such as carbon monoxide levels); and passive personal emergency response systems. All of these applications are based upon the collection of data within the home by a device which translates that data into information and transmits it to an external location, prompting some type of action if necessary. This book brings together the views and experience of a wide variety of contributors involved in the research and application of Telehomecare. It is divided into two sections, containing contributions from the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Each section, comprises chapters written from three different perspectives: research-based, business and the implementation of care. The authors include academic researchers, policy experts, individuals with direct business experience and care providers from each of the three countries. The book reflects on where Telehomecare is today and speculates as to what the future might hold for the field. It will be of interest to all those involved in caring for people in their own homes.",Medical,304,N/A,0,en

The thoughts here presented belong to whom? I wish I might tell you, but truly, I do not know. Aside from the many quotations I have given, thought after thought has appeared, fairly insisting that it be used. As each thought came, I wrote it down for the purpose of putting in concise form the information so many desired. If there be such things as original thoughts, some of these may be so named. But how can one be sure? With my mind equipped with a New Thought wireless, I may have caught and appropriated ideas that someone else was sending; or, from the reading of Epictetus, Emerson, Allen, Brown, Huckel, Hudson, Fletcher, Militz; Mulford, Marden, Towne, Larson, Randall, Sears and others, my subconscious mind may have absorbed and given back to me the thoughts of these good writers and able teachers I feel positive it may be used to help others, as I have endeavored to help, in the work of replacing instead of repressing; of changing the old form of pessimistic thought for the new one of health, prosperity and happiness. ----- A Study in Karma by Annie Besant This scarce antiquarian book is a facsimile reprint of the original.

The Self-Care Project,Jayne Hardy,Hachette UK,2017-12-14,"'Refreshing, heartfelt and humble...a game changer in promoting positive mental health' Sarah Turner, bestselling author of THE UNMUMSY MUM There's a damaging misconception in society that putting ourselves first is an act of selfishness. But self-care is not just a millennial buzzword. Without the restorative power of self-care, how will we ever escape the vicious circle where we're sick and fed-up of feeling sick and fed-up? Self-care is a tool, accessible to us all, which helps us to take responsibility for our own happiness - our physical, emotional, psychological and social needs. Jayne Hardy, founder and CEO of The Blurt Foundation, argues that it is the best preventative measure available to us to combat overwhelmedness, stress and ill health, in our hectic, modern world. The Self-Care Project is for those who have been feeling off-kilter for a while but have not been able to put the finger on the 'why'. It is a no-nonsense, practical journey to help you do just that. It'll walk you through the case for self-care (why it's so darn important), why it isn't selfish at all, help you explore what self-care means for you, what your obstacles might be and provide advice on how to chisel out daily space for self-care in a practical, achievable and realistic way.

Self- Help: The Understanding of Life,Vladimir Zivkovic,Vladimir Živković,N/A,"“Self- Help: The Understanding of Life” is another insightful reading from Vladimir Zivkovic, the author of books “Modern Relationships” and “The Book about Divine-Self”. How to improve your low self-esteem? Where all these modern life problems stem from? How to overcome them and stay on the right path in this crazy world? Further on, it reflects on the issues of the modern man with Self, God, morality, and authorities. The author offers real-life examples to help readers answer these currently burning questions and regain their lost spirituality and confidence. The author mainly talks about our attitude to everyday life and shortcomings of the modern life philosophies which have separated man from its true nature and purpose. The main goal of being happy has turned into great confusion of various teachings and into pure hedonism and an egotistic striving for some kind of success and fame or just to simply pleasure and indulge oneself and one's appetites for worldly pleasures. In this book, is presented a positive spiritual discipline that is free from ego and that will aid a reader to keep one's mind open for the important questions in life. Eventually, it turns out that we look for happiness in the wrong places all the time - the main goal of being happy is not focused on ego, but on making others happy most of the times. Our transient time and memory are another reason to make us question our ways in the world and what we really want to focus on in our lives. Keep in mind that everything that is worthy will not come easily. The change starts with you and it takes lots of work. We should just stop rushing towards materialism and continue moving on at a steady pace towards our true nature and purpose.",Self-Help,55,N/A,0,en

Debunking the Top 9 Self-Help Myths,Aaron A. Andrews,Black Star Media Group,2015-03-29,"Debunking the Top 9 Self-Help Myths Are you tired of traditional self-help literature that always gives the same advice? Would you like to learn why the total opposite of self-help “truths” can actually work much better for you? If so, Debunking the Top 9 Self-Help Myths is for you. The book presents 9 self-help myths and shows how the opposite advice can work better. A large part of the book is based on scientific research that proves beyond doubt that some self-help myths are indeed just dangerous myths. Let’s Put an End to Dangerous Self-Help Myths Some self-help myths are not only wrong, they are outright harmful for you. One of such myths is the myth of waking up early in order to achieve success and the myth that visualizing the goal will help you achieve it. In fact, scientists have proved that visualizing the goal will lead you further away from it. And as for waking up early, at least 20% of us will only feel miserable when following this advice. Here are other things you’ll learn from the book: - two types of procrastination and why one of them is great for you - why procrastination can help you evaluate your life choices - why procrastination can help you find a reason why - why hard work is stupid - the story of how ignorant farmers popularized the myth of working hard - three reasons why cutting down your hours will do you good - how to achieve more with less (hint: it’s not about working hard) - why sometimes it’s better to give up than keep going (persistence doesn’t always pay) - why a step-by-step approach isn’t always the right choice (and what to do instead) - the myth of getting rich slowly - why there’s no single recipe for success and why you shouldn’t look for one - the halo effect and its effect on our judgment of successful people - what the Japanese streets can teach you about doing the opposite thing and still being right - two types of perfectionism and why one of them can change your life - why you don’t need more discipline (and what you need instead of discipline) - how long it really takes to develop a habit Would You Like to Achieve Success by Following the Unconventional Path? By following the unconventional advice from the book you can achieve much better results than by following the traditional way of doing things. Some of the most common self-help tips can actually harm you instead of helping you. Debunking the Top 9 Self-Help Myths will help you avoid doing things that have been proven by the scientists to harm you instead of helping you. You too can benefit from the self-help literature – but first you have to learn how to read them critically, and this book will help you achieve this goal. PS. All readers will get access to a bonus chapter of the book that explains why productivity systems are useless.

The Individual’s Guide to Grants,Judith B. Margolin,Springer,1983-03-31,"This book is a work of conscience. It is the product of a long-standing feeling of obligation on my part to write something useful for a special group of people to which you probably belong-individuals who seek grants. In my years as Director of the New York library of The Foundation Center, * each and every day I encountered numbers of individuals look ing for grant money. Although I tried to be as supportive as possible, in the face of the particular problems shared by this group of library users, my own reaction was one of relative helplessness. Simply stated, most of the fund-raising guides, printed directories, and computer files purport edly created to serve the fund-raising public are of little or no use to individuals who seek funding on their own. These resources are directed *The Foundation Center is the independent, nonprofit organization established by foun dations to provide information for the grant-seeking public. vii viii I PREFACE toward the nonprofit, tax-exempt agency, which is the most common recipient of foundation, corporate, and government largess. They are not designed to respond to the special requirements of the individual grant seeker. In the applicant eligibility index, the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance defines individuals as ""homeowners, students, farmers, artists, scientists, consumers, small-business persons, minors, refugees, aliens, veterans, senior citizens, low-income persons, health and educational professionals, builders, contractors, developers, handicapped persons, the physically afflicted.""

This wisdom inquiry offers, some background, an integrative theory for most of the versions of the precepts found amongst the worlds cultures, in addition to, some newly created reciprocity labels, and maxims, based on mutuality, generosity, altruism and ethical levels.

The Psychology of Health and Illness,Ami Rokach,Taylor & Francis,2024-02-08,"This book examines the effects of various stresses, strains, and traumas in our lives, from the womb till adulthood. The consequences of such stresses are delineated, and this book describes ways of coping with it. Research has demonstrated, repeatedly, that chronic stress may increase unhealthy behavior which may further enhance the development of poor lifestyle habits, substance abuse, or physical inactivity. This may significantly and negatively influence not only our physical wellbeing but emotional one as well. Certain personality traits, like neuroticism for example, is positively correlated with poor physical functioning, greater alcohol consumption as well as increased cigarette smoking. Similarly, extraversion, agreeableness, and emotional stability were shown to significantly affect lifestyle, physical activity, and self-care, and consequently one’s health. The chapters in this volume cover various issues that are related to and influence our health — from how adverse childhood experiences can affect our mental health, resulting in anxiety and heightened stress, how partner violence can cause trauma on the physical and emotional health of its victims to examining the effect of assisted reproductive technology on the mother-child relationship. This book also explores the various ways to cope with the significant stress that we experience daily in our lives, as well as how self-care is important in maintaining good health and in avoiding burnout. This book will be of great value to students, researchers and practitioners of psychology, including health psychology and psychoanalysis.

A to Z About Body Language,Jackson Yogarajah,Jackson Yogarajah,N/A,"A to Z about Body Language is written by an expert on body language and deception detection with over 25 years of teaching and deception detection experience. The writer's expertise and deception detection services are often sought after by enforcement agencies, including the Royal Malaysian Police Force in Malaysia. This book is useful for anyone who wishes to avoid being deceived or for those seeking to benefit from their own body language. Written in two parts, it can help anyone learn simple ways to read body language, detect deception, and take advantage of their very own body language. The author includes a chapter on his observation of the video clip and body language of Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, who piloted the missing MH 370. The clip in the airport at the time of his departure, 7th March 2014, gives convincing and dramatic body language signs and later clues to the disappearance of MH 370. The author's further research on the ill-fated flight, points to the disappearance of MH 370 to Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah. The writer also rebuts author Florence de Changy's latest book that MH370 was shot down into the sea, and that the disappearance was a massive cover-up by the Malaysian authorities. The book benefits you in more ways than you ever thought about body language, by learning to spot body language and using it in the best ways for your own advantage. You will also learn more about your body language and the subconscious mind and how to use its power to make you a better person. Crossing your arms may be viewed somewhat negatively by some, but not if you know its significance and its benefits. If you change the way, you use your arms, and if you understand your habit mind, which is your subconscious mind, you can be a better person. If you are a school teacher, you can use body language to help your class of boisterous children to be calm and focused. By requesting these children to cross their arms and legs for just two to three minutes, these children's anxieties and restlessness would vanish, and they would be as calm as after the storm. The second part of the book teaches you simple ways to escape from been deceived or scammed out of your hard-earned money, betrayed by a trusted friend, colleague, relative, or even your spouse. The simple lie detection skills highlighted within are the most valuable aids this book will provide you. It is a treasured skill, as you can never be guaranteed if people are lying, until you ask the right questions, observe and listen to the how-to that is taught in this book. It is not hard to determine truths, analyze body language and verbal language if you know what you are looking and listening for. This is what is precisely taught in this beneficial 13-chaptered book that generously features a grand total of 266 photographs, images, tables, drawings, and illustrations, to help you interpret correctly the hidden messages you see, hear, feel, smell and taste every day.",Education,350,N/A,0,en

"Gen Z, Explained","Roberta Katz, Sarah Ogilvie, Jane Shaw, Linda Woodhead",University of Chicago Press,2022-10-26,"An optimistic and nuanced portrait of a generation that has much to teach us about how to live and collaborate in our digital world. Born since the mid-1990s, members of Generation Z comprise the first generation never to know the world without the internet, and the most diverse generation yet. As Gen Z starts to emerge into adulthood and enter the workforce, what do we really know about them? And what can we learn from them? Gen Z, Explained is the authoritative portrait of this significant generation. It draws on extensive interviews that display this generation’s candor, surveys that explore their views and attitudes, and a vast database of their astonishingly inventive lexicon to build a comprehensive picture of their values, daily lives, and outlook. Gen Z emerges here as an extraordinarily thoughtful, promising, and perceptive generation that is sounding a warning to their elders about the world around them—a warning of a complexity and depth the “OK Boomer” phenomenon can only suggest. ​ Much of the existing literature about Gen Z has been highly judgmental. In contrast, this book provides a deep and nuanced understanding of a generation facing a future of enormous challenges, from climate change to civil unrest. What’s more, they are facing this future head-on, relying on themselves and their peers to work collaboratively to solve these problems. As Gen Z, Explained shows, this group of young people is as compassionate and imaginative as any that has come before, and understanding the way they tackle problems may enable us to envision new kinds of solutions. This portrait of Gen Z is ultimately an optimistic one, suggesting they have something to teach all of us about how to live and thrive in this digital world.",History,275,N/A,0,en

Exercise your way to health: Depression,"Debbie Lawrence, Jenny Burns",A&C Black,2014-12-01,"Depression is hugely common in our society. The Mental Health Foundation believes that 1 in 4 people will experience some kind of mental health problem in the course of a year, with mixed anxiety and depression being the most common. It affects 1 in 5 older people living in the community and 2 in 5 in care homes (MHF). This means that a staggering amount of people are having to deal with its devastating fallout at home, work and in retirement each year. However, evidence shows that a supervised programme of exercise can be as effective as antidepressants in treating mild or moderate depression (Mental Health Foundation / MIND). The link between exercise and mental wellbeing is a key part of recovery, and this user-friendly book is there to show the way. As with all the titles in the Exercise Your Way to Health series, the book contains a series of well-illustrated exercises specifically designed to combat depression and its physical side effects. Taking into account the prevalence of depression and the well-documented link between exercise and mental health, this is a timely publication, and one that will help many people regain control of their lives.",Health & Fitness,124,N/A,0,en

Value Realization from Efficient Software Deployment,"Alex Louwe Kooijmans, Anshu Kak, Shaun A. Crain, Andrej Crepinsek, Venkata Gadepalli, Ian Hall, IBM Redbooks",IBM Redbooks,2011-10-25,"Many companies have a complex process for purchasing software that is required by IT projects, or better, by the business. Usually software is purchased by a centralized procurement function, and is either purchased on a project-by-project basis or as a large periodic software contract. Unfortunately purchasing software products does not automatically mean that these products are exploited throughout the organization providing the maximum possible value to the business units. Several issues call for a structured approach that gets the most business value out of software already purchased. The objectives of this approach are to: Create maximum awareness throughout the organization of the software purchased. Track software use in IT projects and act if products are not used at all, used improperly, or insufficiently used. Facilitate use of software products in projects, especially when software products are complex and require a lot of integration. We can summarize the overall objective of this approach as ensuring that the business units in an organization obtain the maximum possible value of software products purchased, which is also the scope of this IBM® Redbooks® publication.",Computers,250,N/A,0,en

Eating Disorders and the Brain,"Bryan Lask, Ian Frampton",John Wiley & Sons,2011-09-19,"Why is the brain important in eating disorders? This ground-breaking new book describes how increasingly sophisticated neuroscientific approaches are revealing much about the role of the brain in eating disorders. Even more importantly, it discusses how underlying brain abnormalities and dysfunction may contribute to the development and help in the treatment of these serious disorders. Neuropsychological studies show impairments in specific cognitive functions, especially executive and visuo-spatial skills. Neuroimaging studies show structural and functional abnormalities, including cortical atrophy and neural circuit abnormalities, the latter appearing to be playing a major part in the development of anorexia nervosa. Neurochemistry studies show dysregulation within neurotransmitter systems, with effects upon the modulation of feeding, mood, anxiety, neuroendocrine control, metabolic rate, sympathetic tone and temperature. The first chapter, by an eating disorders clinician, explains the importance of a neuroscience perspective for clinicians. This is followed by an overview of the common eating disorders, then chapters on what we know of them from studies of neuroimaging, neuropsychology and neurochemistry. The mysterious phenomenon of body image disturbance is then described and explained from a neuroscience perspective. The next two chapters focus on neuroscience models of eating disorders, the first offering an overview and the second a new and comprehensive explanatory model of anorexia nervosa. The following two chapters offer a clinical perspective, with attention on the implications of a neuroscience perspective for patients and their families, the second providing details of clinical applications of neuroscience understanding. The final chapter looks to the future. This book succinctly reviews current knowledge about all these aspects of eating disorder neuroscience and explores the implications for treatment. It will be of great interest to all clinicians (psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, dieticians, paediatricians, physicians, physiotherapists) working in eating disorders, as well as to neuroscience researchers.",Medical,258,N/A,0,en

Improving Outcomes in Diabetic Foot Care - A Worldwide Perspective,"Richard Paisey, José Luis Lázaro Martínez, Joanne Paton, Frances Game , Honda Hsu",Frontiers Media SA,2024-11-11,"Enhanced population longevity, decrease in physical activity and the obesity pandemic have resulted in an increase in incidence of type 2 diabetes in all WHO health care areas. The prevalence of the condition has been further increased by an increase in life expectancy of those living with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes as a result of lifestyle and therapeutic interventions. Microvascular complications of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus are related to duration of the condition and include neuropathy in 20% of cases in all cultures. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy in combination with propensity to distal peripheral vascular disease, poor healing, infection and foot deformities often result in foot ulceration and a uniquely high minor and major amputation risk. The risk for foot ulceration is modified by ethnicity (foot flexibility) and life style (footwear and culture of walking bare-foot). Once a deep diabetic foot ulcer has developed the epidermis, dermis, tendon insertions and bone architecture will never return to normal . The lack of resilience in the scar tissue formed and foot deformity after a deep ulcer will confer a high risk of re-ulceration-in fact previous foot ulceration is by far the highest risk factor for occurrence of a foot wound in persons living with diabetes.",Medical,179,N/A,0,en

It constitutes one of the most invalidating neurological disorders that can occur after stroke. It is therefore important to treat neglect as adequate as possible and much of the research dedicated to neglect therefore focuses on rehabilitation. In this special topic, you will find 29 articles on the rehabilitation of neglect. This Research Topic has opened new perspectives, and has given us an indication of where the field is going. Although some of the current rehabilitation techniques have proven to be beneficial, there is limited agreement on the most valuable technique or the mechanisms underlying the ameliorating effects.",Neuropsychology,270,N/A,0,en
The ventricular-subventricular zone: a source of oligodendrocytes in the adult brain," Oscar Gonzalez-Perez, Jose Manuel Garcia-Verdugo, Adan Aguirre",Frontiers E-books,2014-09-30,"Demyelinating diseases are characterized by an extensive loss of oligodendrocytes and myelin sheaths from axolemma, which commonly result in disability in young adults. To date, there is no effective treatment against these neurological disorders. In the adult brain, there are neural stem cells (NSCs) that reside within a niche denominated ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) in the lateral wall of the cerebral ventricles. NSCs give rise to neurons and oligodendrocytes that help preserve cellular homeostasis. Growing evidence indicates that V-SVZ progenitor cells may represent an endogenous source of oligodendrocytes that can be useful to treat demyelinating diseases. This e-Book “The ventricular-subventricular zone as a source of oligodendrocytes in the adult brain” collected the most recent evidence regarding the mechanisms that modulate the proliferation, migration, quiescence, cell-fate choices and survival of oligodendrocyte precursors generated in the V-SVZ. Herein, we compiled information about the role of Sonic hedgehog, NMDA receptors, ErbB proteins, hemopressin, erythropoietin, osmolarity and microglia in the oligodendrocyte production. Some chapters also describe the role of oligodendrocyte precursors in the preservation of cellular homeostasis, aging and white matter repair. All these information is presented as novel research findings, short communications, and review articles, which were written by experts in the field of oligodendrocyte generation, myelin production and white matter re-myelination.",Brain,251,N/A,0,en

Mental Health Promotion and Protection,"Naseem Akhtar Qureshi, Samrat Singh Bhandari, Giorgio Di Lorenzo, Harshavardhan Sampath",Frontiers Media SA,2023-09-13,"The WHO constitution states: ""Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."" There are multiple factors that contribute towards good mental health including civil liberties, politics, economics, social rights, and cultural diversity, and quality of life of the individual and the society as a whole. The promotion of mental health spans many disciplines in order to cover all these factors such as education, work, justice, housing, and welfare. Therefore, it is important to collaborate to create an environment that promotes and supports mental health to improve psychological well-being and allow individuals to realize their own abilities, work productively and contribute to society and live fulfilling lives. There is no health without mental health that is vital to individuals, families, communities, and societies across the world and so the goal of this Research Topic is to collate ideas and research of strategies for the promotion of mental health across all disciplines in order to raise awareness of mental health promotion and protection to ensure it’s incorporation in national mental health policies going forwards. This is of particular relevance given the mental health crisis being experienced across the world right now.",Medical,347,N/A,0,en

我如何真確理解世界：漢斯．羅斯林的人生思辨,漢斯．羅斯林（Hans Rosling）,先覺,2020-01-01,"榮獲誠品．博客來．商業周刊選書推薦 一個慷慨無畏的靈魂，如何以他的思辨與抉擇撼動世界？ 《真確》作者漢斯．羅斯林逝世前堅持寫下的人生自述！ 為什麼比爾．蓋茲會自掏腰包，讓全美大學生人手一本《真確》，甚至要求每個微軟的員工都要讀？ 是什麼樣的人生歷程與思辨，讓漢斯．羅斯林成為舉世聞名的全球公衛學家與教育家，並以《真確》揭露世界的真相，扭轉我們的直覺偏誤？ 以TED演講與《真確》聞名於世的漢斯．羅斯林，擅於運用活潑數據解釋世界的真貌，是我們這個時代最受歡迎的學者。2016年，醫生無預警通知他得了胰臟癌，漢斯立刻決定排除萬難寫下這本書，完整公開他的一生，以及他如何學會理解世界、在生命最艱難的時刻做出抉擇。 本書從漢斯．羅斯林兒時透過咖啡豆產地認識國家寫起，描述一名出身寒微的年輕人，藉由科學深入各個角落，重新詮釋這個世界。他隨時願意承認錯誤，接受相悖的觀點，一次又一次挑戰自己的既定想法，逐步克服偏見，形塑自己的價值觀與人生思辨，並因此致力於運用數據揭露事實，寫下《真確》一書，影響力遍及全球。 無論是在資源窘迫的非洲納卡拉急診室徹底反思醫者的價值，或是在世界經濟論壇以真確問題檢視全球領導人的無知，甚至是因為過於專注地實踐理想差點被太太掃地出門，漢斯．羅斯林持續將自己的生命奉獻給世界。 他值得你認識，你也需要知道，世界上曾經走過這樣一個美好的靈魂。 ◎各界推薦 陳建仁│中華民國副總統／中研院院士／國際公衛專家 林明仁│台灣大學經濟學系特聘教授兼系主任 馮勃翰│台灣大學經濟學系副教授 楊斯棓│方寸管理顧問有限公司首席顧問 姚詩豪│「大人學」共同創辦人 鄭國威│泛科知識公司知識長 劉 軒│知名作家／心理導師 連加恩│醫師／哈佛大學公共衛生博士候選人 楊右任│舊鞋救命國際基督關懷協會創辦人 ──感動推薦 ◎好評迴響 作為一個流行病學家和病因探索者，我極力推薦這本很有趣的傳記。本書描述瑞典臨床醫師、全球衛生教授以及公共教育家漢斯．羅斯林的生命故事，娓娓道岀這位全球百大影響力人物、百大思想家和百大創意人物的成長歷程與大師傳奇，帶給讀者喜樂和信心，努力去真確了解現實世界，比想像中的更加美好！ 本書作者在瑞典完成醫師教育訓練後，毅然決然到非洲進行醫療服務，在當地發現樹薯所引起的癱瘓症──綁腿病，這兩者的因果關係後來也在古巴得到證實。他還成立了蓋普曼德基金會，致力推廣平民教育，教導大眾「解開事實的神祕性」。讀者若能一併閱讀羅斯林醫師的大作《真確》，必會受益更多，更能洞察世事真相，對人類的未來充滿希望！ ──陳建仁（中華民國副總統／中研院院士／國際公衛專家） 每次看羅斯林的書與影片，到最後我總是會掉下眼淚。他是如此地用熱情、數據與思考，去理解、進而改變世界。He is my inspiration, I want to be like him! ──林明仁（台灣大學經濟學系特聘教授兼系主任） 沒想到，在以無數場演說跟《真確》一書刷新世人對世界的假知之後，已逝的公衛專家漢斯．羅斯林竟還留下了這本真摯且震撼的回憶錄。相較於他在TED演講裡的風趣與在《真確》裡的清晰邏輯，他在這本遺作裡勇敢揭露了自己曾有的偏見，以及這些偏見如何一次又一次被生命中的人與事打破，並重新塑造了他。平實卻深刻入骨，令我閱讀時頻頻激動，直至眼眶泛紅，但又彷彿聽見他說：擦去眼淚，捲起袖子吧！ ──鄭國威（泛科知識公司知識長） 大家常說「台灣人欠缺世界觀」，但到底要如何培養「世界觀」呢？送小孩進雙語幼稚園、平常多看國際新聞，就真的能培養世界觀嗎？從這本書我們可以看到漢斯．羅斯林這位出身瑞典勞工家庭的小孩，如何在父母的引導下建立對這個世界的關注，成為醫生之後仍充滿對人文的熱情與關懷，並且透過他在公衛方面的經驗，以及讓數據說話的能力，讓全球數以萬計的公民更真確地認識我們所處的世界。 這是一本好看的自傳，也是一本啟發我們「世界觀」的好書。 ──姚詩豪（「大人學」共同創辦人） 上次這麼感傷又激動地讀一本書，是讀蘭迪．鮑許的《最後的演講》，他是一位熱情、風趣的大學教授，就如同漢斯．羅斯林。 上帝跟他們兩位都開了一個讓人笑不出來的玩笑，胰臟癌對他們無情叩門。 十八年來，漢斯．羅斯林建立的蓋普曼德基金會，不分學霸學渣，推廣平民教育，畢竟民主社會的一切是靠長年一票一票投出來的結果加總，感謝他們看似平凡實為偉大的行動。 ──楊斯棓（方寸管理顧問有限公司首席顧問） 想要改變世界，除了滿腔的熱血，更需要方向完善的策略，以及幫助我們認清事實的統計數據。 作者生命中所走過的早期社會發展、非洲行醫的經歷，以及統計研究的過程，完美地呈現出第一線人員在情感與數據中必須取得的平衡與掙扎。 ──楊右任（舊鞋救命國際基督關懷協會創辦人） ◎媒體讚譽 「本書充滿令人興奮的冒險故事……娛樂性與詳實的資訊兼備！」──《瑞典每日新聞報》 「所有相信這個世界即將滅亡的人，都應該好好閱讀漢斯．羅斯林的這本書。故事中的冒險歷程，傳達了恰恰相反的訊息。」──《瑞典日報》 「仿如驚悚電影般，客觀描繪了病患、員工和人類的命運，嚴謹且具有戲劇性與教育意涵。」──《哥德堡郵報》 「報導文學的寫作方式，直率又真實！」──瑞典BTJ雜誌 「閱讀這本書會讓你發現：沒有什麼是不可能的！」──瑞典每日電視節目Go'kväll 「漢斯．羅斯林能夠將慘淡的畫面，成功轉化成活靈活現的故事。」──瑞典知名新聞網Aftonbladet ◎國外讀者感動好評 ★讀了這本書，心中只湧起對漢斯．羅斯林滿滿的欽佩之意！ ★我最大的遺憾就是沒有能夠早一點認識漢斯．羅斯林！ ★真是位偉大的榜樣。謝謝漢斯．羅斯林做的一切！ ★真是慶幸漢斯．羅斯林留給世人《真確》及這本書，這兩部著作讓他的傳奇永留於世。 ★這是我讀過最好的人生自述！讓你對世界燃起更多的希望，也讓你知道任何事都是有可能的！ ★一打開就無法闔上這本書！漢斯．羅斯林真是奇妙且鼓舞人心。 ★令人大開眼界，每個人都應該要閱讀這本書！ ★漢斯．羅斯林揭露了發生在非洲的怪病真相，引領世界走向更美好的未來。他所運用的數據和分析，通常被視為冷冰冰的科學技能，但是本書告訴我們：驅使他這麼做的，是豐沛的熱情與情感。 作者簡介 漢斯．羅斯林（Hans Rosling, 1948-2017） 臨床醫師、數據學家、全球公衛學家，也是知名的公共教育家，曾擔任世界衛生組織（WHO）與聯合國兒童基金會（UNICEF）顧問，共同創辦無國界醫生的瑞典分部，也是世界經濟論壇（WEF）全球議程網路的成員。 2005年，漢斯和兒子奧拉與媳婦安娜共同創辦了蓋普曼德基金會（Gapminder Foundation），以立基於事實的認知，對抗廣泛的無知，協助人們了解這個世界。他經常獲邀至企業、國際機構與非政府組織講學，更史無前例地十度登上TED大會，演講影片瀏覽總數超過3,500萬次。 漢斯的學術研究和持續追求增進人類福祉的貢獻，使他獲得表彰人文學科與自然科學領域學術翹楚的尤金．甘農獎（Eugene R. Gannon Award）、哈佛大學年度人道主義獎（Harvard Humanitarian Award）、英國皇家地理學會皇家獎章、聯合國人口獎，並入選《時代》雜誌全球百大影響力人物、美國《外交政策》雜誌全球百大思想家，以及商業雜誌Fast Company的年度百大創意人物。 他自詡為認真的「可能性主義者」──既不抱持無端的希望，也不抱持無端的恐懼，持續抵抗過度誇大的世界觀，相信未來會持續進步。 2017年2月因胰臟癌辭世，把人生的最後時光用在撰寫《真確》與本書。 芬妮．哈耶斯坦（Fanny Härgestam） 1983年生，為瑞典作家與新聞記者。她的第一部作品《這是我們的時代》（Det här är vår tid）出版於2014年，書中探討突尼西亞的女性在阿拉伯之春革命之後的生活。芬妮目前定居巴黎，主要為瑞典國營電視台工作。 譯者簡介 郭騰堅 1986年出生於台中市，台灣大學英國文學學士、瑞典斯德哥爾摩大學翻譯學碩士，擁有瑞典商務院（Chamber of Commerce）認證瑞典語至繁簡體中文公證翻譯員資格，現居斯德哥爾摩。譯有：《永不拭淚》三部曲、《我，跟自己拚了！》《剛好就能多活十年》《四百歲的睡鯊與深藍色的節奏》等書。",Biography & Autobiography,113,5,1,zh-TW

The Law of Success,Napoleon Hill,N/A,2018,"This is the book that began Napoleon Hill's self-help odyssey. Hill queried dozens of people about the keys to their prosperity and organized his findings into 16 principles. Each principle marks a chapter of this book, forming a methodology for employing untapped 'mind-power' that leads to success. Hill was well known for researching what made millionaires different from the common man. The sixteen lessons in this book perfectly crystallize everything you will need to know to succeed during these hard economic times. Many of today's best known self-help books take their core concepts form this book. 'The Secret', 'The Power of Positive Thinking', 'The Millionaire Next Door', and 'The Law of Attraction' all take their basic premises from this landmark work. Once you've read this book you will understand what gives certain people an edge over everyone else. By following the advice laid out clearly herein you'll be the one with an edge.

"The ""More or Less"" Definitive Guide to Self-Care",Anna Borges,The Experiment + ORM,2019-11-01,"“Taking care of yourself is not meant to be stressful. [This book] gives practical tips for implementing self-care in our busy lives.” —Allure Some days you need a pick-me-up, some days you need a life preserver. As Anna Borges explains, for most of us, self-care is a wide spectrum of decisions and actions that soothe and fortify us against all the shit we deal with. You may already practice some form of self-care, whether it’s taking an extra-long shower after a stressful day, splurging on a fancy dinner, or choosing Netflix over that friend-of-a-friend’s birthday party. But when life gets so overwhelming that you want to stay in bed, some more radical care is crucial to maintain your sanity. The More or Less Definitive Guide to Self-Care is here to help you exist in the world. Borges gathers over 200 tips, activities, and stories (from experts and everyday people alike) into an A-to-Z list—from asking for help to catching some Zzz’s. Make any day a little more OK with new skills in your self-care toolkit—and energy to show up for yourself. A Foreword INDIES Gold Winner “This self-help guide made me feel seen.” —Real Simple “A compendium [about] how to move through the world with a little more kindness for yourself.” —Bustle “Give [this to] your Type A friend who runs herself ragged.” —Los Angeles Times",Self-Help,313,N/A,0,en

Think and Grow Rich is based on Hill's earlier work The Law of Success, and said to be the result of more than twenty years of study of many individuals who had amassed personal fortunes.

Think and Grow Rich condenses them, providing the reader with 13 principles in the form of a Philosophy of Achievement. The book maintains that desire, faith, and persistence can propel one to great heights if one can suppress negative thoughts and focus on long-term goals. The 13 ""steps"" listed in the book are: Desire, Faith, Autosuggestion, Specialized Knowledge, Imagination, Organized Planning, Decision, Persistence, Power of the Master Mind, The Mystery of Sex Transmutation, The Subconscious Mind, The Brain, The Sixth Sense While the book's title and much of the text concerns increasing income, the author insists that his philosophy can help people succeed in any line of work; to do and be anything they can imagine. First published in 1937 during the Great Depression, the book by Hill's death in 1970 had sold more than 20 million copies. By 2015 more than 100 million copies had been sold worldwide.",Business & Economics,270,N/A,0,en
