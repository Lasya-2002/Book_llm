The First Computers,"Raul Rojas, Ulf Hashagen",MIT Press,2002-07-26,"This history of computing focuses not on chronology (what came first and who deserves credit for it) but on the actual architectures of the first machines that made electronic computing a practical reality. The book covers computers built in the United States, Germany, England, and Japan. It makes clear that similar concepts were often pursued simultaneously and that the early researchers explored many architectures beyond the von Neumann architecture that eventually became canonical. The contributors include not only historians but also engineers and computer pioneers. An introductory chapter describes the elements of computer architecture and explains why ""being first"" is even less interesting for computers than for other areas of technology. The essays contain a remarkable amount of new material, even on well-known machines, and several describe reconstructions of the historic machines. These investigations are of more than simply historical interest, for architectures designed to solve specific problems in the past may suggest new approaches to similar problems in today's machines.

Computers Ltd,David Harel,Oxford University Press,2004,"The computer has been hailed as the greatest innovation of the 20th century, and there is no denying that these technological marvels have dramatically changed our everyday lives. They can fly airplanes and spaceships, route millions of phone calls simultaneously, and play chess with the world's greatest players. But how limitless is the future for the computer? Will computers one day be truly intelligent, make medical diagnoses, run companies, compose music, and fall in love? In Computers Ltd., David Harel, the best-selling author of Algorithmics, illuminates one of the most fundamental yet under-reported facets of computers--their inherent limitations. Looking only at the bad news that is proven, discussing limitations that no amounts of hardware, software, talent, or resources can overcome, the book presents a disturbing and provocative view of computing at the start of the 21st century. Harel takes us on a fascinating tour that touches on everything from tiling problems and monkey puzzles to Monte Carlo algorithms and quantum computing, showing just how far from perfect computers are, while shattering some of the many claims made for these machines. He concludes that though we may strive for bigger and better things in computing, we need to be realistic: computers are not omnipotent--far from it. Their limits are real and here to stay. Based on hard facts, mathematically proven and indisputable, Computers Ltd. offers a vividly written and often amusing look at the shape of the future.",Computers,244,N/A,0,en
Computers as Theatre,Brenda Laurel,Pearson Education,2014,"Brenda Laurel's Computers as Theatre revolutionized the field of human-computer interaction, offering ideas that inspired generations of interface and interaction designers-and continue to inspire them. Laurel's insight was that effective interface design, like effective drama, must engage the user directly in an experience involving both thought and emotion. Her practical conclusion was that a user's enjoyment must be a paramount design consideration, and this demands a deep awareness of dramatic theory and technique, both ancient and modern. Now, two decades later, Laurel has revised and revamped her influential work, reflecting back on enormous change and personal experience and forward toward emerging technologies and ideas that will transform human-computer interaction yet again. Beginning with a clear analysis of classical drama theory, Laurel explores new territory through the lens of dramatic structure and purpose. Computers as Theatre, Second Edition, is directed to a far wider audience, is written more simply and elegantly, is packed with new examples, and is replete with exciting and important new ideas. This book Draws lessons from massively multiplayer online games and systems, social networks, and mobile devices with embedded sensors Integrates values-driven design as a key principle Integrates key ideas about virtual reality Covers new frontiers, including augmented reality, distributed and participatory sensing, interactive public installations and venues, and design for emergence Once more, Brenda Laurel will help you see the connection between humans and computers as you never have before-and help you build interfaces and interactions that are pleasurably, joyously right!",Computers,272,N/A,0,en

It was the first book about programming that spoke to me. It started with a story, and it built up, layer by layer, analogy by analogy, until I understood not just the Code, but the System. Code is a book that is as much about Systems Thinking and abstractions as it is about code and programming. Code teaches us how many unseen layers there are between the computer systems that we as users look at every day and the magical silicon rocks that we infused with lightning and taught to think."" - Scott Hanselman, Partner Program Director, Microsoft, and host of Hanselminutes Computers are everywhere, most obviously in our laptops and smartphones, but also our cars, televisions, microwave ovens, alarm clocks, robot vacuum cleaners, and other smart appliances. Have you ever wondered what goes on inside these devices to make our lives easier but occasionally more infuriating? For more than 20 years, readers have delighted in Charles Petzold's illuminating story of the secret inner life of computers, and now he has revised it for this new age of computing. Cleverly illustrated and easy to understand, this is the book that cracks the mystery. You'll discover what flashlights, black cats, seesaws, and the ride of Paul Revere can teach you about computing, and how human ingenuity and our compulsion to communicate have shaped every electronic device we use. This new expanded edition explores more deeply the bit-by-bit and gate-by-gate construction of the heart of every smart device, the central processing unit that combines the simplest of basic operations to perform the most complex of feats.

Humans Vs Computers,Gojko Adzic,Neuri Consulting Llp,2017-09,"Humans vs Computers is a book about people caught between wrong assumptions and computer bugs. You'll read about humans who are invisible to computers, how a default password once caused a zombie apocalypse and why airlines sometimes give away free tickets. This is also a book on how to prevent, avoid and reduce the impact of such problems. Our lives are increasingly tracked, monitored and categorised by software, driving a flood of information into the vast sea of big data. In this brave new world, humans can't cope with information overload. Governments and companies alike rely on computers to automatically detect fraud, predict behaviour and enforce laws. Inflexible automatons, barely smarter than a fridge, now make life-changing decisions. Clever marketing tricks us into believing that phones, TV sets and even cars are somehow smart. Yet all those computer systems were created by people - people who are well-meaning but fallible and biased, clever but forgetful, and who have grand plans but are pressed for time. Digitising a piece of work doesn't mean there will be no mistakes, but instead guarantees that when mistakes happen, they'll run at a massive scale. The next time you bang your head against a digital wall, the stories in this book will help you understand better what's going on and show you where to look for problems. If nothing else, when it seems as if you're under a black-magic spell, these stories will at least allow you to see the lighter side of the binary chaos. For people involved in software delivery, this book will help you find more empathy for people suffering from our mistakes, and discover heuristics to use during analysis, development or testing to make your software less error prone.

A Natural Introduction to Computer Programming with C++,Kari Laitinen,Trafford Publishing,2003-02,"Computer programming means that you make those machines operate so that they can perform various useful activities for you and others. The skills of computer programming are very important in our present world, and these skills are likely to become even more important in the future. On the pages of this book, the reader is introduced in a natural way to the world of computer programming. The reader does not require any previous knowledge of the subject. The basic operating principles of computers are taught before the actual studies of computer programming begin. All the examples of computer programs are written so that the reader encounters a lot of natural-language expressions instead of the traditional abbreviations of the computer world. This approach aims to make learning easier. The pages of the book are designed to maximize readability and understandability. Examples of computer programs are presented in easy-to-read graphical descriptions. Because the pages of the book are large, example programs can be presented in more reader-friendly way than in traditional programming books. In addition, pages are written so that the reader does not need to turn them unnecessarily. This book uses a programming language called C++ (pronounced ""see plus plus"") to teach computer programming. C++ is suitable for beginners in the field of computer programming because with C++ it is possible to make simple programs, and build a solid understanding of the basics of computing and programming. Plenty of programming exercises are included in the book. The reader can work with the exercises by using free programming tools on a personal computer. The book explains how to download the free programming tools from the Internet. This book is a new kind of book to learn computer programming. Making things clear and eliminating risks for misunderstanding have been primary concerns in the design of the book. Because in some ways the book is less mathematical than other programming books, some experienced computer programmers may hesitate to use it. However, for a beginner in the field of computer programming, this book offers a possibility to make learning easier. Also more experienced people can benefit from the book if they are prepared to discard the traditional abbreviations in computer programs, and follow the programming style that is advocated in the book.",C++ (Computer program language),638,N/A,0,en

Artificial Unintelligence,Meredith Broussard,MIT Press,2019-01-29,"A guide to understanding the inner workings and outer limits of technology and why we should never assume that computers always get it right. In Artificial Unintelligence, Meredith Broussard argues that our collective enthusiasm for applying computer technology to every aspect of life has resulted in a tremendous amount of poorly designed systems. We are so eager to do everything digitally—hiring, driving, paying bills, even choosing romantic partners—that we have stopped demanding that our technology actually work. Broussard, a software developer and journalist, reminds us that there are fundamental limits to what we can (and should) do with technology. With this book, she offers a guide to understanding the inner workings and outer limits of technology—and issues a warning that we should never assume that computers always get things right. Making a case against technochauvinism—the belief that technology is always the solution—Broussard argues that it's just not true that social problems would inevitably retreat before a digitally enabled Utopia. To prove her point, she undertakes a series of adventures in computer programming. She goes for an alarming ride in a driverless car, concluding “the cyborg future is not coming any time soon”; uses artificial intelligence to investigate why students can't pass standardized tests; deploys machine learning to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster; and attempts to repair the U.S. campaign finance system by building AI software. If we understand the limits of what we can do with technology, Broussard tells us, we can make better choices about what we should do with it to make the world better for everyone.",Computers,247,N/A,0,en

Seeing the Past with Computers,"Kevin Kee, Timothy J Compeau",University of Michigan Press,2019-01-24,"Recent developments in computer technology are providing historians with new ways to see—and seek to hear, touch, or smell—traces of the past. Place-based augmented reality applications are an increasingly common feature at heritage sites and museums, allowing historians to create immersive, multifaceted learning experiences. Now that computer vision can be directed at the past, research involving thousands of images can recreate lost or destroyed objects or environments, and discern patterns in vast datasets that could not be perceived by the naked eye. Seeing the Past with Computers is a collection of twelve thought-pieces on the current and potential uses of augmented reality and computer vision in historical research, teaching, and presentation. The experts gathered here reflect upon their experiences working with new technologies, share their ideas for best practices, and assess the implications of—and imagine future possibilities for—new methods of historical study. Among the experimental topics they explore are the use of augmented reality that empowers students to challenge the presentation of historical material in their textbooks; the application of seeing computers to unlock unusual cultural knowledge, such as the secrets of vaudevillian stage magic; hacking facial recognition technology to reveal victims of racism in a century-old Australian archive; and rebuilding the soundscape of an Iron Age village with aural augmented reality.

The Biology of Computer Life,SIMONS,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The doctrine of computer life is not congenial to many people. Often they have not thought in any depth about the idea, and it necessarily disturbs their psychological and intellectual frame of reference: it forces a reappraisal of what it is to be alive, what it is to be human, and whether there are profound, yet un expected, implications in the development of modern com puters. There is abundant evidence to suggest that we are wit nessing the emergence of a vast new family of life-forms on earth, organisms that are not based on the familiar metabolic chemistries yet whose manifest 'life credentials' are accumulating year by year. It is a mistake to regard biology as a closed science, with arbitrarily limited categories; and we should agree with Jacob (1974) who observed that 'Contrary to what is imagined, biology is not a unified science'. Biology is essentially concerned with living things, and we should be reluctant to assume that at anyone time our concept and understanding of life are complete and incapable of further refinement. And it seems clear that much of the continuing refinement of biological categories will be stimulated by advances in systems theory, and in particular by those advances that relate to the rapidly expanding world of computing and robotics. We should also remember what Pant in (1968) said in a different context: 'the biological sciences are unrestricted . . . and their investigator must be prepared to follow their problems into any other science whatsoever.",Science,258,N/A,0,en

Dependable Computing for Critical Applications,"Algirdas Avizienis, Jean-Claude Laprie",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The International Working Conference on Dependable Computing for Critical Applications was the first conference organized by IFIP Working Group 10. 4 ""Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance"", in cooperation with the Technical Committee on Fault-Tolerant Computing of the IEEE Computer Society, and the Technical Committee 7 on Systems Reliability, Safety and Security of EWlCS. The rationale for the Working Conference is best expressed by the aims of WG 10. 4: "" Increasingly, individuals and organizations are developing or procuring sophisticated computing systems on whose services they need to place great reliance. In differing circumstances, the focus will be on differing properties of such services - e. g. continuity, performance, real-time response, ability to avoid catastrophic failures, prevention of deliberate privacy intrusions. The notion of dependability, defined as that property of a computing system which allows reliance to be justifiably placed on the service it delivers, enables these various concerns to be subsumed within a single conceptual framework. Dependability thus includes as special cases such attributes as reliability, availability, safety, security. The Working Group is aimed at identifying and integrating approaches, methods and techniques for specifying, designing, building, assessing, validating, operating and maintaining computer systems which should exhibit some or all of these attributes. "" The concept of WG 10. 4 was formulated during the IFIP Working Conference on Reliable Computing and Fault Tolerance on September 27-29, 1979 in London, England, held in conjunction with the Europ-IFIP 79 Conference.

Making Computers Accessible,Elizabeth R. Petrick,JHU Press,2015-06-01,"The revolution in accessible computer technology was fueled by disability activism, the interactive nature of personal computers, and changing public policy. In 1974, not long after developing the first universal optical character recognition technology, Raymond Kurzweil struck up a conversation with a blind man on a flight. Kurzweil explained that he was searching for a use for his new software. The blind man expressed interest: One of the frustrating obstacles that blind people grappled with, he said, was that no computer program could translate text into speech. Inspired by this chance meeting, Kurzweil decided that he must put his new innovation to work to “overcome this principal handicap of blindness.” By 1976, he had built a working prototype, which he dubbed the Kurzweil Reading Machine. This type of innovation demonstrated the possibilities of computers to dramatically improve the lives of people living with disabilities. In Making Computers Accessible, Elizabeth R. Petrick tells the compelling story of how computer engineers and corporations gradually became aware of the need to make computers accessible for all people. Motivated by user feedback and prompted by legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, which offered the promise of equal rights via technological accommodation, companies developed sophisticated computerized devices and software to bridge the accessibility gap. People with disabilities, Petrick argues, are paradigmatic computer users, demonstrating the personal computer’s potential to augment human abilities and provide for new forms of social, professional, and political participation. Bridging the history of technology, science and technology studies, and disability studies, this book traces the psychological, cultural, and economic evolution of a consumer culture aimed at individuals with disabilities, who increasingly rely on personal computers to make their lives richer and more interconnected.",Technology & Engineering,207,N/A,0,en

Quantum Computing in Cybersecurity,"Romil Rawat, Rajesh Kumar Chakrawarti, Sanjaya Kumar Sarangi, Jaideep Patel, Vivek Bhardwaj, Anjali Rawat, Hitesh Rawat",John Wiley & Sons,2023-10-19,"Machine learning, deep learning, probabilistic neural networks, blockchain, and other new technologies all demand extremely high processing speeds. A quantum computer is an example of such a system. Quantum computers may be accessed over the internet. This technology poses a significant risk, since quantum terrorists, or cyber criminals, coul be able to cause many problems, including bringing down the internet. The principles of quantum mechanics might be used by evil doers to destroy quantum information on a global scale, and an entire class of suspicious codes could destroy data or eavesdrop on communication. Quantum physics, however, safeguards against data eavesdropping. A significant amount of money is being invested in developing and testing a quantum version of the internet that will eliminate eavesdropping and make communication nearly impenetrable to cyber-attacks. The simultaneous activation of quantum terrorists (organized crime) can lead to significant danger by attackers introducing quantum information into the network, breaking the global quantum state, and preventing the system from returning to its starting state. Without signs of identifying information and real-time communication data, such vulnerabilities are very hard to discover. Terrorists' synchronized and coordinated acts have an impact on security by sparking a cyber assault in a fraction of a second. The encryption is used by cyber-criminal groups with the genuine, nefarious, and terrible motives of killing innocent people or stealing money. In the hands of criminals and codes, cryptography is a dangerous and formidable weapon. Small amounts of digital information are hidden in a code string that translates into an image on the screen, making it impossible for the human eye to identify a coded picture from its uncoded equivalents. To steal the cryptographic key necessary to read people's credit card data or banking information, cyber thieves employ installed encryption techniques, human mistakes, keyboard loggers, and computer malware. This new volume delves into the latest cutting-edge trends and the most up-to-date processes and applications for quantum computing to bolster cybersecurity. Whether for the veteran computer engineer working in the field, other computer scientists and professionals, or for the student, this is a one-stop-shop for quantum computing in cyber security and a must have for any library.",Computers,440,N/A,0,en

A City Is Not a Computer,Shannon Mattern,Princeton University Press,2021-08-10,"A bold reassessment of ""smart cities"" that reveals what is lost when we conceive of our urban spaces as computers Computational models of urbanism—smart cities that use data-driven planning and algorithmic administration—promise to deliver new urban efficiencies and conveniences. Yet these models limit our understanding of what we can know about a city. A City Is Not a Computer reveals how cities encompass myriad forms of local and indigenous intelligences and knowledge institutions, arguing that these resources are a vital supplement and corrective to increasingly prevalent algorithmic models. Shannon Mattern begins by examining the ethical and ontological implications of urban technologies and computational models, discussing how they shape and in many cases profoundly limit our engagement with cities. She looks at the methods and underlying assumptions of data-driven urbanism, and demonstrates how the ""city-as-computer"" metaphor, which undergirds much of today's urban policy and design, reduces place-based knowledge to information processing. Mattern then imagines how we might sustain institutions and infrastructures that constitute more diverse, open, inclusive urban forms. She shows how the public library functions as a steward of urban intelligence, and describes the scales of upkeep needed to sustain a city's many moving parts, from spinning hard drives to bridge repairs. Incorporating insights from urban studies, data science, and media and information studies, A City Is Not a Computer offers a visionary new approach to urban planning and design.",Architecture,200,N/A,0,en

Linguistic Meaning Meets Linguistic Form,Patrick Duffley,Oxford University Press,2020-10-14,"This book steers a middle course between two opposing conceptions that currently dominate the field of semantics, the logical and cognitive approaches. Patrick Duffley brings to light the inadequacies of both of these frameworks, arguing that linguistic semantics must be based on the linguistic sign itself and on the meaning that it conveys across the full range of its uses. The book offers 12 case studies that demonstrate the explanatory power of a sign-based semantics, dealing with topics such as complementation with aspectual and causative verbs, control and raising, wh- words, full-verb inversion, and existential-there constructions. It calls for a radical revision of the semantics/pragmatics interface, proposing that the dividing line be drawn between content that is linguistically encoded and content that is not encoded but still communicated. While traditional linguistic analysis often places meaning at the level of the sentence or construction, this volume argues that meaning belongs at the lower level of linguistic items, where the linguistic sign is stored in a stable, permanent, and direct relation with its meaning outside of any particular context. Building linguistic analysis from the ground up in this way provides it with a more solid foundation and increases its explanatory power.",Language Arts & Disciplines,230,N/A,0,en

Computers and Creativity,"Jon McCormack, Mark d’Inverno",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-08-21,"This interdisciplinary volume introduces new theories and ideas on creativity from the perspectives of science and art. Featuring contributions from leading researchers, theorists and artists working in artificial intelligence, generative art, creative computing, music composition, and cybernetics, the book examines the relationship between computation and creativity from both analytic and practical perspectives. Each contributor describes innovative new ways creativity can be understood through, and inspired by, computers. The book tackles critical philosophical questions and discusses the major issues raised by computational creativity, including: whether a computer can exhibit creativity independently of its creator; what kinds of creativity are possible in light of our knowledge from computational simulation, artificial intelligence, evolutionary theory and information theory; and whether we can begin to automate the evaluation of aesthetics and creativity in silico. These important, often controversial questions are contextualised by current thinking in computational creative arts practice. Leading artistic practitioners discuss their approaches to working creatively with computational systems in a diverse array of media, including music, sound art, visual art, and interactivity. The volume also includes a comprehensive review of computational aesthetic evaluation and judgement research, alongside discussion and insights from pioneering artists working with computation as a creative medium over the last fifty years. A distinguishing feature of this volume is that it explains and grounds new theoretical ideas on creativity through practical applications and creative practice. Computers and Creativity will appeal to theorists, researchers in artificial intelligence, generative and evolutionary computing, practicing artists and musicians, students and any reader generally interested in understanding how computers can impact upon creativity. It bridges concepts from computer science, psychology, neuroscience, visual art, music and philosophy in an accessible way, illustrating how computers are fundamentally changing what we can imagine and create, and how we might shape the creativity of the future.

A Biography of the Pixel,Alvy Ray Smith,MIT Press,2021-08-03,"The pixel as the organizing principle of all pictures, from cave paintings to Toy Story. The Great Digital Convergence of all media types into one universal digital medium occurred, with little fanfare, at the recent turn of the millennium. The bit became the universal medium, and the pixel--a particular packaging of bits--conquered the world. Henceforward, nearly every picture in the world would be composed of pixels--cell phone pictures, app interfaces, Mars Rover transmissions, book illustrations, videogames. In A Biography of the Pixel, Pixar cofounder Alvy Ray Smith argues that the pixel is the organizing principle of most modern media, and he presents a few simple but profound ideas that unify the dazzling varieties of digital image making. Smith's story of the pixel's development begins with Fourier waves, proceeds through Turing machines, and ends with the first digital movies from Pixar, DreamWorks, and Blue Sky. Today, almost all the pictures we encounter are digital--mediated by the pixel and irretrievably separated from their media; museums and kindergartens are two of the last outposts of the analog. Smith explains, engagingly and accessibly, how pictures composed of invisible stuff become visible--that is, how digital pixels convert to analog display elements. Taking the special case of digital movies to represent all of Digital Light (his term for pictures constructed of pixels), and drawing on his decades of work in the field, Smith approaches his subject from multiple angles--art, technology, entertainment, business, and history. A Biography of the Pixel is essential reading for anyone who has watched a video on a cell phone, played a videogame, or seen a movie. 400 pages of annotations, prepared by the author and available online, provide an invaluable resource for readers.",Computers,560,N/A,0,en

The Computer Boys Take Over,Nathan L. Ensmenger,MIT Press,2012-08-24,"The contentious history of the computer programmers who developed the software that made the computer revolution possible. This is a book about the computer revolution of the mid-twentieth century and the people who made it possible. Unlike most histories of computing, it is not a book about machines, inventors, or entrepreneurs. Instead, it tells the story of the vast but largely anonymous legions of computer specialists—programmers, systems analysts, and other software developers—who transformed the electronic computer from a scientific curiosity into the defining technology of the modern era. As the systems that they built became increasingly powerful and ubiquitous, these specialists became the focus of a series of critiques of the social and organizational impact of electronic computing. To many of their contemporaries, it seemed the “computer boys” were taking over, not just in the corporate setting, but also in government, politics, and society in general. In The Computer Boys Take Over, Nathan Ensmenger traces the rise to power of the computer expert in modern American society. His rich and nuanced portrayal of the men and women (a surprising number of the “computer boys” were, in fact, female) who built their careers around the novel technology of electronic computing explores issues of power, identity, and expertise that have only become more significant in our increasingly computerized society. In his recasting of the drama of the computer revolution through the eyes of its principle revolutionaries, Ensmenger reminds us that the computerization of modern society was not an inevitable process driven by impersonal technological or economic imperatives, but was rather a creative, contentious, and above all, fundamentally human development.",Computers,331,N/A,0,en
My Mother Was a Computer,N. Katherine Hayles,University of Chicago Press,2010-03-15,"We live in a world, according to N. Katherine Hayles, where new languages are constantly emerging, proliferating, and fading into obsolescence. These are languages of our own making: the programming languages written in code for the intelligent machines we call computers. Hayles's latest exploration provides an exciting new way of understanding the relations between code and language and considers how their interactions have affected creative, technological, and artistic practices. My Mother Was a Computer explores how the impact of code on everyday life has become comparable to that of speech and writing: language and code have grown more entangled, the lines that once separated humans from machines, analog from digital, and old technologies from new ones have become blurred. My Mother Was a Computer gives us the tools necessary to make sense of these complex relationships. Hayles argues that we live in an age of intermediation that challenges our ideas about language, subjectivity, literary objects, and textuality. This process of intermediation takes place where digital media interact with cultural practices associated with older media, and here Hayles sharply portrays such interactions: how code differs from speech; how electronic text differs from print; the effects of digital media on the idea of the self; the effects of digitality on printed books; our conceptions of computers as living beings; the possibility that human consciousness itself might be computational; and the subjective cosmology wherein humans see the universe through the lens of their own digital age. We are the children of computers in more than one sense, and no critic has done more than N. Katherine Hayles to explain how these technologies define us and our culture. Heady and provocative, My Mother Was a Computer will be judged as her best work yet.",Literary Criticism,302,N/A,0,en

The Closed World,Paul N. Edwards,MIT Press,1996,"The Closed World offers a radically new alternative to the canonical histories of computers and cognitive science. Arguing that we can make sense of computers as tools only when we simultaneously grasp their roles as metaphors and political icons, Paul Edwards shows how Cold War social and cultural contexts shaped emerging computer technology--and were transformed, in turn, by information machines. The Closed World explores three apparently disparate histories--the history of American global power, the history of computing machines, and the history of subjectivity in science and culture--through the lens of the American political imagination. In the process, it reveals intimate links between the military projects of the Cold War, the evolution of digital computers, and the origins of cybernetics, cognitive psychology, and artificial intelligence. Edwards begins by describing the emergence of a ""closed-world discourse"" of global surveillance and control through high-technology military power. The Cold War political goal of ""containment"" led to the SAGE continental air defense system, Rand Corporation studies of nuclear strategy, and the advanced technologies of the Vietnam War. These and other centralized, computerized military command and control projects--for containing world-scale conflicts--helped closed-world discourse dominate Cold War political decisions. Their apotheosis was the Reagan-era plan for a "" Star Wars"" space-based ballistic missile defense. Edwards then shows how these military projects helped computers become axial metaphors in psychological theory. Analyzing the Macy Conferences on cybernetics, the Harvard Psycho-Acoustic Laboratory, and the early history of artificial intelligence, he describes the formation of a ""cyborg discourse."" By constructing both human minds and artificial intelligences as information machines, cyborg discourse assisted in integrating people into the hyper-complex technological systems of the closed world. Finally, Edwards explores the cyborg as political identity in science fiction--from the disembodied, panoptic AI of 2001: A Space Odyssey, to the mechanical robots of Star Wars and the engineered biological androids of Blade Runner--where Information Age culture and subjectivity were both reflected and constructed.

Computers As Cognitive Tools,"Susanne P. Lajoie, Sharon J. Derry",Routledge,2013-05-13,"Highlighting and illustrating several important and interesting theoretical trends that have emerged in the continuing development of instructional technology, this book's organizational framework is based on the notion of two opposing camps. One evolves out of the intelligent tutoring movement, which employs artificial-intelligence technologies in the service of student modeling and precision diagnosis, and the other emerges from a constructivist/developmental perspective that promotes exploration and social interaction, but tends to reject the methods and goals of the student modelers. While the notion of opposing camps tends to create an artificial rift between groups of researchers, it represents a conceptual distinction that is inherently more interesting and informative than the relatively meaningless divide often drawn between ""intelligent"" and ""unintelligent"" instructional systems. An evident trend is that researchers in both ""camps"" view their computer learning environments as ""cognitive tools"" that can enhance learning, performance, and understanding. Cognitive tools are objects provided by the instructional environment that allow students to incorporate new auxiliary methods or symbols into their social problem solving which otherwise would be unavailable. A final section of the book represents researchers who are assimilating and accommodating the wisdom and creativity of their neighbors from both camps, perhaps forming the look of technology for the future. When the idea of model tracing in a computer-based environment is combined with appreciation for creative mind-extension cognitive tools and for how a community of learners can facilitate learning, a camp is created where AI technologists and social constructivist learning theorists can feel equally at home.",Education,413,N/A,0,en

At Home with Computers,Elaine Lally,Routledge,2020-05-18,"New technologies are profoundly reshaping the world around us. Home computers - unheard of two decades ago - now play an intimate role as personal possessions in many people's lives. For some, computer games may be vital to winding-down after a busy day, while for others the home computer represents only work or is a means through which to socialize in cyberspace. Powerfully symbolic of both future and present trends, computers are increasingly seen as essential home purchases. This book is the first sustained examination of the revealing role computers play in our domestic lives. Do computers cause or help to resolve arguments? What role does gender play in negotiating their use? Who spends the most time with the computer? How does the importance of home computers change as we move from childhood through careers to retirement? Drawing upon topical theories from material culture, technology and consumption studies, Lally traces the social life of these machines and provides unique insights into the many different ways in which they are transformed into highly personal possessions. The result is an absorbing account of everyday life in the information age. This book will be of interest to anthropologists, geographers, sociologists and anyone who wants to get to know how their home computer affects their family life.",Social Science,257,N/A,0,en

Atmospheres and Oceans on Computers,Lars Petter Røed,Springer,2018-09-04,"This textbook introduces step by step the basic numerical methods to solve the equations governing the motion of the atmosphere and ocean, and describes how to develop a set of corresponding instructions for the computer as part of a code. Today's computers are powerful enough to allow 7-day forecasts within hours, and modern teaching of the subject requires a combination of theoretical and computational approaches. The presentation is aimed at beginning graduate students intending to become forecasters or researchers, that is, users of existing models or model developers. However, model developers must be well versed in the underlying physics as well as in numerical methods. Thus, while some of the topics discussed in the modeling of the atmosphere and ocean are more advanced, the book ensures that the gap between those scientists who analyze results from model simulations and observations and those who work with the inner works of the model does not widen further. In this spirit, the course presents methods whereby important balance equations in oceanography and meteorology, namely the advection-diffusion equation and the shallow water equations on a rotating Earth, can be solved by numerical means with little prior knowledge. The numerical focus is on the finite-difference (FD) methods, and although more powerful methods exist, the simplicity of FD makes it ideal as a pedagogical introduction to the subject. The book also includes suitable exercises and computer problems.",Science,293,N/A,0,en

When Computers Were Human,David Alan Grier,Princeton University Press,2013-11-01,"Before Palm Pilots and iPods, PCs and laptops, the term ""computer"" referred to the people who did scientific calculations by hand. These workers were neither calculating geniuses nor idiot savants but knowledgeable people who, in other circumstances, might have become scientists in their own right. When Computers Were Human represents the first in-depth account of this little-known, 200-year epoch in the history of science and technology. Beginning with the story of his own grandmother, who was trained as a human computer, David Alan Grier provides a poignant introduction to the wider world of women and men who did the hard computational labor of science. His grandmother's casual remark, ""I wish I'd used my calculus,"" hinted at a career deferred and an education forgotten, a secret life unappreciated; like many highly educated women of her generation, she studied to become a human computer because nothing else would offer her a place in the scientific world. The book begins with the return of Halley's comet in 1758 and the effort of three French astronomers to compute its orbit. It ends four cycles later, with a UNIVAC electronic computer projecting the 1986 orbit. In between, Grier tells us about the surveyors of the French Revolution, describes the calculating machines of Charles Babbage, and guides the reader through the Great Depression to marvel at the giant computing room of the Works Progress Administration. When Computers Were Human is the sad but lyrical story of workers who gladly did the hard labor of research calculation in the hope that they might be part of the scientific community. In the end, they were rewarded by a new electronic machine that took the place and the name of those who were, once, the computers.",Science,423,N/A,0,en

A People’s History of Computing in the United States,Joy Lisi Rankin,Harvard University Press,2018-10-08,"Silicon Valley gets all the credit for digital creativity, but this account of the pre-PC world, when computing meant more than using mature consumer technology, challenges that triumphalism. The invention of the personal computer liberated users from corporate mainframes and brought computing into homes. But throughout the 1960s and 1970s a diverse group of teachers and students working together on academic computing systems conducted many of the activities we now recognize as personal and social computing. Their networks were centered in New Hampshire, Minnesota, and Illinois, but they connected far-flung users. Joy Rankin draws on detailed records to explore how users exchanged messages, programmed music and poems, fostered communities, and developed computer games like The Oregon Trail. These unsung pioneers helped shape our digital world, just as much as the inventors, garage hobbyists, and eccentric billionaires of Palo Alto. By imagining computing as an interactive commons, the early denizens of the digital realm seeded today’s debate about whether the internet should be a public utility and laid the groundwork for the concept of net neutrality. Rankin offers a radical precedent for a more democratic digital culture, and new models for the next generation of activists, educators, coders, and makers.",Computers,337,N/A,0,en

Interwoven into the narrative are the highlights of Turing’s own life: his years at Cambridge and Princeton, his secret work in cryptanalysis during World War II, his involvement in seminal computer projects, his speculations about artificial intelligence, his arrest and prosecution for the crime of ""gross indecency,"" and his early death by apparent suicide at the age of 41.",Computers,391,N/A,0,en
Computing and Philosophy in Asia,Soraj Hongladarom,Cambridge Scholars Publishing,2009-03-26,"This volume is a collection of selected papers presented at the Second Asia-Pacific Computing and Philsosophy Conference, which was held in Bangkok, Thailand in January 2005. The conference was organized by the Center for Ethics of Science and Technology, Chulalongkorn University on behalf of the International Association of Computing and Philosophy (www.ia-cap.org). Computing have had a long relationship with philosophy, starting from the problem of how symbols being manipulated in computing bear a relation to the outside world, to those of artificial intelligence, robotics, computer simulation, and so on. Moreover, as computer technologies have become thoroughly pervasive in today's environment, there are also issues concerning social and ethical impacts brought about by them. The papers in the volume represent a wide variety of concerns and various dimensions within which computing and philosophy are related. Furthermore, it also represents some of the first attempts to highlight cultural dimensions of computing and philosophy, which became prominent when the conference was held for the first time within the milieu of an Asian culture. (The First Asia-Pacific Computing and Philosophy was held in Canberra, Australia.) Hence, many of the papers in the volume address this added dimension. Apart form the usual problems of how computers and human lives are interconnected, the papers here also discuss how computers are related to human lives as lived in a specific culture. Thus the book breaks a new ground and should be of interest to a wide range of scholars and students who are interested, not only on computing and philosophy generally construed, but also on this exciting new dimension of how the cultures of Asia, the West, and others bear upon the traditional issues in computing and philosophy, and on how this dimension raises some new concerns and agenda. Among the topics discussed in this volume are: political online forums in Saudi Arabia, e-democracy and structural transformation of public sphere, the Buddhist informational person, a glance into the lives of computerized generation in Thailand, technology and journalism in the market, local approaches and global potential (?) of information ethics, computer-enhanced good life, computer teaching ethics, and many others.",Philosophy,295,5,1,en

Computing for Ordinary Mortals,Robert St. Amant,Oxford University Press,2012-10-29,"Computing isn't only (or even mostly) about hardware and software; it's also about the ideas behind the technology. In Computing for Ordinary Mortals, computer scientist Robert St. Amant explains this ""really interesting part"" of computing, introducing basic computing concepts and strategies in a way that readers without a technical background can understand and appreciate. Each of the chapters illustrates ideas from a different area of computing, and together they provide important insights into what drives the field as a whole. St. Amant starts off with an overview of basic concepts as well as a brief history of the earliest computers, and then he traces two different threads through the fabric of computing. One thread is practical, illuminating the architecture of a computer and showing how this architecture makes computation efficient. St. Amant shows us how to write down instructions so that a computer can accomplish specific tasks (programming), how the computer manages those tasks as it runs (in its operating system), and how computers can communicate with each other (over a network). The other thread is theoretical, describing how computers are, in the abstract, machines for solving problems. Some of these ideas are embedded in much of what we do as humans, and thus this discussion can also give us insight into our own daily activities, how we interact with other people, and in some cases even what's going on in our heads. St. Amant concludes with artificial intelligence, exploring the possibility that computers might eventually be capable of human-level intelligence, and human-computer interaction, showing how computers can enrich our lives--and how they fall short.",Computers,257,N/A,0,en

Computer Confidence,Bruce D. Sanders,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Much of the material in this book comes from what I've learned as I've traveled around the country conducting seminars about working profitably in the automated office. During the first few months of those seminars, there was a question I was asked more often than any other single question. I wa~ asked the question so often that I gave it a nickname. I called it my ""What The Devil"" question. Often in different words, usually at the morning break in the seminar, and almost always with an effort not to offend or embarrass, I was asked, ""What the devil is a psychologist doing conducting seminars about computer systems?"" I'm not asked ""What the Devil"" questions much anymore. Those familiar with office automation have come to realize that human factors chiefly determine whether a computer system will be a success or an expensive failure. So many computer systems have not gained acceptance by is employees because the planners didn't use good psychological sense. That especially true as the computers move from the Engineering Department into the executive suites and the role of computers changes from just producing paper into also assisting in managerial decision making. One human factor I've learned is that people would much rather skip around in a book than read it from front cover to back cover directly. It's true whether the book is a user manual for office equipment or a volume on computer systems for decision makers.",Computers,98,N/A,0,en

Programmed Inequality,Mar Hicks,MIT Press,2018-02-23,"This “sobering tale of the real consequences of gender bias” explores how Britain lost its early dominance in computing by systematically discriminating against its most qualified workers: women (Harvard Magazine) In 1944, Britain led the world in electronic computing. By 1974, the British computer industry was all but extinct. What happened in the intervening thirty years holds lessons for all postindustrial superpowers. As Britain struggled to use technology to retain its global power, the nation’s inability to manage its technical labor force hobbled its transition into the information age. In Programmed Inequality, Mar Hicks explores the story of labor feminization and gendered technocracy that undercut British efforts to computerize. That failure sprang from the government’s systematic neglect of its largest trained technical workforce simply because they were women. Women were a hidden engine of growth in high technology from World War II to the 1960s. As computing experienced a gender flip, becoming male-identified in the 1960s and 1970s, labor problems grew into structural ones and gender discrimination caused the nation’s largest computer user—the civil service and sprawling public sector—to make decisions that were disastrous for the British computer industry and the nation as a whole. Drawing on recently opened government files, personal interviews, and the archives of major British computer companies, Programmed Inequality takes aim at the fiction of technological meritocracy. Hicks explains why, even today, possessing technical skill is not enough to ensure that women will rise to the top in science and technology fields. Programmed Inequality shows how the disappearance of women from the field had grave macroeconomic consequences for Britain, and why the United States risks repeating those errors in the twenty-first century.",Computers,354,N/A,0,en

Reaction-Diffusion Computers,"Andrew Adamatzky, Benjamin De Lacy Costello, Tetsuya Asai",Elsevier,2005-10-05,"The book introduces a hot topic of novel and emerging computing paradigms and architectures -computation by travelling waves in reaction-diffusion media. A reaction-diffusion computer is a massively parallel computing device, where the micro-volumes of the chemical medium act as elementary few-bit processors, and chemical species diffuse and react in parallel. In the reaction-diffusion computer both the data and the results of the computation are encoded as concentration profiles of the reagents, or local disturbances of concentrations, whilst the computation per se is performed via the spreading and interaction of waves caused by the local disturbances. The monograph brings together results of a decade-long study into designing experimental and simulated prototypes of reaction-diffusion computing devices for image processing, path planning, robot navigation, computational geometry, logics and artificial intelligence. The book is unique because it gives a comprehensive presentation of the theoretical and experimental foundations, and cutting-edge computation techniques, chemical laboratory experimental setups and hardware implementation technology employed in the development of novel nature-inspired computing devices. Key Features: - Non-classical and fresh approach to theory of computation. - In depth exploration of novel and emerging paradigms of nature-inspired computing. - Simple to understand cellular-automata models will help readers/students to design their own computational experiments to advance ideas and concepts described in the book . - Detailed description of receipts and experimental setups of chemical laboratory reaction-diffusion processors will make the book an invaluable resource in practical studies of non-classical and nature-inspired computing architectures . - Step by step explanations of VLSI reaction-diffusion circuits will help students to design their own types of wave-based processors.Key Features: - Non-classical and fresh approach to theory of computation. - In depth exploration of novel and emerging paradigms of nature-inspired computing. - Simple to understand cellular-automata models will help readers/students to design their own computational experiments to advance ideas and concepts described in the book . - Detailed description of receipts and experimental setups of chemical laboratory reaction-diffusion processors will make the book an invaluable resource in practical studies of non-classical and nature-inspired computing architectures . - Step by step explanations of VLSI reaction-diffusion circuits will help students to design their own types of wave-based processors.",Mathematics,349,5,1,en

"Computers, Rigidity, and Moduli",Shmuel Weinberger,Princeton University Press,2005,"This book is the first to present a new area of mathematical research that combines topology, geometry, and logic. Shmuel Weinberger seeks to explain and illustrate the implications of the general principle, first emphasized by Alex Nabutovsky, that logical complexity engenders geometric complexity. He provides applications to the problem of closed geodesics, the theory of submanifolds, and the structure of the moduli space of isometry classes of Riemannian metrics with curvature bounds on a given manifold. Ultimately, geometric complexity of a moduli space forces functions defined on that space to have many critical points, and new results about the existence of extrema or equilibria follow. The main sort of algorithmic problem that arises is recognition: is the presented object equivalent to some standard one? If it is difficult to determine whether the problem is solvable, then the original object has doppelgängers--that is, other objects that are extremely difficult to distinguish from it. Many new questions emerge about the algorithmic nature of known geometric theorems, about ""dichotomy problems,"" and about the metric entropy of moduli space. Weinberger studies them using tools from group theory, computability, differential geometry, and topology, all of which he explains before use. Since several examples are worked out, the overarching principles are set in a clear relief that goes beyond the details of any one problem.",Computers,204,N/A,0,en

"A History of Modern Computing, second edition",Paul E. Ceruzzi,MIT Press,2003-04-08,"From the first digital computer to the dot-com crash—a story of individuals, institutions, and the forces that led to a series of dramatic transformations. This engaging history covers modern computing from the development of the first electronic digital computer through the dot-com crash. The author concentrates on five key moments of transition: the transformation of the computer in the late 1940s from a specialized scientific instrument to a commercial product; the emergence of small systems in the late 1960s; the beginning of personal computing in the 1970s; the spread of networking after 1985; and, in a chapter written for this edition, the period 1995-2001. The new material focuses on the Microsoft antitrust suit, the rise and fall of the dot-coms, and the advent of open source software, particularly Linux. Within the chronological narrative, the book traces several overlapping threads: the evolution of the computer's internal design; the effect of economic trends and the Cold War; the long-term role of IBM as a player and as a target for upstart entrepreneurs; the growth of software from a hidden element to a major character in the story of computing; and the recurring issue of the place of information and computing in a democratic society. The focus is on the United States (though Europe and Japan enter the story at crucial points), on computing per se rather than on applications such as artificial intelligence, and on systems that were sold commercially and installed in quantities.",Technology & Engineering,468,3,2,en

"B C, Before Computers",Stephen Robertson,N/A,2021,"The idea that the digital age has revolutionized our day-to-day experience of the world is nothing new, and has been amply recognized by cultural historians. In contrast, Stephen Robertson's BC: Before Computers is a work which questions the idea that the mid-twentieth century saw a single moment of rupture. It is about all the things that we had to learn, invent, and understand - all the ways we had to evolve our thinking - before we could enter the information technology revolution of the second half of the twentieth century. Its focus ranges from the beginnings of data processing, right back to such originary forms of human technology as the development of writing systems, gathering a whole history of revolutionary moments in the development of information technologies into a single, although not linear narrative. Treading the line between philosophy and technical history, Robertson draws on his extensive technical knowledge to produce a text which is both thought-provoking and accessible to a wide range of readers. The book is wide in scope, exploring the development of technologies in such diverse areas as cryptography, visual art and music, and the postal system. Through all this, it does not simply aim to tell the story of computer developments but to show that those developments rely on a long history of humans creating technologies for increasingly sophisticated methods of manipulating information. Through a clear structure and engaging style, it brings together a wealth of informative and conceptual explorations into the history of human technologies, and avoids assumptions about any prior knowledge on the part of the reader. As such the expert and the general reader alike will find it of interest.",,0,N/A,0,en

Computers and Computations in the Neurosciences,P. Michael Conn,Academic Press,2013-10-22,"Methods in Neurosciences, Volume 10: Computers and Computations in the Neurosciences discusses the use of computers in the neurosciences. The book deals with data collection, analysis, and modeling, with emphasis on the use of computers. Section I involves data collection using a personal microcomputer system. One paper presents a tutorial on using a PC-based motor control composed of an electronic circuit to adjust the motion of a light microscope stage through a software program. Other papers discuss computer methods in nuclei cartography and a computer-assisted quantitative receptor autoradiography in studying receptor density distribution. Section II deals with data analysis and some computer programs for kinetic modeling of gene expression in neurons. The book also discusses a computerized analysis of opioid receptor heterogeneity by ligand binding in test animals using computerized programs instead of employing manual or graphical methods. Computerized curve-fitting allows the researcher to utilize a more precise mathematical model to describe the binding of one ligand to one class of sites. Section III evaluates data modeling and simulations and describes the practicality of using computers to design model ion channels. Another paper discusses a graphical interaction program called MEMPOT to simulate an electrophysiological investigation of the properties of the membrane potential in stimulated cells. The book also presents a quantitative data gathered from computer simulation of the factors that affect neuronal density per measured sections. The book is suitable for microbiologists, biochemists, neuroscientists, and researchers in the field of medical research, as well as for advanced computer programmers in medical research work.",Technology & Engineering,609,N/A,0,en

The Empathy Diaries,Sherry Turkle,Penguin,2021-03-02,"“A beautiful book… an instant classic of the genre.” —Dwight Garner, New York Times • A New York Times Critics’ Top Book of 2021 • A New York Times Book Review Editors' Choice • Named a Best Nonfiction Book of 2021 by Kirkus • Winner of the 2021 National Jewish Book Award in Autobiography & Memoir • Winner of the New England Society Book Award in Nonfiction MIT psychologist and bestselling author of Reclaiming Conversation and Alone Together, Sherry Turkle's intimate memoir of love and work For decades, Sherry Turkle has shown how we remake ourselves in the mirror of our machines. Here, she illuminates our present search for authentic connection in a time of uncharted challenges. Turkle has spent a career composing an intimate ethnography of our digital world; now, marked by insight, humility, and compassion, we have her own. In this vivid and poignant narrative, Turkle ties together her coming-of-age and her pathbreaking research on technology, empathy, and ethics. Growing up in postwar Brooklyn,Turkle searched for clues to her identity in a house filled with mysteries. She mastered the codes that governed her mother's secretive life. She learned never to ask about her absent scientist father--and never to use his name, her name. Before empathy became a way to find connection, it was her strategy for survival. Turkle's intellect and curiosity brought her to worlds on the threshold of change. She learned friendship at a Harvard-Radcliffe on the cusp of coeducation during the antiwar movement, she mourned the loss of her mother in Paris as students returned from the 1968 barricades, and she followed her ambition while fighting for her place as a woman and a humanist at MIT. There, Turkle found turbulent love and chronicled the wonders of the new computer culture, even as she warned of its threat to our most essential human connections. The Empathy Diaries captures all this in rich detail--and offers a master class in finding meaning through a life's work.",Biography & Autobiography,386,N/A,0,en

Abstractions and Embodiments,"Janet Abbate, Stephanie Dick",JHU Press,2022-08-30,"Cutting-edge historians explore ideas, communities, and technologies around modern computing to explore how computers mediate social relations. Computers have been framed both as a mirror for the human mind and as an irreducible other that humanness is defined against, depending on different historical definitions of ""humanness."" They can serve both liberation and control because some people's freedom has historically been predicated on controlling others. Historians of computing return again and again to these contradictions, as they often reveal deeper structures. Using twin frameworks of abstraction and embodiment, a reformulation of the old mind-body dichotomy, this anthology examines how social relations are enacted in and through computing. The authors examining ""Abstraction"" revisit central concepts in computing, including ""algorithm,"" ""program,"" ""clone,"" and ""risk."" In doing so, they demonstrate how the meanings of these terms reflect power relations and social identities. The section on ""Embodiments"" focuses on sensory aspects of using computers as well as the ways in which gender, race, and other identities have shaped the opportunities and embodied experiences of computer workers and users. Offering a rich and diverse set of studies in new areas, the book explores such disparate themes as disability, the influence of the punk movement, working mothers as technical innovators, and gaming behind the Iron Curtain. Abstractions and Embodiments reimagines computing history by questioning canonical interpretations, foregrounding new actors and contexts, and highlighting neglected aspects of computing as an embodied experience. It makes the profound case that both technology and the body are culturally shaped and that there can be no clear distinction between social, intellectual, and technical aspects of computing.

Access to Medical Knowledge,Frances Groen,Rlpg/Galleys,2007,"Access to Medical Knowledge answers the question, ""What makes the medical librarian committed to the fundamental value of providing medical information to all who need it?"" What are the underlying values of the profession that support this strong commitment to the public good? In answering these questions, author Frances Groen identifies three core professional values of librarians: providing access to information, preserving the accumulated knowledge of the past, and helping the public to understand how to help themselves to this information. While these values are shared by all library specialties, Groen explores their unique meaning within the field of medical librarianship by taking a careful look at its genesis through a thorough review of the literature demonstrating these perennial values in the practice of medical librarianship. The book describes the transformative nature of information technology that has provided new opportunities to revolutionize clinical medical information delivery and patient information, and it explores the impact of the digital revolution in providing a new paradigm for scientific communication and a more open approach to accessing the literature through the Open Access movement. Groen demonstrates the medical librarian's successful adaptation to this changing information paradigm while simultaneously adhering to the perennial values of the profession. Access to Medical Knowledge also addresses the need for intensified collaboration between branches of librarianship as a result of the digital library world bringing all library practitioners closer together. This book will interest all medical librarians because of its coverage of developments in international medical librarianship.",Computers,306,N/A,0,en

The World Computer,Jonathan Beller,Duke University Press,2021-01-22,"In The World Computer Jonathan Beller forcefully demonstrates that the history of commodification generates information itself. Out of the omnipresent calculus imposed by commodification, information emerges historically as a new money form. Investigating its subsequent financialization of daily life and colonization of semiotics, Beller situates the development of myriad systems for quantifying the value of people, objects, and affects as endemic to racial capitalism and computation. Built on oppression and genocide, capital and its technical result as computation manifest as racial formations, as do the machines and software of social mediation that feed racial capitalism and run on social difference. Algorithms, derived from for-profit management strategies, conscript all forms of expression—language, image, music, communication—into the calculus of capital such that even protest may turn a profit. Computational media function for the purpose of extraction rather than ameliorating global crises, and financialize every expressive act, converting each utterance into a wager. Repairing this ecology of exploitation, Beller contends, requires decolonizing information and money, and the scripting of futures wagered by the cultural legacies and claims of those in struggle.",Philosophy,214,N/A,0,en
The Computer Revolution,Daniel E. Sichel,N/A,1997,"During the 1980s and into this decade, U.S. businesses poured billions of dollars into computers and other information technology. Yet the productivity performance of the U.S. economy in the 1980s remained lackluster--especially in the service sector--leading many observers to suspect that companies were not getting their money's worth from these high-tech investments. At the same time, academic research found little evidence of a productivity payoff. But have the tables now turned? With an apparent improvement in productivity in recent years, much academic and popular opinion now suggests that the payback is at hand or just around the corner. As the nation embarks on a major effort to develop an Information Superhighway, it is critical for policymakers, opinion leaders, and others to understand the contribution and role of information technology in the economy during recent decades. This book provides a straightforward guide to the economic issues underlying the debates about these issues, using quantitative and historical analysis, supplemented with interviews of small and large service-sector companies. To set the stage, Daniel Sichel reviews the debates over the role of computers and summarizes the essential facts about computer use, with a particular emphasis on software. Going beyond basic facts, Sichel describes an economic framework for assessing the aggregate economic impact of computers in recent decades and for looking ahead at this impact in the future. Quantitative estimates from this framework, along with supporting historical and interview evidence, place limits on the contribution of computers to the overall economy. When compared to the size of the slowdown in productivity growth in the early 1970s, the overall impact of computers appears relatively modest, in part because the share of computers in the nation's capital stock is surprisingly small. Looking ahead, Sichel also raises questions as to whether computers are likely to solve the nation's productivity woes in the future.",Business & Economics,174,N/A,0,en

The Glass Cage,Nicholas Carr,Random House,2015-01-15,"In The Glass Cage, Pulitzer Prize nominee and bestselling author Nicholas Carr shows how the most important decisions of our lives are now being made by machines and the radical effect this is having on our ability to learn and solve problems. In May 2009 an Airbus A330 passenger jet equipped with the latest ‘glass cockpit’ controls plummeted 30,000 feet into the Atlantic. The reason for the crash: the autopilot had routinely switched itself off. In fact, automation is everywhere – from the thermostat in our homes and the GPS in our phones to the algorithms of High Frequency Trading and self-driving cars. We now use it to diagnose patients, educate children, evaluate criminal evidence and fight wars. But psychological studies show that we perform best when fully involved in a task, while the principle of automation – that humans are inefficient – is self-fulfilling. The glass cockpit is becoming a glass cage. In this utterly engrossing exposé, bestselling writer Nicholas Carr reveals how automation is affecting our ability to solve problems, forge memories and acquire skills. Rather than rejecting technology, Carr argues that we must urgently rethink its role in our lives, using it to enhance rather than diminish the extraordinary abilities that make us human.",Technology & Engineering,290,N/A,0,en

Rebooting AI,"Gary Marcus, Ernest Davis",Vintage,2019-09-10,"Two leaders in the field offer a compelling analysis of the current state of the art and reveal the steps we must take to achieve a robust artificial intelligence that can make our lives better. “Finally, a book that tells us what AI is, what AI is not, and what AI could become if only we are ambitious and creative enough.” —Garry Kasparov, former world chess champion and author of Deep Thinking Despite the hype surrounding AI, creating an intelligence that rivals or exceeds human levels is far more complicated than we have been led to believe. Professors Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis have spent their careers at the forefront of AI research and have witnessed some of the greatest milestones in the field, but they argue that a computer beating a human in Jeopardy! does not signal that we are on the doorstep of fully autonomous cars or superintelligent machines. The achievements in the field thus far have occurred in closed systems with fixed sets of rules, and these approaches are too narrow to achieve genuine intelligence. The real world, in contrast, is wildly complex and open-ended. How can we bridge this gap? What will the consequences be when we do? Taking inspiration from the human mind, Marcus and Davis explain what we need to advance AI to the next level, and suggest that if we are wise along the way, we won't need to worry about a future of machine overlords. If we focus on endowing machines with common sense and deep understanding, rather than simply focusing on statistical analysis and gatherine ever larger collections of data, we will be able to create an AI we can trust—in our homes, our cars, and our doctors' offices. Rebooting AI provides a lucid, clear-eyed assessment of the current science and offers an inspiring vision of how a new generation of AI can make our lives better.",Computers,290,N/A,0,en

Minds and Computers,Matt Carter,N/A,2007,"Could a computer have a mind? What kind of machine would this be? Exactly what do we mean by ‘mind’ anyway?The notion of the ‘intelligent’ machine, whilst continuing to feature in numerous entertaining and frightening fictions, has also been the focus of a serious and dedicated research tradition. Reflecting on these fictions, and on the research tradition that pursues ‘Artificial Intelligence’, raises a number of vexing philosophical issues. Minds and Computers introduces readers to these issues by offering an engaging, coherent, and highly approachable interdisciplinary introduction to the Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence. Readers are presented with introductory material from each of the disciplines which constitute Cognitive Science: Philosophy, Neuroscience, Psychology, Computer Science, and Linguistics. Throughout, readers are encouraged to consider the implications of this disparate and wide-ranging material for the possibility of developing machines with minds. And they can expect to develop a foundation for philosophically responsible engagement with A.I., a sound understanding of Philosophy of Mind and of computational theory, and a good feel for cross-disciplinary analysis.Features:*A solid foundation in the Philosophy of Mind*A broadly interdisciplinary purview*A directed philosophical focus*A clear and accessible explanation of technical material with abundant exercises*A glossary of terms",Philosophy,222,3,1,en

Design of Arithmetic Units for Digital Computers,GOSLING,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-11-11,"The original motivation for the development of digital computers was to make it possible to perform calculations that were too large to be attempted by a human being without serious likelihood of error. Once the users found that they could achieve their initial aims, they then wanted to go into greater detail, and to solve still bigger problems, so that the demand for extra computing power has continued unabated, and shows no sign of slackening. This book is an attempt to describe some of the more important techniques used today, or likely to be used in the near future, to perform arithmetic within the computing machine. There are, at present, few books in this field. Most books on computer design cover the more elementary methods, and some go into detail on one or two more ambitious units. Space does not allow more. In this text the aim has been to fill this gap in the literature. In selecting the topics to be covered, there have been two main aims: first, to deal with the basic procedures of arithmetic, and then to carry on to the design of more powerful units; second, to maintain a strictly practical approach. The number of mathematical formulae has been kept to a minimum, and the more complex ones have been eliminated, since they merely serve to obscure the essential principles.",Computers,147,N/A,0,en

Highly parallel quantum algorithms can decrease the computational time for some problems by many orders of magnitude. This important book explains how quantum computers can do these amazing things. Several algorithms are illustrated: the discrete Fourier transform, Shor's algorithm for prime factorization; algorithms for quantum logic gates; physical implementations of quantum logic gates in ion traps and in spin chains; the simplest schemes for quantum error correction; correction of errors caused by imperfect resonant pulses; correction of errors caused by the nonresonant actions of a pulse; and numerical simulations of dynamical behavior of the quantum Control-Not gate. An overview of some basic elements of computer science is presented, including the Turing machine, Boolean algebra, and logic gates. The required quantum ideas are explained.",Computers,200,4,2,en

In an extraordinary revision of received wisdom, Byron Reeves and Clifford Nass demonstrate convincingly in The Media Equation that interactions with computers, television, and new communication technologies are identical to real social relationships and to the navigation of real physical spaces. Using everyday language, the authors explain their novel ideas in a way that will engage general readers with an interest in cutting-edge research at the intersection of psychology, communication and computer technology. The result is an accessible summary of exciting ideas for modern times. As Bill Gates says, '(they) ... have shown us some amazing things'.",Computers,317,N/A,0,en

The Origins of Digital Computers,B. Randell,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"My interest in the history of digital computers became an active one when I had the fortune to come across the almost entirely forgotten work of PERCY LUDGATE, who designed a mechanical program-controlled computer in Ireland in the early 1 'JOO's. I undertook an investigation of his life and work, during which I began to realise that a large number of early developments, which we can now see as culminating in the modern digital computer, had been most undeservedly forgotten. Hopefully, historians of science, some of whom are now taking up the subject of the development of the computer and accumulating valuable data, particularly about the more recent events from the people concerned, will before too long provide us with comprehensive analytical accounts of the invention of the computer. The present book merely aims to bring together some of the more important and interesting written source material for such a history of computers.

Mindstorms,Seymour A Papert,Basic Books,2020-10-06,"In this revolutionary book, a renowned computer scientist explains the importance of teaching children the basics of computing and how it can prepare them to succeed in the ever-evolving tech world. Computers have completely changed the way we teach children. We have Mindstorms to thank for that. In this book, pioneering computer scientist Seymour Papert uses the invention of LOGO, the first child-friendly programming language, to make the case for the value of teaching children with computers. Papert argues that children are more than capable of mastering computers, and that teaching computational processes like de-bugging in the classroom can change the way we learn everything else. He also shows that schools saturated with technology can actually improve socialization and interaction among students and between students and teachers. Technology changes every day, but the basic ways that computers can help us learn remain. For thousands of teachers and parents who have sought creative ways to help children learn with computers, Mindstorms is their bible.",Education,272,N/A,0,en

From Counterculture to Cyberculture,Fred Turner,University of Chicago Press,2010-10-15,"In the early 1960s, computers haunted the American popular imagination. Bleak tools of the cold war, they embodied the rigid organization and mechanical conformity that made the military-industrial complex possible. But by the 1990s—and the dawn of the Internet—computers started to represent a very different kind of world: a collaborative and digital utopia modeled on the communal ideals of the hippies who so vehemently rebelled against the cold war establishment in the first place. From Counterculture to Cyberculture is the first book to explore this extraordinary and ironic transformation. Fred Turner here traces the previously untold story of a highly influential group of San Francisco Bay–area entrepreneurs: Stewart Brand and the Whole Earth network. Between 1968 and 1998, via such familiar venues as the National Book Award–winning Whole Earth Catalog, the computer conferencing system known as WELL, and, ultimately, the launch of the wildly successful Wired magazine, Brand and his colleagues brokered a long-running collaboration between San Francisco flower power and the emerging technological hub of Silicon Valley. Thanks to their vision, counterculturalists and technologists alike joined together to reimagine computers as tools for personal liberation, the building of virtual and decidedly alternative communities, and the exploration of bold new social frontiers. Shedding new light on how our networked culture came to be, this fascinating book reminds us that the distance between the Grateful Dead and Google, between Ken Kesey and the computer itself, is not as great as we might think.",History,340,3.5,3,en

The Computer-Based Patient Record,"Committee on Improving the Patient Record, Institute of Medicine",National Academies Press,1997-10-28,"Most industries have plunged into data automation, but health care organizations have lagged in moving patients' medical records from paper to computers. In its first edition, this book presented a blueprint for introducing the computer-based patient record (CPR). The revised edition adds new information to the original book. One section describes recent developments, including the creation of a computer-based patient record institute. An international chapter highlights what is new in this still-emerging technology. An expert committee explores the potential of machine-readable CPRs to improve diagnostic and care decisions, provide a database for policymaking, and much more, addressing these key questions: Who uses patient records? What technology is available and what further research is necessary to meet users' needs? What should government, medical organizations, and others do to make the transition to CPRs? The volume also explores such issues as privacy and confidentiality, costs, the need for training, legal barriers to CPRs, and other key topics.",Medical,257,N/A,0,en

Persuasive Technology,B.J. Fogg,Elsevier,2003-01-04,"Can computers change what you think and do? Can they motivate you to stop smoking, persuade you to buy insurance, or convince you to join the Army? ""Yes, they can,"" says Dr. B.J. Fogg, director of the Persuasive Technology Lab at Stanford University. Fogg has coined the phrase ""Captology""(an acronym for computers as persuasive technologies) to capture the domain of research, design, and applications of persuasive computers.In this thought-provoking book, based on nine years of research in captology, Dr. Fogg reveals how Web sites, software applications, and mobile devices can be used to change people's attitudes and behavior. Technology designers, marketers, researchers, consumers—anyone who wants to leverage or simply understand the persuasive power of interactive technology—will appreciate the compelling insights and illuminating examples found inside. Persuasive technology can be controversial—and it should be. Who will wield this power of digital influence? And to what end? Now is the time to survey the issues and explore the principles of persuasive technology, and B.J.

For centuries, writers have dreamed of mechanical storytellers. We can now build these devices. What will be the impact on society of AI programs that generate original stories to entertain and persuade? What can we learn about human creativity from probing how they work? In Story Machines, two pioneers of creative artificial intelligence explore the design and impact of AI story generators. The book covers three themes: language generators that compose coherent text, storyworlds with believable characters, and AI models of human storytellers. Providing examples of story machines through the ages, it covers the history, recent developments, and future implications of automated story generation. Anyone with an interest in story writing will gain a new perspective on what it means to be a creative writer, what parts of creativity can be mechanized, and what is essentially human. Story Machines is for those who have ever wondered what makes a good story, why stories are important to us, and what the future holds for storytelling.",Education,153,N/A,0,en
Understanding the Digital World,Brian W. Kernighan,Princeton University Press,2017-01-24,"The basics of how computer hardware, software, and systems work, and the risks they create for our privacy and security Computers are everywhere. Some of them are highly visible, in laptops, tablets, cell phones, and smart watches. But most are invisible, like those in appliances, cars, medical equipment, transportation systems, power grids, and weapons. We never see the myriad computers that quietly collect, share, and sometimes leak vast amounts of personal data about us. Through computers, governments and companies increasingly monitor what we do. Social networks and advertisers know far more about us than we should be comfortable with, using information we freely give them. Criminals have all-too-easy access to our data. Do we truly understand the power of computers in our world? Understanding the Digital World explains how computer hardware, software, networks, and systems work. Topics include how computers are built and how they compute; what programming is and why it is difficult; how the Internet and the web operate; and how all of these affect our security, privacy, property, and other important social, political, and economic issues. This book also touches on fundamental ideas from computer science and some of the inherent limitations of computers. It includes numerous color illustrations, notes on sources for further exploration, and a glossary to explain technical terms and buzzwords. Understanding the Digital World is a must-read for all who want to know more about computers and communications. It explains, precisely and carefully, not only how they operate but also how they influence our daily lives, in terms anyone can understand, no matter what their experience and knowledge of technology.",Computers,256,N/A,0,en

Sixty-three carefully chosen profes sionals were invited to participate in this institute together with 12 lecturers and 7 assistants. The 63 participants were selected from a group of almost 140 applicants. Each had the background to learn effectively the set of computer IC design aids which were presented. Each also had individual expertise in at least one of the topics of the Institute. The Institute was designed to provide hands-on type of experience rather than consisting of solely lecture and discussion. Each morning, detailed presentations were made concerning the critical algorithms that are used in the various types of computer IC design aids. Each afternoon a lengthy period was used to provide the participants with direct access to the computer programs. In addition to using the programs, the individual could, if his expertise was sufficient, make modifications of and extensions to the programs, or establish limitations of these present aids. The interest in this hands-on activity was very high and many participants worked with the programs every free hour.

On Computing,Paul S. Rosenbloom,MIT Press,2012-11-09,"A proposal that computing is not merely a form of engineering but a scientific domain on a par with the physical, life, and social sciences. Computing is not simply about hardware or software, or calculation or applications. Computing, writes Paul Rosenbloom, is an exciting and diverse, yet remarkably coherent, scientific enterprise that is highly multidisciplinary yet maintains a unique core of its own. In On Computing, Rosenbloom proposes that computing is a great scientific domain on a par with the physical, life, and social sciences. Rosenbloom introduces a relational approach for understanding computing, conceptualizing it in terms of forms of interaction and implementation, to reveal the hidden structures and connections among its disciplines. He argues for the continuing vitality of computing, surveying the leading edge in computing's combination with other domains, from biocomputing and brain-computer interfaces to crowdsourcing and virtual humans to robots and the intermingling of the real and the virtual. He explores forms of higher order coherence, or macrostructures, over complex computing topics and organizations. Finally, he examines the very notion of a great scientific domain in philosophical terms, honing his argument that computing should be considered the fourth great scientific domain. With On Computing, Rosenbloom, a key architect of the founding of University of Southern California's Institute for Creative Technologies and former Deputy Director of USC's Information Sciences Institute, offers a broader perspective on what computing is and what it can become.",Computers,333,N/A,0,en

Dedicated Computer Crime Units,J. Thomas Mcewen,DIANE Publishing,1995-06,"In the grand tradition of popular exposition, astrophysicist Hubert Reeves explains current scientific understanding of the deepest mysteries of the universe in terms that will excite, stimulate, and educate the nonscientific reader. When it was first published in France in 1981, this book quickly became a best-seller and was avidly embraced by the popular press. The reviewer for L'Express, for example, wrote that ""Reeves turns astrophysics into an epic saga, a metaphysical fresco, a story in the fullest sense of the word. [He can do this] because he forgets to be a professor. Facing the sky, his eternal home, he recounts the titanic struggle of primordial forces that, over the course of billions of years, formed the cosmos and all it contains...."" The book falls into three broad sections. The first explores the implications of the discovery that the universe does indeed have a history - that the night sky that so excites our wonder is not static but has both a beginning and an end. The second uncovers the layers of evolution that comprise that history, from the cosmic phase in the first few moments of the universe when energy first transformed itself into matter, to the biological phase when matter transformed itself into life. The third goes behind the scenes of the universal drama to examine such basic concepts as time, energy, and chance. Reeves' style is metaphorical, determinedly naive, and even slightly anthropomorphic. Music becomes a metaphor for all of the orderliness in the universe that might just as easily have been cosmic ""noise"" if there had been no guiding principles at work. To understand those guiding principles, and to gain a fuller appreciation of the music that they produce, is` the goal of this enlightening and poetic book.",True Crime,148,3,3,en

Every Computer Performance Book,Bob Wescott,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2013-03-29,"This is a short, occasionally funny, book on how to solve and avoid application and/or computer performance problems. I wrote it to give back the knowledge, insights, tips, and tricks I was given over the last 25 years of my computing career. It shows practical ways to use key performance laws and gives well tested advice on how (and when) to do performance monitoring, capacity planning, load testing, and performance modeling. It works for any application or collection of computers because it teaches you how to decipher whatever meters they give you and how to discover more about those meters than the documentation reveals. This book covers the things that will always be true no matter what technology you are using. It will continue to be useful 20 years from now when today's technology, if it runs at all, will look as quaint as a mechanical cuckoo clock. There is no complex math required; yet it allows you to easily use some fairly advanced techniques. Simple arithmetic, and a spreadsheet program, is all that is required of you. Lastly, it helps with the human side of performance. It shows you how to get the help you need and how to present your findings (good or bad) all the way up to the CIO level.",Computer systems,0,N/A,0,en

Fumbling the Future,"Douglas K. Smith, Robert C.

The more knowledgable of them will add the likes of Microsoft, Ashton-Tate, Compaq, and Borland. But no one will say Xerox. Fifteen years after it invented personal computing, Xerox still means ""copy."" Fumbling the Future tells how one of America's leading corporations invented the technology for one of the fastest-growing products of recent times, then miscalculated and mishandled the opportunity to fully exploit it. It is a classic story of how innovation can fare within large corporate structures, the real-life odyssey of what can happen to an idea as it travels from inspiration to implementation. More than anything, Fumbling the Future is a tale of human beings whose talents, hopes, fears, habits, and prejudices determine the fate of our largest organizations and of our best ideas. In an era in which technological creativity and economic change are so critical to the competitiveness of the American economy, Fumbling the Future is a parable for our times.",Computer industry,278,N/A,0,en

Quantum Computing for Everyone,Chris Bernhardt,MIT Press,2019-03-19,"An accessible introduction to an exciting new area in computation, explaining such topics as qubits, entanglement, and quantum teleportation for the general reader. Quantum computing is a beautiful fusion of quantum physics and computer science, incorporating some of the most stunning ideas from twentieth-century physics into an entirely new way of thinking about computation. In this book, Chris Bernhardt offers an introduction to quantum computing that is accessible to anyone who is comfortable with high school mathematics. He explains qubits, entanglement, quantum teleportation, quantum algorithms, and other quantum-related topics as clearly as possible for the general reader. Bernhardt, a mathematician himself, simplifies the mathematics as much as he can and provides elementary examples that illustrate both how the math works and what it means. Bernhardt introduces the basic unit of quantum computing, the qubit, and explains how the qubit can be measured; discusses entanglement—which, he says, is easier to describe mathematically than verbally—and what it means when two qubits are entangled (citing Einstein's characterization of what happens when the measurement of one entangled qubit affects the second as “spooky action at a distance”); and introduces quantum cryptography. He recaps standard topics in classical computing—bits, gates, and logic—and describes Edward Fredkin's ingenious billiard ball computer. He defines quantum gates, considers the speed of quantum algorithms, and describes the building of quantum computers. By the end of the book, readers understand that quantum computing and classical computing are not two distinct disciplines, and that quantum computing is the fundamental form of computing. The basic unit of computation is the qubit, not the bit.",Computers,214,N/A,0,en
Introduction to Computing Systems,"Yale N. Patt, Sanjay J.

The book is in two parts: (a) the underlying structure of a computer, and (b) programming in a high level language and programming methodology. To understand the computer, the authors introduce the LC-3 and provide the LC-3 Simulator to give students hands-on access for testing what they learn. To develop their understanding of programming and programming methodology, they use the C programming language. The book takes a ""motivated"" bottom-up approach, where the students first get exposed to the big picture and then start at the bottom and build their knowledge bottom-up. Within each smaller unit, the same motivated bottom-up approach is followed. Every step of the way, students learn new things, building on what they already know. The authors feel that this approach encourages deeper understanding and downplays the need for memorizing. Students develop a greater breadth of understanding, since they see how the various parts of the computer fit together.",C (Computer program language),632,N/A,0,en

The book is in two parts: (a) the underlying structure of a computer, and (b) programming in a high level language and programming methodology. To understand the computer, the authors introduce the LC-3 and provide the LC-3 Simulator to give students hands-on access for testing what they learn. To develop their understanding of programming and programming methodology, they use the C programming language. The book takes a ""motivated"" bottom-up approach, where the students first get exposed to the big picture and then start at the bottom and build their knowledge bottom-up. Within each smaller unit, the same motivated bottom-up approach is followed. Every step of the way, students learn new things, building on what they already know. The authors feel that this approach encourages deeper understanding and downplays the need for memorizing. Students develop a greater breadth of understanding, since they see how the various parts of the computer fit together.",Computers,656,N/A,0,en

The Computer Guy Is Here!,"John Sak, MM John C Sak Ce",Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2018-01-25,"Way back in the last century, back in the 1960s, computers were mammoth mysterious machines. They were immensely expensive yet became essential to daily business operations. Yet, no one ever saw them. Security dictated they be hidden away. Only the computer operators were allowed access. These were the important people who actually made the computer do useful work. On the other hand, these knowledgeable operators knew absolutely nothing of the technology behind the covers. Whenever a problem arose, there was no choice but to call the Computer Guy. Frantically a supervisor would place a call for service. Then wait. And wait. Little could be done without the computer running. Finally! At long last, someone would yell out, ""The computer guy is here!"" Following a brief greeting, the thankful supervisor immediately wanted to know how long it would take to get the computer running again. So, with everyone anxiously looking over his shoulder, the computer guy set about his business of determining the cause and finding a solution to the problem. Clearly a stressful situation. Yet this was only a minor portion of an essential career from the early days of the Computer Era. The Computer Guys were the Field Engineers who installed, maintained and repaired those old mainframe computers. Their place in technological history is finally documented.",,170,N/A,0,en

C For Dummies,Dan Gookin,John Wiley & Sons,2004-05-07,"while (dead_horse) beat (): If you’re like most people, the above seems like nonsense. Actually, it’s computer sense—C programming. After digesting C For Dummies, 2nd Edition, you’ll understand it. C programs are fast, concise and versatile. They let you boss your computer around for a change. So turn on your computer, get a free compiler and editor (the book tells you where), pull up a chair, and get going. You won’t have to go far (page 13) to find your first program example. You’ll do short, totally manageable, hands-on exercises to help you make sense of: All 32 keywords in the C language (that’s right—just 32 words) The functions—several dozen of them Terms like printf(), scanf(), gets (), and puts () String variables, numeric variables, and constants Looping and implementation Floating-point values In case those terms are almost as intimidating as the idea of programming, be reassured that C For Dummies was written by Dan Gookin, bestselling author of DOS For Dummies, the book that started the whole library. So instead of using expletives and getting headaches, you’ll be using newly acquired skills and getting occasional chuckles as you discover how to: Design and develop programs Add comments (like post-it-notes to yourself) as you go Link code to create executable programs Debug and deploy your programs Use lint, a common tool to examine and optimize your code A helpful, tear-out cheat sheet is a quick reference for comparison symbols, conversion characters, mathematical doodads, C numeric data types, and more.

Computer Security and the Internet,Paul C. van Oorschot,Springer Nature,2020-04-04,"This book provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of computer and Internet security, suitable for a one-term introductory course for junior/senior undergrad or first-year graduate students. It is also suitable for self-study by anyone seeking a solid footing in security – including software developers and computing professionals, technical managers and government staff. An overriding focus is on brevity, without sacrificing breadth of core topics or technical detail within them. The aim is to enable a broad understanding in roughly 350 pages. Further prioritization is supported by designating as optional selected content within this. Fundamental academic concepts are reinforced by specifics and examples, and related to applied problems and real-world incidents. The first chapter provides a gentle overview and 20 design principles for security. The ten chapters that follow provide a framework for understanding computer and Internet security. They regularly refer back to the principles, with supporting examples. These principles are the conceptual counterparts of security-related error patterns that have been recurring in software and system designs for over 50 years. The book is “elementary” in that it assumes no background in security, but unlike “soft” high-level texts it does not avoid low-level details, instead it selectively dives into fine points for exemplary topics to concretely illustrate concepts and principles. The book is rigorous in the sense of being technically sound, but avoids both mathematical proofs and lengthy source-code examples that typically make books inaccessible to general audiences. Knowledge of elementary operating system and networking concepts is helpful, but review sections summarize the essential background. For graduate students, inline exercises and supplemental references provided in per-chapter endnotes provide a bridge to further topics and a springboard to the research literature; for those in industry and government, pointers are provided to helpful surveys and relevant standards, e.g., documents from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), and the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology.",Computers,381,5,1,en

Legal Protection for Computer-Implemented Inventions,"Sabine Kruspig, Claudia Schwarz",Kluwer Law International B.V.,2016-04-24,"As a result of the incorporation of computer software into countless commercial and industrial products, the patentability of software has become a vital issue in intellectual property law. This indispensable book provides an overview on the current status of computer-implemented inventions in patent law across Europe and major jurisdictions worldwide. A hugely practical field research tool with guidance based on case law, it examines the major hurdles in each particular country and describes the best practice to be adopted. Clearly showing how enforceable software patent applications can be competitively drafted and how a patent portfolio for computer-implemented inventions can be established in several countries without spending money unnecessarily on problematic examination proceedings, this book covers such issues and topics as the following: • claim categories for patent applications; • sufficient level of abstraction/breadth of the claimed invention; • fundamental terms of computing and terminological traps; • probability for patents dependent on software application areas; and • patents in core areas of computing. With separate chapters for the key countries, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, the United States, China, Korea, Japan, India, and the European Patent Office the legal situation for computer-implemented inventions in each country or region, this book includes guidance on prosecution under national law, analyses of relevant court decisions, practice checklists, and an outlook on future developments.. The authors describe claim formulation based on actual cases and on principles of computer science in order to show what might be or might not be patentable in each jurisdiction. With this incomparable resource, patent attorneys and patent professionals in companies will get a basis for making decisions about the most appropriate jurisdictions in which to file patent applications. This book will also be of great value to computer professionals who are affected by the protection of software or who are actively involved in the protection of software by patent law.",Law,221,N/A,0,en

Now, from a Silicon Valley hero and bestselling technology writer comes a pointed critique of the hype surrounding computers and their real benefits, especially in education. In High-Tech Heretic, Clifford Stoll questions the relentless drumbeat for ""computer literacy"" by educators and the computer industry, particularly since most people just use computers for word processing and games--and computers become outmoded or obsolete much sooner than new textbooks or a good teacher. As one who loves computers as much as he disdains the inflated promises made on their behalf, Stoll offers a commonsense look at how we can make a technological world better suited for people, instead of making people better suited to using machines.",Education,242,N/A,0,en

I undertook an investigation of his life and work, during which I began to realise that a large number of early developments, which we can now see as culminating in the modern digital computer, had been most undeservedly forgotten. Hopefully, historians of science, some of whom are now taking up the subject of the development of the computer and accumulating valuable data, particularly about the more recent events from the people concerned, will before too long provide us with comprehensive analytical accounts of the invention of the computer. The present book merely aims to bring together some of the more important and interesting written source material for such a history of computers.

There are new implementations of most of the major programming systems in the book, including the interpreters and compilers, and the authors have incorporated many small changes that reflect their experience teaching the course at MIT since the first edition was published. A new theme has been introduced that emphasizes the central role played by different approaches to dealing with time in computational models: objects with state, concurrent programming, functional programming and lazy evaluation, and nondeterministic programming. There are new example sections on higher-order procedures in graphics and on applications of stream processing in numerical programming, and many new exercises.

Image Objects,Jacob Gaboury,MIT Press,2021-08-03,"How computer graphics transformed the computer from a calculating machine into an interactive medium, as seen through the histories of five technical objects. Most of us think of computer graphics as a relatively recent invention, enabling the spectacular visual effects and lifelike simulations we see in current films, television shows, and digital games. In fact, computer graphics have been around as long as the modern computer itself, and played a fundamental role in the development of our contemporary culture of computing. In Image Objects, Jacob Gaboury offers a prehistory of computer graphics through an examination of five technical objects--an algorithm, an interface, an object standard, a programming paradigm, and a hardware platform--arguing that computer graphics transformed the computer from a calculating machine into an interactive medium. Gaboury explores early efforts to produce an algorithmic solution for the calculation of object visibility; considers the history of the computer screen and the random-access memory that first made interactive images possible; examines the standardization of graphical objects through the Utah teapot, the most famous graphical model in the history of the field; reviews the graphical origins of the object-oriented programming paradigm; and, finally, considers the development of the graphics processing unit as the catalyst that enabled an explosion in graphical computing at the end of the twentieth century. The development of computer graphics, Gaboury argues, signals a change not only in the way we make images but also in the way we mediate our world through the computer--and how we have come to reimagine that world as computational.",Computers,323,N/A,0,en

A Class of Backward-difference Digital Differential Analyzers for Incremental Computer Realizations,"Eduardo Whitaker Bergamini, Stanford University Stanford Electronics Laboratories",N/A,1973,"The digital differential analyzer (DDA) is a modular digital integrator whose potentialities are extensive when considered as a basic tool for the solution of problems involving integration. With the advent of high-speed large-scale integrated logic, the attractiveness of the DDA as a real-time signal processor or generator has increased significantly. The investigation presents a class of DDAs based on a predictive version of the Newton backward-difference integration algorithm, also called the Adams-Bashforth method. If properly applied, this predictive integrating algorithm is especially useful for real-time processing. (Modified author abstract).",Electronic differential analyzers,240,N/A,0,en

Computer Science,"Edward K. Blum, Alfred V Aho",Springer Science & Business Media,2011-12-02,"Computer Science: The Hardware, Software and Heart of It focuses on the deeper aspects of the two recognized subdivisions of Computer Science, Software and Hardware. These subdivisions are shown to be closely interrelated as a result of the stored-program concept. Computer Science: The Hardware, Software and Heart of It includes certain classical theoretical computer science topics such as Unsolvability (e.g. the halting problem) and Undecidability (e.g. Godel’s incompleteness theorem) that treat problems that exist under the Church-Turing thesis of computation. These problem topics explain inherent limits lying at the heart of software, and in effect define boundaries beyond which computer science professionals cannot go beyond. Newer topics such as Cloud Computing are also covered in this book. After a survey of traditional programming languages (e.g. Fortran and C++), a new kind of computer Programming for parallel/distributed computing is presented using the message-passing paradigm which is at the heart of large clusters of computers. This leads to descriptions of current hardware platforms for large-scale computing, such as clusters of as many as one thousand which are the new generation of supercomputers. This also leads to a consideration of future quantum computers and a possible escape from the Church-Turing thesis to a new computation paradigm. The book’s historical context is especially helpful during this, the centenary of Turing's birth. Alan Turing is widely regarded as the father of Computer Science, since many concepts in both the hardware and software of Computer Science can be traced to his pioneering research. Turing was a multi-faceted mathematician-engineer and was able to work on both concrete and abstract levels. This book shows how these two seemingly disparate aspects of Computer Science are intimately related. Further, the book treats the theoretical side of Computer Science as well, which also derives from Turing's research. Computer Science: The Hardware, Software and Heart of It is designed as a professional book for practitioners and researchers working in the related fields of Quantum Computing, Cloud Computing, Computer Networking, as well as non-scientist readers. Advanced-level and undergraduate students concentrating on computer science, engineering and mathematics will also find this book useful.",Computers,470,N/A,0,en

The Computer - My Life,Konrad Zuse,Springer Science & Business Media,1993-09-28,"Konrad Zuse is one of the great pioneers of the computer age. He created thefirst fully automated, program controlled, freely programmable computer using binary floating-point calculation. It was operational in 1941. He built his first machines in Berlin during the Second World War, with bombs falling all around, and after the war he built up a company that was taken over by Siemens in 1967. Zuse was an inventor in the traditional style, full of phantastic ideas, but also gifted with a powerful analytical mind. Single-handedly, he developed one of the first programming languages, the Plan Calculus, including features copied only decades later in other languages. He wrote numerousbooks and articles and won many honors and awards. This is his autobiography, written in an engagingly lively and pleasant style, full of anecdotes, reminiscences, and philosophical asides.

Three-dimensional Computer Vision,Olivier Faugeras,MIT Press,1993,"This monograph by one of the world's leading vision researchers provides a thorough, mathematically rigorous exposition of a broad and vital area in computer vision: the problems and techniques related to three-dimensional (stereo) vision and motion. The emphasis is on using geometry to solve problems in stereo and motion, with examples from navigation and object recognition. Faugeras takes up such important problems in computer vision as projective geometry, camera calibration, edge detection, stereo vision (with many examples on real images), different kinds of representations and transformations (especially 3-D rotations), uncertainty and methods of addressing it, and object representation and recognition. His theoretical account is illustrated with the results of actual working programs.Three-Dimensional Computer Vision proposes solutions to problems arising from a specific robotics scenario in which a system must perceive and act. Moving about an unknown environment, the system has to avoid static and mobile obstacles, build models of objects and places in order to be able to recognize and locate them, and characterize its own motion and that of moving objects, by providing descriptions of the corresponding three-dimensional motions. The ideas generated, however, can be used indifferent settings, resulting in a general book on computer vision that reveals the fascinating relationship of three-dimensional geometry and the imaging process.",Computers,712,N/A,0,en

IEA International Computer and Information Literacy Study 2018 Assessment Framework,"Julian Fraillon, John Ainley, Wolfram Schulz, Daniel Duckworth, Tim Friedman",Springer,2019-07-02,"This open access book presents the assessment framework for IEA’s International Computer an Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2018, which is designed to assess how well students are prepared for study, work and life in a digital world. The study measures international differences in students’ computer and information literacy (CIL): their ability to use computers to investigate, create, participate and communicate at home, at school, in the workplace and in the community. Participating countries also have an option for their students to complete an assessment of computational thinking (CT). The ICILS assessment framework articulates the basic structure of the study, providing a description of the field and the constructs to be measured. This book outlines the design and content of the measurement instruments, sets down the rationale for those designs, and describes how measures generated by those instruments relate to the constructs. Hypothesized relations between constructs provide the foundation for some of the analyses that follow. Above all, the framework links ICILS to other similar research, enabling the contents of this assessment framework to combine theory and practice in an explication of both the ‘what’ and the ‘how’ of ICILS.",Education,77,N/A,0,en

Computer Architecture,Joseph D. Dumas II,CRC Press,2018-10-03,"Future computing professionals must become familiar with historical computer architectures because many of the same or similar techniques are still being used and may persist well into the future. Computer Architecture: Fundamentals and Principles of Computer Design discusses the fundamental principles of computer design and performance enhancement that have proven effective and demonstrates how current trends in architecture and implementation rely on these principles while expanding upon them or applying them in new ways. Rather than focusing on a particular type of machine, this textbook explains concepts and techniques via examples drawn from various architectures and implementations. When necessary, the author creates simplified examples that clearly explain architectural and implementation features used across many computing platforms. Following an introduction that discusses the difference between architecture and implementation and how they relate, the next four chapters cover the architecture of traditional, single-processor systems that are still, after 60 years, the most widely used computing machines. The final two chapters explore approaches to adopt when single-processor systems do not reach desired levels of performance or are not suited for intended applications. Topics include parallel systems, major classifications of architectures, and characteristics of unconventional systems of the past, present, and future. This textbook provides students with a thorough grounding in what constitutes high performance and how to measure it, as well as a full familiarity in the fundamentals needed to make systems perform better. This knowledge enables them to understand and evaluate the many new systems they will encounter throughout their professional careers.",Computers,396,N/A,0,en

HT THINK LIKE A COMPUTER SCIEN,"Jeffrey Elkner, Allen B. Downey, Chris Meyers",Samurai Media Limited,2016-10-04,"The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer scientist. This way of thinking combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science. Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (specifically computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions. The single most important skill for a computer scientist is problem solving. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills. That's why this chapter is called, The way of the program. On one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself. On another level, you will use programming as a means to an end. As we go along, that end will become clearer.",Computers,306,5,1,en

The CTO's Guide to Code Quality,Mark Harrison,N/A,2019-10-07,"This is not a book about algorithms. This is not a book about architecture. This is not a book about frameworks. This is not even a book about project management, agile or otherwise.This is a book about ""the other things"" that are important to writing and maintaining a sustainable code base.It's also a book about automation of parts of the programming process.If you're a CTO, the economic case for ""code quality plus automation"" is already strong, and getting stronger with each new iteration of hardware.If you're a programmer (maybe aspiring to be a CTO), it's about being able to concentrate on the stimulating, interesting, and creative parts of the craft, and getting the tedious parts done for you.Much of the book is about the general craft of programming and helping programmers become more productive, and should be useful no matter what programming language(s) you've chosen.However, I find it works better to illustrate principles with examples.

Computer Confidence,Bruce D. Sanders,N/A,1984,"Much of the material in this book comes from what I've learned as I've traveled around the country conducting seminars about working profitably in the automated office. During the first few months of those seminars, there was a question I was asked more often than any other single question. I wã asked the question so often that I gave it a nickname. I called it my ""What The Devil"" question. Often in different words, usually at the morning break in the seminar, and almost always with an effort not to offend or embarrass, I was asked, ""What the devil is a psychologist doing conducting seminars about computer systems?"" I'm not asked ""What the Devil"" questions much anymore. Those familiar with office automation have come to realize that human factors chiefly determine whether a computer system will be a success or an expensive failure. So many computer systems have not gained acceptance by is employees because the planners didn't use good psychological sense. That especially true as the computers move from the Engineering Department into the executive suites and the role of computers changes from just producing paper into also assisting in managerial decision making. One human factor I've learned is that people would much rather skip around in a book than read it from front cover to back cover directly. It's true whether the book is a user manual for office equipment or a volume on computer systems for decision makers.",Electronic data processing,116,N/A,0,en

An Introduction to the Analysis of Algorithms,"Robert Sedgewick, Philippe Flajolet",Addison-Wesley,2013-01-18,"Despite growing interest, basic information on methods and models for mathematically analyzing algorithms has rarely been directly accessible to practitioners, researchers, or students. An Introduction to the Analysis of Algorithms, Second Edition, organizes and presents that knowledge, fully introducing primary techniques and results in the field. Robert Sedgewick and the late Philippe Flajolet have drawn from both classical mathematics and computer science, integrating discrete mathematics, elementary real analysis, combinatorics, algorithms, and data structures. They emphasize the mathematics needed to support scientific studies that can serve as the basis for predicting algorithm performance and for comparing different algorithms on the basis of performance. Techniques covered in the first half of the book include recurrences, generating functions, asymptotics, and analytic combinatorics. Structures studied in the second half of the book include permutations, trees, strings, tries, and mappings. Numerous examples are included throughout to illustrate applications to the analysis of algorithms that are playing a critical role in the evolution of our modern computational infrastructure. Improvements and additions in this new edition include Upgraded figures and code An all-new chapter introducing analytic combinatorics Simplified derivations via analytic combinatorics throughout The book’s thorough, self-contained coverage will help readers appreciate the field’s challenges, prepare them for advanced results—covered in their monograph Analytic Combinatorics and in Donald Knuth’s The Art of Computer Programming books—and provide the background they need to keep abreast of new research. ""[Sedgewick and Flajolet] are not only worldwide leaders of the field, they also are masters of exposition.

Yet, lacking is a comprehensive CSCL handbook that displays the range of research being done in this area. This handbook will provide an overview of the diverse aspects of the field, allowing newcomers to develop a sense of the entirety of CSCL research and for existing community members to become more deeply aware of work outside their direct area. The handbook will also serve as a ready reference for foundational concepts, methods, and approaches in the field. The chapters are written in such a way that each of them can be used in a stand-alone fashion while also serving as introductory readings in relevant study courses or in teacher education. While some CSCL-relevant topics are addressed in the International Handbook of the Learning Sciences and the International Handbook of Collaborative Learning, these books do not aim to present an integrated and comprehensive view of CSCL.

"Computer, Network, Software, and Hardware Engineering with Applications",Norman F. Schneidewind,John Wiley & Sons,2012-03-27,"There are many books on computers, networks, and software engineering but none that integrate the three with applications. Integration is important because, increasingly, software dominates the performance, reliability, maintainability, and availability of complex computer and systems. Books on software engineering typically portray software as if it exists in a vacuum with no relationship to the wider system. This is wrong because a system is more than software. It is comprised of people, organizations, processes, hardware, and software. All of these components must be considered in an integrative fashion when designing systems. On the other hand, books on computers and networks do not demonstrate a deep understanding of the intricacies of developing software. In this book you will learn, for example, how to quantitatively analyze the performance, reliability, maintainability, and availability of computers, networks, and software in relation to the total system. Furthermore, you will learn how to evaluate and mitigate the risk of deploying integrated systems. You will learn how to apply many models dealing with the optimization of systems. Numerous quantitative examples are provided to help you understand and interpret model results. This book can be used as a first year graduate course in computer, network, and software engineering; as an on-the-job reference for computer, network, and software engineers; and as a reference for these disciplines.",Computers,608,N/A,0,en

The Datacenter as a Computer,"Luiz Barroso, Urs Hoelzle",Springer Nature,2009-05-06,"As computation continues to move into the cloud, the computing platform of interest no longer resembles a pizza box or a refrigerator, but a warehouse full of computers. These new large datacenters are quite different from traditional hosting facilities of earlier times and cannot be viewed simply as a collection of co-located servers. Large portions of the hardware and software resources in these facilities must work in concert to efficiently deliver good levels of Internet service performance, something that can only be achieved by a holistic approach to their design and deployment. In other words, we must treat the datacenter itself as one massive warehouse-scale computer (WSC). We describe the architecture of WSCs, the main factors influencing their design, operation, and cost structure, and the characteristics of their software base. We hope it will be useful to architects and programmers of today's WSCs, as well as those of future many-core platforms which may one day implement the equivalent of today's WSCs on a single board.

Computers and the Environment: Understanding and Managing their Impacts,"R. Kuehr, Eric Williams",Springer Science & Business Media,2007-09-15,"Personal computers have made life convenient in many ways, but what about their impacts on the environment due to production, use and disposal? Manufacturing computers requires prodigious quantities of fossil fuels, toxic chemicals and water. Rapid improvements in performance mean we often buy a new machine every 1-3 years, which adds up to mountains of waste computers. How should societies respond to manage these environmental impacts? This volume addresses the environmental impacts and management of computers through a set of analyses on issues ranging from environmental assessment, technologies for recycling, consumer behaviour, strategies of computer manufacturing firms, and government policies. One conclusion is that extending the lifespan of computers (e.g. through reselling) is an environmentally and economically effective strategy that deserves more attention from governments, firms and the general public.",Science,300,4,1,en

Will We Ever Have a Quantum Computer?,Mikhail I. Dyakonov,Springer Nature,2020-03-23,"This book addresses a broad community of physicists, engineers, computer scientists and industry professionals, as well as the general public, who are aware of the unprecedented media hype surrounding the supposedly imminent new era of quantum computing. The central argument of this book is that the feasibility of quantum computing in the physical world is extremely doubtful. The hypothetical quantum computer is not simply a quantum variant of the conventional digital computer, but rather a quantum extension of a classical analog computer operating with continuous parameters. In order to have a useful machine, the number of continuous parameters to control would have to be of such an astronomically large magnitude as to render the endeavor virtually infeasible. This viewpoint is based on the author’s expert understanding of the gargantuan challenges that would have to be overcome to ever make quantum computing a reality. Knowledge of secondary-school-level physics and math will be sufficient for understanding most of the text.",Science,54,N/A,0,en

The Computer: A Very Short Introduction,Darrel Ince,OUP Oxford,2011-11-24,"There is a companion web site asssociated with the book (http://vsicomputer.wordpress.com/). It contains chapter summaries, links to relevant material and posts about items of news relevant to the book's contents. Computers have changed so much since the room-filling, bulky magnetic tape running monsters of the mid 20th century. They now form a vital part of most people's lives. And they are more ubiquitous than might be thought - you may have more than 30 computers in your home: not just the desktop and laptop but think of the television, the fridge, the microwave. But what is the basic nature of the modern computer? How does it work? How has it been possible to squeeze so much power into increasingly small machines? And what will the next generations of computers look like? In this Very Short Introduction, Darrel Ince looks at the basic concepts behind all computers; the changes in hardware and software that allowed computers to become so small and commonplace; the challenges produced by the computer revolution - especially whole new modes of cybercrime and security issues; the Internet and the advent of 'cloud computing'; and the promise of whole new horizons opening up with quantum computing, and even computing using DNA. ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

Focus,Mike Schmoker,ASCD,2018-07-16,"In this 2nd edition of Focus: Elevating the Essentials to Radically Improve Student Learning, Mike Schmoker extends and updates the case that our schools could be on the cusp of swift, unparalleled improvements. But we are stymied by a systemwide failure to simplify and prioritize; we have yet to focus our limited time and energy on the most essential, widely acknowledged, evidence-based practices that could have more impact than all other initiatives combined. They are: simple, coherent curricula; straightforward, traditional literacy practices; and lessons built around just a few hugely effective elements of good teaching. As Schmoker demonstrates, the case for these practices—and the need for them—has grown prodigiously. In every chapter, you’ll find late-breaking discoveries and practical advice on how to simplify the implementation of new state standards in the subject areas; on the hidden pitfalls of our most popular, but unproven instructional fads and programs; and on simple, versatile strategies for building curriculum, planning lessons, and integrating literacy into every discipline. All of these strategies and findings are supported with exciting new evidence from actual schools. Their success confirms, as Michael Fullan writes, that a focus on the best ""high-leverage practices"" won’t only improve student performance; they will produce ""stunningly powerful consequences"" in our schools.",Education,330,N/A,0,en
Computer Game Worlds,Claus Pias,Diaphanes,2017,"Computer games have become ubiquitous in today's society. Many scholars have speculated on the reasons for their massive success. Yet we haven't considered the most basic questions: Why do computer games exist? What specific circumstances led to the creation of this entirely new type of game? What sorts of knowledge facilitated the requisite technological and institutional transformations? With Computer Game Worlds, Claus Pias sets out to answer these questions. Tracing computer games from their earliest forms to the unstoppable commercial and cultural phenomena they have become today, Pias then provides a careful epistemological reconstruction of the process of playing games, both at computers and by computers themselves. The book makes a valuable theoretical contribution to the ongoing discussion about computer games.",Computer games,0,N/A,0,en

Wetware,Dennis Bray,Yale University Press,2009-05-26,"“A beautifully written journey into the mechanics of the world of the cell, and even beyond, exploring the analogy with computers in a surprising way” (Denis Noble, author of Dance to the Tune of Life). How does a single-cell creature, such as an amoeba, lead such a sophisticated life? How does it hunt living prey, respond to lights, sounds, and smells, and display complex sequences of movements without the benefit of a nervous system? This book offers a startling and original answer. In clear, jargon-free language, Dennis Bray taps the findings from the discipline of systems biology to show that the internal chemistry of living cells is a form of computation. Cells are built out of molecular circuits that perform logical operations, as electronic devices do, but with unique properties. Bray argues that the computational juice of cells provides the basis for all distinctive properties of living systems: it allows organisms to embody in their internal structure an image of the world, and this accounts for their adaptability, responsiveness, and intelligence. In Wetware, Bray offers imaginative, wide-ranging, and perceptive critiques of robotics and complexity theory, as well as many entertaining and telling anecdotes. For the general reader, the practicing scientist, and all others with an interest in the nature of life, this book is an exciting portal to some of biology’s latest discoveries and ideas. “Drawing on the similarities between Pac-Man and an amoeba and efforts to model the human brain, this absorbing read shows that biologists and engineers have a lot to learn from working together.” —Discover magazine “Wetware will get the reader thinking.” —Science magazine",Science,280,1,1,en

"A History of Modern Computing, second edition",Paul E. Ceruzzi,MIT Press,2003-04-08,"From the first digital computer to the dot-com crash—a story of individuals, institutions, and the forces that led to a series of dramatic transformations. This engaging history covers modern computing from the development of the first electronic digital computer through the dot-com crash. The author concentrates on five key moments of transition: the transformation of the computer in the late 1940s from a specialized scientific instrument to a commercial product; the emergence of small systems in the late 1960s; the beginning of personal computing in the 1970s; the spread of networking after 1985; and, in a chapter written for this edition, the period 1995-2001. The new material focuses on the Microsoft antitrust suit, the rise and fall of the dot-coms, and the advent of open source software, particularly Linux. Within the chronological narrative, the book traces several overlapping threads: the evolution of the computer's internal design; the effect of economic trends and the Cold War; the long-term role of IBM as a player and as a target for upstart entrepreneurs; the growth of software from a hidden element to a major character in the story of computing; and the recurring issue of the place of information and computing in a democratic society.

Human-Computer Interaction,"Andrew Sears, Julie A. Jacko",CRC Press,2009-03-02,"Hailed on first publication as a compendium of foundational principles and cutting-edge research, The Human-Computer Interaction Handbook has become the gold standard reference in this field. While human-computer interaction may have emerged from within computing, significant contributions have come from a variety of fields including industrial engineering, psychology, education, and graphic design. No where is this more apparent then when designing solutions for users as diverse as children, older adults, and individuals with physical, cognitive, visual, or hearing impairments. Derived from select chapters in The Human-Computer Interaction Handbook, this volume emphasizes design for these groups and also discusses HCI in the context of specific domains including healthcare, games, and the aerospace industry.",Computers,286,N/A,0,en
From Mainframes to Smartphones,"Martin Campbell-Kelly, Daniel D. Garcia-Swartz",Harvard University Press,2015-06-08,"This compact history traces the computer industry from its origins in 1950s mainframes, through the establishment of standards beginning in 1965 and the introduction of personal computing in the 1980s. It concludes with the Internet’s explosive growth since 1995. Across these four periods, Martin Campbell-Kelly and Daniel Garcia-Swartz describe the steady trend toward miniaturization and explain its consequences for the bundles of interacting components that make up a computer system. With miniaturization, the price of computation fell and entry into the industry became less costly. Companies supplying different components learned to cooperate even as they competed with other businesses for market share. Simultaneously with miniaturization—and equally consequential—the core of the computer industry shifted from hardware to software and services. Companies that failed to adapt to this trend were left behind. Governments did not turn a blind eye to the activities of entrepreneurs. The U.S. government was the major customer for computers in the early years. Several European governments subsidized private corporations, and Japan fostered R&D in private firms while protecting its domestic market from foreign competition.

The original chapters provide authoritative commentaries and in-depth descriptions of research programs that will guide 21st century scholars, graduate students, and industry professionals. Human-Computer Interaction (or Human Factors) in MIS is concerned with the ways humans interact with information, technologies, and tasks, especially in business, managerial, organizational, and cultural contexts. It is distinctive in many ways when compared with HCI studies in other disciplines. The MIS perspective affords special importance to managerial and organizational contexts by focusing on analysis of tasks and outcomes at a level that considers organizational effectiveness. With the recent advancement of technologies and development of many sophisticated applications, human-centeredness in MIS has become more critical than ever before. This book focuses on the basics of HCI, with emphasis on concepts, issues, theories, and models that are related to understanding human tasks, and the interactions among humans, tasks, information, and technologies in organizational contexts in general.",Business & Economics,568,N/A,0,en

How Things Work,Charles F. Bowman,CRC Press,2021-08-25,"It’s axiomatic to state that people fear what they do not understand, and this is especially true when it comes to technology. However, despite their prevalence, computers remain shrouded in mystery, and many users feel apprehensive when interacting with them. Smartphones have only exacerbated the issue. Indeed, most users of these devices leverage only a small fraction of the power they hold in their hands. How Things Work: The Computer Science Edition is a roadmap for readers who want to overcome their technophobia and harness the full power of everyday technology. Beginning with the basics, the book demystifies the mysterious world of computer science, explains its fundamental concepts in simple terms, and answers the questions many users feel too intimidated to ask. By the end of the book, readers will understand how computers and smart devices function and, more important, how they can make these devices work for them. To complete the picture, the book also introduces readers to the darker side of modern technology: security and privacy concerns, identity theft, and threats from the Dark Web.",Computers,273,N/A,0,en

Preparing Pre-Service Teachers to Teach Computer Science,"Chrystalla Mouza, Aman Yadav, Anne Ottenbreit-Leftwich",N/A,2021,"""Computer science has emerged as a key driver of innovation in the 21st century. Preparing teachers to teach computer science, however, remains an enormous challenge as there are few highly qualified teachers who can teach computer science or integrate computer science content into K-12 curricula. To address this challenge, NSF established the CS10K program with the aim of preparing 10,000 teachers in 10,000 high schools teaching computer science curricula. While this effort is still under-way, there has not been a systematic attempt to capture the work done in this area. In order to prepare a generation of teachers who are capable of delivering computer science content to students, we must identify research-based examples, pedagogical strategies and policies that can facilitate changes in teacher knowledge and practices. The purpose of this project is to provide examples that could help guide the design and delivery of effective teacher preparation on the teaching of computer science concepts. This book identifies promising pathways, pedagogical strategies and policies that help pre-service and in-service teachers infuse computing ideas in their curricula as well as teach stand-alone computing courses. The book focuses on pedagogical practices for developing and assessing pre-service teacher knowledge of computer science, course design models for pre-service teachers, and discussion of policies that can support the teaching of computer science. The primary audience of the book will be students and faculty in educational technology, educational or cognitive psychology, learning theory, curriculum and instruction, computer science, instructional systems and learning sciences""--",Computer science,282,N/A,0,en

The Computer as Medium,Berit Holmqvist,Cambridge University Press,1993,"Many industrial training applications, educational applications, and of course information applications such as databases and hypermedia are all attempts to communicate, and yet we really don't know much about the computer as a communicative medium. Bringing together a collection of essays presenting such diverse theoretical approaches as general semiotics, linguistics, communication theory, literary and art criticism, sociology, and history, the editors set out to establish and elaborate the role of computer systems as a sign technology. The volume is divided into three main parts, each focused on a different field of semiotic inquiry. ""Computer-Based Signs"" discusses the special nature of signs produced by means of computers. ""The Rhetoric of Interactive Media"" deals with codes of aesthetics and composition for the new ""elastic"" medium of communication: interactive fiction and hypertext. ""Computers in Context"" analyzes computer technology in the larger cultural, historical, and organizational contexts. Scholars in computer science, cognitive science, organization theory, information and media science, semiotics, communication, and linguistics will find this book invaluable, and as current excitement about hypermedia and electronic books continues to grow, a broader audience including computer artists and literary critics will also find it a useful resource.",Computers,514,N/A,0,en
A Vulnerable System,Andrew J. Stewart,Cornell University Press,2021-09-15,"As threats to the security of information pervade the fabric of everyday life, A Vulnerable System describes how, even as the demand for information security increases, the needs of society are not being met. The result is that the confidentiality of our personal data, the integrity of our elections, and the stability of foreign relations between countries are increasingly at risk. Andrew J. Stewart convincingly shows that emergency software patches and new security products cannot provide the solution to threats such as computer hacking, viruses, software vulnerabilities, and electronic spying. Profound underlying structural problems must first be understood, confronted, and then addressed. A Vulnerable System delivers a long view of the history of information security, beginning with the creation of the first digital computers during the Cold War. From the key institutions of the so-called military industrial complex in the 1950s to Silicon Valley start-ups in the 2020s, the relentless pursuit of new technologies has come at great cost. The absence of knowledge regarding the history of information security has caused the lessons of the past to be forsaken for the novelty of the present, and has led us to be collectively unable to meet the needs of the current day. From the very beginning of the information age, claims of secure systems have been crushed by practical reality. The myriad risks to technology, Stewart reveals, cannot be addressed without first understanding how we arrived at this moment. A Vulnerable System is an enlightening and sobering history of a topic that affects crucial aspects of our lives.",Computers,310,N/A,0,en

Fundamentals of Wearable Computers and Augmented Reality,Woodrow Barfield,CRC Press,2017-07-26,"Data will not help you if you can't see it where you need it. Or can't collect it where you need it. Upon these principles, wearable technology was born. And although smart watches and fitness trackers have become almost ubiquitous, with in-body sensors on the horizon, the future applications of wearable computers hold so much more. A trusted reference for almost 15 years, Fundamentals of Wearable Computers and Augmented Reality goes beyond smart clothing to explore user interface design issues specific to wearable tech and areas in which it can be applied. Upon its initial publication, the first edition almost instantly became a trusted reference, setting the stage for the coming decade, in which the explosion in research and applications of wearable computers and augmented reality occurred. Written by expert researchers and teachers, each chapter in the second edition has been revised and updated to reflect advances in the field and provide fundamental knowledge on each topic, solidifying the book's reputation as a valuable technical resource as well as a textbook for augmented reality and ubiquitous computing courses. New Chapters in the Second Edition Explore: Haptics Visual displays Use of augmented reality for surgery and manufacturing Technical issues of image registration and tracking Augmenting the environment with wearable audio interfaces Use of augmented reality in preserving cultural heritage Human-computer interaction and augmented reality technology Spatialized sound and augmented reality Augmented reality and robotics Computational clothing From a technology perspective, much of what is happening now with wearables and augmented reality would not have been possible even five years ago. In the fourteen years since the first edition burst on the scene, the capabilities and applications of both technologies are orders of magnitude faster, smaller, and cheaper. Yet the book's overarching mission remains the same: to supply the fundamental information and basic knowledge about the design and use of wearable computers and augmented reality with the goal of enhancing people's lives.",Augmented reality,739,N/A,0,en
How Computers Work,Roger Young,How Computers Work,2009-04-17,"Computers are the most complex machines that have ever been created. This book will tell you how they work, and no technical knowledge is required. It explains in great detail the operation of a simple but functional computer. Although transistors are mentioned, relays are used in the example circuitry for simplicity. Did you ever wonder what a bit, a pixel, a latch, a word (of memory), a data bus, an address bus, a memory, a register, a processor, a timing diagram, a clock (of a processor), an instruction, or machine code is? Unlike most explanations of how computers work which are a lot of analogies or require a background in electrical engineering, this book will tell you precisely what each of them is and how each of them works without requiring any previous knowledge of computers, programming, or electronics. This book starts out very simple and gets more complex as it goes along, but everything is explained. The processor and memory are mainly covered.",Computers,153,N/A,0,en

The New Division of Labor,"Frank Levy, Richard J. Murnane",Princeton University Press,2012-11-26,"As the current recession ends, many workers will not be returning to the jobs they once held--those jobs are gone. In The New Division of Labor, Frank Levy and Richard Murnane show how computers are changing the employment landscape and how the right kinds of education can ease the transition to the new job market. The book tells stories of people at work--a high-end financial advisor, a customer service representative, a pair of successful chefs, a cardiologist, an automotive mechanic, the author Victor Hugo, floor traders in a London financial exchange. The authors merge these stories with insights from cognitive science, computer science, and economics to show how computers are enhancing productivity in many jobs even as they eliminate other jobs--both directly and by sending work offshore. At greatest risk are jobs that can be expressed in programmable rules--blue collar, clerical, and similar work that requires moderate skills and used to pay middle-class wages. The loss of these jobs leaves a growing division between those who can and cannot earn a good living in the computerized economy. Left unchecked, the division threatens the nation's democratic institutions. The nation's challenge is to recognize this division and to prepare the population for the high-wage/high-skilled jobs that are rapidly growing in number--jobs involving extensive problem solving and interpersonal communication. Using detailed examples--a second grade classroom, an IBM managerial training program, Cisco Networking Academies--the authors describe how these skills can be taught and how our adjustment to the computerized workplace can begin in earnest.",Business & Economics,187,N/A,0,en

The Computer Continuum,"Kurt Lauckner, Zenia Bahorski",Pearson Learning Solutions,2009-09-10,"In most of the sciences, introductory college courses focus on concepts rather than their practical application, with the latter reserved for more advanced study. An exception to this has been the fields of information systems and computer science, in which instruction has tended to focus directly on the tools of the trade, such as the technical aspects of word processing, spreadsheets, and databases. The philosophy of The Computer Continuum, however,is to concentrate on the concepts of information systems and computer science, such as data representation, operating systems, programming languages, and algorithms. While each chapter includes sections on software applications, and laboratory manuals are available to go with the text, the ""concepts approach"" of The Computer Continuum gives it a value that will last well beyond the current generation of computer tools. It builds a lasting foundation of fundamental concepts to prepare graduates for the future. Primarily for use in undergraduate introductory computer concepts courses offered by departments of information systems or computer science, The Computer Continuum is equally appealing to liberal arts majors and computer science majors. The text material has been tested on more than 10,000 college students in both large and small classes, and most of the concepts as presented can be expected to remain current for years to come.

Modeling and Analysis of Computer Communications Networks,Jeremiah F. Hayes,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-03-08,"In large measure the traditional concern of communications engineers has been the conveyance of voice signals. The most prominent example is the telephone network, in which the techniques used for transmission multiplex ing and switching have been designed for voice signals. However, one of the many effects of computers has been the growing volume of the sort of traffic that flows in networks composed of user terminals, processors, and peripherals. The characteristics of this data traffic and the associated perfor mance requirements are quite different from those of voice traffic. These differences, coupled with burgeoning digital technology, have engendered a whole new set of approaches to multiplexing and switching this traffic. The new techniques are the province of what has been loosely called computer communications networks. The subject of this book is the mathematical modeling and analysis of computer communications networks, that is to say, the multiplexing and switching techniques that have been developed for data traffic. The basis for many of the models that we shall consider is queueing theory, although a number of other disciplines are drawn on as well. The level at which this material is covered is that of a first-year graduate course. It is assumed that at the outset the student has had a good undergraduate course in probability and random processes of the sort that are more and more common among electrical engineering and computer science departments.",Computers,407,N/A,0,en

Rainbows End,Vernor Vinge,Tor Books,2007-04-03,"Four time Hugo Award winner Vernor Vinge has taken readers to the depths of space and into the far future in his bestselling novels A Fire Upon the Deep and A Deepness in the Sky. Now, he has written a science-fiction thriller set in a place and time as exciting and strange as any far-future world: San Diego, California, 2025. Robert Gu is a recovering Alzheimer's patient. The world that he remembers was much as we know it today. Now, as he regains his faculties through a cure developed during the years of his near-fatal decline, he discovers that the world has changed and so has his place in it. He was a world-renowned poet. Now he is seventy-five years old, though by a medical miracle he looks much younger, and he's starting over, for the first time unsure of his poetic gifts. Living with his son's family, he has no choice but to learn how to cope with a new information age in which the virtual and the real are a seamless continuum, layers of reality built on digital views seen by a single person or millions, depending on your choice. But the consensus reality of the digital world is available only if, like his thirteen-year-old granddaughter Miri, you know how to wear your wireless access—through nodes designed into smart clothes—and to see the digital context—through smart contact lenses. With knowledge comes risk. When Robert begins to re-train at Fairmont High, learning with other older people what is second nature to Miri and other teens at school, he unwittingly becomes part of a wide-ranging conspiracy to use technology as a tool for world domination. In a world where every computer chip has Homeland Security built-in, this conspiracy is something that baffles even the most sophisticated security analysts, including Robert's son and daughter-in law, two top people in the U.S. military. And even Miri, in her attempts to protect her grandfather, may be entangled in the plot. As Robert becomes more deeply involved in conspiracy, he is shocked to learn of a radical change planned for the UCSD Geisel Library; all the books there, and worldwide, would cease to physically exist. He and his fellow re-trainees feel compelled to join protests against the change. With forces around the world converging on San Diego, both the conspiracy and the protest climax in a spectacular moment as unique and satisfying as it is unexpected. This is science fiction at its very best, by a master storyteller at his peak.

The main impetus for the workshop came from the Graphics and Interaction in ESPRIT Technical Interest Group of the European Community ESPRIT Programme. The Graphics and Interac tion in ESPRIT Technical Interest Group arose from a meeting of researchers held in Brussels in May 1988, which identified a number of technical areas of common interest across a significant number of ESPRIT I and ESPRIT II projects. It was recognized that there was a need to share information on such activities between projects, to disseminate results from the projects to the world at large, and for projects to be aware of related activities elsewhere in the world. The need for a Technical Interest Group was confirmed at a meeting held during ESPRIT Technical Week in November 1989, attended by over 50 representatives from ESPRIT projects and the Commission of the European Communities.

Graphics Systems,Rumen D. Andreev,N/A,1993,"Professional programmers, engineers, students and researchers concerned with the current state and future development of computer graphics systems should find this publication an essential reference point and a comprehensive implementation guide. The book is characterized by the clarification and concrete determination of separate groups of computer graphics problems, which can be studied and developed relatively independently. The presentation of issues is based on the logic of the graphics systems realization. This logic reflects the work of the designer and the implementor in its movement through the following consecutive steps: design of the graphics system; determining of the graphics system architecture and methods for its realization; realization of the graphics data processing through the development of corresponding algorithms. The primary subject areas considered include: presentation of a model and functionality of 2D and 3D graphics systems; architectures of 2D and 3D graphics systems; possible methods for a graphics system realization; algorithms for graphics data processings; systemized presentation of all problems relevant to the user interface to reflect its influence on the graphics system.",Computers,444,N/A,0,en

Towards Practical Brain-Computer Interfaces,"Brendan Z. Allison, Stephen Dunne, Robert Leeb, José Del R. Millán, Anton Nijholt",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-08-21,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are devices that enable people to communicate via thought alone. Brain signals can be directly translated into messages or commands. Until recently, these devices were used primarily to help people who could not move. However, BCIs are now becoming practical tools for a wide variety of people, in many different situations. What will BCIs in the future be like? Who will use them, and why? This book, written by many of the top BCI researchers and developers, reviews the latest progress in the different components of BCIs. Chapters also discuss practical issues in an emerging BCI enabled community.

The Impact of Computer Supported Technologies on Information Systems Development,"Kenneth E. Kendall, Kalle Lyytinen, Janice I. DeGross",North Holland,1992,"A major research stream in computing focuses on building computing technologies which ease the specification, design, implementation and management of information systems. Any computer solution that frees the developer to interact directly with users or the physical configuration of the computing technology, or improves any feature of the act of delivering a computing application, can be called a support technology. In this volume, the focus is on the impacts of computer assisted software engineering tools (CASE), tools for group cooperation and collaboration (also called group decision support system, or GDSS), and other computer supported technologies. The lead paper, by Lyytinen and Kendall, provides a framework for the volume, showing how the contributions fall into groups revealing the progress of research in each individual area. In addition to contributed papers, three authors were invited to send lively, controversial papers.

How Computers Really Work,Matthew Justice,No Starch Press,2020-12-17,"An approachable, hands-on guide to understanding how computers work, from low-level circuits to high-level code. How Computers Really Work is a hands-on guide to the computing ecosystem: everything from circuits to memory and clock signals, machine code, programming languages, operating systems, and the internet. But you won't just read about these concepts, you'll test your knowledge with exercises, and practice what you learn with 41 optional hands-on projects. Build digital circuits, craft a guessing game, convert decimal numbers to binary, examine virtual memory usage, run your own web server, and more. Explore concepts like how to: Think like a software engineer as you use data to describe a real world concept Use Ohm's and Kirchhoff's laws to analyze an electrical circuit Think like a computer as you practice binary addition and execute a program in your mind, step-by-step The book's projects will have you translate your learning into action, as you: Learn how to use a multimeter to measure resistance, current, and voltage Build a half adder to see how logical operations in hardware can be combined to perform useful functions Write a program in assembly language, then examine the resulting machine code Learn to use a debugger, disassemble code, and hack a program to change its behavior without changing the source code Use a port scanner to see which internet ports your computer has open Run your own server and get a solid crash course on how the web works And since a picture is worth a thousand bytes, chapters are filled with detailed diagrams and illustrations to help clarify technical complexities. Requirements: The projects require a variety of hardware - electronics projects need a breadboard, power supply, and various circuit components; software projects are performed on a Raspberry Pi. Appendix B contains a complete list. Even if you skip the projects, the book's major concepts are clearly presented in the main text.",Computers,394,N/A,0,en

The Computer Engineering Handbook,Vojin G. Oklobdzija,CRC Press,2001-12-26,"There is arguably no field in greater need of a comprehensive handbook than computer engineering. The unparalleled rate of technological advancement, the explosion of computer applications, and the now-in-progress migration to a wireless world have made it difficult for engineers to keep up with all the developments in specialties outside their own. References published only a few years ago are now sorely out of date. The Computer Engineering Handbook changes all of that. Under the leadership of Vojin Oklobdzija and a stellar editorial board, some of the industry's foremost experts have joined forces to create what promises to be the definitive resource for computer design and engineering. Instead of focusing on basic, introductory material, it forms a comprehensive, state-of-the-art review of the field's most recent achievements, outstanding issues, and future directions. The world of computer engineering is vast and evolving so rapidly that what is cutting-edge today may be obsolete in a few months.

The Dawn of Software Engineering,Edgar G. Daylight,N/A,2012,"Contrary to what many believe, Alan Turing is not the father of the all-purpose computer. Engineers were, independently of Turing, already building such machines during World War II. Turing's influence was felt more in programming after his death than in computer building during his lifetime. The first person to receive a Turing award was a programmer, not a computer builder. Logicians and programmers recast Turing's notions of machine and universality. Gradually, these recast notions helped programmers to see the bigger picture of what they were accomplishing. Later, problems unsolvable with a computer influenced experienced programmers, including Edsger W. Dijkstra. Dijkstra's pioneering work shows that both unsolvability and aesthetics have practical relevance in software engineering. But to what extent did Dijkstra and others depend on Turing's accomplishments? This book presents a revealing synthesis for the modern software engineer and, by doing so, deromanticizes Turing's role in the history of computing.",Computers,239,N/A,0,en

It presents a wide range of topics for a thorough understanding of the factors that affect the efficiency of secrecy, authentication, and digital signature schema. Most importantly, readers gain hands-on experience in cryptanalysis and learn how to create effective cryptographic systems. The author contributed to the design and analysis of the Data Encryption Standard (DES), a widely used symmetric-key encryption algorithm. His recommendations are based on firsthand experience of what does and does not work. Thorough in its coverage, the book starts with a discussion of the history of cryptography, including a description of the basic encryption systems and many of the cipher systems used in the twentieth century. The author then discusses the theory of symmetric- and public-key cryptography. Readers not only discover what cryptography can do to protect sensitive data, but also learn the practical limitations of the technology. The book ends with two chapters that explore a wide range of cryptography applications. Three basic types of chapters are featured to facilitate learning: Chapters that develop technical skills Chapters that describe a cryptosystem and present a method of analysis Chapters that describe a cryptosystem, present a method of analysis, and provide problems to test your grasp of the material and your ability to implement practical solutions With consumers becoming increasingly wary of identity theft and companies struggling to develop safe, secure systems, this book is essential reading for professionals in e-commerce and information technology.

Long before video games became a multi-billion-dollar industry, a small group of hackers created the Apple II, a PC that contained less memory than the average size of a Microsoft Word document and turned heads by outputting graphics in color. Some users tapped its resources to design productivity software. Others devised some of the most influential games of all time. From the perils along the Oregon Trail and the exploits of Carmen Sandiego to the shadowy dungeons of Wizardry and Prince of Persia s trap-filled labyrinth, Break Out recounts the making of some of the Apple II s most iconic games, illustrates how they informed the games we play today, and tells the stories of the pioneers who made them.""--Page 4 of cover.",Apple II (Computer),255,N/A,0,en

Living with Computers,James W. Cortada,Springer Nature,2020-03-11,"The computing technology on which we are now so dependent has risen to its position of ascendency so rapidly that few of us have had the opportunity to take a step back and wonder where we are headed. This book urges us to do so. Taking a big-picture perspective on digital technology, Living with Computers leads the reader on a whistle-stop tour of the history of information and information technology. This journey culminates in a deep exploration into the meaning and role of computers in our lives, and what this experience might possibly mean for the future of human society – and the very existence of humanity itself. In the face of the transformative power of computing, this book provokes us to ask big questions. If computers become integrated into our bodies, merging with the information processing of our very DNA, will computing help to shape the evolution of biological life? If artificial intelligence advances beyond the abilities of the human brain, will this overturn our anthropocentrism and lead to a new view of reality? Will we control the computers of the future, or will they control us? These questions can be discomforting, yet they cannot be ignored. This book argues that it is time to reshape our definition of our species in the context of our interaction with computing. For although such science-fiction scenarios are not likely to happen any time soon – and may, in fact, never happen – it is nevertheless vital to consider these issues now if we wish to have any influence over whatever is to come. So, humans, let’s confront our possible destiny! James W. Cortada is a Senior Research Fellow at the Charles Babbage Institute at the University of Minnesota. He holds a Ph.D. in modern history and worked at IBM in various positions for 38 years, including in IBM’s management research institute, The IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV).

Home computers - unheard of two decades ago - now play an intimate role as personal possessions in many people's lives. For some, computer games may be vital to winding-down after a busy day, while for others the home computer represents only work or is a means through which to socialize in cyberspace. Powerfully symbolic of both future and present trends, computers are increasingly seen as essential home purchases. This book is the first sustained examination of the revealing role computers play in our domestic lives. Do computers cause or help to resolve arguments? What role does gender play in negotiating their use? Who spends the most time with the computer? How does the importance of home computers change as we move from childhood through careers to retirement? Drawing upon topical theories from material culture, technology and consumption studies, Lally traces the social life of these machines and provides unique insights into the many different ways in which they are transformed into highly personal possessions.

What Computing Is All About,Jan L.A.van de Snepscheut,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"I have always been fascinated with engineering. From Roman bridges and jumbo jets to steam engines and CD players, it is the privilege of the en gineer to combine scientific insights and technical possibilities into useful and elegant products. Engineers get a great deal of satisfaction from the usefulness and beauty of their designs. Some of these designs have a major impact on our daily lives, others enable further scientific insights or shift limits of technology. The successful engineer is familiar with the scientific basis of the field and the technology of the components, and has an eye for the envisioned applications. For example, to build an airplane, one had better understand the physics of motion, the structural properties of alu minum, and the size of passengers. And the physics of motion requires a mastery of mathematics, in particular calculus. Computers are a marvel of modern engineering. They come in a wide variety and their range of applications seems endless. One of the charac teristics that makes computers different from other engineering products is their programmability. Dishwashers have some limited programming capa is not the key part of the device. Their essential part is some bility, but it enclosed space where the dishes are stored and flushed with hot water.

Cooperating Heterogeneous Systems,David G. Schwartz,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Cooperating Heterogeneous Systems provides an in-depth introduction to the issues and techniques surrounding the integration and control of diverse and independent software components. Organizations increasingly rely upon diverse computer systems to perform a variety of knowledge-based tasks. This presents technical issues of interoperability and integration, as well as philosophical issues of how cooperation and interaction between computational entities is to be realized. Cooperating systems are systems that work together towards a common end. The concepts of cooperation must be realized in technically sound system architectures, having a uniform meta-layer between knowledge sources and the rest of the system. The layer consists of a family of interpreters, one for each knowledge source, and meta-knowledge. A system architecture to integrate and control diverse knowledge sources is presented. The architecture is based on the meta-level properties of the logic programming language Prolog. An implementation of the architecture is described, a Framework for Logic Programming Systems with Distributed Execution (FLiPSiDE). Knowledge-based systems play an important role in any up-to-date arsenal of decision support tools. The tremendous growth of computer communications infrastructure has made distributed computing a viable option, and often a necessity in geographically distributed organizations. It has become clear that to take knowledge-based systems to their next useful level, it is necessary to get independent knowledge-based systems to work together, much as we put together ad hoc work groups in our organizations to tackle complex problems. The book is for scientists and software engineers who have experience in knowledge-based systems and/or logic programming and seek a hands-on introduction to cooperating systems. Researchers investigating autonomous agents, distributed computation, and cooperating systems will find fresh ideas and new perspectives on well-established approaches to control, organization, and cooperation.",Computers,216,N/A,0,en

Principles of Computer System Design,"Jerome H. Saltzer, M. Frans Kaashoek",Morgan Kaufmann,2009-05-21,"Principles of Computer System Design is the first textbook to take a principles-based approach to the computer system design. It identifies, examines, and illustrates fundamental concepts in computer system design that are common across operating systems, networks, database systems, distributed systems, programming languages, software engineering, security, fault tolerance, and architecture.Through carefully analyzed case studies from each of these disciplines, it demonstrates how to apply these concepts to tackle practical system design problems. To support the focus on design, the text identifies and explains abstractions that have proven successful in practice such as remote procedure call, client/service organization, file systems, data integrity, consistency, and authenticated messages. Most computer systems are built using a handful of such abstractions. The text describes how these abstractions are implemented, demonstrates how they are used in different systems, and prepares the reader to apply them in future designs.The book is recommended for junior and senior undergraduate students in Operating Systems, Distributed Systems, Distributed Operating Systems and/or Computer Systems Design courses; and professional computer systems designers. - Concepts of computer system design guided by fundamental principles - Cross-cutting approach that identifies abstractions common to networking, operating systems, transaction systems, distributed systems, architecture, and software engineering - Case studies that make the abstractions real: naming (DNS and the URL); file systems (the UNIX file system); clients and services (NFS); virtualization (virtual machines); scheduling (disk arms); security (TLS) - Numerous pseudocode fragments that provide concrete examples of abstract concepts - Extensive support.

Histories of Computing,Michael Sean Mahoney,Harvard University Press,2011-06-20,"Computer technology is pervasive in the modern world, its role ever more important as it becomes embedded in a myriad of physical systems and disciplinary ways of thinking. The late Michael Sean Mahoney was a pioneer scholar of the history of computing, one of the first established historians of science to take seriously the challenges and opportunities posed by information technology to our understanding of the twentieth century. MahoneyÕs work ranged widely, from logic and the theory of computation to the development of software and applications as craft-work. But it was always informed by a unique perspective derived from his distinguished work on the history of medieval mathematics and experimental practice during the Scientific Revolution. His writings offered a new angle on very recent events and ideas and bridged the gaps between academic historians and computer scientists. Indeed, he came to believe that the field was irreducibly pluralistic and that there could be only histories of computing. In this collection, Thomas Haigh presents thirteen of MahoneyÕs essays and papers organized across three categories: historiography, software engineering, and theoretical computer science. His introduction surveys MahoneyÕs work to trace the development of key themes, illuminate connections among different areas of his research, and put his contributions into context. The volume also includes an essay on Mahoney by his former students Jed Z. Buchwald and D. Graham Burnett. The result is a landmark work, of interest to computer professionals as well as historians of technology and science.",Computers,261,N/A,0,en

What Did Jesus Drive,Jason H. Vines,Waldorf Publishing,2014-11-01,"Ever wonder what it would be like to work Public Relations for Ford, or General Motors? Imagine a thousand cameras flashing in your eyes through a forest of microphones, everyone millions of dollars and world-wide headlines riding on your every word as you try to navigate your company through crisis, time and time again. It’s not for the faint of heart… But it does make for one entertaining memoir! Welcome to the life of Jason Vines, the man who preserved the good name of Ford/Firestone, Jeep, General Motors, Nissan, Chevy, and other mega-companies throughout one catastrophe after the next. In Vines’ candid first book, “What Did Jesus Drive”, you’ll hear about all the trials, tribulations, hilarity, and heartbreak of being a master PR consultant – straight from the man with the silver tongue himself! Outrageous as it is insightful, shocking as it is refreshing; “What Did Jesus Drive” will have you laughing yourself hoarse all the while teaching you how to keep your cool with IT hits the fan! This isn’t the PR class you took in Business School! And relax; this is not a book about Jesus. (Although he does appear in two chapters: first as a Hispanic grandfather from Waterford, Michigan, and later as the real Prince of Peace.) No, this book is about a life in the public relations blast furnace of the automotive industry; being the only man on the front line. If you’re a company owner, CEO, PR professional, the lessons and stories in this book are INVALUABLE for you and everyone in your PR department! Even if you’re just somebody who enjoys a look into the wild ride in the world of corporate America, this book is for you. Get your copy of “What Did Jesus Drive” now, and let the games begin! **Reviews** ""Jason's story telling is his honest account of time well spent in a career documenting numerous pivotal events we all want to hear about."" – Lee Iacocca ""Get me Jason Vines! How I wish as the candidates I worked for screamed, screwed, or gaffed their way into crisis, I had called on Jason Vines. This is more than a corporate PR book - it's a masters' class, no holds barred, white knuckle ride of insights and wisdom for anyone whose job it is to communicate for a living.” – ?????? “Jason Vines in raw and real story telling of his own journey explains to every politician, celebrity, corporate communications professional and government agency that has ever faced trouble (yes I am talking about you NFL - read this one Goodell!) why we have such a hard time telling the truth, why that's the whole frickin' problem and what we can do about it."" – Joe Trippi, Democratic Campaign and Media Consultant. ""Jason Vines lived The Hurt Locker, defusing one public relations I.E.D. after another. To think some of the largest corporations we can name have been this close to pure PR disaster, and yet were saved by the insight Jason earned from decades of corporate cage fights, is truly amazing."" – Dutch Mandel, AutoWeek Publisher ""I always knew I could count on Jason for an unbiased and honest opinion."" – Dr. Ricardo Martinez, MD, FACEP and former NHTSA Administrator",Biography & Autobiography,401,N/A,0,en

Computers and Cognition: Why Minds are not Machines,J.H. Fetzer,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-03-07,"An important collection of studies providing a fresh and original perspective on the nature of mind, including thoughtful and detailed arguments that explain why the prevailing paradigm - the computational conception of language and mentality - can no longer be sustained. An alternative approach is advanced, inspired by the work of Charles S. Peirce, according to which minds are sign-using (or `semiotic') systems, which in turn generates distinctions between different kinds of minds and overcomes problems that burden more familiar alternatives. Unlike conceptions of minds as machines, this novel approach has obvious evolutionary implications, where differences in semiotic abilities tend to distinguish the species. From this point of view, the scope and limits of computer and AI systems can be more adequately appraised and alternative accounts of consciousness and cognition can be more thoroughly criticised. Readership: Intermediate and advanced students of computer science, AI, cognitive science, and all students of the philosophy of the mind.",Computers,334,N/A,0,en

Cyber Weaponry,Henry Prunckun,Springer,2018-04-04,"There is little doubt that cyber-space has become the battle space for confrontations. However, to conduct cyber operations, a new armory of weapons needs to be employed. No matter how many, or how sophisticated an aggressor’s kinetic weapons are, they are useless in cyber-space. This book looks at the milieu of the cyber weapons industry, as well as the belligerents who use cyber weapons. It discusses what distinguishes these hardware devices and software programs from computer science in general. It does this by focusing on specific aspects of the topic—contextual issues of why cyber-space is the new battleground, defensive cyber weapons, offensive cyber weapons, dual-use weapons, and the implications these weapons systems have for practice. Contrary to popular opinion, the use of cyber weapons is not limited to nation states; though this is where the bulk of news reporting focuses. The reality is that there isn’t a sector of the political-economy that is immune to cyber skirmishes. So, this book looks at cyber weapons not only by national security agencies and the military, but also by law enforcement, and the business sector—the latter includes administrations termed non-government organisations (NGOs). This book offers study material suitable for a wide-ranging audience—students, professionals, researchers, policy officers, and ICT specialists.",Social Science,207,N/A,0,en

Learning with Computers,"H. Albert Napier, Philip Judd, Jack Hoggatt",Cengage Learning,2005-04,"The new LEARNING WITH COMPUTERS LEVEL 7 Green extends the original LEARNING WITH COMPUTERS LEVELS K-5 into middle school along with the new LEVEL 6 Blue and LEVEL 8 Orange. The LEARNING WITH COMPUTERS series for middle school students delivers a strong foundation in keyboarding and computer applications. In this new project based text, students are introduced to the Explorers Club where three young members of the club - Luis, Ray, and Julie - guide students on virtual explorations. Along the way, each student keeps a personal journal about their explorations. The text offers multiple opportunities to reinforce and maintain basic keyboarding, word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, database, graphics, and Internet skills. Students are also introduced to new grade-level appropriate computer skills based on the National Educational Technology Standards (NETS). Additionally, the text emphasizes research, reading, and writing activities relevant to social studies, science, math, and language arts curriculum. The text for use with Windows applications, is divided into 4 units; Word Processing, Spreadsheets, Presentations (Graphics, Multimedia, and Integration) and Databases. Each unit contains multiple projects for a total of 18 projects per text, plus an introductory project. Each project focuses on a group of grade-level appropriate objectives for particular computer applications. Several hands-on activities within each project are designed around these objectives. Additionally, students use multiple application tools such as keyboard shortcuts, shortcut menus, toolbars, and the menu bar to perform tasks. This one-semester text can be used as a stand alone or in conjunction with South-Western's MicroType keyboarding software. MicroType is an engaging, easy-to-use program that teaches new-key learning and skill building. Features include 3-D animations, videos, and fun interactive games.",Computer literacy,0,N/A,0,en

The Computer from Pascal to von Neumann,Herman H. Goldstine,Princeton University Press,2008-09-02,"In 1942, Lt. Herman H. Goldstine, a former mathematics professor, was stationed at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. It was there that he assisted in the creation of the ENIAC, the first electronic digital computer. The ENIAC was operational in 1945, but plans for a new computer were already underway. The principal source of ideas for the new computer was John von Neumann, who became Goldstine's chief collaborator. Together they developed EDVAC, successor to ENIAC. After World War II, at the Institute for Advanced Study, they built what was to become the prototype of the present-day computer. Herman Goldstine writes as both historian and scientist in this first examination of the development of computing machinery, from the seventeenth century through the early 1950s. His personal involvement lends a special authenticity to his narrative, as he sprinkles anecdotes and stories liberally through his text.",Science,399,N/A,0,en

Multiple View Geometry in Computer Vision,"Richard Hartley, Andrew Zisserman",Cambridge University Press,2004-03-25,"A basic problem in computer vision is to understand the structure of a real world scene given several images of it. Techniques for solving this problem are taken from projective geometry and photogrammetry. Here, the authors cover the geometric principles and their algebraic representation in terms of camera projection matrices, the fundamental matrix and the trifocal tensor. The theory and methods of computation of these entities are discussed with real examples, as is their use in the reconstruction of scenes from multiple images. The new edition features an extended introduction covering the key ideas in the book (which itself has been updated with additional examples and appendices) and significant new results which have appeared since the first edition. Comprehensive background material is provided, so readers familiar with linear algebra and basic numerical methods can understand the projective geometry and estimation algorithms presented, and implement the algorithms directly from the book.",Computers,676,N/A,0,en

Oversold and Underused,Larry CUBAN,Harvard University Press,2009-06-30,"Impelled by a demand for increasing American strength in the new global economy, many educators, public officials, business leaders, and parents argue that school computers and Internet access will improve academic learning and prepare students for an information-based workplace. But just how valid is this argument? In Oversold and Underused, one of the most respected voices in American education argues that when teachers are not given a say in how the technology might reshape schools, computers are merely souped-up typewriters and classrooms continue to run much as they did a generation ago. In his studies of early childhood, high school, and university classrooms in Silicon Valley, Larry Cuban found that students and teachers use the new technologies far less in the classroom than they do at home, and that teachers who use computers for instruction do so infrequently and unimaginatively. Cuban points out that historical and organizational economic contexts influence how teachers use technical innovations. Computers can be useful when teachers sufficiently understand the technology themselves, believe it will enhance learning, and have the power to shape their own curricula. But these conditions can't be met without a broader and deeper commitment to public education beyond preparing workers. More attention, Cuban says, needs to be paid to the civic and social goals of schooling, goals that make the question of how many computers are in classrooms trivial.",Education,258,2,1,en

Computational Thinking Education in K-12,"Siu-Cheung Kong, Harold Abelson",MIT Press,2022-05-03,"A guide to computational thinking education, with a focus on artificial intelligence literacy and the integration of computing and physical objects. Computing has become an essential part of today’s primary and secondary school curricula. In recent years, K–12 computer education has shifted from computer science itself to the broader perspective of computational thinking (CT), which is less about technology than a way of thinking and solving problems—“a fundamental skill for everyone, not just computer scientists,” in the words of Jeanette Wing, author of a foundational article on CT. This volume introduces a variety of approaches to CT in K–12 education, offering a wide range of international perspectives that focus on artificial intelligence (AI) literacy and the integration of computing and physical objects. The book first offers an overview of CT and its importance in K–12 education, covering such topics as the rationale for teaching CT; programming as a general problem-solving skill; and the “phenomenon-based learning” approach. It then addresses the educational implications of the explosion in AI research, discussing, among other things, the importance of teaching children to be conscientious designers and consumers of AI. Finally, the book examines the increasing influence of physical devices in CT education, considering the learning opportunities offered by robotics.

Computational Physics,"Rubin H. Landau, Manuel J. Páez, Cristian C. Bordeianu",John Wiley & Sons,2015-09-08,"The use of computation and simulation has become an essential part of the scientific process. Being able to transform a theory into an algorithm requires significant theoretical insight, detailed physical and mathematical understanding, and a working level of competency in programming. This upper-division text provides an unusually broad survey of the topics of modern computational physics from a multidisciplinary, computational science point of view. Its philosophy is rooted in learning by doing (assisted by many model programs), with new scientific materials as well as with the Python programming language. Python has become very popular, particularly for physics education and large scientific projects. It is probably the easiest programming language to learn for beginners, yet is also used for mainstream scientific computing, and has packages for excellent graphics and even symbolic manipulations. The text is designed for an upper-level undergraduate or beginning graduate course and provides the reader with the essential knowledge to understand computational tools and mathematical methods well enough to be successful. As part of the teaching of using computers to solve scientific problems, the reader is encouraged to work through a sample problem stated at the beginning of each chapter or unit, which involves studying the text, writing, debugging and running programs, visualizing the results, and the expressing in words what has been done and what can be concluded. Then there are exercises and problems at the end of each chapter for the reader to work on their own (with model programs given for that purpose).",Science,647,N/A,0,en

Great Principles of Computing,"Peter J. Denning, Craig H. Martell",National Geographic Books,2015-01-16,"A new framework for understanding computing: a coherent set of principles spanning technologies, domains, algorithms, architectures, and designs. Computing is usually viewed as a technology field that advances at the breakneck speed of Moore's Law. If we turn away even for a moment, we might miss a game-changing technological breakthrough or an earthshaking theoretical development. This book takes a different perspective, presenting computing as a science governed by fundamental principles that span all technologies. Computer science is a science of information processes. We need a new language to describe the science, and in this book Peter Denning and Craig Martell offer the great principles framework as just such a language. This is a book about the whole of computing—its algorithms, architectures, and designs. Denning and Martell divide the great principles of computing into six categories: communication, computation, coordination, recollection, evaluation, and design. They begin with an introduction to computing, its history, its many interactions with other fields, its domains of practice, and the structure of the great principles framework. They go on to examine the great principles in different areas: information, machines, programming, computation, memory, parallelism, queueing, and design. Finally, they apply the great principles to networking, the Internet in particular. Great Principles of Computing will be essential reading for professionals in science and engineering fields with a “computational” branch, for practitioners in computing who want overviews of less familiar areas of computer science, and for non-computer science majors who want an accessible entry way to the field.",Computers,0,N/A,0,en

Howard Aiken,I. Bernard Cohen,MIT Press,2000,"Biography of Howard Aiken, a major figure of the early digital era, by a major historian of science who was also a colleague of Aiken's at Harvard. Howard Hathaway Aiken (1900-1973) was a major figure of the early digital era. He is best known for his first machine, the IBM Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator or Harvard Mark I, conceived in 1937 and put into operation in 1944. But he also made significant contributions to the development of applications for the new machines and to the creation of a university curriculum for computer science. This biography of Aiken, by a major historian of science who was also a colleague of Aiken's at Harvard, offers a clear and often entertaining introduction to Aiken and his times. Aiken's Mark I was the most intensely used of the early large-scale, general-purpose automatic digital computers, and it had a significant impact on the machines that followed. Aiken also proselytized for the computer among scientists, scholars, and businesspeople and explored novel applications in data processing, automatic billing, and production control. But his most lasting contribution may have been the students who received degrees under him and then took prominent positions in academia and industry. I.

Chance Encounters: Probability in Education,"R. Kapadia, M. Borovcnik",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This book has been written to fIll a substantial gap in the current literature in mathemat ical education. Throughout the world, school mathematical curricula have incorporated probability and statistics as new topics. There have been many research papers written on specifIc aspects of teaching, presenting novel and unusual approaches to introducing ideas in the classroom; however, there has been no book giving an overview. Here we have decided to focus on probability, making reference to inferential statistics where appropriate; we have deliberately avoided descriptive statistics as it is a separate area and would have made ideas less coherent and the book excessively long. A general lead has been taken from the fIrst book in this series written by the man who, probably more than everyone else, has established mathematical education as an aca demic discipline. However, in his exposition of didactical phenomenology, Freudenthal does not analyze probability. Thus, in this book, we show how probability is able to organize the world of chance and idealized chance phenomena based on its development and applications. In preparing these chapters we and our co-authors have reflected on our own acquisition of probabilistic ideas, analyzed textbooks, and observed and reflect ed upon the learning processes involved when children and adults struggle to acquire the relevant concepts.",Education,324,N/A,0,en

End-User Development,"Volkmar Pipek, Mary-Beth Rosson, Volker Wulf",Springer,2009-02-24,"Work practices and organizational processes vary widely and evolve constantly. The technological infrastructure has to follow, allowing or even supporting these changes. Traditional approaches to software engineering reach their limits whenever the full spectrum of user requirements cannot be anticipated or the frequency of changes makes software reengineering cycles too clumsy to address all the needs of a specific field of application. Moreover, the increasing importance of ‘infrastructural’ aspects, particularly the mutual dependencies between technologies, usages, and domain competencies, calls for a differentiation of roles beyond the classical user–designer dichotomy. End user development (EUD) addresses these issues by offering lightweight, use-time support which allows users to configure, adapt, and evolve their software by themselves. EUD is understood as a set of methods, techniques, and tools that allow users of software systems who are acting as non-professional software developers to 1 create, modify, or extend a software artifact. While programming activities by non-professional actors are an essential focus, EUD also investigates related activities such as collective understanding and sense-making of use problems and solutions, the interaction among end users with regard to the introduction and diffusion of new configurations, or delegation patterns that may also partly involve professional designers.",Computers,291,N/A,0,en
Quantum Computing,"Eleanor G. Rieffel, Wolfgang H.

The combination of two of the twentieth century's most influential and revolutionary scientific theories, information theory and quantum mechanics, gave rise to a radically new view of computing and information. Quantum information processing explores the implications of using quantum mechanics instead of classical mechanics to model information and its processing. Quantum computing is not about changing the physical substrate on which computation is done from classical to quantum but about changing the notion of computation itself, at the most basic level. The fundamental unit of computation is no longer the bit but the quantum bit or qubit. This comprehensive introduction to the field offers a thorough exposition of quantum computing and the underlying concepts of quantum physics, explaining all the relevant mathematics and offering numerous examples.

i never knew what time it was,David Antin,Univ of California Press,2005-04-25,"In this series of intricately related texts, internationally known poet, critic, and performance artist David Antin explores the experience of time—how it's felt, remembered, and recounted. These free-form talk pieces—sometimes called talk poems or simply talks—began as improvisations at museums, universities, and poetry centers where Antin was invited to come and think out loud. Serious and playful, they move rapidly from keen analysis to powerful storytelling to passages of pure comedy, as they range kaleidoscopically across Antin's experiences: in the New York City of his childhood and youth, the Eastern Europe of family and friends, and the New York and Southern California of his art and literary career. The author's analysis and abrasive comedy have been described as a mix of Lenny Bruce and Ludwig Wittgenstein, his commitment to verbal invention and narrative as a fusion of Mark Twain and Gertrude Stein. Taken together, these pieces provide a rich oral history of and critical context for the evolution of the California art scene from the 1960s onward.",Poetry,190,N/A,0,en

The other half consists of the ways that cultural forces have transformed photography into a constellation of practices more diverse than any other mode of representation. Photographers can tell a more in-depth story through a photo like Dorothea Lange's ""Migrant Mother than a journalist ever could with the written word alone. Major themes and practitioners: Over 25 entries, many with supporting illustrations, examine the figures, trends, and ideas that have contributed most heavily to the history and current state of photography. Contemporary issues: The issues influencing photography today are more complex than at any other time in its history. Questions of ethics, desire, perception, digitization, and commercialization all vie for attention. Hear what the experts have to say about crucial issues such as whether or not the images we take today will last the test of time, and if so, how?

There's Nothing in This Book That I Meant to Say,Paula Poundstone,Crown,2022-04-05,"Part memoir, part monologue, with a dash of startling honesty, There’s Nothing in This Book That I Meant to Say features biographies of legendary historical figures from which Paula Poundstone can’t help digressing to tell her own story. Mining gold from the lives of Abraham Lincoln, Helen Keller, Joan of Arc, and Beethoven, among others, the eccentric and utterly inimitable mind of Paula Poundstone dissects, observes, and comments on the successes and failures of her own life with surprising candor and spot-on comedic timing in this unique laugh-out-loud book. If you like Paula Poundstone’s ironic and blindingly intelligent humor, you’ll love this wryly observant, funny, and touching book. Paula Poundstone on . . . The sources of her self-esteem: “A couple of years ago I was reunited with a guy I knew in the fifth grade. He said, “All the other fifth-grade guys liked the pretty girls, but I liked you.” It’s hard to know if a guy is sincere when he lays it on that thick. The battle between fatigue and informed citizenship: I play a videotape of The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer every night, but sometimes I only get as far as the theme song (da da-da-da da-ah) before I fall asleep. Sometimes as soon as Margaret Warner says whether or not Jim Lehrer is on vacation I drift right off. Somehow just knowing he’s well comforts me. The occult: I need to know exactly what day I’m gonna die so that I don’t bother putting away leftovers the night before. TV’s misplaced priorities: Someday in the midst of the State of the Union address they’ll break in with, “We interrupt this program to bring you a little clip from Bewitched.” Travel: In London I went to the queen’s house. I went as a tourist—she didn’t invite me so she could pick my brain: “What do you think of my face on the pound? Too serious?” Air-conditioning in Florida: If it were as cold outside in the winter as they make it inside in the summer, they’d put the heat on. It makes no sense.

Share Engage Educate,Vinesh Chandra,BRILL,2019-12-09,"There is no doubt that our world is becoming increasingly more connected through digital technologies. For meaningful participation in this environment we need to be digitally literate, yet there are many children in developing countries who have yet to touch a computer because of social disadvantage. For these children, schools are the only place where they can build this capacity. Regrettably, many schools in these communities are under resourced. They do not have sufficient and relevant library books, let alone digital resources. As a consequence, teaching and learning strategies have remained unchanged for decades. The field of critical pedagogy evolved through the initial work of Paulo Freire. This theory is underpinned by critical thinking about societal issues followed by action and reflection. When citizens are armed with such knowledge and skills, they can positively impact on the lives of the underprivileged. Critical pedagogy, however, is still struggling to find its meaningful place, particularly in higher education. This is largely due to the lack of effective strategies and critical educators. Share Engage Educate is an auto-ethnography which presents accounts of the initiatives that were undertaken to promote print and digital literacy in rural and remote schools in eight developing countries. It highlights the experiences of school leaders, teachers, university staff and students, and globally minded citizens working alongside local communities to enhance the quality of education for over 15,000 children in these schools. This book explores how critical pedagogy can unfold in educational spaces through knowledge sharing, engaging and in the process educating all stakeholders.",Education,222,N/A,0,en

Doing Teacher-Research,Wolff-Michael Roth,BRILL,2007-01-01,"There are many teachers who think about doing research in their own classes and schools but who are perplexed by what appears to be involved. This book is intended for these perplexed practitioners, to provide them with an easily understandable narrative about the concrete praxis of doing research in their classrooms or in those of their teacher peers teaching next door or in the same school. The fundamental idea underlying this book is to provide an easily accessible but nevertheless intellectually honest text that allows teachers to increase their agency with respect to better understanding their praxis and the events in their classrooms by means of research. The author draws on his experience of doing teacher-research while being a high school teacher and department head. Roth uses six concrete research studies that he has conducted alone or with peers to describe the salient parts of any teacher-researcher investigation including: what topic to study; issues of ethics and permissions from students, school, and parents; how and what sources to collect; how to structure resources; how to construct data from the materials; how to derive claims; and how to write a report/research study. Roth chose the case-based approach because cases provide the details necessary for understanding why and how he, as teacher-researcher, has made certain decisions, and what he would do differently today. Using this case-based approach, he allows readers to tie methods choices to situations that they likely are familiar with.",Education,301,N/A,0,en

Technology and English Studies,"James A. Inman, Beth L.

That is, they chronicle the positive influence of a particular technology, class, professor, or publication, and suggest that it inspired a distinct and rewarding professional path. What is missing is the rest of the story--alternate ways that individuals have come to do work in technology and English studies and analysis of what this means for paths others might pursue. Technology and English Studies: Innovative Professional Paths meets this need. The volume begins with definitions of its three central terms: technology, English Studies, and professional paths. Chapters are organized in four sections, reflecting both a chronological progression and thematic professional development: ""The Past as the Future""; ""Searching the Academy""; ""Pushing Boundaries""; and ""Forging Beyond."" As a forerunner in addressing professionalization across the domains that comprise technology and English studies, it will prove foundational for many readers with non-traditional or otherwise alternate backgrounds who are working out what professional paths might be available to them. Technology and English Studies: Innovative Professional Paths is an important professional development resource for professors, instructors, and graduate students across the field of English studies, including rhetoric and composition, computers and writing, computer-assisted language learning, literary and linguistic computing, literary studies, English education, technical communication, linguistics, writing centers, second-language education/ESL, and creative writing.",Language Arts & Disciplines,260,N/A,0,en

Born Under a Black Cloud and Then I Married Hitler’s Daughter,Stanley Marvin Coren,Xlibris Corporation,2021-03-07,"The primary reason for writing this book was to describe the difficult circumstances I have encountered in every endeavor that eventually ended my quest for success. Although I never failed in any challenge, the end was always predictable. I was always doomed to be the loser. My attempts to achieve success were always to follow clearly marked paths that numerous people before me had followed and found success. They achieved their goals. It never worked for me. In every endeavor I began with the full knowledge of how I was to proceed and operate until some unforeseen problem interfered. I thought that I was a success in the Race to the moon until that race was cancelled by a war. I was overcome by flood from a broken water main that destroyed my business. A sudden change in the law that at first protected my business and then later denied it. A sudden fire in an adjacent building destroyed the roof of my business. A change in how computers made life amazingly good was replaced by cell phones. It appeared that somehow I was not meant to be a success. My Reason Even before I was born my goal was to be born but that was quickly changed to mere survival. My mother attempted an early abortion by bathing in a tub that was filled with a laundry lye soap that was definitely a method used to kill the unborn child within her, but it ultimately failed, and I was born. Of course, I never knew about this even till much later in my life. I then began my life not knowing that every future opportunity was predestined to not come to fruition. I never understood that my path to success was under the path of my personal Dark Cloud. My first marriage was wonderful until several years later my wife learned of how she was born and the infamous circumstance that permitted her birth was enough to destroy everything two years later.

THE CARAVAN OF LOVE,Donald Sharpe,Balboa Press,2013-07,"Since the discovery of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, there have been so many uncertainties about the cause of this disease and about the ways one gets infected. During the 1980s, so much false information persisted, along with the labeling of groups and discrimination. Thirty years later, this epidemic has gone global; just about every nation on the globe has a caseload involving HIV/AIDS. South Africa was the nation I focus on in this book; however, it is not the only country dealing with this crisis. This disease started as an isolated case; now it is a worldwide phenomenon. Love and education can help us to decrease the spread of this disease. This book highlights the panic people in South Africa went through. Their calls for help received no answers. I was encouraged to get involved when I read about Dr. Hlengwa Smangaliso in the community of Hlabisa, South Africa, who stood up and did all he could to help the people in his community. He, along with others, fought for the government to recognize the cause of the disease, allowing antiretroviral medications to be approved for those who were HIV-positive and educating the population about HIV/AIDS. I encourage you to join The Caravan of Love; whatever you can do to fight against the spread of this disease, join in.",Education,155,N/A,0,en

Sanathana Sarathi English Volume 07 (2012 - 2021),Sri Sathya Sai Media Centre,Sri Sathya Sai Media Centre ,2022-11-12,"Started in 1958, Sanathana Sarathi is a monthly magazine devoted to Sathya (Truth), Dharma (Righteousness), Shanti (Peace) and Prema (Love) - the four cardinal principles of Bhagawan Baba's philosophy. It is published from Prasanthi Nilayam (the Abode of Highest Peace) and acts as a mouthpiece of Baba's Ashram as it speaks of the important events that take place in His sacred Abode, besides carrying Divine Messages conveyed through Divine Discourses of Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba. The word meaning of Sanathana Sarathi is the 'Eternal Charioteer'. It signifies the presence of the Lord in every being as the atma guiding their lives like a charioteer. It implies that he who places his life, the body being likened to a chariot, in an attitude of surrender in the hands of the Lord, will be taken care of by the Lord even as a charioteer would take the occupant of his chariot safely to its destination. The magazine is an instrument to disseminate spiritual knowledge for the moral, physical and mental uplift of humanity without any discrimination as the subject matter discussed therein is always of common interest and of universal appeal. The fifteen Vahinis - streams of sacredness - known as the Vahini Series comprising annotation and interpretation of the Upanishads and other scriptures, Itihasas like the Ramayana, the Bhagavatha and the Mahabharata, and authentic explanations on Dhyana, Dharma, Prema, etc., have been serially published in this magazine as and when they emanated from the Divine pen of Bhagawan Baba. This magazine is published in almost all Indian languages, English and Telugu from Prasanthi Nilayam and others from respective regions. Every year Sanathana Sarathi comes out with a special issue in November commemorating the Divine Birthday. The English and Telugu magazines are posted on the 10th and 23rd respectively, of every month, from Prasanthi Nilayam. This magazine has wide, ever increasing circulation in India as well as abroad, as the study of it brings the reader closer to the philosophy of the Avatar in simple understandable language THUS SPAKE SAI... Discoursing during the launch of Sanathana Sarathi... From this day, our Sanathana Sarathi will lead to victory the cohorts of truth - the Vedas, the Sastras and similar scriptures of all faiths, against the forces of the ego such as injustice, falsehood, immorality and cruelty. This is the reason why it has emerged. This Sarathi will fight in order to establish world prosperity. It is bound to sound the paean of triumph when universal Ananda is achieved.","Body, Mind & Spirit",4302,N/A,0,en

We were proud to welcome participants from more than 40 countries from all con- nents to ICCHP. The International Programme Committee, encompassing 102 experts form all over the world, selected 150 full and 40 short papers out of 360 abstracts submitted to ICCHP. Our acceptance rate of about half of the submissions, demonstrates the scientific quality of the programme and in particular the proceedings you have in your hands. An impressive group of experts agreed to organize “Special Thematic Sessions” (STS) for ICCHP 2008. The existence of these STS sessions helped to bring the me- ing into sharper focus in several key areas of assistive technology. In turn, this deeper level of focus helped to bring together the state-of-the-art and mainstream technical, social, cultural and political developments.

OUTSIDERS: Vol. I,W. C. Collier,"BookLocker.com, Inc.",2022-04-18,"A small team of graduate students is experimenting with a new method for ""machine learning"" (AI) processing, requiring only a single, tiny process running on thousands of computers across a network, and using the complexity of the network itself to solve problems. Technical work. Esoteric. Exactly the kind of thing that excites Melody Ritter, one of the students on the team. But when they begin large scale experiments, they discover that such an AI already exists—only vastly more sophisticated and more subtle, and which has already recruited every Internet-connected device in the world to some unknown end. Within days, an amateur hacker involved with the project dies under suspicious circumstances, and Melody experiences a terrifying and seemingly supernatural encounter at her family home, followed by an attempt on her life. Meanwhile, a special forces unit conducting what was supposed to be an uncontested covert operation half a world away is nearly wiped out in an ambush, only to be rescued at the last moment by a mysterious benefactor. A lowly intelligence analyst will put these and other pieces together, and will discover the unthinkable reality which connects them, but he is not the hero. He will die for his diligence. It will take, in fact, the unexpected courage, resourcefulness, and determination of Melody Ritter, along with the aid of a few daring allies, to unmask and then to fight back against the mysterious forces drawing their world into Armageddon. And Melody, taking up this battle, will discover something she never imagined in herself: a willingness to sacrifice almost anything to fight for truth and freedom.",Fiction,379,N/A,0,en

What Little I Remember,Otto Robert Frisch,Plunkett Lake Press,2019-08-17,"Otto Robert Frisch took part in some of the most momentous developments in modern physics, notably the discovery of nuclear fission (a term which he coined). His work on the first atom bomb, which he saw explode in the desert “like the light of a thousand suns”, brought him into contact with figures such as Robert Oppenheimer, Edward Teller, Richard Feynman and the father of electronic computers, John von Neumann. He also encountered the physicists who had made the great discoveries of recent generations: Einstein, Rutherford and Niels Bohr. This characterful book of reminiscences sheds an engagingly personal light on the people and events behind some of the greatest scientific discoveries of this century, illustrated with a series of fascinating photographs and witty sketches by the author himself. “This is a happy book, from which the author's personality and his enjoyment of physics, of music, of life, emerges clearly. It is also a portrait of the pre-War world of physics, of days of small numbers and small apparatus, of times when a physicist could think of an ingenious experiment today and set it up tomorrow.” — Rudolf Peierls, Nature “In writing a charming, light-hearted cameo of his life and times as a scientist, Professor Frisch has revealed more about science than many authors with greater pretensions. This is a book that deserves to be read, and will be enjoyed, by a wide audience.” — The Economist “Despite his modest title, what Frisch ‘manages to remember’ is quite impressive. He loved to tell stories and his many vignettes of his associates... include nearly every outstanding physicist who worked in nuclear physics.” — Science “In the straightforward narrative style he developed writing lay treatments of modern physics, Frisch recounts his memories of significant men and events in the history of physics between 1920 and 1960...

Policies have thus been formed and implemented without even a cursory feminist critical glance.

Stability of Dynamical Systems,,Springer Science & Business Media,2008,"In the analysis and synthesis of contemporary systems, engineers and scientists are frequently confronted with increasingly complex models that may simultaneously include components whose states evolve along continuous time and discrete instants; components whose descriptions may exhibit nonlinearities, time lags, transportation delays, hysteresis effects, and uncertainties in parameters; and components that cannot be described by various classical equations, as in the case of discrete-event systems, logic commands, and Petri nets. The qualitative analysis of such systems requires results for finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional systems; continuous-time and discrete-time systems; continuous continuous-time and discontinuous continuous-time systems; and hybrid systems involving a mixture of continuous and discrete dynamics. Filling a gap in the literature, this textbook presents the first comprehensive stability analysis of all the major types of system models described above. Throughout the book, the applicability of the developed theory is demonstrated by means of many specific examples and applications to important classes of systems, including digital control systems, nonlinear regulator systems, pulse-width-modulated feedback control systems, artificial neural networks (with and without time delays), digital signal processing, a class of discrete-event systems (with applications to manufacturing and computer load balancing problems) and a multicore nuclear reactor model. The book covers the following four general topics: * Representation and modeling of dynamical systems of the types described above * Presentation of Lyapunov and Lagrange stability theory for dynamical systems defined on general metric spaces * Specialization of this stability theory to finite-dimensional dynamical systems * Specialization of this stability theory to infinite-dimensional dynamical systems Replete with exercises and requiring basic knowledge of linear algebra, analysis, and differential equations, the work may be used as a textbook for graduate courses in stability theory of dynamical systems. The book may also serve as a self-study reference for graduate students, researchers, and practitioners in applied mathematics, engineering, computer science, physics, chemistry, biology, and economics.",Differentiable dynamical systems,516,N/A,0,en

Surviving in the Hi-Tech World - Memoirs of a life in computers,Ernie Dainow,Ernie Dainow,2024-05-01,"Surviving in the Hi-Tech World follows the many ups and downs of my years as a software developer in the high-tech industry, starting in the mainframe era. It provides a window into what it is like to work in the computer field. I worked for many different organizations, from academia and large companies to medium sized companies and several startups. The stories weave my work experience with explanations of the technology of the period. In the process it follows the revolutionary changes in computer hardware and software from large mainframes to personal microcomputers and the evolution of early networks into the global Internet. When I was a psychology student in university, I became interested in the possibilities of using computers to model and understand human thinking. I completed a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence in Computer Science in 1970, but my interest in doing academic research shifted to an interest in building real world systems. My first job in computers was with Univac, the company that had built one of the first general purpose commercial computers. I switched jobs for many different reasons – sometimes because of interest and at other times because of necessity. Each chapter in the book covers the different jobs and places that I worked.

The result of his search is 20 Teachers, a collection of revealing profiles in which outstanding educators explain what works for them in the classroom and why. Macrorie's interviews with these professionals show an astonishing similarity in their beliefs, methods, and attitudes and the keys to their success with students from first grade to the graduate level. Ranging from a woodworking instructor in a wealthy suburban school to an inner-city history teacher to a professor of space engineering, the teachers profiled here share a fundamental belief in putting choice and responsibility in the hands of their students, no matter what their age. Macrorie includes, in addition to the interviews, a summary chapter listing 43 items these teachers claim help learners to do ""good works."" Finally, in an ""Open Letter About Schools,"" he explores the notion that schools have developed, often unwittingly, traditions that run counter to the way these educators work; he discusses the obstacles they face, from both within the system and without.

The Day I Was Sent to the Principal's Office,Steve Russo,iUniverse,2013-04,"From the time he was a child, Steve Russo knew that he wanted to be an educator. It was his dream to be a teacher, to influence and shape young lives and minds, and he has lived that dream for twenty-eight years. As with many teachers, he didn't get into the field for money, but his rewards have been many and rich over his career. As an administrator, he encouraged his teachers to remember the daily opportunity to influence and inspire their students and to make those influences powerfully positive ones. It's a rule he tries to live by every day. He starts with the story of his first trip to the principal's office as a young student. In a deliciously ironic turn, he has returned to that same office this time, behind the desk, as the principal. Now he shares some of his favorite memories from a life lived as a public school administrator. These stories are not only a representation of his career in education but also a reflection of his life. All the stories are true, with no details exaggerated to enhance the stories because in the life of an administrator, fact can be more amusing than fiction.",Education,105,N/A,0,en

Factors Correlating with Teachers' Use of Computers in the Classroom,Samia A. Wahab,Universal-Publishers,2008-11-11,"There is a need to understand the factors correlating with teachers' instructional use of computers, because much of the present research focuses on students rather than teachers. This study examines several factors relating to the use of computers in the classroom by teachers. The factors examined include teacher attitudes, emotions, beliefs, and outside influences. This was done by a review of the present literature, administering two surveys, and analyzing the survey data. Questionnaires were distributed to faculty at five randomly selected high schools in a Midwest city participating in the study. Data from the survey was then examined to determine which factors correlate with teacher computer use in the classroom. The results of this study will help improve understanding of teachers' instructional computer use.",,179,N/A,0,en
Founders at Work,Jessica Livingston,Apress,2008-11-01,"Now available in paperback—with a new preface and interview with Jessica Livingston about Y Combinator! Founders at Work: Stories of Startups' Early Days is a collection of interviews with founders of famous technology companies about what happened in the very earliest days. These people are celebrities now. What was it like when they were just a couple friends with an idea? Founders like Steve Wozniak (Apple), Caterina Fake (Flickr), Mitch Kapor (Lotus), Max Levchin (PayPal), and Sabeer Bhatia (Hotmail) tell you in their own words about their surprising and often very funny discoveries as they learned how to build a company. Where did they get the ideas that made them rich? How did they convince investors to back them? What went wrong, and how did they recover? Nearly all technical people have thought of one day starting or working for a startup. For them, this book is the closest you can come to being a fly on the wall at a successful startup, to learn how it's done. But ultimately these interviews are required reading for anyone who wants to understand business, because startups are business reduced to its essence. The reason their founders become rich is that startups do what businesses do—create value—more intensively than almost any other part of the economy. How? What are the secrets that make successful startups so insanely productive? Read this book, and let the founders themselves tell you.",Business & Economics,468,4,15,en

"Computers, Children, and Classrooms","Hilda W. Carmichael, Ontario. Ministry of Education",N/A,1985,"This study examined the creative uses of computers in elementary schools and their impact on student's confidence and self-esteem, student-student interaction, student-teacher interaction, male and female students, classroom management, the role of the teacher, special education, teacher training, teachers not involved in the study, and curricular areas such as computer literacy, learning Logo as a programming language, problem-solving and problem-creation, mathematics, oral communication, reading and writing, the arts, and values and the individual and society. Findings are based on intensive examinations of real classrooms over a 2-year period. A total of 433 students in 18 classrooms that involved 13 different teachers were studied; of these, 5 teachers and 40 students were involved in the study for 2 years. Classrooms had 1 to 5 computers over the entire school year, or students had access to a computer laboratory. Logo and word processing were studied extensively; the use of a graphics tablet and Musicland were explored for short periods. Findings indicate that the creative use of computers fosters the development of independent and original thinking and that an environment that encourages exploration leads to extensive social interaction among students; in addition, students become more willing to express, refine, or revise their ideas. A significantly greater proportion of students experienced an increase in their confidence and self-esteem if their teacher was able to give them autonomy over their learning. The impact on students' attention span and cognitive development in the special education classes was also significant. Appendices and selected references are provided.

Information Technology and Social Justice,"Rooksby, Emma, Weckert, John",IGI Global,2006-10-31,"The term digital divide is still used regularly to characterize the injustice associated with inequalities in access to information and communication technologies (ICTs). As the debate continues and becomes more sophisticated, more and more aspects of the distribution of ICTs are singled out as relevant to characterizations of the digital divide and of its moral status. The best way to articulate the digital divide is to relate it to other aspects of social and distributive justice, using a mixture of pre-existing theories within moral and political philosophy. These theories are complemented with contributions from sociology, communication studies, information systems, and a range of other disciplines. Information Technology and Social Justice presents conceptual frameworks for understanding and tackling digital divides.

Enterprise Culture in Neoliberal India,Nandini Gooptu,Routledge,2013-10-30,"The promotion of an enterprise culture and entrepreneurship in India in recent decades has had far-reaching implications beyond the economy, and transformed social and cultural attitudes and conduct. This book brings together pioneering research on the nature of India’s enterprise culture, covering a range of different themes: workplace, education, religion, trade, films, media, youth identity, gender relations, class formation and urban politics. Based on extensive empirical and ethnographic research by the contributors, the book shows the myriad manifestations of enterprise culture and the making of the aspiring, enterprising-self in public culture, social practice, and personal lives, ranging from attempts to construct hegemonic ideas in public discourse, to appropriation by individuals and groups with unintended consequences, to forms of contested and contradictory expression. It discusses what is ‘new’ about enterprise culture and how it relates to pre-existing ideas, and goes on to look at the processes and mechanisms through which enterprise culture is becoming entrenched, as well as how it affects different classes and communities. The book highlights the social and political implications of enterprise culture and how it recasts family and interpersonal relationships as well as personal and collective identity. Illuminating one of the most important aspects of India’s current economic and social transformation, this book is of interest to students and scholars of Asian Business, Sociology, Anthropology, Development Studies and Media and Cultural Studies.",Social Science,287,N/A,0,en

Numerical Solution of Partial Differential Equations on Parallel Computers,"Are Magnus Bruaset, Aslak Tveito",Springer Science & Business Media,2006-03-05,"Since the dawn of computing, the quest for a better understanding of Nature has been a driving force for technological development. Groundbreaking achievements by great scientists have paved the way from the abacus to the supercomputing power of today. When trying to replicate Nature in the computer’s silicon test tube, there is need for precise and computable process descriptions. The scienti?c ?elds of Ma- ematics and Physics provide a powerful vehicle for such descriptions in terms of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Formulated as such equations, physical laws can become subject to computational and analytical studies. In the computational setting, the equations can be discreti ed for ef?cient solution on a computer, leading to valuable tools for simulation of natural and man-made processes. Numerical so- tion of PDE-based mathematical models has been an important research topic over centuries, and will remain so for centuries to come. In the context of computer-based simulations, the quality of the computed results is directly connected to the model’s complexity and the number of data points used for the computations. Therefore, computational scientists tend to ?ll even the largest and most powerful computers they can get access to, either by increasing the si e of the data sets, or by introducing new model terms that make the simulations more realistic, or a combination of both. Today, many important simulation problems can not be solved by one single computer, but calls for parallel computing.",Mathematics,491,N/A,0,en

Advances in Virtual Agents and Affective Computing for the Understanding and Remediation of Social Cognitive Disorders,"Eric Brunet-Gouet, Ali Oker, Jean-Claude Martin, Ouriel Grynszpan, Philip L. Jackson",Frontiers Media SA,2016-03-02,"Advances in modern sciences occur thanks to within-fields discoveries as well as confrontation of concepts and methods from separated, sometimes distant, domains of knowledge. For instance, the fields of psychology and psychopathology benefited from accumulated contributions from cognitive neurosciences, which, in turn, received insights from molecular chemistry, cellular biology, physics (neuroimaging), statistics and computer sciences (data processing), etc. From the results of these researches, one can argue that among the numerous cognitive phenomena supposedly involved in the emergence the human intelligence and organized behavior, some of them are specific to the social nature of our phylogenetic order. Scientific reductionism allowed to divide the social cognitive system into several components, i.e. emotion processing and regulation, mental state inference (theory of mind), agency, etc. New paradigms were progressively designed to investigate these processes within highly-controlled laboratory settings. Moreover, the related constructs were successful at better understanding psychopathological conditions such as autism and schizophrenia, with partial relationships with illness outcomes. Here, we would like to outline the parallel development of concepts in social neurosciences and in other domains such as computer science, affective computing, virtual reality development, and even hardware technologies. While several researchers in neurosciences pointed out the necessity to consider naturalistic social cognition (Zaki and Ochsner, Ann N Y Acad Sci 1167, 16-30, 2009), the second person perspective (Schilbach et al., Behav Brain Sci 36(4), 393-414, 2013) and reciprocity (de Bruin et al., Front Hum Neurosci 6, 151, 2012), both computer and software developments allowed more and more realistic real-time models of our environment and of virtual humans capable of some interaction with users. As noted at the very beginning of this editorial, a new convergence between scientific disciplines might occur from which it is tricky to predict the outcomes in terms of new concepts, methods and uses. Although this convergence is motivated by the intuition that it fits well ongoing societal changes (increasing social demands on computer technologies, augmenting funding), it comes with several difficulties for which the current Frontiers in’ topic strives to bring some positive answers, and to provide both theoretical arguments and experimental examples. The first issue is about concepts and vocabulary as the contributions described in the following are authored by neuroscientists, computer scientists, psychopathologists, etc. A special attention was given during the reviewing process to stay as close as possible to the publication standards in psychological and health sciences, and to avoid purely technical descriptions. The second problem concerns methods: more complex computerized interaction models results in unpredictable and poorly controlled experiments. In other words, the assets of naturalistic paradigms may be alleviated by the difficulty to match results between subjects, populations, conditions. Of course, this practical question is extremely important for investigating pathologies that are associated with profoundly divergent behavioral patterns. Some of the contributions of this topic provide description of strategies that allowed to solve these difficulties, at least partially. The last issue is about heterogeneity of the objectives of the researches presented here. While selection criteria focused on the use of innovative technologies to assess or improve social cognition, the fields of application of this approach were quite unexpected. In an attempt to organize the contributions, three directions of research can be identified: 1) how innovation in methods might improve understanding and assessment of social cognition disorders or pathology? 2) within the framework of cognitive behavioral psychotherapies (CBT), how should we consider the use of virtual reality or augmented reality? 3) which are the benefits of these techniques for investigating severe mental disorders (schizophrenia or autism) and performing cognitive training? The first challenging question is insightfully raised in the contribution of Timmermans and Schilbach (2014) giving orientations for investigating alterations of social interaction in psychiatric disorders by the use of dual interactive eye tracking with virtual anthropomorphic avatars. Joyal, Jacob and collaborators (2014) bring concurrent and construct validities of a newly developed set of virtual faces expressing six fundamental emotions. The relevance of virtual reality was exemplified with two contributions focusing on anxiety related phenomena. Jackson et al. (2015) describe a new environment allowing to investigate empathy for dynamic FACS-coded facial expressions including pain. Based on a systematic investigation of the impact of social stimuli modalities (visual, auditory), Ruch and collaborators are able to characterize the specificity of the interpretation of laughter in people with gelotophobia (2014). On the issue of social anxiety, Aymerich-Franch et al. (2014) presented two studies in which public speaking anxiety has been correlated with avatars’ similarity of participants’ self-representations. The second issue focuses on how advances in virtual reality may benefit to cognitive and behavioral therapies in psychiatry. These interventions share a common framework that articulates thoughts, feelings or emotions and behaviors and proposes gradual modification of each of these levels thanks to thought and schema analysis, stress reduction procedures, etc. They were observed to be somehow useful for the treatment of depression, stress disorders, phobias, and are gaining some authority in personality disorders and addictions. The main asset of new technologies is the possibility to control the characteristics of symptom-eliciting stimuli/situations, and more precisely the degree to which immersion is enforced. For example, Baus and Bouchard (2014) provide a review on the extension of virtual reality exposure-based therapy toward recently described augmented reality exposure-based therapy in individuals with phobias. Concerning substance dependence disorders, Hone-Blanchet et collaborators (2014) present another review on how virtual reality can be an asset for both therapy and craving assessment stressing out the possibilities to simulate social interactions associated with drug seeking behaviors and even peers’ pressure to consume. The last issue this Frontiers’ topic deals with encompasses the questions raised by social cognitive training or remediation in severe and chronic mental disorders (autistic disorders, schizophrenia). Here, therapies are based on drill and practice or strategy shaping procedures, and, most of the time, share an errorless learning of repeated cognitive challenges. Computerized methods were early proposed for that they do, effortlessly and with limited costs, repetitive stimulations. While, repetition was incompatible with realism in the social cognitive domain, recent advances provide both immersion and full control over stimuli. Georgescu and al. (2014) exhaustively reviews the use of virtual characters to assess and train non-verbal communication in high-functioning autism (HFA). Grynszpan and Nadel (2015) present an original eye-tracking method to reveal the link between gaze patterns and pragmatic abilities again in HFA. About schizophrenia, Oker and collaborators (2015) discuss and report some insights on how an affective and reactive virtual agents might be useful to assess and remediate several defects of social cognitive disorders. About assessment within virtual avatars on schizophrenia, Park et al., (2014) focused on effect of perceived intimacy on social decision making with schizophrenia patients. Regarding schizophrenia remediation, Peyroux and Franck (2014) presented a new method named RC2S which is a cognitive remediation program to improve social cognition in schizophrenia and related disorders. To conclude briefly, while it is largely acknowledged that social interaction can be studied as a topic of its own, all the contributions demonstrate the added value of expressive virtual agents and affective computing techniques for the experimentation. It also appears that the use of virtual reality is at the very beginning of a new scientific endeavor in cognitive sciences and medicine.",Cognition disorders,140,N/A,0,en

Cognition and Interaction: From Computers to Smart Objects and Autonomous Agents,"Amon Rapp, Maurizio Tirassa, Tom Ziemke",Frontiers Media SA,2019-10-10,"Cognitive sciences have been involved under numerous accounts to explain how humans interact with technology, as well as to design technological instruments tailored to human needs. As technological advancements in fields like wearable and ubiquitous computing, virtual reality, robotics and artificial intelligence are presenting novel modalities for interacting with technology, there are opportunities for deepening, exploring, and even rethinking the theoretical foundations of human technology use. This volume entitled “Cognition and Interaction: From Computers to Smart Objects and Autonomous Agents” is a collection of articles on the impacts that novel 3 September Frontiers in Psychology 2019 | Cognition and Interaction interactive technologies are producing on individuals. It puts together 17 works, spanning from research on social cognition in human-robot interaction to studies on neural changes triggered by Internet use, that tackle relevant technological and theoretical issues in human-computer interaction, encouraging us to rethink how we conceptualize technology, its use and development. The volume addresses fundamental issues at different levels. The first part revolves around the biological impacts that technologies are producing on our bodies and brains. The second part focuses on the psychological level, exploring how our psychological characteristics may affect the way we use, understand and perceive technology, as well as how technology is changing our cognition.

Rhetorical Machines,"John Jones, Lavinia Hirsu",University Alabama Press,2019-07-02,"A landmark volume that explores the interconnected nature of technologies and rhetorical practice Rhetorical Machines addresses new approaches to studying computational processes within the growing field of digital rhetoric. While computational code is often seen as value-neutral and mechanical, this volume explores the underlying, and often unexamined, modes of persuasion this code engages. In so doing, it argues that computation is in fact rife with the values of those who create it and thus has powerful ethical and moral implications. From Socrates’s critique of writing in Plato’s Phaedrus to emerging new media and internet culture, the scholars assembled here provide insight into how computation and rhetoric work together to produce social and cultural effects. This multidisciplinary volume features contributions from scholar-practitioners across the fields of rhetoric, computer science, and writing studies. It is divided into four main sections: “Emergent Machines” examines how technologies and algorithms are framed and entangled in rhetorical processes, “Operational Codes” explores how computational processes are used to achieve rhetorical ends, “Ethical Decisions and Moral Protocols” considers the ethical implications involved in designing software and that software’s impact on computational culture, and the final section includes two scholars’ responses to the preceding chapters. Three of the sections are prefaced by brief conversations with chatbots (autonomous computational agents) addressing some of the primary questions raised in each section. At the heart of these essays is a call for emerging and established scholars in a vast array of fields to reach interdisciplinary understandings of human-machine interactions. This innovative work will be valuable to scholars and students in a variety of disciplines, including but not limited to rhetoric, computer science, writing studies, and the digital humanities.",Language Arts & Disciplines,294,N/A,0,en

Computer Techniques in Neuroanatomy,J.J. Capowski,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This book is the story of the marriage of a new techl}ology, computers, with an old problem, the study of neuroanatomical structures using the light microscope. It is aimed toward you, the neuroanatomist, who until now have used computers primarily for word processing but now wish to use them also to collect and analyze your laboratory data. Mter reading the book, you will be better equipped to use a computer system for data collection and analysis, to employ a programmer who might develop a system for you, or to evaluate the systems available in the marketplace. To start toward this goal, a glossary first presents commonly used terms in computer assisted neuroanatomy. This, on its own, will aid you as it merges the jargon of the two different fields. Then, Chapter 1 presents a historical review to describe the manual tasks involved in presenting and measuring anatomic structures. This review lays a base line of the tasks that were done before computers and the amount of skill and time needed to perform the tasks. In Chapters 2 and 3, you will find basic information about laboratory computers and programs to the depth required for you to use the machines easily and talk with some fluency to computer engineers, programmers, and salesmen.

The Myth of Artificial Intelligence,Erik J. Larson,Belknap Press,2021-04-06,"“Exposes the vast gap between the actual science underlying AI and the dramatic claims being made for it.” —John Horgan “If you want to know about AI, read this book...It shows how a supposedly futuristic reverence for Artificial Intelligence retards progress when it denigrates our most irreplaceable resource for any future progress: our own human intelligence.” —Peter Thiel Ever since Alan Turing, AI enthusiasts have equated artificial intelligence with human intelligence. A computer scientist working at the forefront of natural language processing, Erik Larson takes us on a tour of the landscape of AI to reveal why this is a profound mistake. AI works on inductive reasoning, crunching data sets to predict outcomes. But humans don’t correlate data sets. We make conjectures, informed by context and experience. And we haven’t a clue how to program that kind of intuitive reasoning, which lies at the heart of common sense. Futurists insist AI will soon eclipse the capacities of the most gifted mind, but Larson shows how far we are from superintelligence—and what it would take to get there. “Larson worries that we’re making two mistakes at once, defining human intelligence down while overestimating what AI is likely to achieve...Another concern is learned passivity: our tendency to assume that AI will solve problems and our failure, as a result, to cultivate human ingenuity.” —David A.

The initial technical scope and vision of the MURI project was formulated by Drs. Larry Cooper and Joel Davis, both program of?cers at ONR at the time. The unifying theme of this MURI project and its companionefforts is the concept of cellular nonlinear/neuralnetwork (CNN) technology and its various extensions and chip implementations, including nanoscale sensors and the broadening ?eld of cellular wave computing. In recent years, CNN-based vision system drew much attention from vision scientists to device technologists and computer architects. Due to its early - plementation in a two-dimensional (2D) topography, it found success in early vision technologyapplications, such as focal-plane arrays, locally adaptable sensor/ processor integration, resulting in extremely high frame rates of 10,000 frames per second. More recently it drew increasing attention from computer architects, due to its intrinsic local interconnect architecture and parallel processing paradigm.

Socio-technical Design of Ubiquitous Computing Systems,"Klaus David, Kurt Geihs, Jan Marco Leimeister, Alexander Roßnagel, Ludger Schmidt, Gerd Stumme, Arno Wacker",Springer,2014-07-28,"By using various data inputs, ubiquitous computing systems detect their current usage context, automatically adapt their services to the user’s situational needs and interact with other services or resources in their environment on an ad-hoc basis. Designing such self-adaptive, context-aware knowledge processing systems is, in itself, a formidable challenge. This book presents core findings from the VENUS project at the Interdisciplinary Research Center for Information System Design (ITeG) at Kassel University, where researchers from different fields, such as computer science, information systems, human-computer interaction and law, together seek to find general principles and guidelines for the design of socially aware ubiquitous computing systems. To this end, system usability, user trust in the technology and adherence to privacy laws and regulations were treated as particularly important criteria in the context of socio-technical system design. During the project, a comprehensive blueprint for systematic, interdisciplinary software development was developed, covering the particular functional and non-functional design aspects of ubiquitous computing at the interface between technology and human beings. The organization of the book reflects the structure of the VENUS work program. After an introductory part I, part II provides the groundwork for VENUS by presenting foundational results from all four disciplines involved. Subsequently, part III focuses on methodological research funneling the development activities into a common framework. Part IV then covers the design of the demonstrators that were built in order to develop and evaluate the VENUS method. Finally, part V is dedicated to the evaluation phase to assess the user acceptance of the new approach and applications. The presented findings are especially important for researchers in computer science, information systems, and human-computer interaction, but also for everyone working on the acceptance of new technologies in society in general.",Computers,351,N/A,0,en

Pyramidal Architectures for Computer Vision,"Virginio Cantoni, Marco Ferretti",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Computer vision deals with the problem of manipulating information contained in large quantities of sensory data, where raw data emerge from the transducing 6 7 sensors at rates between 10 to 10 pixels per second. Conventional general purpose computers are unable to achieve the computation rates required to op erate in real time or even in near real time, so massively parallel systems have been used since their conception in this important practical application area. The development of massively parallel computers was initially character ized by efforts to reach a speedup factor equal to the number of processing elements (linear scaling assumption). This behavior pattern can nearly be achieved only when there is a perfect match between the computational struc ture or data structure and the system architecture. The theory of hierarchical modular systems (HMSs) has shown that even a small number of hierarchical levels can sizably increase the effectiveness of very large systems. In fact, in the last decade several hierarchical architectures that support capabilities which can overcome performances gained with the assumption of linear scaling have been proposed. Of these architectures, the most commonly considered in com puter vision is the one based on a very large number of processing elements (PEs) embedded in a pyramidal structure. Pyramidal architectures supply the same image at different resolution lev els, thus ensuring the use of the most appropriate resolution for the operation, task, and image at hand.",Computers,348,N/A,0,en

What Can Be Computed?,John MacCormick,Princeton University Press,2018-05-01,"An accessible and rigorous textbook for introducing undergraduates to computer science theory What Can Be Computed? is a uniquely accessible yet rigorous introduction to the most profound ideas at the heart of computer science. Crafted specifically for undergraduates who are studying the subject for the first time, and requiring minimal prerequisites, the book focuses on the essential fundamentals of computer science theory and features a practical approach that uses real computer programs (Python and Java) and encourages active experimentation. It is also ideal for self-study and reference. The book covers the standard topics in the theory of computation, including Turing machines and finite automata, universal computation, nondeterminism, Turing and Karp reductions, undecidability, time-complexity classes such as P and NP, and NP-completeness, including the Cook-Levin Theorem. But the book also provides a broader view of computer science and its historical development, with discussions of Turing's original 1936 computing machines, the connections between undecidability and Gödel's incompleteness theorem, and Karp's famous set of twenty-one NP-complete problems. Throughout, the book recasts traditional computer science concepts by considering how computer programs are used to solve real problems. Standard theorems are stated and proven with full mathematical rigor, but motivation and understanding are enhanced by considering concrete implementations. The book's examples and other content allow readers to view demonstrations of—and to experiment with—a wide selection of the topics it covers. The result is an ideal text for an introduction to the theory of computation.

Computers in Fisheries Research,"Bernard A. Megrey, Erlend Moksness",Springer Science & Business Media,2008-11-26,"The first edition of this book was published by Chapman and Hall Ltd. in 1996. The first edition contained nine chapters and, for all except one chapter, the original chapter authors agreed to update their chapter. Comparing these chapters gives the reader an idea of the development over a time span of more than 10 years between the two editions. In the preparation of the second edition we decided to add more chapters reflecting some important fields with significant contributions to present day fishery research. These are the use of internet for searching of information (Chapter 2), and the present state and use of remote sensing (Chapter 5), ecosystem modeling (Chapter 8) and visualization of data (Chapter 10). This second edition provides a valuable sampling of contemporary applications. Scientists have an opportunity to evaluate the suitability of different computer technology applications to their particular research situation thereby taking advantage of the experience of others. The chapters that follow are the fruition of this idea. The history behind this book started in 1989 when we were asked by Dr. Vidar Wespestad (previously: Alaska Fisheries Science Center, Seattle, USA) to prepare and convene a session at the 1992 World Fishery Congress in Athens, Greece on computer applications in fisheries.

The Government Machine,Jon Agar,MIT Press,2003-09-26,"An examination of technology and politics in the evolution of the British ""government machine."" In The Government Machine, Jon Agar traces the mechanization of government work in the United Kingdom from the nineteenth to the early twenty-first century. He argues that this transformation has been tied to the rise of ""expert movements,"" groups whose authority has rested on their expertise. The deployment of machines was an attempt to gain control over state action—a revolutionary move. Agar shows how mechanization followed the popular depiction of government as machine-like, with British civil servants cast as components of a general purpose ""government machine""; indeed, he argues that today's general purpose computer is the apotheosis of the civil servant. Over the course of two centuries, government has become the major repository and user of information; the Civil Service itself can be seen as an information-processing entity. Agar argues that the changing capacities of government have depended on the implementation of new technologies, and that the adoption of new technologies has depended on a vision of government and a fundamental model of organization. Thus, to study the history of technology is to study the state, and vice versa.",Computers,565,N/A,0,en

The Spike,Mark Humphries,Princeton University Press,2021-03-09,"The story of a neural impulse and what it reveals about how our brains work We see the last cookie in the box and think, can I take that? We reach a hand out. In the 2.1 seconds that this impulse travels through our brain, billions of neurons communicate with one another, sending blips of voltage through our sensory and motor regions. Neuroscientists call these blips “spikes.” Spikes enable us to do everything: talk, eat, run, see, plan, and decide. In The Spike, Mark Humphries takes readers on the epic journey of a spike through a single, brief reaction. In vivid language, Humphries tells the story of what happens in our brain, what we know about spikes, and what we still have left to understand about them. Drawing on decades of research in neuroscience, Humphries explores how spikes are born, how they are transmitted, and how they lead us to action. He dives into previously unanswered mysteries: Why are most neurons silent? What causes neurons to fire spikes spontaneously, without input from other neurons or the outside world? Why do most spikes fail to reach any destination? Humphries presents a new vision of the brain, one where fundamental computations are carried out by spontaneous spikes that predict what will happen in the world, helping us to perceive, decide, and react quickly enough for our survival. Traversing neuroscience’s expansive terrain, The Spike follows a single electrical response to illuminate how our extraordinary brains work.",Science,232,5,1,en

The Lyons teashops were one of the great British institutions, providing a cup of tea and a penny bun through the depression, the war, austerity and on into the 1960s and 1970s. Yet Lyons also has a more surprising claim to history. In the 1930s John Simmons, a young graduate in charge of the clerks' offices that totalled all the bills issued by the Nippies and kept track of the costs of all the tea, cakes and other goods distributed to the nation's cafes and shops, became obsessed by the new ideas of scientific management.

Deep Learning,"Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville",MIT Press,2016-11-10,"An introduction to a broad range of topics in deep learning, covering mathematical and conceptual background, deep learning techniques used in industry, and research perspectives. “Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject.” —Elon Musk, cochair of OpenAI; cofounder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX Deep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

Computational Thinking,"Peter J. Denning, Matti Tedre",MIT Press,2019-05-14,"This pocket-sized introduction to computational thinking and problem-solving traces its genealogy centuries before the digital computer. A few decades into the digital era, scientists discovered that thinking in terms of computation made possible an entirely new way of organizing scientific investigation. Eventually, every field had a computational branch: computational physics, computational biology, computational sociology. More recently, “computational thinking” has become part of the K–12 curriculum. But what is computational thinking? This volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series offers an accessible overview—tracing a genealogy that begins centuries before digital computers and portraying computational thinking as the pioneers of computing have described it. The authors explain that computational thinking (CT) is not a set of concepts for programming; it is a way of thinking that is honed through practice: the mental skills for designing computations to do jobs for us, and for explaining and interpreting the world as a complex of information processes. Mathematically trained experts (known as “computers”) who performed complex calculations as teams engaged in CT long before electronic computers. In each chapter, the author identify different dimensions of today's highly developed CT: • Computational Methods • Computing Machines • Computing Education • Software Engineering • Computational Science • Design Along the way, they debunk inflated claims for CT and computation while making clear the power of CT in all its complexity and multiplicity.",Computers,266,N/A,0,en

Digitized,Peter Bentley,Oxford University Press (UK),2012-03-22,"There's a hidden science that affects every part of your life, a science so powerful that you would be hard-pressed to find a single human being on the planet unaffected by its achievements. It is the science behind computers, the machines which drive the supply and creation of power, food, medicine, money, communication, entertainment, and most goods our stores. It has transformed societies with the Internet, the digitization of information, mobile phone networks, and GPS technologies. Written in friendly and approachable language, Digitized provides a window onto the mysterious field from which all computer technology originates, making the theory and practice of computation understandable to the general reader. This popular science book explains how and why computers were invented, how they work, and what will happen in the future. Written by a leading computer scientist, Peter J. Bentley, it tells this fascinating story using the voices of pioneers and leading experts interviewed for the book, in effect throwing open the doors of the most cutting-edge computer laboratories. Bentley explores how this young discipline grew from the early work by pioneers such as Turing, through its growth spurts in the Internet, its difficult adolescent stage where the promises of AI were never achieved and dot-com bubble burst, to its current stage as a semi-mature field, capable of remarkable achievements. Packed with real-world examples, Digitized is the only book to explain the origins and key advances in all areas of computing: theory, hardware, software, Internet, user interfaces, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence. If you have an interest in computers--whether you work with them, use them for fun, or are being taught about them in school--this book will provide an entertaining introduction to the science that's changing the world.",Computers,307,N/A,0,en

Digital Art History,"Anna Bentkowska-Kafel, Trish Cashen, Hazel Gardiner",Intellect Books,2005,"This book looks at the transformation that Art and Art history is undergoing through engagement with the digital revolution. Since its initiation in 1985, CHArt (Computers and the History of Art) has set out to promote interaction between the rapidly developing new Information Technology and the study and practice of Art. It has become increasingly clear in recent years that this interaction has led, not just to the provision of new tools for the carrying out of existing practices, but to the evolution of unprecedented activities and modes of thought. This collection of papers represents the variety, innovation and richness of significant presentations made at the CHArt Conferences of 2001 and 2002. Some show new methods of teaching being employed, making clear in particular the huge advantages that IT can provide for engaging students in learning and interactive discussion. It also shows how much is to be gained from the flexibility of the digital image 'Äì or could be gained if the road block of copyright is finally overcome. Others look at the impact on collections and archives, showing exciting ways of using computers to make available information about collections and archives and to provide new accessibility to archives. The way such material can now be accessed via the internet has revolutionized the search methods of scholars, but it has also made information available to all. However the internet is not only about access. Some papers here show how it also offers the opportunity of exploring the structure of images and dealing with the fascinating possibilities offered by digitisation for visual analysis, searching and reconstruction. Another challenging aspect covered here are the possibilities offered by digital media for new art forms. One point that emerges is that digital art is not some discreet practice, separated from other art forms. It is rather an approach that can involve all manner of association with both other art practices and with other forms of presentation and enquiry, demonstrating that we are witnessing a revolution that affects all our activities and not one that simply leads to the establishment of a new discipline to set alongside others.",Art,142,N/A,0,en

Open Wide The Freedom Gates,Dorothy Height,PublicAffairs,2009-04-28,"Dorothy Height marched at civil rights rallies, sat through tense White House meetings, and witnessed every major victory in the struggle for racial equality. Yet as the sole woman among powerful, charismatic men, someone whose personal ambition was secondary to her passion for her cause, she has received little mainstream recognition -- until now. In her memoir, Dr. Height, now ninety-one, reflects on a life of service and leadership. We witness her childhood encounters with racism and the thrill of New York college life during the Harlem Renaissance. We see her protest against lynchings. We sit with her onstage as Martin Luther King Jr. delivers his ""I Have a Dream"" speech. We meet people she knew intimately throughout the decades: W.E.B.

Digitized: The science of computers and how it shapes our world,Peter J. Bentley,OUP Oxford,2012-03-22,"There's a hidden science that affects every part of your life. You are fluent in its terminology of email, WiFi, social networking, and encryption. You use its results when you make a telephone call, access the Internet, use any factory-produced product, or travel in any modern car. The discipline is so new that some prefer to call it a branch of engineering or mathematics. But it is so powerful and world-changing that you would be hard-pressed to find a single human being on the planet unaffected by its achievements. The science of computers enables the supply and creation of power, food, water, medicine, transport, money, communication, entertainment, and most goods in shops. It has transformed societies with the Internet, the digitization of information, mobile phone networks and GPS technologies. Here, Peter J. Bentley explores how this young discipline grew from its theoretical conception by pioneers such as Turing, through its growth spurts in the Internet, its difficult adolescent stage where the promises of AI were never achieved and dot-com bubble burst, to its current stage as a (semi)mature field, now capable of remarkable achievements. Charting the successes and failures of computer science through the years, Bentley discusses what innovations may change our world in the future.",Computers,320,N/A,0,en

With this book, author Philipp K. Janert demonstrates how the same principles that govern cruise control in your car also apply to data center management and other enterprise systems. Through case studies and hands-on simulations, you’ll learn methods to solve several control issues, including mechanisms to spin up more servers automatically when web traffic spikes. Feedback is ideal for controlling large, complex systems, but its use in software engineering raises unique issues. This book provides basic theory and lots of practical advice for programmers with no previous background in feedback control. Learn feedback concepts and controller design Get practical techniques for implementing and tuning controllers Use feedback “design patterns” for common control scenarios Maintain a cache’s “hit rate” by automatically adjusting its size Respond to web traffic by scaling server instances automatically Explore ways to use feedback principles with queueing systems Learn how to control memory consumption in a game engine Take a deep dive into feedback control theory",Computers,285,N/A,0,en

The Tides of Mind: Uncovering the Spectrum of Consciousness,David Gelernter,W. W. Norton & Company,2016-02-22,"A “rock star” (New York Times) of the computing world provides a radical new work on the meaning of human consciousness. The holy grail of psychologists and scientists for nearly a century has been to understand and replicate both human thought and the human mind. In fact, it's what attracted the now-legendary computer scientist and AI authority David Gelernter to the discipline in the first place. As a student and young researcher in the 1980s, Gelernter hoped to build a program with a dial marked ""focus."" At maximum ""focus,"" the program would ""think"" rationally, formally, reasonably. As the dial was turned down and ""focus"" diminished, its ""mind"" would start to wander, and as you dialed even lower, this artificial mind would start to free-associate, eventually ignoring the user completely as it cruised off into the mental adventures we know as sleep. While the program was a only a partial success, it laid the foundation for The Tides of Mind, a groundbreaking new exploration of the human psyche that shows us how the very purpose of the mind changes throughout the day. Indeed, as Gelernter explains, when we are at our most alert, when reasoning and creating new memories is our main mental business, the mind is a computer-like machine that keeps emotion on a short leash and attention on our surroundings. As we gradually tire, however, and descend the ""mental spectrum,"" reasoning comes unglued. Memory ranges more freely, the mind wanders, and daydreams grow more insistent. Self-awareness fades, reflection blinks out, and at last we are completely immersed in our own minds. With far-reaching implications, Gelernter’s landmark ""Spectrum of Consciousness"" finally helps decode some of the most mysterious wonders of the human mind, such as the numinous light of early childhood, why dreams are so often predictive, and why sadism and masochism underpin some of our greatest artistic achievements. It’s a theory that also challenges the very notion of the mind as a machine—and not through empirical studies or ""hard science"" but by listening to our great poets and novelists, who have proven themselves as humanity's most trusted guides to the subjective mind and inner self. In the great introspective tradition of Wilhelm Wundt and René Descartes, David Gelernter promises to not only revolutionize our understanding of what it means to be human but also to help answer many of our most fundamental questions about the origins of creativity, thought, and consciousness.",Science,240,N/A,0,en

Universal Algebra and Applications in Theoretical Computer Science,"Klaus Denecke, Shelly L. Wismath",CRC Press,2018-10-03,"Over the past 20 years, the emergence of clone theory, hyperequational theory, commutator theory and tame congruence theory has led to a growth of universal algebra both in richness and in applications, especially in computer science. Yet most of the classic books on the subject are long out of print and, to date, no other book has integrated these theories with the long-established work that supports them. Universal Algebra and Applications in Theoretical Computer Science introduces the basic concepts of universal algebra and surveys some of the newer developments in the field. The first half of the book provides a solid grounding in the core material. A leisurely pace, careful exposition, numerous examples, and exercises combine to form an introduction to the subject ideal for beginning graduate students or researchers from other areas. The second half of the book focuses on applications in theoretical computer science and advanced topics, including Mal'cev conditions, tame congruence theory, clones, and commutators. The impact of the advances in universal algebra on computer science is just beginning to be realized, and the field will undoubtedly continue to grow and mature. Universal Algebra and Applications in Theoretical Computer Science forms an outstanding text and offers a unique opportunity to build the foundation needed for further developments in its theory and in its computer science applications.",Mathematics,396,N/A,0,en

The Age of Spiritual Machines,Ray Kurzweil,Penguin,2000-01-01,"NATIONAL BESTSELLER • Bold futurist Ray Kurzweil, author of The Singularity Is Near, offers a framework for envisioning the future of machine intelligence—“a book for anyone who wonders where human technology is going next” (The New York Times Book Review). “Kurzweil offers a thought-provoking analysis of human and artificial intelligence and a unique look at a future in which the capabilities of the computer and the species that invented it grow ever closer.”—BILL GATES Imagine a world where the difference between man and machine blurs, where the line between humanity and technology fades, and where the soul and the silicon chip unite. This is not science fiction. This is the twenty-first century according to Ray Kurzweil, the “restless genius” (The Wall Street Journal), “ultimate thinking machine” (Forbes), and inventor of the most innovative and compelling technology of our era. In his inspired hands, life in the new millennium no longer seems daunting. Instead, it promises to be an age in which the marriage of human sensitivity and artificial intelligence fundamentally alters and improves the way we live. More than just a list of predictions, Kurzweil’s prophetic blueprint for the future guides us through the inexorable advances that will result in: • Computers exceeding the memory capacity and computational ability of the human brain (with human-level capabilities not far behind) • Relationships with automated personalities who will be our teachers, companions, and lovers • Information fed straight into our brains along direct neural pathways Eventually, the distinction between humans and computers will have become sufficiently blurred that when the machines claim to be conscious, we will believe them.",Computers,404,3,1,en

Magic Trash,J. H. Shapiro,Charlesbridge,2015-01-06,"Vacant lots. Abandoned houses. Trash--lots of trash. Heidelberg Street was in trouble! Tyree Guyton loved his childhood home--that's where his grandpa Sam taught him to ""paint the world."" So he wanted to wake people up... to make them see Detroit's crumbling communities. Paintbrush in hand, Tyree cast his artistic spell, transforming everyday junk into magic trash. Soon local kids and families joined Tyree in rebuilding their neighborhood, discovering the healing power of art along the way. This picture book biography of Tyree Guyton, an urban environmental artist, shows how he transformed his decaying, crime-ridden neighborhood into the Heidelberg Project, an interactive sculpture park. The story spans from Tyree's childhood in 1950s Detroit to his early efforts to heal his community through art in the 1980s. Tyree's awards include Michigan Artist of the Year and International Artist. MAGIC TRASH offers strong themes of working together, the power of art, and the importance of inspiring community--especially kids--to affect action. The Heidelberg Project is internationally recognized for providing arts education to children and adults and for the ongoing development of several houses on Heidelberg Street. Not only does the Heidelberg Project prove that when a community works together it can rebuild itself, but it also addresses the issues of recycling, environmentalism, and community on a global level.",Juvenile Nonfiction,35,N/A,0,en

Introducing Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD),Chinmay K. Maiti,CRC Press,2017-03-16,"This might be the first book that deals mostly with the 3D technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations of major state-of-the-art stress- and strain-engineered advanced semiconductor devices: MOSFETs, BJTs, HBTs, nonclassical MOS devices, finFETs, silicon-germanium hetero-FETs, solar cells, power devices, and memory devices. The book focuses on how to set up 3D TCAD simulation tools, from mask layout to process and device simulation, including design for manufacturing (DFM), and from device modeling to SPICE parameter extraction. The book also offers an innovative and new approach to teaching the fundamentals of semiconductor process and device design using advanced TCAD simulations of various semiconductor structures. The simulation examples chosen are from the most popular devices in use today and provide useful technology and device physics insights. To extend the role of TCAD in today’s advanced technology era, process compact modeling and DFM issues have been included for design–technology interface generation. Unique in approach, this book provides an integrated view of silicon technology and beyond—with emphasis on TCAD simulations. It is the first book to provide a web-based online laboratory for semiconductor device characterization and SPICE parameter extraction. It describes not only the manufacturing practice associated with the technologies used but also the underlying scientific basis for those technologies. Written from an engineering standpoint, this book provides the process design and simulation background needed to understand new and future technology development, process modeling, and design of nanoscale transistors. The book also advances the understanding and knowledge of modern IC design via TCAD, improves the quality in micro- and nanoelectronics R&D, and supports the training of semiconductor specialists. It is intended as a textbook or reference for graduate students in the field of semiconductor fabrication and as a reference for engineers involved in VLSI technology development who have to solve device and process problems. CAD specialists will also find this book useful since it discusses the organization of the simulation system, in addition to presenting many case studies where the user applies TCAD tools in different situations.",Science,438,N/A,0,en

Quantum Computer Science,"Marco Lanzagorta, Jeffrey K. Uhlmann",Morgan & Claypool Publishers,2009,"In this text we present a technical overview of the emerging field of quantum computation along with new research results by the authors. What distinguishes our presentation from that of others is our focus on the relationship between quantum computation and computer science. Specifically, our emphasis is on the computational model of quantum computing rather than on the engineering issues associated with its physical implementation. We adopt this approach for the same reason that a book on computer programming doesn't cover the theory and physical realization of semiconductors. Another distinguishing feature of this text is our detailed discussion of the circuit complexity of quantum algorithms. To the extent possible we have presented the material in a form that is accessible to the computer scientist, but in many cases we retain the conventional physics notation so that the reader will also be able to consult the relevant quantum computing literature. Although we expect the reader to have a solid understanding of linear algebra, we do not assume a background in physics. This text is based on lectures given as short courses and invited presentations around the world, and it has been used as the primary text for a graduate course at George Mason University. In all these cases our challenge has been the same: how to present to a general audience a concise introduction to the algorithmic structure and applications of quantum computing on an extremely short period of time. The feedback from these courses and presentations has greatly aided in making our exposition of challenging concepts more accessible to a general audience.

"Stuck in the Shallow End, updated edition",Jane Margolis,MIT Press,2017-03-03,"Why so few African American and Latino/a students study computer science: updated edition of a book that reveals the dynamics of inequality in American schools. The number of African Americans and Latino/as receiving undergraduate and advanced degrees in computer science is disproportionately low. And relatively few African American and Latino/a high school students receive the kind of institutional encouragement, educational opportunities, and preparation needed for them to choose computer science as a field of study and profession. In Stuck in the Shallow End, Jane Margolis and coauthors look at the daily experiences of students and teachers in three Los Angeles public high schools: an overcrowded urban high school, a math and science magnet school, and a well-funded school in an affluent neighborhood. They find an insidious “virtual segregation” that maintains inequality. The race gap in computer science, Margolis discovers, is one example of the way students of color are denied a wide range of occupational and educational futures. Stuck in the Shallow End is a story of how inequality is reproduced in America—and how students and teachers, given the necessary tools, can change the system. Since the 2008 publication of Stuck in the Shallow End, the book has found an eager audience among teachers, school administrators, and academics. This updated edition offers a new preface detailing the progress in making computer science accessible to all, a new postscript, and discussion questions (coauthored by Jane Margolis and Joanna Goode).",Education,245,N/A,0,en

Connections,"H. Peter Alesso, Craig F. Smith",John Wiley & Sons,2008-01-18,"""In their fascinating analysis of the recent history of information technology, H. Peter Alesso and Craig F. Smith reveal the patterns in discovery and innovation that have brought us to the present tipping point. . . . A generation from now, every individual will have personally tailored access to the whole of knowledge . . . the sooner we all begin to think about how we got here, and where we're going, the better. This exciting book is an essential first step."" —From the Foreword by James Burke Many people envision scientists as dispassionate characters who slavishly repeat experiments until ""eureka""—something unexpected happens. Actually, there is a great deal more to the story of scientific discovery, but seeing ""the big picture"" is not easy. Connections: Patterns of Discovery uses the primary tools of forecasting and three archetypal patterns of discovery—Serendipity, Proof of Principle, and 1% Inspiration and 99% Perspiration—to discern relationships of past developments and synthesize a cohesive and compelling vision for the future. It challenges readers to think of the consequences of extrapolating trends, such as Moore's Law, to either reach real machine intelligence or retrench in the face of physical limitations. From this perspective,the book draws ""the big picture"" for the Information Revolution's innovations in chips, devices, software, and networks. With a Foreword by James Burke and bursting with fascinating detail throughout, Connections: Patterns of Discovery is a must-read for computer scientists, technologists, programmers, hardware and software developers, students, and anyone with an interest in tech-savvy topics.",Technology & Engineering,223,N/A,0,en

KADS approaches development as a modeling activity. Two key characteristics of KADS are the use of multiple models to cope with the complexity of knowledge engineering and the use of knowledge-level descriptions as an immediate model between system design and expertise data. The result is that KADS enables effective KBS construction by building a computational model of desired behavior for a particular problem domain. KADS contains three section: the Theoretical Basis of KADS, Languages and Tools, and Applications. Together they form a comprehensive sourcebook of the how and why of the KADS methodology. KADS will be required reading for all academic and industrial professionals concerned with building knowledge-based systems. It will also be a valuable source for students of knowledge acquisition and KBS. * SPECIAL FEATURES: * KADS is the most widely used commercial structured methodology for KBS development in Europe and is becoming one of the few significant AI exports to the US. * Describes KADS from its Theoretical Basis, through Language and Tool Developments, to real Applications.",Computers,484,N/A,0,en

Computer Supported Collaborative Learning,Claire O'Malley,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Although research in collaborative learning has a fairly long history, dating back at least to the early work of Piaget and Vygotsky, it is only recently that workers have begun to apply some of its findings to the design of computer based learning systems. The early generation of the!le systems focused on their potential for supporting individual learning: learning could be self paced; teaching could be adapted to individual learners' needs. This was certainly the promise of the later generation of intelligent tutoring systems. However, this promise has yet to be realised. Not only are there still some very difficult research problems to solve in providing adaptive learning systems, but there are also some very real practical constraints on the widespread take up of individualised computer based instruction. Reseachers soon began to realise that the organisational, cultural and social contexts of the classroom have to be taken into account in designing systems to promote effective learning. Much of the work that goes on in classrooms is collaborative, whether by design or not. Teachers also need to be able to adapt the technology to their varying needs. Developments in technology, such as networking, have also contributed to changes in the way in which computers may be envisaged to support learning. In September 1989, a group of researchers met in Maratea, Italy, for a NATO-sponsored workshop on ""Computer supported collaborative . learning"".

When Computers Went to Sea,David L.

This is the only book written on the United States Navy's initial application of shipboard digital computers to naval warfare. Considered one of the most successful projects ever undertaken by the US Navy, the Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS) was the subject of numerous studies attempting to pinpoint the reason for the systems inordinate success in the face of seemingly impossible technical challenges and stiff resistance from some in the military. The system's success precipitated a digital revolution in naval warfare systems. Dave Boslaugh details the innovations developed by the NTDS project managers including: project management techniques, modular digital hardware for ship systems, top-down modular computer programming techniques, innovative computer program documentation, and other novel real-time computer system concepts. Automated military systems users and developers, real-time process control systems designers, automated system project managers, and digital technology history students will find this account of a United States military organization's initial foray into computerization interesting and thought provoking.",Computers,504,N/A,0,en

Parallel Computation and Computers for Artificial Intelligence,J.S. Kowalik,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"It has been widely recognized that artificial intelligence computations offer large potential for distributed and parallel processing. Unfortunately, not much is known about designing parallel AI algorithms and efficient, easy-to-use parallel computer architectures for AI applications. The field of parallel computation and computers for AI is in its infancy, but some significant ideas have appeared and initial practical experience has become available. The purpose of this book has been to collect in one volume contributions from several leading researchers and pioneers of AI that represent a sample of these ideas and experiences. This sample does not include all schools of thought nor contributions from all leading researchers, but it covers a relatively wide variety of views and topics and in this sense can be helpful in assessing the state ofthe art. We hope that the book will serve, at least, as a pointer to more specialized literature and that it will stimulate interest in the area of parallel AI processing. It has been a great pleasure and a privilege to cooperate with all contributors to this volume. They have my warmest thanks and gratitude. Mrs. Birgitta Knapp has assisted me in the editorial task and demonstrated a great deal of skill and patience. Janusz S.

"A Bibliographic Guide to the History of Computing, Computers, and the Information Processing Industry",,Greenwood,1990-05-21,"As millions of people have been exposed to computing through the tremendous growth of microcomputers, there has developed an increasing appreciation of the history of data processing, which dates back many decades before the arrival of the computer. Stretching back to at least the 1860s, such early technologies as adding machines, punch cards, and the office appliance industry are now being recognized for their place in the history of the information processing industry. This work brings together a comprehensive list of sources that offer a general introduction to the literature of the industry. Divided into nine chapters covering topics and historical periods, the bibliography provides an annotated list of published materials describing both the history of the industry and significant items of general interest. Each chapter is introduced with a short review of historically important issues and comments on the literature, and contains contemporary publications as well as more recent material. To give the work a continuing usefulness, ongoing publications, such as computer magazines, are highlighted. Entries are grouped under nearly 100 subheadings, covering such material as contemporary descriptions of hardware and software of the past, seminal technical papers, industry surveys, programming languages, significant individuals and companies, and the role of Japan and microcomputing. All citations are annotated with a brief summary of either the work's contents or its historical importance, while two indexes provide both subject references and author citations. This bibliography will be an important reference source for courses in the history of data processing and business history, and a useful addition to public, college, and university libraries.",Business & Economics,674,N/A,0,en

Pyramidal Systems for Computer Vision,"Virginio Cantoni, Stefano Levialdi",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This book contains the proceedings of the NATO Advanced Research Workshop held in Maratea (Italy), May 5-9, 1986 on Pyramidal Systems for Image Processing and Computer Vision. We had 40 participants from 11 countries playing an active part in the workshop and all the leaders of groups that have produced a prototype pyramid machine or a design for such a machine were present. Within the wide field of parallel architectures for image processing a new area was recently born and is growing healthily: the area of pyramidally structured multiprocessing systems. Essentially, the processors are arranged in planes (from a base to an apex) each one of which is generally a reduced (usually by a power of two) version of the plane underneath: these processors are horizontally interconnected (within a plane) and vertically connected with ""fathers"" (on top planes) and ""children"" on the plane below. This arrangement has a number of interesting features, all of which were amply discussed in our Workshop including the cellular array and hypercube versions of pyramids. A number of projects (in different parts of the world) are reported as well as some interesting applications in computer vision, tactile systems and numerical calculations.",Computers,391,N/A,0,en

What Computers Still Can't Do,Hubert L. Dreyfus,MIT Press,1992-10-30,"When it was first published in 1972, Hubert Dreyfus's manifesto on the inherent inability of disembodied machines to mimic higher mental functions caused an uproar in the artificial intelligence community. The world has changed since then. Today it is clear that ""good old-fashioned AI,"" based on the idea of using symbolic representations to produce general intelligence, is in decline (although several believers still pursue its pot of gold), and the focus of the Al community has shifted to more complex models of the mind. It has also become more common for AI researchers to seek out and study philosophy. For this edition of his now classic book, Dreyfus has added a lengthy new introduction outlining these changes and assessing the paradigms of connectionism and neural networks that have transformed the field. At a time when researchers were proposing grand plans for general problem solvers and automatic translation machines, Dreyfus predicted that they would fail because their conception of mental functioning was naive, and he suggested that they would do well to acquaint themselves with modern philosophical approaches to human beings. What Computers Can't Do was widely attacked but quietly studied. Dreyfus's arguments are still provocative and focus our attention once again on what it is that makes human beings unique.",Computers,412,5,1,en

Chromatic Algorithms,Carolyn L. Kane,University of Chicago Press,2014-08-13,"These days, we take for granted that our computer screens—and even our phones—will show us images in vibrant full color. Digital color is a fundamental part of how we use our devices, but we never give a thought to how it is produced or how it came about. Chromatic Algorithms reveals the fascinating history behind digital color, tracing it from the work of a few brilliant computer scientists and experimentally minded artists in the late 1960s and early ‘70s through to its appearance in commercial software in the early 1990s. Mixing philosophy of technology, aesthetics, and media analysis, Carolyn Kane shows how revolutionary the earliest computer-generated colors were—built with the massive postwar number-crunching machines, these first examples of “computer art” were so fantastic that artists and computer scientists regarded them as psychedelic, even revolutionary, harbingers of a better future for humans and machines. But, Kane shows, the explosive growth of personal computing and its accompanying need for off-the-shelf software led to standardization and the gradual closing of the experimental field in which computer artists had thrived. Even so, the gap between the bright, bold presence of color onscreen and the increasing abstraction of its underlying code continues to lure artists and designers from a wide range of fields, and Kane draws on their work to pose fascinating questions about the relationships among art, code, science, and media in the twenty-first century.",Science,353,N/A,0,en

Human Factors in Analysis and Design of Information Systems,"Anthony Finkelstein, Michael J. Tauber, Roland Traunmüller",North Holland,1990,"Information systems may be regarded as an interaction of people and machines. In the past, however, human factors took second place. Nowadays, the need to provide: (i) a functionality that meets the user's needs and (ii) an ergonomic human-machine interface - which takes the way people would like to solve their tasks into consideration - are both recognised as primary concerns by the designers of information systems. The two major themes of this book are as follows: - As new methods and rigorous techniques come into use, the proportion of information systems development effort devoted to analysis and design is set to increase, and the study of human factors also to increase in importance. Methods, representation schemes, tools and environments cannot be applied without a systematic understanding of their use by analysts and designers in development teams. The book presents research results in this area. - Much study in software development has concentrated on a human factors perspective of the end user'. However, this work has to be placed in the overall context of systematic analysis and design of information systems. The book presents some new developments.",Business & Economics,260,N/A,0,en

Understanding Software Dynamics,Richard L Sites,Addison-Wesley Professional,2021-11-02,"An Expert Guide to Software Performance Optimization From mobile and cloud apps to video games to driverless vehicle control, more and more software is time-constrained: It must deliver reliable results seamlessly, consistently, and virtually instantaneously. If it doesn't, customers are unhappy--and sometimes lives are put at risk. When complex software underperforms or fails, software engineers need to identify and address the root causes. This is difficult and, historically, few tools have been available to help. In Understanding Software Dynamics, performance expert Richard L. Sites tackles the problem head on, offering expert methods and advanced tools for understanding complex, time-constrained software dynamics, improving reliability and troubleshooting challenging performance problems. Sites draws on several decades of experience pioneering software performance optimization, as well as extensive experience teaching graduate-level developers. He introduces principles and techniques for use in any environment, from embedded devices to datacenters, illuminating them with examples based on x86 or ARM processors running Linux and linked by Ethernet. He also guides readers through building and applying a powerful, new, extremely low-overhead open-source software tool, KUtrace, to precisely trace executions on every CPU core. Using insights gleaned from this tool, readers can apply nuanced solutions--not merely brute-force techniques such as turning off caches or cores. Measure and address issues associated with CPUs, memory, disk/SSD, networks, and their interactions Fix programs that are always too slow, and those that sometimes lag for no apparent reason Design useful observability, logging, and time-stamping capabilities into your code Reason more effectively about performance data to see why reality differs from expectations Identify problems such as excess execution, slow instruction execution, waiting for resources, and software locks Understanding Software Dynamics will be valuable to experienced software professionals, including application and OS developers, hardware and system architects, real-time system designers, and game developers, as well as advanced students.

Building Your Own Computer Made Easy,James Bernstein,N/A,2019,"Everyone has to get a new computer at some time or another so why not get the computer you always wanted? Sure you can buy a nice computer off of the store shelf but you never really get exactly what you want that way. When you build your own computer, you are in charge of what components are going to be used so you know that it will perform the way you want it to. The goal of this book is to help you choose the parts (components) for your new computer so you can end up with a computer that does what you want it to do. Then you will be taken through the build process with step by step instructions and illustrations making it easy to get your new computer up and running in no time. Finally you will be guided through the process of installing an operating system on your computer so you can start enjoying your work.

The Cultural Logic of Computation,David Golumbia,Harvard University Press,2009-04-30,"Advocates of computers make sweeping claims for their inherently transformative power: new and different from previous technologies, they are sure to resolve many of our existing social problems, and perhaps even to cause a positive political revolution. In The Cultural Logic of Computation, David Golumbia, who worked as a software designer for more than ten years, confronts this orthodoxy, arguing instead that computers are cultural “all the way down”—that there is no part of the apparent technological transformation that is not shaped by historical and cultural processes, or that escapes existing cultural politics. From the perspective of transnational corporations and governments, computers benefit existing power much more fully than they provide means to distribute or contest it. Despite this, our thinking about computers has developed into a nearly invisible ideology Golumbia dubs “computationalism”—an ideology that informs our thinking not just about computers, but about economic and social trends as sweeping as globalization. Driven by a programmer’s knowledge of computers as well as by a deep engagement with contemporary literary and cultural studies and poststructuralist theory, The Cultural Logic of Computation provides a needed corrective to the uncritical enthusiasm for computers common today in many parts of our culture.",Computers,276,5,1,en

Computer Architecture,"John L. Hennessy, David A. Patterson",Elsevier,2006-11-03,"The era of seemingly unlimited growth in processor performance is over: single chip architectures can no longer overcome the performance limitations imposed by the power they consume and the heat they generate. Today, Intel and other semiconductor firms are abandoning the single fast processor model in favor of multi-core microprocessors--chips that combine two or more processors in a single package. In the fourth edition of Computer Architecture, the authors focus on this historic shift, increasing their coverage of multiprocessors and exploring the most effective ways of achieving parallelism as the key to unlocking the power of multiple processor architectures. Additionally, the new edition has expanded and updated coverage of design topics beyond processor performance, including power, reliability, availability, and dependability.

Transparent Designs,Michael L. Black,JHU Press,2022-03-29,"This fascinating cultural history of the personal computer explains how user-friendly design allows tech companies to build systems that we cannot understand. Modern personal computers are easy to use, and their welcoming, user-friendly interfaces encourage us to see them as designed for our individual benefit. Rarely, however, do these interfaces invite us to consider how our individual uses support the broader political and economic strategies of their designers. In Transparent Designs, Michael L. Black revisits early debates from hobbyist newsletters, computing magazines, user manuals, and advertisements about how personal computers could be seen as usable and useful by the average person. Black examines how early personal computers from the Tandy TRS-80 and Commodore PET to the IBM PC and Apple Macintosh were marketed to an American public that was high on the bold promises of the computing revolution but also skeptical about their ability to participate in it. Through this careful archival study, he shows how many of the foundational principles of usability theory were shaped through disagreements over the languages and business strategies developed in response to this skepticism. In short, this book asks us to consider the consequences of a computational culture that is based on the assumption that the average person does not need to know anything about the internal operations of the computers we've come to depend on for everything. Expanding our definition of usability, Transparent Designs examines how popular and technical rhetoric shapes user expectations about what counts as usable and useful as much as or even more so than hardware and software interfaces. Offering a fresh look at the first decade of personal computing, Black highlights how the concept of usability has been leveraged historically to smooth over conflicts between the rhetoric of computing and its material experience. Readers interested in vintage computing, the history of technology, digital rhetoric, or American culture will be fascinated in this book.",Technology & Engineering,278,N/A,0,en

When Computers Went to Sea,David L. Boslaugh,John Wiley & Sons,2003-04-16,"When Computers Went to Sea explores the history of the United States Navy's secret development of code-breaking computers and their adaptation to solve a critical fleet radar data handling problem in the Navy's first seaborne digital computer system - that went to sea in 1962. This is the only book written on the United States Navy's initial application of shipboard digital computers to naval warfare. Considered one of the most successful projects ever undertaken by the US Navy, the Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS) was the subject of numerous studies attempting to pinpoint the reason for the systems inordinate success in the face of seemingly impossible technical challenges and stiff resistance from some in the military. The system's success precipitated a digital revolution in naval warfare systems. Dave Boslaugh details the innovations developed by the NTDS project managers including: project management techniques, modular digital hardware for ship systems, top-down modular computer programming techniques, innovative computer program documentation, and other novel real-time computer system concepts. Automated military systems users and developers, real-time process control systems designers, automated system project managers, and digital technology history students will find this account of a United States military organization's initial foray into computerization interesting and thought provoking.",Computers,501,N/A,0,en

"Computers and the Teaching of Writing in American Higher Education, 1979-1994",Gail E. Hawisher,Praeger,1996,"This book is a history composed of histories. Its particular focus is the way in which computers entered and changed the field of composition studies, a field that defines itself both as a research community and as a community of teachers. This may have a somewhat sinister suggestion that technology alone has agency, but this history (made of histories) is not principally about computers. It is about people-the teachers and scholars who have adapted the computer to their personal and professional purposes. From the authors' perspectives, change in technology drives changes in the ways we live and work, and we, agents to a degree in control of our own lives, use technology to achieve our human purposes. REVIEW: . . . This book reminds those of us now using computers to teach writing where we have been, and it brings those who are just entering the field up to date. More important, it will inform administrators, curriculum specialists, and others responsible for implementing the future uses of technology in writing instruction. - Computers and Composition",Computers,380,N/A,0,en
Computer Organization and Assembly Language Programming,James L. Peterson,Academic Press,2014-05-10,"Computer Organization and Assembly Language Programming deals with lower level computer programming-machine or assembly language, and how these are used in the typical computer system. The book explains the operations of the computer at the machine language level. The text reviews basic computer operations, organization, and deals primarily with the MIX computer system. The book describes assembly language programming techniques, such as defining appropriate data structures, determining the information for input or output, and the flow of control within the program. The text explains basic I/O programming concepts, technique of interrupts, and an overlapped I/O. The text also describes the use of subroutines to reduce the number of codes that are repetitively written for the program. An assembler can translate a program from assembly language into a loader code for loading into the computer's memory for execution. A loader can be of several types such as absolute, relocatable, or a variation of the other two types. A linkage editor links various small segments into one large segment with an output format similar to an input format for easier program handling. The book also describes the use of other programming languages which can offer to the programmer the power of an assembly language by his using the syntax of a higher-level language. The book is intended as a textbook for a second course in computer programming, following the recommendations of the ACM Curriculum 68 for Course B2 ""Computers and Programming.",Reference,465,N/A,0,en

What Computers Still Can't Do,Hubert L. Dreyfus,MIT Press,1992-10-30,"When it was first published in 1972, Hubert Dreyfus's manifesto on the inherent inability of disembodied machines to mimic higher mental functions caused an uproar in the artificial intelligence community. The world has changed since then. Today it is clear that ""good old-fashioned AI,"" based on the idea of using symbolic representations to produce general intelligence, is in decline (although several believers still pursue its pot of gold), and the focus of the Al community has shifted to more complex models of the mind. It has also become more common for AI researchers to seek out and study philosophy. For this edition of his now classic book, Dreyfus has added a lengthy new introduction outlining these changes and assessing the paradigms of connectionism and neural networks that have transformed the field. At a time when researchers were proposing grand plans for general problem solvers and automatic translation machines, Dreyfus predicted that they would fail because their conception of mental functioning was naive, and he suggested that they would do well to acquaint themselves with modern philosophical approaches to human beings. What Computers Can't Do was widely attacked but quietly studied.

Computer Work Stations,Herman R. Holtz,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Most of us do not realize that we are living in revolutionary times. To a large degree, we are in a time of massive economic and industrial change, and perhaps history will one day record this era as the Second Industrial Revolution. Certainly we have been made aware of the decline of ""smoke stack industries"" and of the rapid rise of what might be called the ""infor mation industries"" in the United States and, presumably, in most of the western world. Several best-selling authors have assured us that we must change or perish, and a great many industrialists appear to agree. Ironically, we have also been all but promised a return to a modern form of that very cottage industry economy that the first Industrial Revolution wiped out: Some of our leading savants envision individuals working at home on desktop computers, connected via hardwire (telephone) to an employer's large, central computer. Will this come to pass? Perhaps; the industrial/economic indicators appear to point in that direction, although there are the problems of numerous laws and regulations -labor laws and OSHA laws, to name only two areas, and ignoring for the moment the reaction of our labor unions - that would be most difficult to reconcile with such an arrangement.

Until 1967 there was no comprehensive multilingual dictionary on the subject; former publications were incomplete and out of date and lacked clear definition - often leading to disastrous misunderstandings. Furthermore, the subject of printing, paper and ink technology had never been dealt with, in dictionary form, in relation to other aspects of the graphic industry.This new work, prepared by F.J.M.

Information Technology Policy,Richard Coopey,OUP Oxford,2004-08-26,"Information Technology has become symbolic of modernity and progress almost since its inception. The nature and boundaries of IT have also meant that it has shaped, or become embedded within a wide range of other scientific, technological and economic developments. Governments, from the outset, saw the computer as a strategic technology, a keystone of economic development and an area where technology policy should be targeted. This was true for those economies interested in maintaining their technological and economic leadership, but also figured strongly in the developmental programmes of those seeking to modernise or catch up. So strong was the notion that IT policy should be the centre of economic strategy that predominant political economic ideologies have frequently been subverted or distorted to allow for special efforts to promote either the production or use of IT. This book brings together a series of country-based studies to examine, in depth, the nature and extent of IT policies as they have evolved from a complex historical interaction of politics, technology, institutions, and social and cultural factors. In doing so many key questions are critically examined. Where can we find successful examples of IT policy? Who has shaped policy? Who did governments turn to for advice in framing policy? Several chapters outline the impact of military influence on IT. What is the precise nature of this influence on IT development? How closely were industry leaders linked to government programs and to what extent were these programs, particularly those aimed at the generation of 'national champions', misconceived through undue special pleading? How effective were government personnel and politicians in assessing the merits of programs predicated on technological trajectories extrapolated from increasingly complex and specialised information? This book will be of interest to academics and graduate students of Management Studies, History, Economics, and Technology Studies, and Government and Corporate policy makers engaged with IT and Technology policy.",Business & Economics,363,N/A,0,en
Generative Modeling for Computer Graphics and Cad,John M. Snyder,Academic Press,2014-05-10,"Generative Modeling for Computer Graphics and Cad: Symbolic Shape Design Using Interval Analysis presents a symbolic approach to shape representation that is useful to the CAD/CAM and computer graphics communities. This book discusses the kinds of operators useful in a geometric modeling system, including arithmetic operators, vector and matrix operators, integration, differentiation, constraint solution, and constrained minimization. Associated with each operator are several methods that compute properties about the parametric functions represented with the operators. This text also elaborates how numerous rendering and analytical operations can be supported with only three methods—evaluation of the parametric function at a point, symbolic differentiation of the parametric function, and evaluation of an inclusion function for the parametric function. This publication is intended for people working in the area of computational geometry who are interested in a robust class of algorithms for manipulating shapes and those who want to know how human beings can specify and manipulate shape.",Mathematics,342,N/A,0,en

"Computers, Chess and Long-Range Planning",Michail M. Botvinnik,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Mihail Moiseevich Botvinnik is an electrical engineer by profession; during World War II he headed a high-tension laboratory in the Urals and was decorated by the USSR for his accomplishments. At present, he is the head of the alternating-current machine laboratory at the Moscow Institute of Power Engineering. He is also a world-renowned chess player. He was born in 1911, and by 1935 had become a Grandmaster of Soviet chess. In 1948 he won the world chess championship and held the title until 1963 (except for a two-year break). His chess style has been characterized as deep, objective, serious, and courageous. In this book, the quality of his thinking is revealed in his study of the basic thought processes of master chess players, and his reduction of these processes to mathematical form. This formalization of thought processes is a contribution to science at three levels: at the immediate level, it provides a basis for a computer program that seems likely to succeed in playing chess; at the middle level, game-playing programs help us to study and rationalize the processes of planning and decision-making; and, at the highest level, the study of the mind in action, as in the game of chess, leads to an understanding of human thought and of the human psyche.",Computers,97,N/A,0,en

Failure to Connect,Jane M. Healy,Simon and Schuster,1999-07-13,"In this comprehensive, practical, and unsettling look at computers in children's lives, Jane M. Healy, Ph.D., questions whether computers are really helping or harming children's development. Once a bedazzled enthusiast of educational computing but now a troubled skeptic, Dr. Healy examines the advantages and drawbacks of computer use for kids at home and school, exploring its effects on children's health, creativity, brain development, and social and emotional growth. Today, the Federal Government allocates scarce educational funding to wire every classroom to the Internet, software companies churn out ""educational"" computer programs even for preschoolers, and school administrators cut funding and space for books, the arts, and physical education to make room for new computer hardware. It is past the time to address these issues. Many parents and even some educators have been sold on the idea that computer literacy is as important as reading and math. Those who haven't hopped on the techno bandwagon are left wondering whether they are shortchanging their children's education or their students' futures. Few people stop to consider that computers, used incorrectly, may do far more harm than good. New technologies can be valuable educational tools when used in age-appropriate ways by properly trained teachers. But too often schools budget insufficiently for teacher training and technical support. Likewise, studies suggest that few parents know how to properly assist children's computer learning; much computer time at home may be wasted time, drawing children away from other developmentally important activities such as reading, hobbies, or creative play. Moreover, Dr. Healy finds that much so-called learning software is more ""edutainment"" than educational, teaching students more about impulsively pointing and clicking for some trivial goal than about how to think, to communicate, to imagine, or to solve problems. Some software, used without careful supervision, may also have the potential to interrupt a child's internal motivation to learn. Failure to Connect is the first book to link children's technology use to important new findings about stages of child development and brain maturation, which are clearly explained throughout. It illustrates, through dozens of concrete examples and guidelines, how computers can be used successfully with children of different age groups as supplements to classroom curricula, as research tools, or in family projects. Dr. Healy issues strong warnings, however, against too early computer use, recommending little or no exposure before age seven, when the brain is primed to take on more abstract challenges. She also lists resources for reliable reviews of child-oriented software, suggests questions parents should ask when their children are using computers in school, and discusses when and how to manage computer use at home. Finally, she offers a thoughtful look at the question of which skills today's children will really need for success in a technological future -- and how they may best acquire them. Based on years of research into learning and hundreds of hours of interviews and observations with school administrators, teachers, parents, and students, Failure to Connect is a timely and eye-opening examination of the central questions we must confront as technology increasingly influences the way we educate our children.",Education,337,N/A,0,en

Readings in Human-Computer Interaction,Ronald M.

In fact, the interface is often the most important factor in the success or failure of any computer system. Dealing with the numerous subtly interrelated issues and technical, behavioral, and aesthetic considerations consumes a large and increasing share of development time and a corresponding percentage of the total code for any given application. A revision of one of the most successful books on human-computer interaction, this compilation gives students, researchers, and practitioners an overview of the significant concepts and results in the field and a comprehensive guide to the research literature. Like the first edition, this book combines reprints of key research papers and case studies with synthesizing survey material and analysis by the editors. It is significantly reorganized, updated, and enhanced; over 90% of the papers are new. An invaluable resource for systems designers, cognitive scientists, computer scientists, managers, and anyone concerned with the effectiveness of user-computer interfaces, it is also designed for use as a primary or supplementary text for graduate and advanced undergraduate courses in human-computer interaction and interface design. - Human computer interaction--historical, intellectual, and social - Developing interactive systems, including design, evaluation methods, and development tools - The interaction experience, through a variety of sensory modalities including vision, touch, gesture, audition, speech, and language - Theories of information processing and issues of human-computer fit and adaptation",Computers,973,N/A,0,en

"Fundamentals of Wearable Computers and Augmented Reality, Second Edition",Woodrow Barfield,CRC Press,2015-07-23,"Data will not help you if you can’t see it where you need it. Or can’t collect it where you need it. Upon these principles, wearable technology was born. And although smart watches and fitness trackers have become almost ubiquitous, with in-body sensors on the horizon, the future applications of wearable computers hold so much more. A trusted reference for almost 15 years, Fundamentals of Wearable Computers and Augmented Reality goes beyond smart clothing to explore user interface design issues specific to wearable tech and areas in which it can be applied. Upon its initial publication, the first edition almost instantly became a trusted reference, setting the stage for the coming decade, in which the explosion in research and applications of wearable computers and augmented reality occurred. Written by expert researchers and teachers, each chapter in the second edition has been revised and updated to reflect advances in the field and provide fundamental knowledge on each topic, solidifying the book’s reputation as a valuable technical resource as well as a textbook for augmented reality and ubiquitous computing courses. New Chapters in the Second Edition Explore: Haptics Visual displays Use of augmented reality for surgery and manufacturing Technical issues of image registration and tracking Augmenting the environment with wearable audio interfaces Use of augmented reality in preserving cultural heritage Human-computer interaction and augmented reality technology Spatialized sound and augmented reality Augmented reality and robotics Computational clothing From a technology perspective, much of what is happening now with wearables and augmented reality would not have been possible even five years ago. In the fourteen years since the first edition burst on the scene, the capabilities and applications of both technologies are orders of magnitude faster, smaller, and cheaper. Yet the book’s overarching mission remains the same: to supply the fundamental information and basic knowledge about the design and use of wearable computers and augmented reality with the goal of enhancing people’s lives.",Computers,723,N/A,0,en

The Dream Machine,M. Mitchell Waldrop,Stripe Press,2018-09-25,"The story of the man who instigated the work that led to the internet—and shifted our understanding of what computers could be. Behind every great revolution is a vision and behind perhaps the greatest revolution of our time, personal computing, is the vision of J.C.R. Licklider. He did not design the first personal computers or write the software that ran on them, nor was he involved in the legendary early companies that brought them to the forefront of our everyday experience. He was instead a relentless visionary that saw the potential of the way individuals could interact with computers and software. At a time when computers were a short step removed from mechanical data processors, Licklider was writing treatises on ""human-computer symbiosis"", ""computers as communication devices"", and a now not-so-unfamiliar ""Intergalactic Network."" His ideas became so influential, his passion so contagious, that Waldrop called him ""computing's Johnny Appleseed. In a simultaneously compelling personal narrative and comprehensive historical exposition, Waldrop tells the story of the man who not only instigated the work that led to the internet, but also shifted our understanding of what computers were and could be. Included in this edition are also the original texts of Licklider's three most influential writings: 'Man-computer symbiosis' (1960), which outlines the vision that inspired the personal computer revolution of the 1970s; his 'Intergalactic Network' memo (1963), which outlines the vision that inspired the internet; and ""The computer as a communication device"" (1968, co-authored with Robert Taylor), which amplifies his vision for what the network could become.",Biography & Autobiography,583,N/A,0,en

Spirits in the Wires,Charles de Lint,Macmillan + ORM,2007-04-01,"Charles de Lint's Newford novels, loosely linked ""tales"" with overlapping characters set in an imaginary modern North American city, are tales of magic and myth afoot on today's city streets. But at the center of every de Lint story is the miracle of the human heart. And at the heart of Spirits in the Wires are Saskia Madding and Christiana Tree, both of whom are tied to perennial Newford character, the writer Christy Riddell. Are either Saskia or Christiana real? Christy's girlfriend, Saskia, believes she was born in a Web site, while Christiana is Christy's ""shadow-self""--all the parts of him that he cast out when he was seven years old. At a popular Newford on-line research and library Web site called the Wordwood, a mysterious ""crash"" occurs. Everyone visiting the site at the moment of the crash vanishes from where they were sitting in front of their computers. Saskia disappears right before Christy's eyes, along with countless others. Now Christy and his companions must journey into Newford's otherworld, where the Wordwood, it transpires, has a physical presence of its own...to rescue their missing friends and loved ones and to set this viral spirit right before it causes further harm.

The Definitive ANTLR 4 Reference,Terence Parr,Pragmatic Bookshelf,2013-01-15,"Programmers run into parsing problems all the time. Whether it's a data format like JSON, a network protocol like SMTP, a server configuration file for Apache, a PostScript/PDF file, or a simple spreadsheet macro language--ANTLR v4 and this book will demystify the process. ANTLR v4 has been rewritten from scratch to make it easier than ever to build parsers and the language applications built on top. This completely rewritten new edition of the bestselling Definitive ANTLR Reference shows you how to take advantage of these new features. Build your own languages with ANTLR v4, using ANTLR's new advanced parsing technology. In this book, you'll learn how ANTLR automatically builds a data structure representing the input (parse tree) and generates code that can walk the tree (visitor). You can use that combination to implement data readers, language interpreters, and translators. You'll start by learning how to identify grammar patterns in language reference manuals and then slowly start building increasingly complex grammars. Next, you'll build applications based upon those grammars by walking the automatically generated parse trees. Then you'll tackle some nasty language problems by parsing files containing more than one language (such as XML, Java, and Javadoc). You'll also see how to take absolute control over parsing by embedding Java actions into the grammar. You'll learn directly from well-known parsing expert Terence Parr, the ANTLR creator and project lead. You'll master ANTLR grammar construction and learn how to build language tools using the built-in parse tree visitor mechanism. The book teaches using real-world examples and shows you how to use ANTLR to build such things as a data file reader, a JSON to XML translator, an R parser, and a Java class->interface extractor. This book is your ticket to becoming a parsing guru! What You Need: ANTLR 4.0 and above. Java development tools.

"The Computer, the Writer and the Learner",Noel Williams,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Computers are gradually infiltrating all stages of the writing process. Increasingly, teachers, writers, students, software developers, technical authors, and computer scientists need to learn more about the effective use of computers for writing. This book discusses how computers can help support writing. It explores the issues associated with using computers to train and help writers, concentrating on computational and user aspects and reviewing practical, economic and institutional issues. Noel Williams balances theoretical and practical concerns, to meet the needs of researchers and practising trainers of writing. There is also a brief evaluation available software products, together with advice about the major considerations and pitfalls of working on custom-made software. The book is based on five years of research by the Communication and Information Research Group (CIRG) at Sheffield City Polytechnic into the value of computer-based approaches to training and helping writers. The work was funded and supported by the Training Agency, IBM, AT&T, Rolls Royce, NAB and GEC. The Computer, the Writer and the Learner is for people who are using, or are thinking of using, computers to teach or support writing, and for designers of computer-based writing systems. Many such people are unaware of the nature and use of existing systems, and of the possibilities they offer. Developers often lack detailed knowledge of other projects and of the range of users' needs. Although the bias of the book is towards the teacher, trainer and student, most of the content deals with issues that developers will want to know about.",Computers,239,N/A,0,en

Process Modelling and Model Analysis,"Ian T. Cameron, Katalin Hangos",Elsevier,2001-05-23,"Process Modelling and Model Analysis describes the use of models in process engineering. Process engineering is all about manufacturing--of just about anything! To manage processing and manufacturing systematically, the engineer has to bring together many different techniques and analyses of the interaction between various aspects of the process. For example, process engineers would apply models to perform feasibility analyses of novel process designs, assess environmental impact, and detect potential hazards or accidents. To manage complex systems and enable process design, the behavior of systems is reduced to simple mathematical forms. This book provides a systematic approach to the mathematical development of process models and explains how to analyze those models. Additionally, there is a comprehensive bibliography for further reading, a question and answer section, and an accompanying Web site developed by the authors with additional data and exercises. - Introduces a structured modeling methodology emphasizing the importance of the modeling goal and including key steps such as model verification, calibration, and validation - Focuses on novel and advanced modeling techniques such as discrete, hybrid, hierarchical, and empirical modeling - Illustrates the notions, tools, and techniques of process modeling with examples and advances applications",Technology & Engineering,561,4,2,en

Secure Computer and Network Systems,Nong Ye,John Wiley & Sons,2008-04-15,"Computer and network systems have given us unlimited opportunities of reducing cost, improving efficiency, and increasing revenues, as demonstrated by an increasing number of computer and network applications. Yet, our dependence on computer and network systems has also exposed us to new risks, which threaten the security of, and present new challenges for protecting our assets and information on computer and network systems. The reliability of computer and network systems ultimately depends on security and quality of service (QoS) performance. This book presents quantitative modeling and analysis techniques to address these numerous challenges in cyber attack prevention and detection for security and QoS, including: the latest research on computer and network behavior under attack and normal use conditions; new design principles and algorithms, which can be used by engineers and practitioners to build secure computer and network systems, enhance security practice and move to providing QoS assurance on the Internet; mathematical and statistical methods for achieving the accuracy and timeliness of cyber attack detection with the lowest computational overhead; guidance on managing admission control, scheduling, reservation and service of computer and network jobs to assure the service stability and end-to-end delay of those jobs even under Denial of Service attacks or abrupt demands.

Computers and Control in Clinical Medicine,"Ewart R. Carson, Derek G. Cramp",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-11-11,"This book is a collection of invited contributions, each reflec ting an area of medicine in which computing techniques have been successfully applied; but why the title? From a control system point of view the aim of clinical medicine is to recognise the deviation of a patient from the space of normality, and to propel and steer the patient along a trajectory back to that space. Acquiring and main taining the knowledge and skills of this process is the function of medicine. The first chapter expands on this view. Subsequent chapters written by experts in their respective areas cover a fair range of application. All give considerable insight as to the ways in which the control system approach, facilitated by computational tools, can be of value when applied to clinical problems. The idea for this book arose naturally out of a symposium held at the University of Sussex, Brighton, England, on ""Control System Concepts and Approaches in Clinical Medicine"" in April, 1982, spon sored by the Institute of Measurement and Control and co-sponsored by the Institution of Electrical Engineers and the Royal Society of Medicine.

Computers and the Collaborative Experience of Learning (1994),Charles Crook,Routledge,2018-02-06,"Originally published in 1994. Until this book was published, the application of computers to educational practice has received little input from psychological theory. Computers and the Collaborative Experience of Learning locates this topic within the contemporary movement of socio-cultural theory, drawing on the writing of Vygotsky and others. Charles Crook reviews psychological approaches to cognition and learning, in so far as they implicitly direct strategy in respect of computer-based learning. He also takes a novel stance in considering how new technology can enhance rather than undermine the social experience of learning and instruction, and can allow teachers to achieve more in the classroom. He argues that computers can provide the conditions for effective collaboration and enhance the social dimension of education. With its unique blend of theory and practice, from the primary school to university settings, Computers and the Collaborative Experience of Learning will be of interest to educational psychologists, as well as psychologists studying group processes, cognition and development.",Education,299,N/A,0,en

Parallel Computers 2,"R.W Hockney, C.R Jesshope",CRC Press,1988-01-01,"Since the publication of the first edition, parallel computing technology has gained considerable momentum. A large proportion of this has come from the improvement in VLSI techniques, offering one to two orders of magnitude more devices than previously possible. A second contributing factor in the fast development of the subject is commercialization. The supercomputer is no longer restricted to a few well-established research institutions and large companies. A new computer breed combining the architectural advantages of the supercomputer with the advance of VLSI technology is now available at very attractive prices. A pioneering device in this development is the transputer, a VLSI processor specifically designed to operate in large concurrent systems. Parallel Computers 2: Architecture, Programming and Algorithms reflects the shift in emphasis of parallel computing and tracks the development of supercomputers in the years since the first edition was published. It looks at large-scale parallelism as found in transputer ensembles. This extensively rewritten second edition includes major new sections on the transputer and the OCCAM language. The book contains specific information on the various types of machines available, details of computer architecture and technologies, and descriptions of programming languages and algorithms.

How We Became Posthuman,N. Katherine Hayles,University of Chicago Press,2008-05-15,"In this age of DNA computers and artificial intelligence, information is becoming disembodied even as the ""bodies"" that once carried it vanish into virtuality. While some marvel at these changes, envisioning consciousness downloaded into a computer or humans ""beamed"" Star Trek-style, others view them with horror, seeing monsters brooding in the machines. In How We Became Posthuman, N. Katherine Hayles separates hype from fact, investigating the fate of embodiment in an information age. Hayles relates three interwoven stories: how information lost its body, that is, how it came to be conceptualized as an entity separate from the material forms that carry it; the cultural and technological construction of the cyborg; and the dismantling of the liberal humanist ""subject"" in cybernetic discourse, along with the emergence of the ""posthuman."" Ranging widely across the history of technology, cultural studies, and literary criticism, Hayles shows what had to be erased, forgotten, and elided to conceive of information as a disembodied entity. Thus she moves from the post-World War II Macy Conferences on cybernetics to the 1952 novel Limbo by cybernetics aficionado Bernard Wolfe; from the concept of self-making to Philip K. Dick's literary explorations of hallucination and reality; and from artificial life to postmodern novels exploring the implications of seeing humans as cybernetic systems. Although becoming posthuman can be nightmarish, Hayles shows how it can also be liberating. From the birth of cybernetics to artificial life, How We Became Posthuman provides an indispensable account of how we arrived in our virtual age, and of where we might go from here.",Science,364,4,7,en

"Computers, Cockroaches, and Ecosystems",Kevin J. Pugh,IAP,2017-02-01,"Of all the topics ever studied, surely one of the most compelling is human learning itself. What is the nature of the human mind? How do we understand and process new information? Where do new ideas come from? How is our very intelligence a product of society and culture? Computers, Cockroaches, and Ecosystems: Understanding Learning through Metaphor brings to light the great discoveries about human learning by illuminating key metaphors underlying the major learning perspectives. Such metaphors include, among others, the mind as computer, the mind as ecosystem, and the mind as cultural tools. These metaphors reveal the essence of different learning perspectives in a way that is accessible and engaging for teachers and students. Each metaphor is brought to life through stories ranging from the humorous to the profound. The book conveys scholarly ideas in a personal manner and will be a delight for teachers, university students, parents, business or military trainers, or anyone with an interest in learning.",Language Arts & Disciplines,179,N/A,0,en

Racing the Beam,"Nick Montfort, Ian Bogost",MIT Press,2009-01-09,"A study of the relationship between platform and creative expression in the Atari VCS, the gaming system for popular games like Pac-Man and Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. The Atari Video Computer System dominated the home video game market so completely that “Atari” became the generic term for a video game console. The Atari VCS was affordable and offered the flexibility of changeable cartridges. Nearly a thousand of these were created, the most significant of which established new techniques, mechanics, and even entire genres. This book offers a detailed and accessible study of this influential video game console from both computational and cultural perspectives. Studies of digital media have rarely investigated platforms—the systems underlying computing. This book, the first in a series of Platform Studies, does so, developing a critical approach that examines the relationship between platforms and creative expression. Nick Montfort and Ian Bogost discuss the Atari VCS itself and examine in detail six game cartridges: Combat, Adventure, Pac-Man, Yars' Revenge, Pitfall!, and Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. They describe the technical constraints and affordances of the system and track developments in programming, gameplay, interface, and aesthetics. Adventure, for example, was the first game to represent a virtual space larger than the screen (anticipating the boundless virtual spaces of such later games as World of Warcraft and Grand Theft Auto), by allowing the player to walk off one side into another space; and Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back was an early instance of interaction between media properties and video games. Montfort and Bogost show that the Atari VCS—often considered merely a retro fetish object—is an essential part of the history of video games.",Games & Activities,193,4,3,en

The Apollo Guidance Computer,Frank O'Brien,Springer Science & Business Media,2010-06-25,"The technological marvel that facilitated the Apollo missions to the Moon was the on-board computer. In the 1960s most computers filled an entire room, but the spacecraft’s computer was required to be compact and low power. Although people today find it difficult to accept that it was possible to control a spacecraft using such a ‘primitive’ computer, it nevertheless had capabilities that are advanced even by today’s standards. This is the first book to fully describe the Apollo guidance computer’s architecture, instruction format and programs used by the astronauts. As a comprehensive account, it will span the disciplines of computer science, electrical and aerospace engineering. However, it will also be accessible to the ‘space enthusiast’. In short, the intention is for this to be the definitive account of the Apollo guidance computer. Frank O’Brien’s interest in the Apollo program began as a serious amateur historian. About 12 years ago, he began performing research and writing essays for the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal, and the Apollo Flight Journal. Much of this work centered on his primary interests, the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) and the Lunar Module. These Journals are generally considered the canonical online reference on the flights to the Moon. He was then asked to assist the curatorial staff in the creation of the Cradle of Aviation Museum, on Long Island, New York, where he helped prepare the Lunar Module simulator, a LM procedure trainer and an Apollo space suit for display. He regularly lectures on the Apollo computer and related topics to diverse groups, from NASA's computer engineering conferences, the IEEE/ACM, computer festivals and university student groups.",Technology & Engineering,440,5,1,en

GATE AND PGECET For Computer Science and Information Technology,DASARADH RAMAIAH K.,PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.,2014-10-01,"Useful for Campus Recruitments, UGC-NET and Competitive Examinations— ISRO, DRDO, HAL, BARC, ONGC, NTPC, RRB, BHEL, MTNL, GAIL and Others 28 Years’ GATE Topic-wise Problems and Solutions In today’s competitive scenario, where there is a mushrooming of universities and engineering colleges, the only yardstick to analyze the caliber of engineering students is the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE). It is one of the recognized national level examination that demands focussed study along with forethought, systematic planning and exactitude. Postgraduate Engineering Common Entrance Test (PGECET) is also one of those examinations, a student has to face to get admission in various postgraduate programs. So, in order to become up to snuff for this eligibility clause (qualifying GATE/PGECET), a student facing a very high competition should excel his/her standards to success by way of preparing from the standard books. This book guides students via simple, elegant and explicit presentation that blends theory logically and rigorously with the practical aspects bearing on computer science and information technology. The book not only keeps abreast of all the chapterwise information generally asked in the examinations but also proffers felicitous tips in the furtherance of problem-solving technique. Various cardinal landmarks pertaining to the subject such as theory of computation, compiler design, digital logic design, computer organisation and architecture, computer networks, database management system, operating system, web technology, software engineering, C programming, data structure, design and analysis of algorithms along with general aptitude verbal ability, non-verbal aptitude, basic mathematics and discrete mathematics are now under a single umbrella. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE BOOK • Systematic discussion of concepts endowed with ample illustrations • Adequate study material suffused with pointwise style to enhance learning ability • Notes are incorporated at several places giving additional information on the key concepts • Inclusion of solved practice exercises for verbal and numerical aptitude to guide the students from practice and examination point of view • Points to ponder are provided in between for a quick recap before examination • Prodigious objective-type questions based on the GATE examination from 1987 to 2014 along with in-depth explanation for each solution from stem to stern • Every solution lasts with a reference, thus providing a scope for further study • Two sample papers for GATE 2015 are incorporated along with answer keys WHAT THE REVIEWERS SAY “Professor Dasaradh has significantly prepared each and every solution of the questions appeared in GATE and other competitive examinations and many individuals from the community have devoted their time to proofread and improve the quality of the solutions so that they become very lucid for the reader. I personally find this book very useful and only one of its kind in the market because this book gives complete analysis of the chapterwise questions based on the previous years’ examination. Moreover, all solutions are fully explained, with a reference to the concerned book given after each solution. It definitely helps in the elimination of redundant topics which are not important from examination point of view. So, the students will be able to reduce the volume of text matter to be studied. Besides, solutions are presented in lucid and understandable language for an average student.” —Dr. T. Venugopal, Associate Professor, Department of CSE, JNTUH, Jagtial “Overall, I think this book represents an extremely valuable and unique contribution to the competitive field because it captures a wealth of GATE/PGECET examination’s preparation experience in a compact and reusable form. This book is certainly one that I shall turn into a regular practice for all entrance examinations’ preparation guides. This book will change the way of preparation for all competitive examinations.” —Professor L.V.N. Prasad, CEO, Vardhaman College of Engineering, Hyderabad “I began to wish that someone would compile all the important abstracting information into one reference, as the need for a single reference book for aspirants had become even more apparent.

The Charisma Machine,Morgan G. Ames,MIT Press,2019-11-19,"A fascinating examination of technological utopianism and its complicated consequences. In The Charisma Machine, Morgan Ames chronicles the life and legacy of the One Laptop per Child project and explains why—despite its failures—the same utopian visions that inspired OLPC still motivate other projects trying to use technology to “disrupt” education and development. Announced in 2005 by MIT Media Lab cofounder Nicholas Negroponte, One Laptop per Child promised to transform the lives of children across the Global South with a small, sturdy, and cheap laptop computer, powered by a hand crank. In reality, the project fell short in many ways—starting with the hand crank, which never materialized. Yet the project remained charismatic to many who were captivated by its claims of access to educational opportunities previously out of reach. Behind its promises, OLPC, like many technology projects that make similarly grand claims, had a fundamentally flawed vision of who the computer was made for and what role technology should play in learning. Drawing on fifty years of history and a seven-month study of a model OLPC project in Paraguay, Ames reveals that the laptops were not only frustrating to use, easy to break, and hard to repair, they were designed for “technically precocious boys”—idealized younger versions of the developers themselves—rather than the children who were actually using them. The Charisma Machine offers a cautionary tale about the allure of technology hype and the problems that result when utopian dreams drive technology development.",Technology & Engineering,323,N/A,0,en

Using Computers in the Translation of Literary Style,ROY. YOUDALE,Routledge,2021-03-31,"This volume argues for an innovative interdisciplinary approach to the analysis and translation of literary style, based on a mutually supportive combination of traditional close reading and 'distant' reading, involving corpus-linguistic analysis and text-visualisation. The book contextualizes this approach within the broader story of the development of computer-assisted translation -- including machine translation and the use of CAT tools -- and elucidates the ways in which the approach can lead to better informed translations than those based on close reading alone. This study represents the first systematic attempt to use corpus linguistics and text-visualisation in the process of translating individual literary texts, as opposed to comparing and analysing already published originals and their translations. Using the case study of his translation into English of Uruguayan author Mario Benedetti's 1965 novel Gracías por el Fuego, Youdale showcases how a close and distant reading approach (CDR) enhances the translator's ability to detect and measure a variety of stylistic features, ranging from sentence length and structure to lexical richness and repetition, both in the source text and in their own draft translation, thus assisting them with the task of revision. The book reflects on the benefits and limitations of a CDR approach, its scalability and broader applicability in translation studies and related disciplines, making this key reading for translators, postgraduate students and scholars in the fields of literary translation, corpus linguistics, corpus stylistics and narratology.",,242,N/A,0,en

The Pattern On The Stone,W. Daniel Hillis,Basic Books,2014-12-09,"Most people are baffled by how computers work and assume that they will never understand them. What they don't realize -- and what Daniel Hillis's short book brilliantly demonstrates -- is that computers' seemingly complex operations can be broken down into a few simple parts that perform the same simple procedures over and over again. Computer wizard Hillis offers an easy-to-follow explanation of how data is processed that makes the operations of a computer seem as straightforward as those of a bicycle. Avoiding technobabble or discussions of advanced hardware, the lucid explanations and colorful anecdotes in The Pattern on the Stone go straight to the heart of what computers really do. Hillis proceeds from an outline of basic logic to clear descriptions of programming languages, algorithms, and memory. He then takes readers in simple steps up to the most exciting developments in computing today -- quantum computing, parallel computing, neural networks, and self-organizing systems. Written clearly and succinctly by one of the world's leading computer scientists, The Pattern on the Stone is an indispensable guide to understanding the workings of that most ubiquitous and important of machines: the computer.",Computers,133,N/A,0,en

The Soul of A New Machine,Tracy Kidder,Hachette UK,2011-08-23,"Tracy Kidder's ""riveting"" (Washington Post) story of one company's efforts to bring a new microcomputer to market won both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award and has become essential reading for understanding the history of the American tech industry. Computers have changed since 1981, when The Soul of a New Machine first examined the culture of the computer revolution. What has not changed is the feverish pace of the high-tech industry, the go-for-broke approach to business that has caused so many computer companies to win big (or go belly up), and the cult of pursuing mind-bending technological innovations. The Soul of a New Machine is an essential chapter in the history of the machine that revolutionized the world in the twentieth century.

The Tech-Wise Family,Andy Crouch,Baker Books,2017-04-18,"Making conscientious choices about technology in our families is more than just using internet filters and determining screen time limits for our children. It's about developing wisdom, character, and courage in the way we use digital media rather than accepting technology's promises of ease, instant gratification, and the world's knowledge at our fingertips. And it's definitely not just about the kids. Drawing on in-depth original research from the Barna Group, Andy Crouch shows readers that the choices we make about technology have consequences we may never have considered. He takes readers beyond the typical questions of what, where, and when and instead challenges them to answer provocative questions like, Who do we want to be as a family? and How does our use of a particular technology move us closer or farther away from that goal? Anyone who has felt their family relationships suffer or their time slip away amid technology's distractions will find in this book a path forward to reclaiming their real life in a world of devices.",Religion,202,N/A,0,en

Cringely reveals the manias and foibles of these men (they are always men) with deadpan hilarity and cogently demonstrates how their neuroses have shaped the computer business. But Cringely gives us much more than high-tech voyeurism and insider gossip.

Computers and Writing,"Patrik O'Brian Holt, Noel Williams",Springer,2014-03-14,"Patrik O'Brian Holt Heriot-Watt University After speech, writing is the most common form of human communication and represents the cornerstone of our ability to preserve and record information. Writing, by its very definition, requires artifacts in the form of tools to write with and a medium to write on. Through history these artifacts have ranged from sticks and clay tablets, feather and leather, crude pens and paper, sophisticated pens and paper, typewriters and paper; and electronic devices with or without paper. The development of writing tools has straightforward objectives, to make writing easier and more effective and assist in distributing written communication fast and efficiently. Both the crudest and most sophisticated forms of writing tools act as mediators of human written communication for the purpose of producing, distributing and conserving written language. In the modern world the computer is arguably the most sophisticated form of mediation, the implications of which are not yet fully understood. The use of computers (a writing artifact which mediates communication) for the production and editing of text is almost as old as computers themselves. Early computers involved the use of crude text editors and a writer had to insert commands resembling a programming language to format and print a document. For example to underline a word the writer had to do the following, This is an example of how to .ul underline a single word. in order to produce: This is an example of how to underline a single word.",Computers,387,N/A,0,en

Computer,Paul Atkinson,Reaktion Books,2010-08-15,"The pixelated rectangle we spend most of our day staring at in silence is not the television as many long feared, but the computer—the ubiquitous portal of work and personal lives. At this point, the computer is almost so common we don’t notice it in our view. It’s difficult to envision that not that long ago it was a gigantic, room-sized structure only to be accessed by a few inspiring as much awe and respect as fear and mystery. Now that the machine has decreased in size and increased in popular use, the computer has become a prosaic appliance, little-more noted than a toaster. These dramatic changes, from the daunting to the ordinary, are captured in Computer by design historian Paul Atkinson. Here, Atkinson chronicles the changes in physical design of the computer and shows how these changes in design are related to changes in popular attitude. Atkinson is fascinated by how the computer has been represented and promoted in advertising. For example, in contrast to ads from the 1970s and ’80s, today’s PC is very PC—genderless, and largely status free. Computer also considers the role of the computer as a cultural touchstone, as evidenced by its regular appearance in popular culture, including the iconography of the space age, HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey, James Bond’s gadgetry, and Stars War and Star Trek. Computer covers many issues ignored by other histories of computing, which have focused on technology and the economics involved in their production, but rarely on the role of fashion in the physical design and promotion of computers and their general reception. The book will appeal to professionals and students of design and technology as well as those interested in the history of computers and how they have shaped—and been shaped by—our lives.",Computers,258,N/A,0,en
Creating the Computer,Kenneth Flamm,Brookings Institution Press,2010-12-01,"The development of the first electronic digital computers in the 1940s signaled the beginning of a new and distinctive type of industry—an industry marked by competition through innovation, and by the large percentage of revenues spent on research and development. Written as a companion volume to Targeting the Computer: Government Support and International Competition, this comprehensive volume provides a new understanding to the complex forces that have shaped the computer industry during the past four decades. Kenneth Flamm identifies the origins of technologies important to the creation of computers and traces the roots of individual technologies to the specific research groups and programs responsible for major advances. He evaluates the impact of these innovations on industrial competition and argues that the emergence of specialization and product differentiation in the 1950s and the compatibility and standards in the mid-1960s were key factors defining this competition. Flamm also identifies the various market strategies adopted in later decades to challenge an industry leader, strategies linked to the entry and exit of individual firms. In addition to the effects of technology and internal industry developments, international competition and national policies on technology, trade, and investment shaped the evolution of this new industry. Flamm documents the role of government support for technology in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan and describes the critical technological and economic links between national and international markets. Finally, he links these strategies, technological trends, and national policies to one another and shows how they continue to influence current developments in the computer industry.",Business & Economics,306,N/A,0,en

The Classroom Arsenal,Douglas D. Noble,Routledge,2017-09-29,"A quarter of a century after its initial publication, The Classroom Arsenal remains pivotal in understanding and challenging the relentless promotion of technology to reform education. This seemingly benign education technology juggernaut carries forward the momentum of military agendas in man-machine systems detailed in the book. Promoters continue to flood schools with technology and its (still unfulfilled) promise of cutting edge, ""personalized learning."" Meanwhile, they continue as well their insatiable pursuit of federal funding, educational legitimacy, corporate profits, and access to student subjects and their accumulated learning data for product development.? Less understood, though, is a companion enterprise, there from the start, to replace teaching and learning in traditional classrooms by efficient automated systems that manage and monitor human cognition and learning for high-performance systems, from weapons systems to high tech corporations. As education is moved?imperceptibly away from its traditional humanistic aims and from the classroom itself, the goal of this human engineering project, the depersonalized accumulation of cognitive components for a 21st century militarized economy, best befits the book’s original title: ""The Human Arsenal."" This ongoing military/corporate-sponsored enterprise continues to impact education today, largely unnoticed. One example is the federally-funded Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative (ADL), which has been a major force behind the implementation of electronic learning systems, now used in all Defense Department and federal employee training. With the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) ADL is developing structures to capture students’ soft skills, and the Army Research Laboratory is developing ""intelligent tutoring systems"" to enable ""instructional management of affect, engagement, and grit (perseverance)."" ADL through the Department of Defense has developed Experience API, a learning technology that can monitor all student online and offline interactions and archive these in date lockers or learning record stores. ADL has already impacted thousands of school districts through nonprofits such as IMS Global and Future Ready Schools, part of an industry massively subsidized by high tech corporations and valued at $255 billion annually. A $90 million Advanced Research Projects Agency for Education (ARPA-ED), modeled after the military’s ARPA,?has been proposed to fund ""dramatic breakthroughs in learning and teaching."" These include ""digital tutors as effective as personal tutors"" and, with the Navy’s Full Spectrum Learning project, ""data collection tools for personalized education modeled after corporate data analysis that identifies consumer patterns and preferences."" ADL is just one example of how the military/corporate ed tech enterprise is changing public education by hollowing?it out into something that can be digitized, data-driven, automated, and monitored. Its promoters envision education as children interacting with online learning systems where, based on past performance, algorithms will serve up what each student needs to know next. Through this digital curriculum, students create virtual educational identities at very young ages and learning devices are watching students as much as students are watching them. Such is the education landscape presaged by The Classroom Arsenal a quarter century ago, whose origins and trajectories need to be deeply understood now more than ever.",Education,216,N/A,0,en

He asserts that ultimately, the most important job of the English teacher is to reveal to students ways they can participate in the discourse that shapes their lives, and he offers a timely look at how technology has influenced the way we write and read. The scope of this fascinating book reaches beyond the classroom and offers insight about what it means to be ""literate"" in an economically driven, dynamic society. Addressing earlier works on the subject of literacy, as well as the ideas of theorists such as Foucault, this perceptive work has much to offer educators and anyone seeking to understand the nature of literacy itself.",Language Arts & Disciplines,236,N/A,0,en

The Analogue Alternative,James S. Small,Routledge,2013-06-17,"We are in the midst of a digital revolution - until recently, the majority of appliances used in everyday life have been developed with analogue technology. Now, either at home or out and about, we are surrounded by digital technology such as digital 'film', audio systems, computers and telephones. From the late 1940s until the 1970s, analogue technology was a genuine alternative to digital, and the two competing technologies ran parallel with each other. During this period, a community of engineers, scientists, academics and businessmen continued to develop and promote the analogue computer. At the height of the Cold War, this community and its technology met with considerable success in meeting the urgent demand for high speed computing for use in the design and simulation of rockets, aircraft and manned space vehicles. The Analogue Alternative tracks the development, commercialisation and ultimate decline of the electronic analogue computer in the USA and Britain. It examines the roles played by technical, economic and cultural factors in the competition between the alternative technologies, but more importantly, James Small demonstrates that non-technical factors, such as the role of 'military enterprise' and the working practices of analogue engineers, have been the most crucial in analogue's demise.^l This book will be of interest to students of the history and sociology of science and technology, particularly computing.

The Computer Revolution,Daniel E. Sichel,Brookings Institution Press,2001-08-09,"During the 1980s and into this decade, U.S. businesses poured billions of dollars into computers and other information technology. Yet the productivity performance of the U.S. economy in the 1980s remained lackluster--especially in the service sector--leading many observers to suspect that companies were not getting their money's worth from these high-tech investments. At the same time, academic research found little evidence of a productivity payoff. But have the tables now turned? With an apparent improvement in productivity in recent years, much academic and popular opinion now suggests that the payback is at hand or just around the corner. As the nation embarks on a major effort to develop an Information Superhighway, it is critical for policymakers, opinion leaders, and others to understand the contribution and role of information technology in the economy during recent decades. This book provides a straightforward guide to the economic issues underlying the debates about these issues, using quantitative and historical analysis, supplemented with interviews of small and large service-sector companies. To set the stage, Daniel Sichel reviews the debates over the role of computers and summarizes the essential facts about computer use, with a particular emphasis on software. Going beyond basic facts, Sichel describes an economic framework for assessing the aggregate economic impact of computers in recent decades and for looking ahead at this impact in the future. Quantitative estimates from this framework, along with supporting historical and interview evidence, place limits on the contribution of computers to the overall economy. When compared to the size of the slowdown in productivity growth in the early 1970s, the overall impact of computers appears relatively modest, in part because the share of computers in the nation's capital stock is surprisingly small. Looking ahead, Sichel also raises questions as to whether computers are likely to s",Business & Economics,165,N/A,0,en

Computer-Based Instruction in Military Environments,"Robert J. Seidel, P.D. Weddle",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This collection of papers is the result of a symposium sponsored by NATO's Defense Research Group Panel VIII in the Spring of 1985. The symposium came into being when it became obvious to the NATO countries that research, development and utilization of advanced technologies for training was the best means of increasing both training effectiveness and efficiency. This symposium was the second in a series of three devoted to training. The series was structured to cover all aspects of training. The first series addressed the value of training, the second one dealt with the application of training technologies and the third and last of the series focused on academic issues concerned with the effect of prior learning on subsequent learning. The fact that a major American publisher has determined that computer based instruction is the technology of greatest interest to the NATO community is not surprising. Advances in microprocessor technology have revolutionized both how and where we train. During this symposium there were a limited number of carefully chosen exhibits to demonstrate the various applications of computer based training techniques. In the following papers you will find both a practical and scientific basis for the way current and future training and training systems should be designed, applied and utilized. We know that training must be done faster and more effectively.",Computers,348,N/A,0,en

Lessons From Nanoelectronics: A New Perspective On Transport (Second Edition) - Part B: Quantum Transport,Supriyo Datta,World Scientific,2018-03-23,"Everyone is familiar with the amazing performance of a modern smartphone, powered by a billion-plus nanotransistors, each having an active region that is barely a few hundred atoms long. The same amazing technology has also led to a deeper understanding of the nature of current flow and heat dissipation on an atomic scale which is of broad relevance to the general problems of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics that pervade many different fields.This book is based on a set of two online courses originally offered in 2012 on nanoHUB-U and more recently in 2015 on edX. In preparing the second edition the author decided to split it into parts A and B titled Basic Concepts and Quantum Transport respectively, along the lines of the two courses. A list of available video lectures corresponding to different sections of this volume is provided upfront.To make these lectures accessible to anyone in any branch of science or engineering, the author assume very little background beyond linear algebra and differential equations. However, the author will be discussing advanced concepts that should be of interest even to specialists, who are encouraged to look at his earlier books for additional technical details.",Technology & Engineering,259,N/A,0,en

Using Computers in the Translation of Literary Style,Roy Youdale,N/A,2019,"This volume argues for an innovative interdisciplinary approach to the analysis and translation of literary style, based on a mutually supportive combination of traditional close reading and 'distant' reading, involving corpus-linguistic analysis and text-visualisation. The book contextualizes this approach within the broader story of the development of computer-assisted translation -- including machine translation and the use of CAT tools -- and elucidates the ways in which the approach can lead to better informed translations than those based on close reading alone. This study represents the first systematic attempt to use corpus linguistics and text-visualisation in the process of translating individual literary texts, as opposed to comparing and analysing already published originals and their translations. Using the case study of his translation into English of Uruguayan author Mario Benedetti's 1965 novel Gracías por el Fuego, Youdale showcases how a close and distant reading approach (CDR) enhances the translator's ability to detect and measure a variety of stylistic features, ranging from sentence length and structure to lexical richness and repetition, both in the source text and in their own draft translation, thus assisting them with the task of revision. The book reflects on the benefits and limitations of a CDR approach, its scalability and broader applicability in translation studies and related disciplines, making this key reading for translators, postgraduate students and scholars in the fields of literary translation, corpus linguistics, corpus stylistics and narratology.",Literature,242,N/A,0,en

"Utopias, Dolphins and Computers",Mary Midgley,Routledge,2003-09-02,"Why do the big philosophical questions so often strike us as far-fetched and little to with everyday life? Mary Midgley shows that it need not be that way; she shows that there is a need for philosophy in the real world. Her popularity as one of our foremost philosophers is based on a no-nonsense, down-to-earth approach to fundamental human problems, philosphical or otherwise. In Utopias, Dolphins and Computers she makes her case for philosophy as a difficult but necessary tool for solving some of the most pressing issues facing contemporary society. How should we treat animals? Why are we so confused about the value of education? What is at stake in feminism? Why should we sustain our environment? Why do we think intelligent computers will save us? Mary Midgley argues that philosophy not only can, but should be used in thinking about these questions.

Fire in the Valley,"Michael Swaine, Paul Freiberger",Pragmatic Bookshelf,2014-10-20,"In the 1970s, while their contemporaries were protesting the computer as a tool of dehumanization and oppression, a motley collection of college dropouts, hippies, and electronics fanatics were engaged in something much more subversive. Obsessed with the idea of getting computer power into their own hands, they launched from their garages a hobbyist movement that grew into an industry, and ultimately a social and technological revolution. What they did was invent the personal computer: not just a new device, but a watershed in the relationship between man and machine. This is their story. Fire in the Valley is the definitive history of the personal computer, drawn from interviews with the people who made it happen, written by two veteran computer writers who were there from the start. Working at InfoWorld in the early 1980s, Swaine and Freiberger daily rubbed elbows with people like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates when they were creating the personal computer revolution. A rich story of colorful individuals, Fire in the Valley profiles these unlikely revolutionaries and entrepreneurs, such as Ed Roberts of MITS, Lee Felsenstein at Processor Technology, and Jack Tramiel of Commodore, as well as Jobs and Gates in all the innocence of their formative years. This completely revised and expanded third edition brings the story to its completion, chronicling the end of the personal computer revolution and the beginning of the post-PC era. It covers the departure from the stage of major players with the deaths of Steve Jobs and Douglas Engelbart and the retirements of Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer; the shift away from the PC to the cloud and portable devices; and what the end of the PC era means for issues such as personal freedom and power, and open source vs. proprietary software.",Computers,602,N/A,0,en

Part I of this book introduces the collection of useful and illustrative approximations, each of which is presented with a carefully drawn error curve in Part II. Originally published in 1955. The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.",Mathematics,212,N/A,0,en
Affective Computing,Rosalind W. Picard,MIT Press,2000-07-24,"According to Rosalind Picard, if we want computers to be genuinely intelligent and to interact naturally with us, we must give computers the ability to recognize, understand, even to have and express emotions. The latest scientific findings indicate that emotions play an essential role in decision making, perception, learning, and more—that is, they influence the very mechanisms of rational thinking. Not only too much, but too little emotion can impair decision making. According to Rosalind Picard, if we want computers to be genuinely intelligent and to interact naturally with us, we must give computers the ability to recognize, understand, even to have and express emotions. Part 1 of this book provides the intellectual framework for affective computing. It includes background on human emotions, requirements for emotionally intelligent computers, applications of affective computing, and moral and social questions raised by the technology. Part 2 discusses the design and construction of affective computers. Although this material is more technical than that in Part 1, the author has kept it less technical than typical scientific publications in order to make it accessible to newcomers. Topics in Part 2 include signal-based representations of emotions, human affect recognition as a pattern recognition and learning problem, recent and ongoing efforts to build models of emotion for synthesizing emotions in computers, and the new application area of affective wearable computers.",Computers,308,4.5,3,en

Understanding by Design,"Grant P. Wiggins, Jay McTighe",ASCD,2005,"What is understanding and how does it differ from knowledge? How can we determine the big ideas worth understanding? Why is understanding an important teaching goal, and how do we know when students have attained it? How can we create a rigorous and engaging curriculum that focuses on understanding and leads to improved student performance in today's high-stakes, standards-based environment? Authors Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe answer these and many other questions in this second edition of Understanding by Design. Drawing on feedback from thousands of educators around the world who have used the UbD framework since its introduction in 1998, the authors have greatly revised and expanded their original work to guide educators across the K-16 spectrum in the design of curriculum, assessment, and instruction. With an improved UbD Template at its core, the book explains the rationale of backward design and explores in greater depth the meaning of such key ideas as essential questions and transfer tasks. Readers will learn why the familiar coverage- and activity-based approaches to curriculum design fall short, and how a focus on the six facets of understanding can enrich student learning. With an expanded array of practical strategies, tools, and examples from all subject areas, the book demonstrates how the research-based principles of Understanding by Design apply to district frameworks as well as to individual units of curriculum. Combining provocative ideas, thoughtful analysis, and tested approaches, this new edition of Understanding by Design offers teacher-designers a clear path to the creation of curriculum that ensures better learning and a more stimulating experience for students and teachers alike.",Education,383,3.5,7,en

Programmers and Managers,P. Kraft,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Norbert Wiener, perhaps better than anyone else, understood the intimate and delicate relationship between control and communication: that messages intended as commands do not necessarily differ from those intended simply as facts. Wiener noted the paradox when the modem computer was hardly more than a laboratory curiosity. Thirty years later, the same paradox is at the heart of a severe identity crisis which con fronts computer programmers. Are they primarily members of ""management"" acting as foremen, whose task it is to ensure that orders emanating from executive suites are faithfully trans lated into comprehensible messages? Or are they perhaps sim ply engineers preoccupied with the technical difficulties of relating ""software"" to ""hardware"" and vice versa? Are they aware, furthermore, of the degree to which their work whether as manager or engineer-routinizes the work of others and thereby helps shape the structure of social class relation ships? I doubt that many of us who lived through the first heady and frantic years of software development-at places like the RAND and System Development Corporations-ever took time to think about such questions. The science fiction-like setting of mysterious machines, blinking lights, and torrents of numbers served to awe outsiders who could only marvel at the complexity of it all. We were insiders who constituted a secret society into which only initiates were welcome. So today I marvel at the boundless audacity of a rank out sider in writing a book like Programmers and Managers.",Computers,128,N/A,0,en

"Computers: Classical, Quantum and Others","Sergey P. Suprun, Anatoly P. Suprun",Bentham Science Publishers,2011-04-27,"This volume elaborates upon functioning of a quantum computer and the analysis of mind phenomenon in a natural scientific paradigm. Many outstanding physicists - Bohr, Heisenberg et al.- considered that many aspects of quantum physics could be understood considering the laws of perception, linguistics and semiotics within the world's semiotic description. An analysis of would-be scientific theories and paradoxes connected with a number of unformulated statements regarding initial information is therefore presented. These, in turn, could be used to draw algorithms that generate a picture of reality in the human mind. The e-book also attempts to find out what is available to an observer from his/her standpoint (reference system), and from what theoretical standpoints that observation is developed. the initial point of this approach is recognizing that we are closed inside the semiotic system in which the 'universe' can only be presented to our mind. Such semiotic restrictions for translation of knowledge in any field are considered.

The first paper describes an extension of the servo theoretic approach to describing the human operator as an active element of a control system. The model presented has been developed to describe and predict muscular actions. The second paper addresses the monte carlo simulation of human performance within a task and time analytic framework, and illustrates the current state-of-the-art. A third paper deals with man-computer interaction in information-processing and decision-making tasks. An attempt was made to describe such interactions in a manner that facilitates the allocation of tasks to man and the computer. The fourth paper demonstrates the feasibility of graphically portraying human biomechanical movements on an IBM graphic display console. Such techniques can simulate human movements and aid the designer in optimizing workplace geometry.

Computers As Cognitive Tools,"Susanne P. Lajoie, Sharon J. Derry",Routledge,2013-05-13,"Highlighting and illustrating several important and interesting theoretical trends that have emerged in the continuing development of instructional technology, this book's organizational framework is based on the notion of two opposing camps. One evolves out of the intelligent tutoring movement, which employs artificial-intelligence technologies in the service of student modeling and precision diagnosis, and the other emerges from a constructivist/developmental perspective that promotes exploration and social interaction, but tends to reject the methods and goals of the student modelers. While the notion of opposing camps tends to create an artificial rift between groups of researchers, it represents a conceptual distinction that is inherently more interesting and informative than the relatively meaningless divide often drawn between ""intelligent"" and ""unintelligent"" instructional systems. An evident trend is that researchers in both ""camps"" view their computer learning environments as ""cognitive tools"" that can enhance learning, performance, and understanding. Cognitive tools are objects provided by the instructional environment that allow students to incorporate new auxiliary methods or symbols into their social problem solving which otherwise would be unavailable. A final section of the book represents researchers who are assimilating and accommodating the wisdom and creativity of their neighbors from both camps, perhaps forming the look of technology for the future. When the idea of model tracing in a computer-based environment is combined with appreciation for creative mind-extension cognitive tools and for how a community of learners can facilitate learning, a camp is created where AI technologists and social constructivist learning theorists can feel equally at home.",Education,414,N/A,0,en
IBM,James W. Cortada,MIT Press,2023-08-01,"A history of one of the most influential American companies of the last century. For decades, IBM shaped the way the world did business. IBM products were in every large organization, and IBM corporate culture established a management style that was imitated by companies around the globe. It was “Big Blue, ” an icon. And yet over the years, IBM has gone through both failure and success, surviving flatlining revenue and forced reinvention. The company almost went out of business in the early 1990s, then came back strong with new business strategies and an emphasis on artificial intelligence. In this authoritative, monumental history, James Cortada tells the story of one of the most influential American companies of the last century. Cortada, a historian who worked at IBM for many years, describes IBM's technology breakthroughs, including the development of the punch card (used for automatic tabulation in the 1890 census), the calculation and printing of the first Social Security checks in the 1930s, the introduction of the PC to a mass audience in the 1980s, and the company's shift in focus from hardware to software. He discusses IBM's business culture and its orientation toward employees and customers; its global expansion; regulatory and legal issues, including antitrust litigation; and the track records of its CEOs. The secret to IBM's unequalled longevity in the information technology market, Cortada shows, is its capacity to adapt to changing circumstances and technologies.",Computers,747,N/A,0,en

But Clay begins to realize that this store is even more curious than its name suggests. There are only a few customers, but they come in repeatedly and never seem to actually buy anything. Instead they “check out” impossibly obscure volumes from strange corners of the store, all according to some elaborate, long-standing arrangement with the gnomic Mr. Penumbra. The store must be a front for something larger, Clay concludes, and soon he has embarked on a complex analysis of the customers’ behaviour and roped his friends into helping him figure out just what’s going on. But once they take their findings to Mr. Penumbra, they discover the secrets extend far beyond the walls of the bookstore.

Explorations in Quantum Computing,Colin P. Williams,Springer Science & Business Media,2010-12-07,"By the year 2020, the basic memory components of a computer will be the size of individual atoms. At such scales, the current theory of computation will become invalid. ""Quantum computing"" is reinventing the foundations of computer science and information theory in a way that is consistent with quantum physics - the most accurate model of reality currently known. Remarkably, this theory predicts that quantum computers can perform certain tasks breathtakingly faster than classical computers – and, better yet, can accomplish mind-boggling feats such as teleporting information, breaking supposedly ""unbreakable"" codes, generating true random numbers, and communicating with messages that betray the presence of eavesdropping. This widely anticipated second edition of Explorations in Quantum Computing explains these burgeoning developments in simple terms, and describes the key technological hurdles that must be overcome to make quantum computers a reality. This easy-to-read, time-tested, and comprehensive textbook provides a fresh perspective on the capabilities of quantum computers, and supplies readers with the tools necessary to make their own foray into this exciting field. Topics and features: concludes each chapter with exercises and a summary of the material covered; provides an introduction to the basic mathematical formalism of quantum computing, and the quantum effects that can be harnessed for non-classical computation; discusses the concepts of quantum gates, entangling power, quantum circuits, quantum Fourier, wavelet, and cosine transforms, and quantum universality, computability, and complexity; examines the potential applications of quantum computers in areas such as search, code-breaking, solving NP-Complete problems, quantum simulation, quantum chemistry, and mathematics; investigates the uses of quantum information, including quantum teleportation, superdense coding, quantum data compression, quantum cloning, quantum negation, and quantum cryptography; reviews the advancements made towards practical quantum computers, covering developments in quantum error correction and avoidance, and alternative models of quantum computation.

"Logic, Mathematics, and Computer Science",Yves Nievergelt,Springer,2015-10-13,"This text for the first or second year undergraduate in mathematics, logic, computer science, or social sciences, introduces the reader to logic, proofs, sets, and number theory. It also serves as an excellent independent study reference and resource for instructors. Adapted from Foundations of Logic and Mathematics: Applications to Science and Cryptography © 2002 Birkhӓuser, this second edition provides a modern introduction to the foundations of logic, mathematics, and computers science, developing the theory that demonstrates construction of all mathematics and theoretical computer science from logic and set theory. The focuses is on foundations, with specific statements of all the associated axioms and rules of logic and set theory, and provides complete details and derivations of formal proofs. Copious references to literature that document historical development is also provided. Answers are found to many questions that usually remain unanswered: Why is the truth table for logical implication so unintuitive? Why are there no recipes to design proofs? Where do these numerous mathematical rules come from? What issues in logic, mathematics, and computer science still remain unresolved? And the perennial question: In what ways are we going to use this material? Additionally, the selection of topics presented reflects many major accomplishments from the twentieth century and includes applications in game theory and Nash's equilibrium, Gale and Shapley's match making algorithms, Arrow's Impossibility Theorem in voting, to name a few. From the reviews of the first edition: ""...All the results are proved in full detail from first principles...remarkably, the arithmetic laws on the rational numbers are proved, step after step, starting from the very definitions!...This is a valuable reference text and a useful companion for anybody wondering how basic mathematical concepts can be rigorously developed within set theory."" —MATHEMATICAL REVIEWS ""Rigorous and modern in its theoretical aspect, attractive as a detective novel in its applied aspects, this paper book deserves the attention of both beginners and advanced students in mathematics, logic and computer sciences as well as in social sciences."" —Zentralblatt MATH",Mathematics,399,N/A,0,en

PROCEEDINGS OF THE 21ST CONFERENCE ON FORMAL METHODS IN COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN – FMCAD 2021,"Michael W. Whalen, Ruzica Piskac",TU Wien Academic Press,2021-10-14,"Our life is dominated by hardware: a USB stick, the processor in our laptops or the SIM card in our smart phone. But who or what makes sure that these systems work stably, safely and securely from the word go? The computer - with a little help from humans. The overall name for this is CAD (computer-aided design), and it’s become hard to imagine our modern industrial world without it. So how can we be sure that the hardware and computer systems we use are reliable? By using formal methods: these are techniques and tools to calculate whether a system description is in itself consistent or whether requirements have been developed and implemented correctly. Or to put it another way: they can be used to check the safety and security of hardware and software. Just how this works in real life was also of interest at the annual conference on ""Formal Methods in Computer-Aided Design (FMCAD)"". Under the direction of Ruzica Piskac and Michael Whalen, the 21st Conference in October 2021 addressed the results of the latest research in the field of formal methods. A volume of conference proceedings with over 30 articles covering a wide range of formal methods has now been published for this online conference: starting from the verification of hardware, parallel and distributed systems as well as neuronal networks, right through to machine learning and decision-making procedures. This volume provides a fascinating insight into revolutionary methods, technologies, theoretical results and tools for formal logic in computer systems and system developments.",Computers,297,N/A,0,en

Themechanismsareallthe morefascinatingwhensystemsarecomposed of small, simple units, and the ability of the system to self-stabilize emerges out of its components. Faithful computer simulations of such physical systems exhibit the self-stabilizing property, but in the realm of computing, particularly for distributed systems, wehavegreaterambition. We imaginethat all manner of software, ranging from basic communication protocols to high-level applications, could enjoy self-corrective properties. Self-stabilizing software o?ers a unique, non-traditional approach to the c- cial problem of transient fault tolerance. Many successful instances of modern fault-tolerant networks are based on principles of self-stabilization. Surprisingly, the most widely accepted technical de?nition of a self-stabilizing system does not refer to faults: it is the property that the system can be started in any i- tial state, possibly an “illegal state,” and yet the system guarantees to behave properly in ?nite time. This, and similar de?nitions, break many traditional approaches to program design, in which the programmer by habit makes - sumptions about initial conditions. The composition of self-stabilizing systems, initially seen as a daunting challenge, has been transformed into a mana- able task, thanks to an accumulation of discoveries by many investigators. - search on various topics in self-stabilization continues to supply new methods for constructing self-stabilizing systems, determines limits and applicability of the paradigm of self-stabilization, and connects self-stabilization to related areas of fault tolerance and distributed computing.",Computers,237,N/A,0,en

Current Trends in Theoretical Computer Science,"Gheorghe P?un, Arto Salomaa",World Scientific,2001,"The scientific developments at the end of the past millennium were dominated by the huge increase and diversity of disciplines with the common label ""computer science"". The theoretical foundations of such disciplines have become known as theoretical computer science. This book highlights some key issues of theoretical computer science as they seem to us now, at the beginning of the new millennium. The text is based on columns and tutorials published in the Bulletin of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science in the period 1995 -- 2000. The columnists themselves selected the material they wanted for the book, and the editors had a chance to update their work. Indeed, much of the material presented here appears in a form quite different from the original. Since the presentation of most of the articles is reader-friendly and does not presuppose much knowledge of the area, the book constitutes suitable supplementary reading material for various courses in computer science.",Computers,881,N/A,0,en

Statistical Computing with R,Maria L. Rizzo,CRC Press,2007-11-15,"Computational statistics and statistical computing are two areas that employ computational, graphical, and numerical approaches to solve statistical problems, making the versatile R language an ideal computing environment for these fields. One of the first books on these topics to feature R, Statistical Computing with R covers the traditional core material of computational statistics, with an emphasis on using the R language via an examples-based approach. Suitable for an introductory course in computational statistics or for self-study, it includes R code for all examples and R notes to help explain the R programming concepts. After an overview of computational statistics and an introduction to the R computing environment, the book reviews some basic concepts in probability and classical statistical inference. Each subsequent chapter explores a specific topic in computational statistics. These chapters cover the simulation of random variables from probability distributions, the visualization of multivariate data, Monte Carlo integration and variance reduction methods, Monte Carlo methods in inference, bootstrap and jackknife, permutation tests, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, and density estimation. The final chapter presents a selection of examples that illustrate the application of numerical methods using R functions. Focusing on implementation rather than theory, this text serves as a balanced, accessible introduction to computational statistics and statistical computing.",Mathematics,412,5,1,en

Introducing Microsoft Quantum Computing for Developers,Johnny Hooyberghs,Apress,2021-12-10,"Dive in with this hands-on introduction to quantum computing with the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit and Q# for software developers. You may have heard about quantum computing, but what does it mean to you as a software developer? With many new developments, a resurgence in interest, and investment by some of the largest tech companies in the world to be the first to market with quantum programming (QP) hardware and platforms, it is no longer a tool in the distant future. Developers are at the forefront, now able to create applications that take advantage of QP through simulations.

Once Upon an Algorithm,Martin Erwig,MIT Press,2022-08-09,"This easy-to-follow introduction to computer science reveals how familiar stories like Hansel and Gretel, Sherlock Holmes, and Harry Potter illustrate the concepts and everyday relevance of computing. Picture a computer scientist, staring at a screen and clicking away frantically on a keyboard, hacking into a system, or perhaps developing an app. Now delete that picture. In Once Upon an Algorithm, Martin Erwig explains computation as something that takes place beyond electronic computers, and computer science as the study of systematic problem solving. Erwig points out that many daily activities involve problem solving. Getting up in the morning, for example: You get up, take a shower, get dressed, eat breakfast. This simple daily routine solves a recurring problem through a series of well-defined steps. In computer science, such a routine is called an algorithm. Erwig illustrates a series of concepts in computing with examples from daily life and familiar stories. Hansel and Gretel, for example, execute an algorithm to get home from the forest. The movie Groundhog Day illustrates the problem of unsolvability; Sherlock Holmes manipulates data structures when solving a crime; the magic in Harry Potter’s world is understood through types and abstraction; and Indiana Jones demonstrates the complexity of searching. Along the way, Erwig also discusses representations and different ways to organize data; “intractable” problems; language, syntax, and ambiguity; control structures, loops, and the halting problem; different forms of recursion; and rules for finding errors in algorithms. This engaging book explains computation accessibly and shows its relevance to daily life.

The Biological Mind,Alan Jasanoff,Basic Books,2018-03-13,"A pioneering neuroscientist argues that we are more than our brains To many, the brain is the seat of personal identity and autonomy. But the way we talk about the brain is often rooted more in mystical conceptions of the soul than in scientific fact. This blinds us to the physical realities of mental function. We ignore bodily influences on our psychology, from chemicals in the blood to bacteria in the gut, and overlook the ways that the environment affects our behavior, via factors varying from subconscious sights and sounds to the weather. As a result, we alternately overestimate our capacity for free will or equate brains to inorganic machines like computers. But a brain is neither a soul nor an electrical network: it is a bodily organ, and it cannot be separated from its surroundings. Our selves aren't just inside our heads -- they're spread throughout our bodies and beyond. Only once we come to terms with this can we grasp the true nature of our humanity.",Psychology,342,N/A,0,en

Computers and the Environment: Understanding and Managing their Impacts,"R.

Manufacturing computers requires prodigious quantities of fossil fuels, toxic chemicals and water. Rapid improvements in performance mean we often buy a new machine every 1-3 years, which adds up to mountains of waste computers. How should societies respond to manage these environmental impacts? This volume addresses the environmental impacts and management of computers through a set of analyses on issues ranging from environmental assessment, technologies for recycling, consumer behaviour, strategies of computer manufacturing firms, and government policies. One conclusion is that extending the lifespan of computers (e.g. through reselling) is an environmentally and economically effective strategy that deserves more attention from governments, firms and the general public.",Science,306,1,1,en

Protocol,Alexander R. Galloway,MIT Press,2006-02-17,"How Control Exists after Decentralization Is the Internet a vast arena of unrestricted communication and freely exchanged information or a regulated, highly structured virtual bureaucracy? In Protocol, Alexander Galloway argues that the founding principle of the Net is control, not freedom, and that the controlling power lies in the technical protocols that make network connections (and disconnections) possible. He does this by treating the computer as a textual medium that is based on a technological language, code. Code, he argues, can be subject to the same kind of cultural and literary analysis as any natural language; computer languages have their own syntax, grammar, communities, and cultures. Instead of relying on established theoretical approaches, Galloway finds a new way to write about digital media, drawing on his backgrounds in computer programming and critical theory. ""Discipline-hopping is a necessity when it comes to complicated socio-technical topics like protocol,"" he writes in the preface. Galloway begins by examining the types of protocols that exist, including TCP/IP, DNS, and HTML. He then looks at examples of resistance and subversion—hackers, viruses, cyberfeminism, Internet art—which he views as emblematic of the larger transformations now taking place within digital culture. Written for a nontechnical audience, Protocol serves as a necessary counterpoint to the wildly utopian visions of the Net that were so widespread in earlier days.",Computers,298,N/A,0,en

History of Computing and Education 2 (HCE2),John Impagliazzo,Springer Science & Business Media,2006-07-27,"These proceedings derive from an international conference on the history of computing and education. This conference is the second of hopefully a series of conferences that will take place within the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) and hence, we describe it as the ""Second IFIP Conference on the History of Computing and Education"" or simply ""History of Computing and Education 2"" (HCE2). This volume consists of a collection of articles presented at the HCE2 conference held in association with the IFIP 2006 World Computer Congress in Santiago, Chile. Articles range from a wide variety of educational and computing perspectives and represent activities from five continents. The HCE2 conference represents a joint effort of the IFIP Working Group 9. 7 on the History of Computing and the IFIP Technical Committee 3 on Education. The HCE2 conference brings to light a broad spectrum of issues. It illustrates topics in computing as they occurred in the ""early days"" of computing whose ramifications or overtones remain with us today. Indeed, many of the early challenges remain part of our educational tapestry; most likely, many will evolve into future challenges. Therefore, these proceedings provide additional value to the reader as it will reflect in part the future development of computing and education to stimulate new ideas and models in educational development. These proceedings provide a spectrum of interesting articles spanning many topics of historical interest.",Computers,227,N/A,0,en

Introduction to Numerical Analysis,"J. Stoer, R. Bulirsch",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-03-09,"On the occasion of this new edition, the text was enlarged by several new sections. Two sections on B-splines and their computation were added to the chapter on spline functions: Due to their special properties, their flexibility, and the availability of well-tested programs for their computation, B-splines play an important role in many applications. Also, the authors followed suggestions by many readers to supplement the chapter on elimination methods with a section dealing with the solution of large sparse systems of linear equations. Even though such systems are usually solved by iterative methods, the realm of elimination methods has been widely extended due to powerful techniques for handling sparse matrices. We will explain some of these techniques in connection with the Cholesky algorithm for solving positive definite linear systems. The chapter on eigenvalue problems was enlarged by a section on the Lanczos algorithm; the sections on the LR and QR algorithm were rewritten and now contain a description of implicit shift techniques. In order to some extent take into account the progress in the area of ordinary differential equations, a new section on implicit differential equa tions and differential-algebraic systems was added, and the section on stiff differential equations was updated by describing further methods to solve such equations.",Mathematics,674,N/A,0,en

Formal Methods for Trustworthy Computer Systems (FM89),"Dan Craigen, Karen Summerskill",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-11-11,"The 1989 Workshop on the Assessment of Formal Methods for Trustworthy Com puter Systems (FM89} was an invitational workshop that brought together repre sentatives from the research, commercial and governmental spheres of Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The workshop was held in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, from July 23 through July 27, 1989. This document reports the activities, observations, recommendations and conclusions resulting. from FM89. 1. 1 Purpose of Workshop The primary purpose for holding FM89 was to assess the role of formal methods in the development and fielding of trustworthy critical systems. The need for this assessment was predicated upon four observations: 1. Critical systems are increasingly being controlled by computer systems; 2. Existing techniques for developing, assuring and certifying computer-based critical systems are inadequate; 3. Formal methods have the potential for playing the same role in the devel opment of computer-based systems as applied mathematics does for other engineering disciplines; and 4. Formal methods have had limited impact on the development of comput- based systems and supporting technologies. · The goal of the workshop was to complete the following tasks: 1. Assess the problems retarding the development of trustworthy critical systems; 2. Determine the (potential) impact of applying formal methods techniques to the development of trustworthy critical systems; 3. Determine the research and development required to facilitate a broader ap plication of formal methods techniques; 4.",Computers,246,N/A,0,en

Scientific Programming and Computer Architecture,Divakar Viswanath,MIT Press,2017-07-28,"A variety of programming models relevant to scientists explained, with an emphasis on how programming constructs map to parts of the computer. What makes computer programs fast or slow? To answer this question, we have to get behind the abstractions of programming languages and look at how a computer really works. This book examines and explains a variety of scientific programming models (programming models relevant to scientists) with an emphasis on how programming constructs map to different parts of the computer's architecture. Two themes emerge: program speed and program modularity. Throughout this book, the premise is to ""get under the hood,"" and the discussion is tied to specific programs. The book digs into linkers, compilers, operating systems, and computer architecture to understand how the different parts of the computer interact with programs. It begins with a review of C/C++ and explanations of how libraries, linkers, and Makefiles work. Programming models covered include Pthreads, OpenMP, MPI, TCP/IP, and CUDA.The emphasis on how computers work leads the reader into computer architecture and occasionally into the operating system kernel. The operating system studied is Linux, the preferred platform for scientific computing. Linux is also open source, which allows users to peer into its inner workings.

Understanding Computers & Information Processing,Charles S. Parker,N/A,1992,"Clearly the favourite character of Canada's overseas troops during World War II, ""Herbie"" had a penchant for getting into some of the most bizarre predicaments imaginable. With feet that generally led to trouble and a nose like a disillusioned banana, Herbie provided Canadian soldiers with a daily ration of laughter at a time when humour was often at a premium. No figure before or since boosted so effectively the spirit of Canadians overseas. As J.D. MacFarlane, Editor of The Maple Leaf, stated so aptly: ""War can be funny as hell. Things happen to soldiers that shoudn't happen to a human -- crazy situations that add touches of humour to an otherwise grim business ... Herbie helped to win the war with laughs.""",Computers,676,N/A,0,en

Home Networking Annoyances,Kathy Ivens,"""O'Reilly Media, Inc.""",2005-01-25,"The beauty of a home network is that it can make life so easy--what could be better than sharing an Internet connection so that everyone can be online at the same time? With home networking you can move files from one computer to another, share resources, print to a single printer or multiple printers from any computer in the house, and IM the kids when they're holed up in their rooms. And the downside? Anyone who's ever had to troubleshoot a network glitch doesn't need to ask that question. The simple words, ""Why can't I print? Why can't I get to the Internet? Why does my computer say 'Access Denied' today, when it worked fine yesterday?"" are enough to send the home network administrator running for cover. And the concept of ""network security"" can keep the soundest sleeper tossing and turning all night.Currently, more than 8 million homes in the US have installed a network of some kind, and within five years, that number is expected to jump to 37 million. This speaks to the availability of easy-to-install home networking products. Unfortunately, there's also a glut of potential headaches that can occur after installation (and during, sometimes) with no warning label on the box saying, ""This product sure to cause annoyances.""But help is here. Home Networking Annoyances will ease the headaches and annoyances of anyone who runs a home network. This book tackles all the common annoyances associated with running your network--whether it's wired or wireless, or a combination thereof. Its friendly, off-the-cuff approach will put you in a position of power over those home networking glitches, including file sharing, printing, cabling, security, and much more. You'll find dozens of on-target tips, workarounds, and fixes that will help you improve your home networking experience in every way possible.Whether you're a mainstream business user or a home user with newly installed network hardware, you've probably had your patience tested by frustrating network maintenance issues.

""A number of people, by now, have told me that I could greatly improve things by buying a computer. My answer is that I am not going to do it. I have several reasons, and they are good ones."" Wendell Berry first challenged the idea that our advanced technological age is a good thing when he penned ""Why I Am Not Going to Buy a Computer"" in the late 1980s for Harper's Magazine, galvanizing a critical reaction eclipsing any the magazine had seen before.

Collecting and Exhibiting Computer-Based Technology,Petrina Foti,Routledge,2018-11-05,"Computer technology has transformed modern society, yet curators wishing to reflect those changes face difficult challenges in terms of both collecting and exhibiting. Collecting and Exhibiting Computer-Based Technology examines how curators at the history and technology museums of the Smithsonian Institution have met these challenges. Focusing on the curatorial process, the book explores the ways in which curators at the institution have approached the accession and display of technological artifacts. Such collections often have comparatively few precedents, and can pose unique dilemmas. In analysing the Smithsonian’s approach, Foti takes in diverse collection case studies ranging from DNA analyzers to Herbie Hancock’s music synthesizers, from iPods to born-digital photographs, from the laptop used during the filming of the television program Sex and the City to ""Stanley"" the self-driving car. Using her proposed model of ""expert curation"", she synthesizes her findings into a more universal framework for undertanding the curatorial methods associated with computer technology and reflects on what it means to be a curator in a postdigital world. Collecting and Exhibiting Computer-Based Technology offers a detailed analysis of curatorial practice in a relatively new field that is set to grow exponentially.

Black Social Capital,Marion Orr,N/A,1999,"Deindustrialization, white flight, and inner city poverty have spelled trouble for Baltimore schools. Marion Orr now examines why school reform has been difficult to achieve there, revealing the struggles of civic leaders and the limitations placed on Baltimore's African-American community as each has tried to rescue a failing school system. Examining the interplay between government and society, Orr presents the first systematic analysis of social capital both within the African-American community (""black social capital"") and outside it where social capital crosses racial lines. Orr shows that while black social capital may have created solidarity against white domination in Baltimore, it hampered African-American leaders' capacity to enlist the cooperation from white corporate elites and suburban residents needed for school reform. Orr examines social capital at the neighborhood level, in elite-level interactions, and in intergovernmental relations to argue that black social capital doesn't necessarily translate into the kind of intergroup coalition needed to bring about school reform. He also includes an extensive historical survey of the black community, showing how distrust engendered by past black experiences has hampered the formation of significant intergroup social capital. The book features case studies of school reform activity, including the first analysis of the politics surrounding Baltimore's decision to hire a private, for-profit firm to operate nine of its public schools. These cases illuminate the paradoxical aspects of black social capital in citywide school reform while offering critical perspectives on current debates about privatization, site-based management, and other reform alternatives. Orr's book challenges those who argue that social capital alone can solve fundamentally political problems by purely social means and questions the efficacy of either privatization or black community power to reform urban schools. Black Social Capital offers a cogent conceptual synthesis of social capital theory and urban regime theory that demonstrates the importance of government, politics, and leadership in converting social capital into a resource that can be mobilized for effective social change.",Business & Economics,264,N/A,0,en

Why Aren't They Shouting?,Kevin Rodgers,National Geographic Books,2017-07-25,"When Kevin Rodgers embarked on his career in finance, dealing rooms were seething with clamouring traders and gesticulating salesmen. Nearly three decades later, the feverish bustle has gone and the loudest noise you’re likely to hear is the gentle tapping of keyboards. Why Aren’t They Shouting? is a very personal, often wryly amusing chronicle of this silent revolution that takes us from the days of phone calls, hand signals and alpha males to a world of microwave communications, complex derivatives and computer geeks. In addition, it’s a masterclass in how modern banking works, for those who don’t know their spot FX from their VaR or who struggle to recall precisely how Monte Carlo pricing operates. But it’s also an account of thirty years of seismic change that raises a deeply worrying question: Could it be that the technology that has transformed banking – and that continues to do so – is actually making it ever more unstable?",Business & Economics,0,N/A,0,en

High-tech Heretic,Clifford Stoll,Doubleday Books,1999,"A thorough detonation of the hype surrounding computers in our lives, by the bestselling author of The Cuckoo's Egg and Silicon Snake Oil. In a book that should spark debate across the country, Clifford Stoll, one of the pioneers of the Internet and a renowned gadfly of the computer industry, takes an insightful, provocative--and entertaining--look at how computers have encroached on our lives. High Tech Heretic punctures the exaggerated benefits of everything from foisting computers on preschoolers to ""free"" software to computer ""help desks"" that help no one at all. Why, Stoll asks, is there a relentless drumbeat for ""computer literacy"" by educators and the high-tech industry when the computer's most common uses are for word processing and games? Is diverting scarce education resources from teachers and equipment in favor of computers in the classroom the best use of school money? Are supermarket checkout clerks computer literate because they operate a laser scanner? Has no one noticed that the closest equivalent to today's hot new multimedia and Internet Web sites are--(drumroll)--Classics Illustrated, the comic books based on literature? In these fascinating contrarian commentaries, Stoll focuses his droll wit and penetrating gaze on everything from why computers have to be so darned ""ugly"" to the cultural aftershocks of our high-tech society, to how to turn an outdated 386 computer into something useful, like a fish tank or a cat litter box. As one who loves computers as much as he disdains the inflated promises made on their behalf, Cliff Stoll is nothing less than a P. J.

The Founders,Jimmy Soni,Simon and Schuster,2022-02-22,"NAMED A BEST BOOK OF 2022 BY THE NEW YORKER National Bestseller * New York Times Editors’ Choice * Financial Times “Books to Read in 2022” A SABEW BEST IN BUSINESS BOOK AWARDS FINALIST “A gripping account of PayPal’s origins and a vivid portrait of the geeks and contrarians who made its meteoric rise possible” (The Wall Street Journal)—including Elon Musk, Amy Rowe Klement, Peter Thiel, Julie Anderson, Max Levchin, Reid Hoffman, and many others whose stories have never been shared. Today, PayPal’s founders and earliest employees are considered the technology industry’s most powerful network. Since leaving PayPal, they have formed, funded, and advised the leading companies of our era, including Tesla, Facebook, YouTube, SpaceX, Yelp, Palantir, and LinkedIn, among many others. As a group, they have driven twenty-first-century innovation and entrepreneurship. Their names stir passions; they’re as controversial as they are admired. Yet for all their influence, the story of where they first started has gone largely untold. Before igniting the commercial space race or jumpstarting social media’s rise, they were the unknown creators of a scrappy online payments start-up called PayPal. In building what became one of the world’s foremost companies, they faced bruising competition, internal strife, the emergence of widespread online fraud, and the devastating dot-com bust of the 2000s. Their success was anything but certain. In The Founders: The Story of PayPal and the Entrepreneurs Who Shaped Silicon Valley, award-winning author and biographer Jimmy Soni explores PayPal’s turbulent early days. With hundreds of interviews and unprecedented access to thousands of pages of internal material, he shows how the seeds of so much of what shapes our world today—fast-scaling digital start-ups, cashless currency concepts, mobile money transfer—were planted two decades ago. He also reveals the stories of countless individuals who were left out of the front-page features and banner headlines but who were central to PayPal’s success. Described as “an intensely magnetic chronicle” (The New York Times) and “engrossing” (Business Insider), The Founders is a story of iteration and inventiveness—the products of which have cast a long and powerful shadow over modern life. This narrative illustrates how this rare assemblage of talent came to work together and how their collaboration changed our world forever.",Business & Economics,484,N/A,0,en
"Minds, Brains and Science",John R. Searle,Harvard University Press,1986-01-01,"Minds, Brains and Science takes up just the problems that perplex people, and it does what good philosophy always does: it dispels the illusion caused by the specious collision of truths. How do we reconcile common sense and science? John Searle argues vigorously that the truths of common sense and the truths of science are both right and that the only question is how to fit them together. Searle explains how we can reconcile an intuitive view of ourselves as conscious, free, rational agents with a universe that science tells us consists of mindless physical particles. He briskly and lucidly sets out his arguments against the familiar positions in the philosophy of mind, and details the consequences of his ideas for the mind-body problem, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, questions of action and free will, and the philosophy of the social sciences.",History,116,N/A,0,en

The Power Law,Sebastian Mallaby,Penguin,2022-02-01,"Shortlisted for the Financial Times Business Book of the Year Named a Best Book of 2022 by The Economist “A gripping fly-on-the-wall story of the rise of this unique and important industry based on extensive interviews with some of the most successful venture capitalists.” - Daniel Rasmussen, Wall Street Journal “A must-read for anyone seeking to understand modern-day Silicon Valley and even our economy writ large.” -Bethany McLean, The Washington Post ""A rare and unsettling look inside a subculture of unparalleled influence.” —Jane Mayer ""A classic...A book of exceptional reporting, analysis and storytelling.” —Charles Duhigg From the New York Times bestselling author of More Money Than God comes the astonishingly frank and intimate story of Silicon Valley’s dominant venture-capital firms—and how their strategies and fates have shaped the path of innovation and the global economy Innovations rarely come from “experts.” Elon Musk was not an “electric car person” before he started Tesla. When it comes to improbable innovations, a legendary tech VC told Sebastian Mallaby, the future cannot be predicted, it can only be discovered. It is the nature of the venture-capital game that most attempts at discovery fail, but a very few succeed at such a scale that they more than make up for everything else. That extreme ratio of success and failure is the power law that drives the VC business, all of Silicon Valley, the wider tech sector, and, by extension, the world. In The Power Law, Sebastian Mallaby has parlayed unprecedented access to the most celebrated venture capitalists of all time—the key figures at Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Accel, Benchmark, and Andreessen Horowitz, as well as Chinese partnerships such as Qiming and Capital Today—into a riveting blend of storytelling and analysis that unfurls the history of tech incubation, in the Valley and ultimately worldwide. We learn the unvarnished truth, often for the first time, about some of the most iconic triumphs and infamous disasters in Valley history, from the comedy of errors at the birth of Apple to the avalanche of venture money that fostered hubris at WeWork and Uber. VCs’ relentless search for grand slams brews an obsession with the ideal of the lone entrepreneur-genius, and companies seen as potential “unicorns” are given intoxicating amounts of power, with sometimes disastrous results. On a more systemic level, the need to make outsized bets on unproven talent reinforces bias, with women and minorities still represented at woefully low levels. This does not just have social justice implications: as Mallaby relates, China’s homegrown VC sector, having learned at the Valley’s feet, is exploding and now has more women VC luminaries than America has ever had. Still, Silicon Valley VC remains the top incubator of business innovation anywhere—it is not where ideas come from so much as where they go to become the products and companies that create the future. By taking us so deeply into the VCs’ game, The Power Law helps us think about our own future through their eyes.",Business & Economics,497,N/A,0,en

Goedel's Way,"Gregory Chaitin, Francisco A Doria, Newton C.A. da Costa",CRC Press,2011-10-14,"Kurt Gödel (1906-1978) was an Austrian-American mathematician, who is best known for his incompleteness theorems. He was the greatest mathematical logician of the 20th century, with his contributions extending to Einstein’s general relativity, as he proved that Einstein’s theory allows for time machines. The Gödel incompleteness theorem - the usual formal mathematical systems cannot prove nor disprove all true mathematical sentences - is frequently presented in textbooks as something that happens in the rarefied realms of mathematical logic, and that has nothing to do with the real world. Practice shows the contrary though; one can demonstrate the validity of the phenomenon in various areas, ranging from chaos theory and physics to economics and even ecology. In this lively treatise, based on Chaitin’s groundbreaking work and on the da Costa-Doria results in physics, ecology, economics and computer science, the authors show that the Gödel incompleteness phenomenon can directly bear on the practice of science and perhaps on our everyday life. This accessible book gives a new, detailed and elementary explanation of the Gödel incompleteness theorems and presents the Chaitin results and their relation to the da Costa-Doria results, which are given in full, but with no technicalities. Besides theory, the historical report and personal stories about the main character and on this book’s writing process, make it appealing leisure reading for those interested in mathematics, logic, physics, philosophy and computer sciences.

In these cases the writers describe and analyze various roles that research played in their development work and ways in which research, curriculum development, and tool development can inform each other. These thoughtful descriptions and analyses provide documentation of how this process can and does occur. The remaining chapters in the second volume address research related issues and perspectives on the use of technology in the teaching and learning of mathematics. The lessons learned from the research presented in these volumes are lessons about teaching and learning that can be applied more broadly than solely in technological settings.",Mathematics,484,N/A,0,en
Unabomber,Robert Graysmith,"Monkey's Paw Publishing, Inc.",2021-01-26,"From National Bestselling author Robert Graysmith comes the original book about the mysterious UNABOMBER, the elusive mailbomber who baffled authorities for 17 years, creating the longest and most expensive investigation in FBI history. November 15, 1979, the cockpit crew aboard American Airlines Flight No. 444 felt a concussion, a “thump,” and heard a “loud sucking noise” come from the area of the forward cargo hold. The sleek, silver outer skin of the fuselage began to peel and blister, just outside where the bags of mail were stored. Panic set in as acrid, dense clouds of black smoke billowed into the passenger cabin. The plane descended from 30,000 ft at twice the normal velocity, over 600 mph. The crew made a harrowing landing, the doors immediately flew open, and plumes of smoke roiled out. At its center lay a peculiarly made device, built from commonplace odds and ends, with one strange distinction–some key components were made from wood and carved by hand. This time no one was killed, but that would soon change. Who was this man? What was with his strange fascination against technology? And what made him so elusive? What reviewers are saying about Unabomber: A Desire to Kill: “The work of a careful and conscientious investigative reporter . . . thought provoking . . .”--Bill Tafoya, Expert FBI Profiler, Crime and Justice International. “An intensive portrait of the Unabomber”--Variety.",True Crime,586,N/A,0,en

How to Cheat at Windows System Administration Using Command Line Scripts,Pawan K Bhardwaj,Elsevier,2006-10-09,"How to Cheat at Windows Systems Administrators using Command Line Scripts teaches system administrators hundreds of powerful, time-saving tips for automating daily system administration tasks using Windows command line scripts. With every new version of Windows, Microsoft is trying to ease the administration jobs by adding more and more layers of graphical user interface (GUI) or configuration wizards (dialog boxes). While these 'wizards' are interactive and make the administrator's job easier, they are not always the most convenient and efficient way to accomplish the everyday administration tasks. These wizards are time consuming and, at times, may seem a bit confusing. The purpose of the book is to teach administrators how to use command-line scripts to complete everyday administration jobs, solve recurring network problems and at the same time improve their efficiency. - Provides system administrators with hundreds of tips, tricks, and scripts to complete administration tasks more quickly and efficiently. - No direct competition for a core tool for Windows administrators. - Builds on success of other books in the series including How to Cheat at Managing Windows Small Business Server 2003 and How to Cheat at Managing Microsoft Operations Manager 2005.",Computers,481,4,2,en

Functional Programming in Scala,"Paul Chiusano, Runar Bjarnason",Simon and Schuster,2014-09-01,"Summary Functional Programming in Scala is a serious tutorial for programmers looking to learn FP and apply it to the everyday business of coding. The book guides readers from basic techniques to advanced topics in a logical, concise, and clear progression. In it, you'll find concrete examples and exercises that open up the world of functional programming. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. About the Technology Functional programming (FP) is a style of software development emphasizing functions that don't depend on program state. Functional code is easier to test and reuse, simpler to parallelize, and less prone to bugs than other code. Scala is an emerging JVM language that offers strong support for FP. Its familiar syntax and transparent interoperability with Java make Scala a great place to start learning FP. About the Book Functional Programming in Scala is a serious tutorial for programmers looking to learn FP and apply it to their everyday work. The book guides readers from basic techniques to advanced topics in a logical, concise, and clear progression. In it, you'll find concrete examples and exercises that open up the world of functional programming. This book assumes no prior experience with functional programming. Some prior exposure to Scala or Java is helpful.

Conquering Complexity,"Mike Hinchey, Lorcan Coyle",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-01-03,"Software has long been perceived as complex, at least within Software Engineering circles. We have been living in a recognised state of crisis since the first NATO Software Engineering conference in 1968. Time and again we have been proven unable to engineer reliable software as easily/cheaply as we imagined. Cost overruns and expensive failures are the norm. The problem is fundamentally one of complexity: software is fundamentally complex because it must be precise. Problems that appear to be specified quite easily in plain language become far more complex when written in a more formal notation, such as computer code. Comparisons with other engineering disciplines are deceptive. One cannot easily increase the factor of safety of software in the same way that one could in building a steel structure, for example. Software is typically built assuming perfection, often without adequate safety nets in case the unthinkable happens. In such circumstances it should not be surprising to find out that (seemingly) minor errors have the potential to cause entire software systems to collapse. The goal of this book is to uncover techniques that will aid in overcoming complexity and enable us to produce reliable, dependable computer systems that will operate as intended, and yet are produced on-time, in budget, and are evolvable, both over time and at run time. We hope that the contributions in this book will aid in understanding the nature of software complexity and provide guidance for the control or avoidance of complexity in the engineering of complex software systems.",Computers,477,N/A,0,en

The Friendly Orange Glow,Brian Dear,Vintage,2017-11-14,"At a time when Steve Jobs was only a teenager and Mark Zuckerberg wasn’t even born, a group of visionary engineers and designers—some of them only high school students—in the late 1960s and 1970s created a computer system called PLATO, which was light-years ahead in experimenting with how people would learn, engage, communicate, and play through connected computers. Not only did PLATO engineers make significant hardware breakthroughs with plasma displays and touch screens but PLATO programmers also came up with a long list of software innovations: chat rooms, instant messaging, message boards, screen savers, multiplayer games, online newspapers, interactive fiction, and emoticons. Together, the PLATO community pioneered what we now collectively engage in as cyberculture. They were among the first to identify and also realize the potential and scope of the social interconnectivity of computers, well before the creation of the internet. PLATO was the foundational model for every online community that was to follow in its footsteps. The Friendly Orange Glow is the first history to recount in fascinating detail the remarkable accomplishments and inspiring personal stories of the PLATO community. The addictive nature of PLATO both ruined many a college career and launched pathbreaking multimillion-dollar software products. Its development, impact, and eventual disappearance provides an instructive case study of technological innovation and disruption, project management, and missed opportunities. Above all, The Friendly Orange Glow at last reveals new perspectives on the origins of social computing and our internet-infatuated world.",Technology & Engineering,641,N/A,0,en
The Universal Computer,Martin Davis,CRC Press,2018-10-08,"The breathtakingly rapid pace of change in computing makes it easy to overlook the pioneers who began it all. Written by Martin Davis, respected logician and researcher in the theory of computation, The Universal Computer: The Road from Leibniz to Turing explores the fascinating lives, ideas, and discoveries of seven remarkable mathematicians. It tells the stories of the unsung heroes of the computer age – the logicians. The story begins with Leibniz in the 17th century and then focuses on Boole, Frege, Cantor, Hilbert, and Gödel, before turning to Turing. Turing’s analysis of algorithmic processes led to a single, all-purpose machine that could be programmed to carry out such processes—the computer. Davis describes how this incredible group, with lives as extraordinary as their accomplishments, grappled with logical reasoning and its mechanization. By investigating their achievements and failures, he shows how these pioneers paved the way for modern computing. Bringing the material up to date, in this revised edition Davis discusses the success of the IBM Watson on Jeopardy, reorganizes the information on incompleteness, and adds information on Konrad Zuse. A distinguished prize-winning logician, Martin Davis has had a career of more than six decades devoted to the important interface between logic and computer science. His expertise, combined with his genuine love of the subject and excellent storytelling, make him the perfect person to tell this story.",Computers,232,N/A,0,en

Woodhull",N/A,1997,"The Second Edition of this best-selling introductory operating systems text is the only textbook that successfully balances theory and practice. The authors accomplish this important goal by first covering all the fundamental operating systems concepts such as processes, interprocess communication, input/output, virtual memory, file systems, and security. These principles are then illustrated through the use of a small, but real, UNIX-like operating system called MINIX that allows students to test their knowledge in hands-on system design projects. Each book includes a CD-ROM that contains the full MINIX source code and two simulators for running MINIX on various computers.",Minix (Computer operating system),939,N/A,0,en
Computational Imaging,"Ayush Bhandari, Achuta Kadambi, Ramesh Raskar",MIT Press,2022-10-25,"A comprehensive and up-to-date textbook and reference for computational imaging, which combines vision, graphics, signal processing, and optics. Computational imaging involves the joint design of imaging hardware and computer algorithms to create novel imaging systems with unprecedented capabilities. In recent years such capabilities include cameras that operate at a trillion frames per second, microscopes that can see small viruses long thought to be optically irresolvable, and telescopes that capture images of black holes. This text offers a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to this rapidly growing field, a convergence of vision, graphics, signal processing, and optics. It can be used as an instructional resource for computer imaging courses and as a reference for professionals. It covers the fundamentals of the field, current research and applications, and light transport techniques. The text first presents an imaging toolkit, including optics, image sensors, and illumination, and a computational toolkit, introducing modeling, mathematical tools, model-based inversion, data-driven inversion techniques, and hybrid inversion techniques. It then examines different modalities of light, focusing on the plenoptic function, which describes degrees of freedom of a light ray. Finally, the text outlines light transport techniques, describing imaging systems that obtain micron-scale 3D shape or optimize for noise-free imaging, optical computing, and non-line-of-sight imaging. Throughout, it discusses the use of computational imaging methods in a range of application areas, including smart phone photography, autonomous driving, and medical imaging.

Mathematics in Ancient Iraq,Eleanor Robson,Princeton University Press,2020-06-30,"This monumental book traces the origins and development of mathematics in the ancient Middle East, from its earliest beginnings in the fourth millennium BCE to the end of indigenous intellectual culture in the second century BCE when cuneiform writing was gradually abandoned. Eleanor Robson offers a history like no other, examining ancient mathematics within its broader social, political, economic, and religious contexts, and showing that mathematics was not just an abstract discipline for elites but a key component in ordering society and understanding the world. The region of modern-day Iraq is uniquely rich in evidence for ancient mathematics because its prehistoric inhabitants wrote on clay tablets, many hundreds of thousands of which have been archaeologically excavated, deciphered, and translated. Drawing from these and a wealth of other textual and archaeological evidence, Robson gives an extraordinarily detailed picture of how mathematical ideas and practices were conceived, used, and taught during this period. She challenges the prevailing view that they were merely the simplistic precursors of classical Greek mathematics, and explains how the prevailing view came to be. Robson reveals the true sophistication and beauty of ancient Middle Eastern mathematics as it evolved over three thousand years, from the earliest beginnings of recorded accounting to complex mathematical astronomy. Every chapter provides detailed information on sources, and the book includes an appendix on all mathematical cuneiform tablets published before 2007.",Mathematics,419,N/A,0,en
The Emotionally Intelligent Manager,"David R. Caruso, Peter Salovey",John Wiley & Sons,2004-03-15,"We have long been taught that emotions should be felt and expressed in carefully controlled ways, and then only in certain environments and at certain times. This is especially true when at work, particularly when managing others. It is considered terribly unprofessional to express emotion while on the job, and many of us believe that our biggest mistakes and regrets are due to our reactions at those times when our emotions get the better of us. David R. Caruso and Peter Salovey believe that this view of emotion is not correct. The emotion centers of the brain, they argue, are not relegated to a secondary place in our thinking and reasoning, but instead are an integral part of what it means to think, reason, and to be intelligent. In The Emotionally Intelligent Manager, they show that emotion is not just important, but absolutely necessary for us to make good decisions, take action to solve problems, cope with change, and succeed. The authors detail a practical four-part hierarchy of emotional skills: identifying emotions, using emotions to facilitate thinking, understanding emotions, and managing emotions—and show how we can measure, learn, and develop each skill and employ them in an integrated way to solve our most difficult work-related problems.",Business & Economics,320,5,1,en

The first in the Kopps Sisters Novel Series, Girl Waits with Gun is an enthralling novel based on the forgotten true story of one of the nation’s first female deputy sheriffs. Constance Kopp doesn’t quite fit the mold. She towers over most men, has no interest in marriage or domestic affairs, and has been isolated from the world since a family secret sent her and her sisters into hiding fifteen years ago. One day a belligerent and powerful silk factory owner runs down their buggy, and a dispute over damages turns into a war of bricks, bullets, and threats as he unleashes his gang on their family farm. When the sheriff enlists her help in convicting the men, Constance is forced to confront her past and defend her family — and she does it in a way that few women of 1914 would have dared.

The Sirens of Mars,Sarah Stewart Johnson,Crown,2020-07-07,"“Sarah Stewart Johnson interweaves her own coming-of-age story as a planetary scientist with a vivid history of the exploration of Mars in this celebration of human curiosity, passion, and perseverance.”—Alan Lightman, author of Einstein’s Dreams WINNER OF THE PHI BETA KAPPA AWARD FOR SCIENCE • NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY The New York Times Book Review • Times (UK) • Library Journal “Lovely . . . Johnson’s prose swirls with lyrical wonder, as varied and multihued as the apricot deserts, butterscotch skies and blue sunsets of Mars.”—Anthony Doerr, The New York Times Book Review Mars was once similar to Earth, but today there are no rivers, no lakes, no oceans. Coated in red dust, the terrain is bewilderingly empty. And yet multiple spacecraft are circling Mars, sweeping over Terra Sabaea, Syrtis Major, the dunes of Elysium, and Mare Sirenum—on the brink, perhaps, of a staggering find, one that would inspire humankind as much as any discovery in the history of modern science. In this beautifully observed, deeply personal book, Georgetown scientist Sarah Stewart Johnson tells the story of how she and other researchers have scoured Mars for signs of life, transforming the planet from a distant point of light into a world of its own. Johnson’s fascination with Mars began as a child in Kentucky, turning over rocks with her father and looking at planets in the night sky. She now conducts fieldwork in some of Earth’s most hostile environments, such as the Dry Valleys of Antarctica and the salt flats of Western Australia, developing methods for detecting life on other worlds. Here, with poetic precision, she interlaces her own personal journey—as a female scientist and a mother—with tales of other seekers, from Percival Lowell, who was convinced that a utopian society existed on Mars, to Audouin Dollfus, who tried to carry out astronomical observations from a stratospheric balloon. In the process, she shows how the story of Mars is also a story about Earth: This other world has been our mirror, our foil, a telltale reflection of our own anxieties and yearnings. Empathetic and evocative, The Sirens of Mars offers an unlikely natural history of a place where no human has ever set foot, while providing a vivid portrait of our quest to defy our isolation in the cosmos.",Science,303,N/A,0,en

Copyright Protection of Computer Software in the United Kingdom,Stanley Lai,Hart Publishing,2000-06-26,"This work analyses the scope of copyright protection for computer software in the United Kingdom,and examines challenges for the future. The work presents the case for the adoption and application of infringement methodology emanating from the courts in the United States, resulting in a narrower scope of protection than is presently argued for by many UK academics, practitioners and judges alike. The work makes a careful evaluation of the efficacy of the various prevailing tests for infringement of copyright in software and their progenies, suggesting an improved formula and advocating the utility of limiting doctrines to assist in the determination of substantial similarity of particular non-literal software elements, user interfaces and screen display protection. The monograph also contains a detailed study of reverse engineering, copyright defences, permitted acts, database protection and the copyright-contract interface in the context of computer software, not omitting crucial discussions of the internet, digital dissemination and the impact of recent treaty and legislative initiatives on British copyright law.

Optimization of Large Structural Systems,George I. N. Rozvany,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-11-21,"G.I.N. Rozvany ASI Director, Professor of Structural Design, FB 10, Essen University, Essen, Germany Structural optimization deals with the optimal design of all systems that consist, at least partially, of solids and are subject to stresses and deformations. This inte grated discipline plays an increasingly important role in all branches of technology, including aerospace, structural, mechanical, civil and chemical engineering as well as energy generation and building technology. In fact, the design of most man made objects, ranging from space-ships and long-span bridges to tennis rackets and artificial organs, can be improved considerably if human intuition is enhanced by means of computer-aided, systematic decisions. In analysing highly complex structural systems in practice, discretization is un avoidable because closed-form analytical solutions are only available for relatively simple, idealized problems. To keep discretization errors to a minimum, it is de sirable to use a relatively large number of elements. Modern computer technology enables us to analyse systems with many thousand degrees of freedom. In the optimization of structural systems, however, most currently available methods are restricted to at most a few hundred variables or a few hundred active constraints.",Technology & Engineering,1201,N/A,0,en

Electronic Consumer Contracts in the Conflict of Laws,Zheng Sophia Tang,Bloomsbury Publishing,2009-09-09,"The application of private international law to electronic consumer contracts raises new, complex, and controversial questions. It is new because consumer protection was not a private international law concern until very recently and e-commerce only became an important commercial activity within the last ten years. E-consumer contracts generate original questions which have not been considered under traditional private international law theories. It is complex because it has to deal both with difficulties raised by consumer contracts and the challenges of e-commerce. Reasonable resolutions to consumer contracts may prove inappropriate in e-commerce, while effective approaches to resolving private international law problems in e-commerce may be improper for consumer contracts. It is controversial because it concerns the conflicting interests of consumers and businesses in a fast-moving commercial environment - a fair balance is therefore hard to achieve. Without proper solutions provided by private international law, consumers will not be confident about purchasing online, and businesses will face unreasonable risk and participation costs in e-commerce. Updated and properly designed private international law rules are essential to the further development of e-commerce. This book aims to provide an answer to the urgent requirement for legal certainty, security and justice in e-consumer contracts. It is primarily concerned with existing approaches to jurisdiction and choice of law issues in e-consumer contracts in the European Community and England, but some typical approaches in other jurisdictions are also examined. Based on the analysis and the comparative study of the existing law, the book seeks to provide a proposal as to what the law should be in order to provide certainty to both parties, to provide reasonable protection to consumers, and to promote the development of e-commerce.",Law,348,N/A,0,en

Copyright Law in the Digital World,"Manoj Kumar Sinha, Vandana Mahalwar",Springer,2017-03-06,"This book addresses the key issues, challenges and implications arising out of changes in the copyright law and corresponding judicial responses. Using concrete examples, the book does not assume any prior knowledge of copyright law, but brings together leading intellectual property researchers to consider the significant role of copyright law in shaping the needs of the modern digital world. It provides an insight into two distinct arenas: copyright and digital media. The exponential increase in the ability to multiply and disseminate information by digital means has sparked numerous conflicts pertaining to copyright – and in turn has prompted lawmakers to expand the scope of copyright protection in the digital age. Bearing in mind the new questions that the advent of the digital age has raised on the role and function of copyright, the book presents a collection of papers largely covering new frontiers and changing horizons especially in this area. The contributions intensively address core issues including the exhaustion principle, copyright and digital media, liability of hosting service providers, the originality requirement, accessibility to published works for the visually disabled, criminalization of copyright infringement, and software protection under copyright law, among others. Consisting of 14 papers, this book will be equally interesting to researchers, policymakers, practitioners and lawmakers, especially those active in the field of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).",Law,334,N/A,0,en

This book presents software engineering as a coherent and logically built synthesis and makes it possible to properly carry out an application of small or medium difficulty that can later be developed and adapted to more complex cases. This text is comprised of six chapters and begins by introducing the reader to the fundamental notions of entities, actions, and programming. The next two chapters elaborate on the concepts of information and consistency domains and show that a processor can take into account only imperative, occasionally adverbial, statements written in an artificial language. The third chapter explains how to define the general characteristics of actions so that they may be expressed using an artificial language conceived by an interlocutor of Indo-European idiom. The fourth chapter looks at general and technical criteria, and the fifth chapter deals with all the fundamental structures of entities. The final chapter considers a rational method of determining the actions. This book is a valuable resource for software designers and students taking computer courses.",Reference,141,N/A,0,en

"Computers, Communication, and Usability","Paul Byerley, Philip J. Barnard, Jon May",North Holland,1993,"In the last half century, research on usability has been dominated by three main areas: military hardware, telecommunications equipment and information technology. Characteristically, research was carried out on local issues as they affected a particular class of technology and its design. In just the last decade there has been a massive convergence both in the technological bases of these areas of concern and in the human factors issues they raise.This book considers usability research in depth but does not seek to provide a comprehensive view of all European research on related topics. Rather, it draws on a limited number of projects and juxtaposes contributions concerned with practical issues in method development and more basic research. This strategy was chosen with three general objectives in mind. The first was to provide a description of the product design context for usability research and practice, focusing in particular on the problems and opportunities arising from the advanced communication services which are expected to be in business and domestic markets within 20 years. The second was to draw upon some illustrative basic research in usability, system modelling and design behaviour which could lead to significant improvements in design practice in the long term. The last was to provide an integrated guide to some recently introduced usability design methods which are particularly appropriate to the design problems of advanced communication services.Specifically, the publication should also be viewed as a demonstration of the results of international collaborative research supported by the European Community. Researchers from most of the western European countries have jointly engaged in a series of projects in telecommunications and information technology, these programmes being RACE, ESPRIT main and ESPRIT Basic Research. The book not only represents a significant sample of collaborative research within these programmes but attempts to bring together the results around the general theme of usability requirements.It is hoped that this publication will be of interest to those developing future research programmes, to researchers in industry and university and to psychologists and engineers designing new computer and service products.",Computers,490,N/A,0,en

Computer Crime Law,Orin S. Kerr,West Academic Publishing,2006,"This book introduces the future of criminal law. It covers every aspect of crime in the digital age, assembled together for the first time. Topics range from Internet surveillance law and the Patriot Act to computer hacking laws and the Council of Europe cybercrime convention. More and more crimes involve digital evidence, and computer crime law will be an essential area for tomorrow's criminal law practitioners. Many U.S. Attorney's Offices have started computer crime units, as have many state Attorney General offices, and any student with a background in this emerging area of law will have a leg up on the competition. This is the first law school book dedicated entirely to computer crime law. The materials are authored entirely by Orin Kerr, a new star in the area of criminal law and Internet law who has recently published articles in the Harvard Law Review, Columbia Law Review, NYU Law Review, and Michigan Law Review. The book is filled with ideas for future scholarship, including hundreds of important questions that have never been addressed in the scholarly literature. The book reflects the author's practice experience, as well: Kerr was a computer crime prosecutor at the Justice Department for three years, and the book combines theoretical insights with practical tips for working with actual cases. Students will find it easy and fun to read, and professors will find it an angaging introduction to a new world of scholarly ideas. The book is ideally suited either for a 2-credit seminar or a 3-credit course, and should appeal both to criminal law professors and those interested in cyberlaw or law and technology. No advanced knowledge of computers and the Internet is required or assumed.",Law,808,N/A,0,en

"Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python, revised and expanded edition",John V. Guttag,MIT Press,2013-08-09,"An introductory text that teaches students the art of computational problem solving, covering topics that range from simple algorithms to information visualization. This book introduces students with little or no prior programming experience to the art of computational problem solving using Python and various Python libraries, including PyLab. It provides students with skills that will enable them to make productive use of computational techniques, including some of the tools and techniques of “data science” for using computation to model and interpret data. The book is based on an MIT course (which became the most popular course offered through MIT's OpenCourseWare) and was developed for use not only in a conventional classroom but in a massive open online course (or MOOC) offered by the pioneering MIT-Harvard collaboration edX. Students are introduced to Python and the basics of programming in the context of such computational concepts and techniques as exhaustive enumeration, bisection search, and efficient approximation algorithms. The book does not require knowledge of mathematics beyond high school algebra, but does assume that readers are comfortable with rigorous thinking and not intimidated by mathematical concepts. Although it covers such traditional topics as computational complexity and simple algorithms, the book focuses on a wide range of topics not found in most introductory texts, including information visualization, simulations to model randomness, computational techniques to understand data, and statistical techniques that inform (and misinform) as well as two related but relatively advanced topics: optimization problems and dynamic programming. Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python can serve as a stepping-stone to more advanced computer science courses, or as a basic grounding in computational problem solving for students in other disciplines.",Computers,315,N/A,0,en

The Patent Wars,Fred Warshofsky,N/A,1994-10-17,"From the ""Diaper Wars"" that pitted Procter & Gamble against Kimberly-Clark to disputes over high-temperature superconductors, veteran technology writer Fred Warshofsky tracks patent litigation's path to becoming one of the most potent financial tools of the 1990s. The stakes are enormous. For example, Honeywell Inc. more than doubled its net income for the third quarter of 1992 despite lower operating revenue by winning some dozen patent infringement suits against Japanese camera makers, including a tidy $96 billion from Minolta. Japanese companies frequently win. In a revealing analysis of the patent wars in Japan, Warshofsky shows how Japanese industries surround basic patents with clusters of patent modifications. In the global winner-take-all battle, this strategy gives them effective control over the licensing and usefulness of the original invention. The patent game becomes more complicated with the development of each new product and technology. Nowhere is the phenomenon more evident than in software, semiconductors, and biotechnology. Warshofsky delves into each of these highly sophisticated industries. In the software industry, for instance, Warshofsky dissects patent battles such as Apple v. Microsoft and Borland v. Lotus that have made front-page headlines. The Patent Wars is the first book to take an incisive look at this new business offensive and its consequences, including hackers and piracy in cyberspace. As more and more companies deliberately strive to prohibit competition and innovation, this stimulating and highly informative book will become essential reading for people in business and finance, technology-watchers, and policymakers.",Business & Economics,312,N/A,0,en

The Mathematics of Love,Hannah Fry,Simon and Schuster,2015-02-03,"In this must-have for anyone who wants to better understand their love life, a mathematician pulls back the curtain and reveals the hidden patterns—from dating sites to divorce, sex to marriage—behind the rituals of love. The roller coaster of romance is hard to quantify; defining how lovers might feel from a set of simple equations is impossible. But that doesn’t mean that mathematics isn’t a crucial tool for understanding love. Love, like most things in life, is full of patterns. And mathematics is ultimately the study of patterns—from predicting the weather to the fluctuations of the stock market, the movement of planets or the growth of cities. These patterns twist and turn and warp and evolve just as the rituals of love do. In The Mathematics of Love, Dr. Hannah Fry takes the reader on a fascinating journey through the patterns that define our love lives, applying mathematical formulas to the most common yet complex questions pertaining to love: What’s the chance of finding love? What’s the probability that it will last? How do online dating algorithms work, exactly? Can game theory help us decide who to approach in a bar? At what point in your dating life should you settle down? From evaluating the best strategies for online dating to defining the nebulous concept of beauty, Dr. Fry proves—with great insight, wit, and fun—that math is a surprisingly useful tool to negotiate the complicated, often baffling, sometimes infuriating, always interesting, mysteries of love.",Family & Relationships,128,N/A,0,en

Over a decade ago, Simon Sinek started a movement that inspired millions to demand purpose at work, to ask what was the WHY of their organization. Since then, millions have been touched by the power of his ideas, and these ideas remain as relevant and timely as ever. START WITH WHY asks (and answers) the questions: why are some people and organizations more innovative, more influential, and more profitable than others? Why do some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike? Even among the successful, why are so few able to repeat their success over and over? People like Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and the Wright Brothers had little in common, but they all started with WHY. They realized that people won't truly buy into a product, service, movement, or idea until they understand the WHY behind it. START WITH WHY shows that the leaders who have had the greatest influence in the world all think, act and communicate the same way—and it's the opposite of what everyone else does. Sinek calls this powerful idea The Golden Circle, and it provides a framework upon which organizations can be built, movements can be led, and people can be inspired. And it all starts with WHY.",Business & Economics,257,4.5,2,en

Analogia,George Dyson,Macmillan + ORM,2020-08-18,"Named one of WIRED’s ""The Best Pop Culture That Got Us Through 2020"" In Analogia, technology historian George Dyson presents a startling look back at the analog age and life before the digital revolution—and an unsettling vision of what comes next. In 1716, the philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz spent eight days taking the cure with Peter the Great at Bad Pyrmont in Saxony, trying to persuade the tsar to launch a voyage of discovery from Russia to America and to adopt digital computing as the foundation for a remaking of life on earth. In two classic books, Darwin Among the Machines and Turing’s Cathedral, George Dyson chronicled the realization of the second of Leibniz’s visions. In Analogia, his pathbreaking new book, he brings the story full circle, starting with the Russian American expedition of 1741 and ending with the beyond-digital revolution that will complete the transformation of the world. Dyson enlists a startling cast of characters, from the time of Catherine the Great to the age of machine intelligence, and draws heavily on his own experiences at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and onward to the rain forest of the Northwest Coast. We are, Dyson reveals, entering a new epoch in human history, one driven by a generation of machines whose powers are no longer under programmable control.

"Reader, Come Home",Maryanne Wolf,HarperCollins,2018-08-14,"The author of the acclaimed Proust and the Squid follows up with a lively, ambitious, and deeply informative book that considers the future of the reading brain and our capacity for critical thinking, empathy, and reflection as we become increasingly dependent on digital technologies. A decade ago, Maryanne Wolf’s Proust and the Squid revealed what we know about how the brain learns to read and how reading changes the way we think and feel. Since then, the ways we process written language have changed dramatically with many concerned about both their own changes and that of children. New research on the reading brain chronicles these changes in the brains of children and adults as they learn to read while immersed in a digitally dominated medium. Drawing deeply on this research, this book comprises a series of letters Wolf writes to us—her beloved readers—to describe her concerns and her hopes about what is happening to the reading brain as it unavoidably changes to adapt to digital mediums. Wolf raises difficult questions, including: Will children learn to incorporate the full range of ""deep reading"" processes that are at the core of the expert reading brain? Will the mix of a seemingly infinite set of distractions for children’s attention and their quick access to immediate, voluminous information alter their ability to think for themselves? With information at their fingertips, will the next generation learn to build their own storehouse of knowledge, which could impede the ability to make analogies and draw inferences from what they know? Will all these influences change the formation in children and the use in adults of ""slower"" cognitive processes like critical thinking, personal reflection, imagination, and empathy that comprise deep reading and that influence both how we think and how we live our lives? How can we preserve deep reading processes in future iterations of the reading brain? Concerns about attention span, critical reasoning, and over-reliance on technology are never just about children—Wolf herself has found that, though she is a reading expert, her ability to read deeply has been impacted as she has become increasingly dependent on screens. Wolf draws on neuroscience, literature, education, and philosophy and blends historical, literary, and scientific facts with down-to-earth examples and warm anecdotes to illuminate complex ideas that culminate in a proposal for a biliterate reading brain. Provocative and intriguing, Reader, Come Home is a roadmap that provides a cautionary but hopeful perspective on the impact of technology on our brains and our most essential intellectual capacities—and what this could mean for our future.",Science,233,3,2,en

The Efficient Use of Vector Computers with Emphasis on Computational Fluid Dynamics,"Willi Schönauer, Wolfgang Gentzsch",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-11-11,"The GAMM Committee for Numerical Methods in Fluid Mechanics organizes workshops which should bring together experts of a narrow field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to exchange ideas and experiences in order to speed-up the development in this field. In this sense it was suggested that a workshop should treat the solution of CFD problems on vector computers. Thus we organized a workshop with the title ""The efficient use of vector computers with emphasis on computational fluid dynamics"". The workshop took place at the Computing Centre of the University of Karlsruhe, March 13-15,1985. The participation had been restricted to 22 people of 7 countries. 18 papers have been presented. In the announcement of the workshop we wrote: ""Fluid mechanics has actively stimulated the development of superfast vector computers like the CRAY's or CYBER 205. Now these computers on their turn stimulate the development of new algorithms which result in a high degree of vectorization (sca1ar/vectorized execution-time). But with 3-D problems we quickly reach the limit of present vector computers. If we want e.g. to solve a system of 6 partial differential equations (e.g. for u, v, w, p, k, € or for the vectors u, curl u) on a 50x50x50 grid we have 750.000 unknowns and for a 4th order difference method we have circa 60 million nonzero coefficients in the highly sparse matrix.

Tangible Interactive Systems,Guy André Boy,Springer,2016-04-21,"Distinguishing between tangible user interfaces (TUI) and tangible interactive systems (TISs), this book takes into account not only the user interfaces but also looks at how interaction can be enabled by using digital information through the physical environment. TISs go far beyond the concept of tangible user interfaces, addressing large complex systems in the framework of human-centred design and putting the human at the center of the design process from the start. How can human-centered designers grasp the real world with computers? This question is explored by looking at concepts such as innovation, complexity, flexibility, maturity, stability, sustainability and art to see whether we can assess both physical and figurative tangibility during the design process before product delivery. Concepts like creativity, design thinking and team spirit are fundamental to TIS’s human-centered design, and are presented together with human-systems integration (HSI), agile development and formative evaluations to build a greater understanding of this new area of research. Tangible Interactive Systems would be an essential read to designers, academics and other professionals concerned with product design within HCI, industrial design, virtual engineering and other related areas.",Computers,218,N/A,0,en

Essential Logic for Computer Science,"Rex Page, Ruben Gamboa",MIT Press,2019-01-08,"An introduction to applying predicate logic to testing and verification of software and digital circuits that focuses on applications rather than theory. Computer scientists use logic for testing and verification of software and digital circuits, but many computer science students study logic only in the context of traditional mathematics, encountering the subject in a few lectures and a handful of problem sets in a discrete math course. This book offers a more substantive and rigorous approach to logic that focuses on applications in computer science. Topics covered include predicate logic, equation-based software, automated testing and theorem proving, and large-scale computation. Formalism is emphasized, and the book employs three formal notations: traditional algebraic formulas of propositional and predicate logic; digital circuit diagrams; and the widely used partially automated theorem prover, ACL2, which provides an accessible introduction to mechanized formalism. For readers who want to see formalization in action, the text presents examples using Proof Pad, a lightweight ACL2 environment. Readers will not become ALC2 experts, but will learn how mechanized logic can benefit software and hardware engineers. In addition, 180 exercises, some of them extremely challenging, offer opportunities for problem solving. There are no prerequisites beyond high school algebra. Programming experience is not required to understand the book's equation-based approach. The book can be used in undergraduate courses in logic for computer science and introduction to computer science and in math courses for computer science students.",Computers,305,N/A,0,en

Superminds,Thomas W. Malone,"Little, Brown Spark",2018-05-15,"From the founding director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence comes a fascinating look at the remarkable capacity for intelligence exhibited by groups of people and computers working together. If you're like most people, you probably believe that humans are the most intelligent animals on our planet. But there's another kind of entity that can be far smarter: groups of people. In this groundbreaking book, Thomas Malone, the founding director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence, shows how groups of people working together in superminds -- like hierarchies, markets, democracies, and communities -- have been responsible for almost all human achievements in business, government, science, and beyond. And these collectively intelligent human groups are about to get much smarter. Using dozens of striking examples and case studies, Malone shows how computers can help create more intelligent superminds simply by connecting humans to one another in a variety of rich, new ways. And although it will probably happen more gradually than many people expect, artificially intelligent computers will amplify the power of these superminds by doing increasingly complex kinds of thinking. Together, these changes will have far-reaching implications for everything from the way we buy groceries and plan business strategies to how we respond to climate change, and even for democracy itself. By understanding how these collectively intelligent groups work, we can learn how to harness their genius to achieve our human goals. Drawing on cutting-edge science and insights from a remarkable range of disciplines, Superminds articulates a bold -- and utterly fascinating -- picture of the future that will change the ways you work and live, both with other people and with computers.",Business & Economics,327,N/A,0,en

The Digital Hand,James W. Cortada,Oxford University Press,2005-11-03,"The Digital Hand, Volume 2, is a historical survey of how computers and telecommunications have been deployed in over a dozen industries in the financial, telecommunications, media and entertainment sectors over the past half century. It is past of a sweeping three-volume description of how management in some forty industries embraced the computer and changed the American economy. Computers have fundamentally changed the nature of work in America. However it is difficult to grasp the full extent of these changes and their implications for the future of business. To begin the long process of understanding the effects of computing in American business, we need to know the history of how computers were first used, by whom and why. In this, the second volume of The Digital Hand, James W. Cortada combines detailed analysis with narrative history to provide a broad overview of computing's and telecomunications' role in over a dozen industries, ranging from Old Economy sectors like finance and publishing to New Economy sectors like digital photography and video games. He also devotes considerable attention to the rapidly changing media and entertainment industries which are now some of the most technologically advanced in the American economy. Beginning in 1950, when commercial applications of digital technology began to appear, Cortada examines the ways different industries adopted new technologies, as well as the ways their innovative applications influenced other industries and the US economy as a whole. He builds on the surveys presented in the first volume of the series, which examined sixteen manufacturing, process, transportation, wholesale and retail industries. In addition to this account, of computers' impact on industries, Cortada also demonstrates how industries themselves influenced the nature of digital technology. Managers, historians and others interested in the history of modern business will appreciate this historical analysis of digital technology's many roles and future possibilities in an wide array of industries. The Digital Hand provides a detailed picture of what the infrastructure of the Information Age really looks like and how we got there.",Computers,646,N/A,0,en

That enthusiastic response gets to the heart of how this remarkable textbook works. Quantitative Literacy shows students that they use math in their everyday lives more than they realize, and that learning math in real-world contexts not only makes it easier to get better grades, but prepares them for decisions they’ll face about money, voting and politics, health issues, and much more.

The History of Visual Magic in Computers,Jon Peddie,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-06-13,"If you have ever looked at a fantastic adventure or science fiction movie, or an amazingly complex and rich computer game, or a TV commercial where cars or gas pumps or biscuits behaved liked people and wondered, “How do they do that?”, then you’ve experienced the magic of 3D worlds generated by a computer. 3D in computers began as a way to represent automotive designs and illustrate the construction of molecules. 3D graphics use evolved to visualizations of simulated data and artistic representations of imaginary worlds. In order to overcome the processing limitations of the computer, graphics had to exploit the characteristics of the eye and brain, and develop visual tricks to simulate realism. The goal is to create graphics images that will overcome the visual cues that cause disbelief and tell the viewer this is not real. Thousands of people over thousands of years have developed the building blocks and made the discoveries in mathematics and science to make such 3D magic possible, and The History of Visual Magic in Computers is dedicated to all of them and tells a little of their story. It traces the earliest understanding of 3D and then foundational mathematics to explain and construct 3D; from mechanical computers up to today’s tablets. Several of the amazing computer graphics algorithms and tricks came of periods where eruptions of new ideas and techniques seem to occur all at once. Applications emerged as the fundamentals of how to draw lines and create realistic images were better understood, leading to hardware 3D controllers that drive the display all the way to stereovision and virtual reality.",Computers,485,N/A,0,en

The Pattern On The Stone,W. Daniel Hillis,Basic Books,2015-02-10,"Most people are baffled by how computers work and assume that they will never understand them. What they don't realize—and what Daniel Hillis's short book brilliantly demonstrates—is that computers' seemingly complex operations can be broken down into a few simple parts that perform the same simple procedures over and over again. Computer wizard Hillis offers an easy-to-follow explanation of how data is processed that makes the operations of a computer seem as straightforward as those of a bicycle.Avoiding technobabble or discussions of advanced hardware, the lucid explanations and colorful anecdotes in The Pattern on the Stone go straight to the heart of what computers really do. Hillis proceeds from an outline of basic logic to clear descriptions of programming languages, algorithms, and memory. He then takes readers in simple steps up to the most exciting developments in computing today—quantum computing, parallel computing, neural networks, and self-organizing systems.Written clearly and succinctly by one of the world's leading computer scientists, The Pattern on the Stone is an indispensable guide to understanding the workings of that most ubiquitous and important of machines: the computer.",Computers,0,N/A,0,en

The Computer's Voice,Liz W. Faber,U of Minnesota Press,2020-12-22,"A deconstruction of gender through the voices of Siri, HAL 9000, and other computers that talk Although computer-based personal assistants like Siri are increasingly ubiquitous, few users stop to ask what it means that some assistants are gendered female, others male. Why is Star Trek’s computer coded as female, while HAL 9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey is heard as male? By examining how gender is built into these devices, author Liz W. Faber explores contentious questions around gender: its fundamental constructedness, the rigidity of the gender binary, and culturally situated attitudes on male and female embodiment. Faber begins by considering talking spaceships like those in Star Trek, the film Dark Star, and the TV series Quark, revealing the ideologies that underlie space-age progress. She then moves on to an intrepid decade-by-decade investigation of computer voices, tracing the evolution from the masculine voices of the ’70s and ’80s to the feminine ones of the ’90s and ’00s. Faber ends her account in the present, with incisive looks at the film Her and Siri herself. Going beyond current scholarship on robots and AI to focus on voice-interactive computers, The Computer’s Voice breaks new ground in questions surrounding media, technology, and gender. It makes important contributions to conversations around the gender gap and the increasing acceptance of transgender people.",Performing Arts,246,N/A,0,en

Notework,Simon Reader,Stanford University Press,2021-06-22,"Notework begins with a striking insight: the writer's notebook is a genre in itself. Simon Reader pursues this argument in original readings of unpublished writing by prominent Victorians, offering an expansive approach to literary formalism for the twenty-first century. Neither drafts nor diaries, the notes of Charles Darwin, Oscar Wilde, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Vernon Lee, and George Gissing record ephemeral and nonlinear experiences, revealing each author's desire to leave their fragments scattered and unused. Presenting notes in terms of genre allows Reader to suggest inventive new accounts of key Victorian texts, including The Picture of Dorian Gray, On the Origin of Species, and Hopkins's devotional lyrics, and to reinterpret these works as meditations on the ethics of compiling and using data. In this way, Notework recasts information collection as a personal and expressive activity that comes into focus against large-scale systems of knowledge organization. Finding resonance between today's digital culture and its nineteenth-century precursors, Reader honors our most disposable, improvised, and fleeting written gestures.",Literary Criticism,289,N/A,0,en
Feminine Singularity,Ronjaunee Chatterjee,Stanford University Press,2022-08-09,"What happens if we read nineteenth-century and Victorian texts not for the autonomous liberal subject, but for singularity—for what is partial, contingent, and in relation, rather than what is merely ""alone""? Feminine Singularity offers a powerful feminist theory of the subject—and shows us paths to thinking subjectivity, race, and gender anew in literature and in our wider social world. Through fresh, sophisticated readings of Lewis Carroll, Christina Rossetti, Charles Baudelaire, and Wilkie Collins in conversation with psychoanalysis, Black feminist and queer-of-color theory, and continental philosophy, Ronjaunee Chatterjee uncovers a lexicon of feminine singularity that manifests across poetry and prose through likeness and minimal difference, rather than individuality and identity. Reading for singularity shows us the ways femininity is fundamentally entangled with racial difference in the nineteenth century and well into the contemporary, as well as how rigid categories can be unsettled and upended. Grappling with the ongoing violence embedded in the Western liberal imaginary, Feminine Singularity invites readers to commune with the subversive potentials in nineteenth-century literature for thinking subjectivity today.",Literary Criticism,243,N/A,0,en
The Novel and the New Ethics,Dorothy J. Hale,Stanford University Press,2020-11-24,"For a generation of contemporary Anglo-American novelists, the question ""Why write?"" has been answered with a renewed will to believe in the ethical value of literature. Dissatisfied with postmodernist parody and pastiche, a broad array of novelist-critics—including J.M. Coetzee, Toni Morrison, Zadie Smith, Gish Jen, Ian McEwan, and Jonathan Franzen—champion the novel as the literary genre most qualified to illuminate individual ethical action and decision-making within complex and diverse social worlds. Key to this contemporary vision of the novel's ethical power is the task of knowing and being responsible to people different from oneself, and so thoroughly have contemporary novelists devoted themselves to the ethics of otherness, that this ethics frequently sets the terms for plot, characterization, and theme. In The Novel and the New Ethics, literary critic Dorothy J. Hale investigates how the contemporary emphasis on literature's social relevance sparks a new ethical description of the novel's social value that is in fact rooted in the modernist notion of narrative form. This ""new"" ethics of the contemporary moment has its origin in the ""new"" idea of novelistic form that Henry James inaugurated and which was consolidated through the modernist narrative experiments and was developed over the course of the twentieth century. In Hale's reading, the art of the novel becomes defined with increasing explicitness as an aesthetics of alterity made visible as a formalist ethics. In fact, it is this commitment to otherness as a narrative act which has conferred on the genre an artistic intensity and richness that extends to the novel's every word.",Literary Criticism,466,N/A,0,en

Rapid technological change in communications, computing, and information management continue to promise further gains in productivity, a phenomenon often referred to as the New Economy. To better understand this phenomenon, the National Academies Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy (STEP) has convened a series of workshops and commissioned papers on Measuring and Sustaining the New Economy. This major workshop, entitled Deconstructing the Computer, brought together leading industrialists and academic researchers to explore the contribution of the different components of computers to improved price-performance and quality of information systems. The objective was to help understand the sources of the remarkable growth of American productivity in the 1990s, the relative contributions of computers and their underlying components, and the evolution and future contributions of the technologies supporting this positive economic performance.",Political Science,182,N/A,0,en

Before the Computer,James W. Cortada,Princeton University Press,2015-03-08,"Before the Computer fully explores the data processing industry in the United States from its nineteenth-century inception down to the period when the computer became its primary tool. As James Cortada describes what was once called the ""office appliance industry,"" he challenges our view of the digital computer as a revolutionary technology. Cortada interprets reliance on computers as a development within an important segment of the American economy that was earlier represented largely by such instruments as typewriters, tabulating machines, adding machines, and calculators. He also describes how many of the practices of the office appliance industry evolved into those of the computer world. Drawing on previously unavailable industry archives, the author adds to our understanding of IBM's early history and offers short corporate histories of firms that include NCR, Burroughs, and Remington Rand. Focusing on the United States but also including comparative material on Europe and Asia, Before the Computer will be a unique source of knowledge about the companies that built office equipment and their enormous impact on economic life.

Software,Kim W. Tracy,Morgan & Claypool,2021-09-20,"Software history has a deep impact on current software designers, computer scientists, and technologists. System constraints imposed in the past and the designs that responded to them are often unknown or poorly understood by students and practitioners, yet modern software systems often include “old” software and “historical” programming techniques. This work looks at software history through specific software areas to develop student-consumable practices, design principles, lessons learned, and trends useful in current and future software design. It also exposes key areas that are widely used in modern software, yet infrequently taught in computing programs. Written as a textbook, this book uses specific cases from the past and present to explore the impact of software trends and techniques. Building on concepts from the history of science and technology, software history examines such areas as fundamentals, operating systems, programming languages, programming environments, networking, and databases. These topics are covered from their earliest beginnings to their modern variants. There are focused case studies on UNIX, APL, SAGE, GNU Emacs, Autoflow, internet protocols, System R, and others. Extensive problems and suggested projects enable readers to deeply delve into the history of software in areas that interest them most.",Computers,358,N/A,0,en

My Remarkable Journey,"Katherine Johnson, Joylette Hylick, Katherine Moore",HarperCollins,2021-05-25,"The remarkable woman at heart of the smash New York Times bestseller and Oscar-winning film Hidden Figures tells the full story of her life, including what it took to work at NASA, help land the first man on the moon, and live through a century of turmoil and change. In 2015, at the age of 97, Katherine Johnson became a global celebrity. President Barack Obama awarded her the prestigious Presidential Medal of Freedom—the nation’s highest civilian honor—for her pioneering work as a mathematician on NASA’s first flights into space. Her contributions to America’s space program were celebrated in a blockbuster and Academy-award nominated movie. In this memoir, Katherine shares her personal journey from child prodigy in the Allegheny Mountains of West Virginia to NASA human computer. In her life after retirement, she served as a beacon of light for her family and community alike. Her story is centered around the basic tenets of her life—no one is better than you, education is paramount, and asking questions can break barriers. The memoir captures the many facets of this unique woman: the curious “daddy’s girl,” pioneering professional, and sage elder. This multidimensional portrait is also the record of a century of racial history that reveals the influential role educators at segregated schools and Historically Black Colleges and Universities played in nurturing the dreams of trailblazers like Katherine. The author pays homage to her mentor—the African American professor who inspired her to become a research mathematician despite having his own dream crushed by racism. Infused with the uplifting wisdom of a woman who handled great fame with genuine humility and great tragedy with enduring hope, My Remarkable Journey ultimately brings into focus a determined woman who navigated tough racial terrain with soft-spoken grace—and the unrelenting grit required to make history and inspire future generations.",Biography & Autobiography,255,N/A,0,en
Computers & Composing,"Jeanne W.

FUNDAMENTALS OF COMPUTERS,"V. RAJARAMAN, NEEHARIKA ADABALA",PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.,2014-12-15,"The sixth edition of the highly acclaimed “Fundamentals of Computers” lucidly presents how a computer system functions. Both hardware and software aspects of computers are covered. The book begins with how numeric and character data are represented in a computer, how various input and output units function, how different types of memory units are organized, and how data is processed by the processor. The interconnection and communication between the I/O units, the memory, and the processor is explained clearly and concisely. Software concepts such as programming languages, operating systems, and communication protocols are discussed. With growing use of wireless to access computer networks, cellular wireless communication systems, WiFi (Wireless high fidelity), and WiMAX have become important. Thus it has now become part of “fundamental knowledge” of computers and has been included. Besides this, use of computers in multimedia processing has become commonplace and hence is discussed. With the increase in speed of networks and consequently the Internet, new computing environments such as peer to peer, grid, and cloud computing have emerged and will change the future of computing. Hence a new chapter on this topic has been included in this edition. This book is an ideal text for undergraduate and postgraduate students of Computer Applications (BCA and MCA), undergraduate students of engineering and computer science who study fundamentals of computers as a core course, and students of management who should all know the basics of computer hardware and software. It is ideally suited for working professionals who want to update their knowledge of fundamentals of computers.

From Gutenberg to the Internet,Jeremy M. Norman,Norman Publishing,2005,"From Gutenberg to the Internet presents 63 original readings from the history of computing, networking, and telecommunications arranged thematically by chapters. Most of the readings record basic discoveries from the 1830s through the 1960s that laid the foundation of the world of digital information in which we live. These readings, some of which are illustrated, trace historic steps from the early nineteenth century development of telegraph systems---the first data networks---through the development of the earliest general-purpose programmable computers and the earliest software, to the foundation in 1969 of ARPANET, the first national computer network that eventually became the Internet. The readings will allow you to review early developments and ideas in the history of information technology that eventually led to the convergence of computing, data networking, and telecommunications in the Internet. The editor has written a lengthy illustrated historical introduction concerning the impact of the Internet on book culture. It compares and contrasts the transition from manuscript to print initiated by Gutenberg's invention of printing by moveable type in the 15th century with the transition that began in the mid-19th century from a print-centric world to the present world in which printing co-exists with various electronic media that converged to form the Internet.

Making Middle Schools Work,"Jon Wiles, Joseph Bondi",N/A,1986,"Over the past 20 years, the middle school has been a major innovative movement changing the face of intermediate education. While hard to define exactly, middle schools have different priorities and purposes than junior high schools. The former serve preadolescents (ages 10 to 14) through a balanced, comprehensive program. Middle school programs need clear definition and constant reevaluation to monitor program effectiveness and prevent slippage. Success depends heavily on sound curriculum development and management. This report describes the Wiles-Bondi Curriculum Management Plan (CMP), which draws from the work of Tyler and Taba and the widely used accreditation process format. The CMP introduces regularity into the change process by superimposing a management schemata over the curriculum development framework and forcing values clarification and commitment along the way. Establishing goals, assessing needs, and determining priorities are essential steps. The model is based on several key points: involving school staff, administrators, and parents; directing change from the top; basing decisions on hard data; and driving change by evaluation and accountability. Developing an effective management team is a must. The standard curriculum development cycle of analysis, design implementation, and evaluation is bolstered by the CMP routine. Procedures are amply illustrated by 33 figures and 4 appendices that include sample survey forms, two articles on adolescents, and a list of selected teacher competencies.

X-Risk,Thomas Moynihan,MIT Press,2020-11-03,"How humanity came to contemplate its possible extinction. From forecasts of disastrous climate change to prophecies of evil AI superintelligences and the impending perils of genome editing, our species is increasingly concerned with the prospects of its own extinction. With humanity's future on this planet seeming more insecure by the day, in the twenty-first century, existential risk has become the object of a growing field of serious scientific inquiry. But, as Thomas Moynihan shows in X-Risk, this preoccupation is not exclusive to the post-atomic age of global warming and synthetic biology. Our growing concern with human extinction itself has a history. Tracing this untold story, Moynihan revisits the pioneers who first contemplated the possibility of human extinction and stages the historical drama of this momentous discovery. He shows how, far from being a secular reprise of religious prophecies of apocalypse, existential risk is a thoroughly modern idea, made possible by the burgeoning sciences and philosophical tumult of the Enlightenment era. In recollecting how we first came to care for our extinction, Moynihan reveals how today's attempts to measure and mitigate existential threats are the continuation of a project initiated over two centuries ago, which concerns the very vocation of the human as a rational, responsible, and future-oriented being.",Social Science,481,N/A,0,en

William Strauss and Neil Howe posit the history of America as a succession of generational biographies, beginning in 1584 and encompassing every-one through the children of today. Their bold theory is that each generation belongs to one of four types, and that these types repeat sequentially in a fixed pattern. The vision of Generations allows us to plot a recurring cycle in American history -- a cycle of spiritual awakenings and secular crises -- from the founding colonists through the present day and well into this millenium. Generations is at once a refreshing historical narrative and a thrilling intuitive leap that reorders not only our history books but also our expectations for the twenty-first century.",History,548,5,2,en

The Second Age of Computer Science,Subrata Dasgupta,Oxford University Press,2018-05-01,"By the end of the 1960s, a new discipline named computer science had come into being. A new scientific paradigm--the 'computational paradigm'--was in place, suggesting that computer science had reached a certain level of maturity. Yet as a science it was still precociously young. New forces, some technological, some socio-economic, some cognitive impinged upon it, the outcome of which was that new kinds of computational problems arose over the next two decades. Indeed, by the beginning of the 1990's the structure of the computational paradigm looked markedly different in many important respects from how it was at the end of the 1960s. Author Subrata Dasgupta named the two decades from 1970 to 1990 as the second age of computer science to distinguish it from the preceding genesis of the science and the age of the Internet/World Wide Web that followed. This book describes the evolution of computer science in this second age in the form of seven overlapping, intermingling, parallel histories that unfold concurrently in the course of the two decades. Certain themes characteristic of this second age thread through this narrative: the desire for a genuine science of computing; the realization that computing is as much a human experience as it is a technological one; the search for a unified theory of intelligence spanning machines and mind; the desire to liberate the computational mind from the shackles of sequentiality; and, most ambitiously, a quest to subvert the very core of the computational paradigm itself. We see how the computer scientists of the second age address these desires and challenges, in what manner they succeed or fail and how, along the way, the shape of computational paradigm was altered. And to complete this history, the author asks and seeks to answer the question of how computer science shows evidence of progress over the course of its second age.",Computers,361,N/A,0,en

The Antikythera Mechanism,Evaggelos G. Vallianatos,Universal-Publishers,2021-10-01,"In Antikythera Mechanism: The Story Behind the Genius of the Greek Computer and Its Demise, Evaggelos Vallianatos, historian and ecopolitical theorist, shows that after the conquest of Persia by Alexander the Great in the late fourth century BCE, the Greeks, especially in Egypt, reached unprecedented heights of achievements in science, technology, and civilization. The Antikythera Mechanism, an astronomical computer probably crafted in Rhodes in the second century BCE, was proof of that prowess. It’s the grandfather of our computers. Greek sponge divers discovered the Antikythera Mechanism in 1900 on a 2,100-year-old Roman-era shipwreck. The hand-powered device reveals a sophisticated Greek technology previously unknown to scholars and historians, not seen and understood again until the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The book not only describes how the sophisticated political and technological infrastructure of the Greeks after Alexander the Great resulted in the Antikythera celestial computer, and the bedrock of science and technology we know today, but also how the influence of Christianity on Greek civilization destroyed the nascent computer age of ancient Greece. Vallianatos, born in Greece and educated in America, is a historian, author, and journalist. He is a passionate champion of Greek culture and a well-suited guide to this historical account. Vallianatos explains how and why Greek scientists employed advanced engineering in translating the beautiful conception of the Antikythera Mechanism into an astronomical computer of genius: a bronze-geared device of mathematical astronomy, predicting the eclipses of the Sun and the Moon; calculating the risings and settings of important stars and constellations, and the movements of the planets around the Sun; while mechanizing the predictions of scientific theories. The computer’s accurate calendar connected these cosmic phenomena to the Olympics and other major Panhellenic religious and athletic celebrations, bringing the Greeks closer to their gods, traditions, and the Cosmos.",History,342,N/A,0,en

Storage Systems,Alexander Thomasian,Academic Press,2021-10-13,"Storage Systems: Organization, Performance, Coding, Reliability and Their Data Processing was motivated by the 1988 Redundant Array of Inexpensive/Independent Disks proposal to replace large form factor mainframe disks with an array of commodity disks. Disk loads are balanced by striping data into strips—with one strip per disk— and storage reliability is enhanced via replication or erasure coding, which at best dedicates k strips per stripe to tolerate k disk failures. Flash memories have resulted in a paradigm shift with Solid State Drives (SSDs) replacing Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) for high performance applications. RAID and Flash have resulted in the emergence of new storage companies, namely EMC, NetApp, SanDisk, and Purestorage, and a multibillion-dollar storage market. Key new conferences and publications are reviewed in this book.The goal of the book is to expose students, researchers, and IT professionals to the more important developments in storage systems, while covering the evolution of storage technologies, traditional and novel databases, and novel sources of data. We describe several prototypes: FAWN at CMU, RAMCloud at Stanford, and Lightstore at MIT; Oracle's Exadata, AWS' Aurora, Alibaba's PolarDB, Fungible Data Center; and author's paper designs for cloud storage, namely heterogeneous disk arrays and hierarchical RAID. - Surveys storage technologies and lists sources of data: measurements, text, audio, images, and video - Familiarizes with paradigms to improve performance: caching, prefetching, log-structured file systems, and merge-trees (LSMs) - Describes RAID organizations and analyzes their performance and reliability - Conserves storage via data compression, deduplication, compaction, and secures data via encryption - Specifies implications of storage technologies on performance and power consumption - Exemplifies database parallelism for big data, analytics, deep learning via multicore CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs, e.g., Google's Tensor Processing Units",Science,748,N/A,0,en

Computer Graphics from Scratch,Gabriel Gambetta,No Starch Press,2021-05-13,"Computer Graphics from Scratch demystifies the algorithms used in modern graphics software and guides beginners through building photorealistic 3D renders. Computer graphics programming books are often math-heavy and intimidating for newcomers. Not this one. Computer Graphics from Scratch takes a simpler approach by keeping the math to a minimum and focusing on only one aspect of computer graphics, 3D rendering. You’ll build two complete, fully functional renderers: a raytracer, which simulates rays of light as they bounce off objects, and a rasterizer, which converts 3D models into 2D pixels. As you progress you’ll learn how to create realistic reflections and shadows, and how to render a scene from any point of view. Pseudocode examples throughout make it easy to write your renderers in any language, and links to live JavaScript demos of each algorithm invite you to explore further on your own. Learn how to: Use perspective projection to draw 3D objects on a 2D plane Simulate the way rays of light interact with surfaces Add mirror-like reflections and cast shadows to objects Render a scene from any camera position using clipping planes Use flat, Gouraud, and Phong shading to mimic real surface lighting Paint texture details onto basic shapes to create realistic-looking objects Whether you’re an aspiring graphics engineer or a novice programmer curious about how graphics algorithms work, Gabriel Gambetta’s simple, clear explanations will quickly put computer graphics concepts and rendering techniques within your reach. All you need is basic coding knowledge and high school math. Computer Graphics from Scratch will cover the rest.",Computers,250,N/A,0,en

Workloads have changed. Many applications, including mission-critical ones, are deployed on a variety of platforms, and the System z® design has adapted to this change. It takes into account a wide range of factors, including compatibility and investment protection, to match the IT requirements of an enterprise. This IBM® Redbooks® publication discusses the IBM zEnterprise System, an IBM scalable mainframe server. IBM is taking a revolutionary approach by integrating separate platforms under the well-proven System z hardware management capabilities, while extending System z qualities of service to those platforms. The zEnterprise System consists of the IBM zEnterprise 114 central processor complex, the IBM zEnterprise Unified Resource Manager, and the IBM zEnterprise BladeCenter® Extension. The z114 is designed with improved scalability, performance, security, resiliency, availability, and virtualization. The z114 provides up to 18% improvement in uniprocessor speed and up to a 12% increase in total system capacity for z/OS®, z/VM®, and Linux on System z over the z10TM Business Class (BC). The zBX infrastructure works with the z114 to enhance System z virtualization and management through an integrated hardware platform that spans mainframe, POWER7TM, and System x technologies. The federated capacity from multiple architectures of the zEnterprise System is managed as a single pool of resources, integrating system and workload management across the environment through the Unified Resource Manager. This book provides an overview of the zEnterprise System and its functions, features, and associated software support. Greater detail is offered in areas relevant to technical planning. This book is intended for systems engineers, consultants, planners, and anyone wanting to understand the zEnterprise System functions and plan for their usage. It is not intended as an introduction to mainframes. Readers are expected to be generally familiar with existing IBM System z technology and terminology.",Computers,416,N/A,0,en

"Gen Z, Explained","Roberta Katz, Sarah Ogilvie, Jane Shaw, Linda Woodhead",University of Chicago Press,2022-10-26,"An optimistic and nuanced portrait of a generation that has much to teach us about how to live and collaborate in our digital world. Born since the mid-1990s, members of Generation Z comprise the first generation never to know the world without the internet, and the most diverse generation yet. As Gen Z starts to emerge into adulthood and enter the workforce, what do we really know about them? And what can we learn from them? Gen Z, Explained is the authoritative portrait of this significant generation. It draws on extensive interviews that display this generation’s candor, surveys that explore their views and attitudes, and a vast database of their astonishingly inventive lexicon to build a comprehensive picture of their values, daily lives, and outlook. Gen Z emerges here as an extraordinarily thoughtful, promising, and perceptive generation that is sounding a warning to their elders about the world around them—a warning of a complexity and depth the “OK Boomer” phenomenon can only suggest. ​ Much of the existing literature about Gen Z has been highly judgmental. In contrast, this book provides a deep and nuanced understanding of a generation facing a future of enormous challenges, from climate change to civil unrest. What’s more, they are facing this future head-on, relying on themselves and their peers to work collaboratively to solve these problems. As Gen Z, Explained shows, this group of young people is as compassionate and imaginative as any that has come before, and understanding the way they tackle problems may enable us to envision new kinds of solutions. This portrait of Gen Z is ultimately an optimistic one, suggesting they have something to teach all of us about how to live and thrive in this digital world.",History,275,N/A,0,en

Market Prophets,"Eddie Z, Russ Hazelcorn",CreateSpace,2013-11-02,"Market Prophets: Eddie Z's Interviews with Wall Street Legends, Gurus, All Stars, and Hall of Famers is a priceless collection of stories, anecdotes, experiences, and trading insights from some of the most successful traders in the last 50 years. Some of these traders you may have heard of and others will be totally new to you. Either way, this collection of experience and know-how, represents a combined lifetime earnings over $100 million dollars and over 100 years of full time engagement with the markets. As a veteran or new trader, you may be asking yourself: “Why is it important to hear the stories of experienced, successful traders?” There are several good reasons:The first reason is to get an idea of the learning curve involved in becoming a successful trader. Like any other skill, trading requires hours of practice, learning, and hands-on experience—especially learning from mistakes. These interviews are the best way to find out the biggest mistakes that even successful traders have made on their way to becoming consistently profitable. Second, experienced, veteran traders have the ability to give you insights and distinctions that you otherwise may not get anywhere else. Guys who have been in the trading trenches have the ability to see market events and phenomena well before the average person does. This high level of experience and training can be compared to the 20 year Navy Seal. In other words, these guys have the absolute highest level of training and years and years of successful combat missions. Think of it this way, if you were learning to play basketball, wouldn't you want Michael Jordan to be your personal coach? Wouldn't it be great to sit down with Kareem or Magic and hear about what worked for them and what didn't? The third reason to learn about successful traders is to give you historical perspective of Wall Street over the last 50 years so you can see exactly what has changed and what has stayed the same. This way you can get an idea of where the art and skill of trading has come from and where it's headed in the future. The goal of this book is to give you insights and experiences from some of the world's very best traders. Let these interviews serve as your personal virtual coach. I am certain that what you read will not only entertain you but also actually leapfrog you up your own learning curve. I sincerely hope you enjoy reading this book as much as I enjoyed interviewing these traders.",Business & Economics,208,N/A,0,en

Topological Quantum Computation,Zhenghan Wang,American Mathematical Soc.,2010,"Topological quantum computation is a computational paradigm based on topological phases of matter, which are governed by topological quantum field theories. In this approach, information is stored in the lowest energy states of many-anyon systems and processed by braiding non-abelian anyons. The computational answer is accessed by bringing anyons together and observing the result. Besides its theoretical esthetic appeal, the practical merit of the topological approach lies in its error-minimizing hypothetical hardware: topological phases of matter are fault-avoiding or deaf to most local noises, and unitary gates are implemented with exponential accuracy. Experimental realizations are pursued in systems such as fractional quantum Hall liquids and topological insulators. This book expands on the author's CBMS lectures on knots and topological quantum computing and is intended as a primer for mathematically inclined graduate students. With an emphasis on introducing basic notions and current research, this book gives the first coherent account of the field, covering a wide range of topics: Temperley-Lieb-Jones theory, the quantum circuit model, ribbon fusion category theory, topological quantum field theory, anyon theory, additive approximation of the Jones polynomial, anyonic quantum computing models, and mathematical models of topological phases of matter.",Computers,134,N/A,0,en

Fight,John Della Volpe,St. Martin's Press,2022-01-18,"From John Della Volpe, the director of polling at the Harvard Institute of Politics, Fight is an exploration of Gen Z, the issues that matter most to them, and how they will shape the future. 9/11. The war on terror. Hurricane Katrina. The 2008 financial crisis. The housing crisis. The opioid epidemic. Mass school shootings. Global warming. The Trump presidency. COVID-19. Since they were born, Generation Z (also known as ""zoomers"")—those born from the late 1990s to early 2000s—have been faced with an onslaught of turmoil, destruction and instability unprecedented in modern history. And it shows: they are more stressed, anxious, and depressed than previous generations, a phenomenon John Della Volpe has documented heavily through decades of meeting with groups of young Americans across the country. But Gen Z has not buckled under this tremendous weight. On the contrary, they have organized around issues from gun control to racial and environmental justice to economic equity, becoming more politically engaged than their elders, and showing a unique willingness to disrupt the status quo. In Fight: How Gen Z Is Channeling Their Passion and Fear to Save America, Della Volpe draws on his vast experience to show the largest forces shaping zoomers' lives, the issues they care most about, and how they are—despite older Americans' efforts to label Gen Z as overly sensitive, lazy, and entitled—rising to the unprecedented challenges of their time to take control of their country and our future.",Political Science,146,N/A,0,en

Introduction to the New Mainframe,"Mike Ebbers, Wayne O'Brien, Bill Ogden",IBM.Com/Redbooks,2006,"This IBM Redbook provides students of information systems technology with the background knowledge and skills necessary to begin using the basic facilities of a mainframe computer. It is the first in a planned series of textbooks designed to introduce students to mainframe concepts and help prepare them for a career in large systems computing. For optimal learning, students are assumed to have successfully completed an introductory course in computer system concepts, such as computer organization and architecture, operating systems, data management, or data communications. They should also have successfully completed courses in one or more programming languages, and be PC literate. This textbook can also be used as a prerequisite for courses in advanced topics or for internships and special studies. It is not intended to be a complete text covering all aspects of mainframe operation, nor is it a reference book that discusses every feature and option of the mainframe facilities. Others who will benefit from this course include experienced data processing professionals who have worked with non-mainframe platforms, or who are familiar with some aspects of the mainframe but want to become knowledgeable with other facilities and benefits of the mainframe environment. As we go through this course, we suggest that the instructor alternate between text, lecture, discussions, and hands-on exercises. Many of the exercises are cumulative, and are designed to show the student how to design and implement the topic presented. The instructor-led discussions and hands-on exercises are an integral part of the course material, and can include topics not covered in this textbook. This book is also offered with a textbook cover instead of a redbook cover in PDF and hardcopy formats.

How Highly Effective People Speak,Peter Andrei,Independently Published,2020-05-29,"Why do we think what we think? Think we know what we think we know? Believe what we believe? Like what we like? Do what we do? Why do others trust or distrust us? Respect or disrespect us? Listen to or ignore us? Reach out to or neglect us? Like or dislike us? Praise or slander us? Believe or doubt us? That's not all... Why do others follow our lead or stand in our way? Give us opportunities or send them elsewhere? Support our striving for success and appreciate our message or toss it - and us - aside? Decades of cutting-edge (but unheard-of) scientific research presents an answer... Because hidden, little-known secrets of psychology influence everything about us... Neglecting them is swimming upstream. You can't change minds, win allies, or influence people. You can't earn undivided attention or the respect you deserve. You undermine your professional image, stagnate your career, and destroy your confidence until communication makes you anxious. You don't deserve this... And how do I know all this? Because I've been there: I remember wondering... ""Why do my ideas never catch on? Why do I face so much professional rejection, stagnating my career? Why can't I influence anyone?"" But everything changed when I answered one question... What are the communication habits of highly effective people? It comes down to one secret: Highly effective people speak how the human mind evolved to interpret information. The result? They easily persuade and instantly influence. They turn communication from an obstacle into an opportunity. They enrich their careers, get more done, and advance with stunning speed. They impact and inspire others, rising to positions of leadership. They change their field, excel with ease, and shape the world. They attract others, feel confident, and smash goal after goal. Who are they? Presidents and CEOs; top-performers and respected professionals; leaders and visionaries. And here's my question to you: Will you be one of them? In How Highly Effective People Speak, you'll discover 194 communication habits of highly effective people (proven by 57 scientific studies) including: How to get more done with less effort by influencing others to support you How to attract others (instead of turning them away and seeming unfriendly) with the correct type of body language How to make people systematically, predictably, and reliably overweigh your opinion by activating the availability bias How to charge more or pay less (for the same product) and win every negotiation with the anchoring effect How to effortlessly make others want something by activating one little-known cognitive bias (called ""essential"" by billionaire investor Charlie Munger, partner to Warren Buffet) How to lead with ease and reliably influence teams by using the contrast effect How to effortlessly speak with memorable eloquence by applying 2,000-year-old secrets of powerful language How to ace every interview, meeting, and presentation with ease by activating agent detection bias How to quickly diffuse all objections by activating the little-known (but extremely powerful) zero-risk bias How to make people believe something even if they think the exact opposite with the illusory truth effect How to appear authoritative, trustworthy, and capable in 10 seconds by activating the halo effect How to combine the science of psychology with the art of communication and create a critical competitive advantage in life",,246,N/A,0,en

The Bitcoin Standard,Saifedean Ammous,John Wiley & Sons,2018-03-23,"A comprehensive and authoritative exploration of Bitcoin and its place in monetary history When a pseudonymous programmer introduced ""a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party"" to a small online mailing list in 2008, very few people paid attention. Ten years later, and against all odds, this upstart autonomous decentralized software offers an unstoppable and globally accessible hard money alternative to modern central banks. The Bitcoin Standard analyzes the historical context to the rise of Bitcoin, the economic properties that have allowed it to grow quickly, and its likely economic, political, and social implications. While Bitcoin is an invention of the digital age, the problem it purports to solve is as old as human society itself: transferring value across time and space. Author Saifedean Ammous takes the reader on an engaging journey through the history of technologies performing the functions of money, from primitive systems of trading limestones and seashells, to metals, coins, the gold standard, and modern government debt. Exploring what gave these technologies their monetary role, and how most lost it, provides the reader with a good idea of what makes for sound money, and sets the stage for an economic discussion of its consequences for individual and societal future-orientation, capital accumulation, trade, peace, culture, and art. Compellingly, Ammous shows that it is no coincidence that the loftiest achievements of humanity have come in societies enjoying the benefits of sound monetary regimes, nor is it coincidental that monetary collapse has usually accompanied civilizational collapse. With this background in place, the book moves on to explain the operation of Bitcoin in a functional and intuitive way. Bitcoin is a decentralized, distributed piece of software that converts electricity and processing power into indisputably accurate records, thus allowing its users to utilize the Internet to perform the traditional functions of money without having to rely on, or trust, any authorities or infrastructure in the physical world. Bitcoin is thus best understood as the first successfully implemented form of digital cash and digital hard money. With an automated and perfectly predictable monetary policy, and the ability to perform final settlement of large sums across the world in a matter of minutes, Bitcoin’s real competitive edge might just be as a store of value and network for the final settlement of large payments a digital form of gold with a built-in settlement infrastructure. Ammous’ firm grasp of the technological possibilities as well as the historical realities of monetary evolution provides for a fascinating exploration of the ramifications of voluntary free market money. As it challenges the most sacred of government monopolies, Bitcoin shifts the pendulum of sovereignty away from governments in favor of individuals, offering us the tantalizing possibility of a world where money is fully extricated from politics and unrestrained by borders. The final chapter of the book explores some of the most common questions surrounding Bitcoin: Is Bitcoin mining a waste of energy? Is Bitcoin for criminals? Who controls Bitcoin, and can they change it if they please? How can Bitcoin be killed? And what to make of all the thousands of Bitcoin knockoffs, and the many supposed applications of Bitcoin's 'block chain technology'? The Bitcoin Standard is the essential resource for a clear understanding of the rise of the Internet’s decentralized, apolitical, free-market alternative to national central banks.",Business & Economics,311,5,2,en

What is new in this book are the authors’ innovative methods for taking distributed environments running mainframe virtual machine (VM) and multiple virtual storage (MVS) and making them look and feel like other MVS systems. The authors’ combined expertise involves every aspect of the implementation of IBM zPDT technology to create virtualized mainframe environments by which the mainframe operations on a z series server can be transitioned to distributed platforms. All of the enhancement methods consecutively laid out in this book have been architected and developed by the authors for the CA Technologies distributed platform. Barrett and Norris impart these techniques and processes to CIOs and CTOs across the mainframe and distributed fields, to zPDT and RDz UT implementers, and to IBM’s independent software vendors and customers.",Computers,276,N/A,0,en

Object Orientation in Z,"Susan Stepney, Rosalind Barden, David Cooper",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-06-29,"This collection of papers draws together a variety of approaches for adding ob ject orientation to the Z formal specification language. These papers are not a conference proceedings, but have a slightly more complicated his tory. This work has grown and evolved from some work originally done in the ZIP project, under the United Kingdom's Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) IED initiative. ZIP is a three year project which aims to make the use of the Z specification language more widespread. It hopes to achieve this by producing a standard for Zj developing a method for Zj building tool support for Zj and carrying out research into refinement, proof and concurrency in Z. The ZIP methods work includes performing a survey of current Z practitioners (reported in [Barden et al. 1992])j investigating current styles and methods of Z usagej and developing a Z Method handbook (available early in 1993). As part of this work, we carried out a comparative study of the ways in which object orientation has been combined with Z. A summary of that work has been published as [Stepney et al. 1992].",Computers,147,N/A,0,en
You Look Like a Thing and I Love You,Janelle Shane,Voracious,2019-11-05,"As heard on NPR's ""Science Friday,"" discover the book recommended by Malcolm Gladwell, Susan Cain, Daniel Pink, and Adam Grant: an ""accessible, informative, and hilarious"" introduction to the weird and wonderful world of artificial intelligence (Ryan North). ""You look like a thing and I love you"" is one of the best pickup lines ever . . . according to an artificial intelligence trained by scientist Janelle Shane, creator of the popular blog AI Weirdness. She creates silly AIs that learn how to name paint colors, create the best recipes, and even flirt (badly) with humans—all to understand the technology that governs so much of our daily lives. We rely on AI every day for recommendations, for translations, and to put cat ears on our selfie videos. We also trust AI with matters of life and death, on the road and in our hospitals. But how smart is AI really... and how does it solve problems, understand humans, and even drive self-driving cars? Shane delivers the answers to every AI question you've ever asked, and some you definitely haven't. Like, how can a computer design the perfect sandwich? What does robot-generated Harry Potter fan-fiction look like? And is the world's best Halloween costume really ""Vampire Hog Bride""? In this smart, often hilarious introduction to the most interesting science of our time, Shane shows how these programs learn, fail, and adapt—and how they reflect the best and worst of humanity. You Look Like a Thing and I Love You is the perfect book for anyone curious about what the robots in our lives are thinking.

It is a love story, but not one you have read before. ""Delightful and absorbing."" —The New York Times • ""Utterly brilliant."" —John Green One of the Best Books of the Year: The New York Times, Entertainment Weekly, TIME, GoodReads, Oprah Daily From the best-selling author of The Storied Life of A. J. Fikry: On a bitter-cold day, in the December of his junior year at Harvard, Sam Masur exits a subway car and sees, amid the hordes of people waiting on the platform, Sadie Green. He calls her name. For a moment, she pretends she hasn’t heard him, but then, she turns, and a game begins: a legendary collaboration that will launch them to stardom. These friends, intimates since childhood, borrow money, beg favors, and, before even graduating college, they have created their first blockbuster, Ichigo. Overnight, the world is theirs. Not even twenty-five years old, Sam and Sadie are brilliant, successful, and rich, but these qualities won’t protect them from their own creative ambitions or the betrayals of their hearts. Spanning thirty years, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Venice Beach, California, and lands in between and far beyond, Gabrielle Zevin’s Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow examines the multifarious nature of identity, disability, failure, the redemptive possibilities in play, and above all, our need to connect: to be loved and to love.",Fiction,452,5,2,en
