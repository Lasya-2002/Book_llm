Uninvited,Lysa TerKeurst,Thomas Nelson,2016-08-09,"Do you ever feel left out, lonely, or less than? Today, learn the secret of belonging which will help you keep rejections in perspective and be better equipped to foster healthy connections in your relationships. In Uninvited, Lysa shares her own deeply personal experiences of rejection from the perceived judgment of the perfectly toned woman one elliptical over to the incredibly painful childhood abandonment by her father. She leans in to honestly examine the roots of rejection, as well as rejection's ability to poison relationships from the inside out, including our relationship with God. With biblical depth, gut honest vulnerability, and refreshing wit, Lysa will help you: Stop feeling left out by believing that even when you are overlooked by others you are handpicked by God. Change your tendency to either fall apart or control the actions of others by embracing God-honoring ways to process your hurt. Know exactly what to pray for the next ten days to steady your soul and restore your confidence in the midst of rejection. Overcome the two core fears that feed your insecurities by understanding the secret of belonging. Uninvited reminds us we are destined for a love that can never be diminished, tarnished, shaken, or taken—a love that does not reject or uninvite.",Religion,289,4,2,en

The Master Plan,"Chris Wilson, Bret Witter",Penguin,2020-02-04,"""The Master Plan is less of a road map and more of a philosophy that we should all take to heart: We are all better than our worst decision, our sense of justice should honor the redemptive possibilities inherent in every person, and our destinies are truly intertwined.""--Wes Moore, author of The Other Wes Moore Growing up in Washington, DC, Chris Wilson was surrounded by violence and despair. He watched his family and neighborhood shattered by trauma, and he lost his faith. One night when he was seventeen, defending himself, he killed a man. He was sentenced to life in prison with no hope of parole. But what should have been the end of his story became the beginning. Behind bars, Wilson embarked on a remarkable journey of self-improvement--reading, working out, learning languages, even starting a business. At nineteen, he sat down and wrote a list of all the things he intended to accomplish, and all the steps he'd have to take to get there. He called it his Master Plan. He revised that plan regularly and followed it religiously. Sixteen years later, it led him to an unlikely opportunity--and to a promise he has been working hard to live up to every day since. Harrowing, heartbreaking, and ultimately triumphant, The Master Plan is a memoir for this moment, proving that every person is capable of doing great things.",Biography & Autobiography,434,N/A,0,en
Anonymous,Alicia Britt Chole,Thomas Nelson,2011-09-05,"In Anonymous, learn to recognize the riches in the uncelebrated seasons of your life. When your potential is unseen and your abilities are unappreciated, use those times as opportunities to develop an unshakable identity and to find rest in God's timing—just as Jesus did. Unsettling spaces are actually the surprising birthplace of true spiritual strength. Most of Jesus’ first thirty years went unnoticed by the world, but that season of quiet anonymity prepared Him for true greatness...and made Him unshakable when His time had come. Using Jesus' hidden years as inspiration, Alicia Chole memorably demonstrates how to: Resist resentment when your accomplishments go unnoticed Repurpose your own hidden years and experience deep growth Resolutely live out God's dreams for you with integrity and confidence We all experience times of hiddenness, when our potential is unseen and our abilities remain uncelebrated.

(You'll need your own copies of those real ACT practice tests, which you can find in the Official ACT Prep Guide, 2018, by ACT, Inc.) The Black Book is a clear, concise roadmap to the ACT. (See the selected highlights below). It explains exactly how every ACT question works, and how to beat it in the least time possible. Selected Highlights from the ACT Prep Black Book: The important differences between the ACT and a normal high school test, and how they influence every aspect of the proper approach to ACT preparation... Why every ACT question can only have one valid answer, no matter how much it might seem otherwise sometimes... How to look at ACT questions the same way ACT, Inc. does when it writes them... Why it's so important to work with real test questions from ACT, Inc....and why you shouldn't pay much attention to the official written explanations for those questions... What you're actually supposed to do when the ACT asks you about an author's attitude... The important implications of viewing time as an investment on test day... Why focusing on the wrong answers can be just as important as finding the right one...and how to do it effectively... The simple formula that allows you to crank out a top-scoring essay (that is, if you even need to take the ACT Writing test in the first place)... The special grammatical rules tested on the ACT English section-which may differ from what's commonly accepted in a high school or college classroom... The unwritten rules for every kind of ACT question... The many ways to approach an ACT Math question, and which ones are likely to work best for you... Why every real ACT Math question can potentially be answered in under 30 seconds... And much, much more than we can fit in this space...",,630,N/A,0,en

PostSecret,Frank Warren,Harper Collins,2005-11-29,"The project that captured a nation's imagination. The instructions were simple, but the results were extraordinary. ""You are invited to anonymously contribute a secret to a group art project. Your secret can be a regret, fear, betrayal, desire, confession, or childhood humiliation. Reveal anything -- as long as it is true and you have never shared it with anyone before. Be brief. Be legible. Be creative."" It all began with an idea Frank Warren had for a community art project. He began handing out postcards to strangers and leaving them in public places -- asking people to write down a secret they had never told anyone and mail it to him, anonymously. The response was overwhelming. The secrets were both provocative and profound, and the cards themselves were works of art -- carefully and creatively constructed by hand. Addictively compelling, the cards reveal our deepest fears, desires, regrets, and obsessions. Frank calls them ""graphic haiku,"" beautiful, elegant, and small in structure but powerfully emotional. As Frank began posting the cards on his website, PostSecret took on a life of its own, becoming much more than a simple art project. It has grown into a global phenomenon, exposing our individual aspirations, fantasies, and frailties -- our common humanity. Every day dozens of postcards still make their way to Frank, with postmarks from around the world, touching on every aspect of human experience. This extraordinary collection brings together the most powerful, personal, and beautifully intimate secrets Frank Warren has received -- and brilliantly illuminates that human emotions can be unique and universal at the same time.",Self-Help,290,N/A,0,en

Urantia Work Book,Hara Davis,N/A,2019-01-11,"All Urantia Book readers will tell you how reading the Book changed their lives. We have a new way of looking at life; we can see the bigger picture; our faith is strengthened; we feel more secure, more able to cope with life's problems; we have come to know God and Jesus as friends; we are no longer afraid of death. The knowledge of the Grand Universe and all the beings within it brings great comfort to us on this extraordinarily difficult planet. It puts our lives into perspective and we can cope with life's problems knowing that the challenges we face are all part of the beginning of our Ascendant career.But how much does knowledge of the Urantia Book change our personality? Are we better people having read the Book? Can we relate to others in a kinder way? Are we better parents, more loving partners? Are we more honest, reliable, trustworthy, loyal, tolerant and wise? Do we display more of the qualities of Jesus in our lives? Are we progressing from the human to the divine?This Work Book is especially for those who want to put spiritual values into practice in their lives. I believe we have a responsibility to our Thought Adjusters, our Guardians of Destiny but most of all to ourselves and those we come into contact with to be the best we can be. Together with quotes from the Urantia Book and my own suggestions and exercises, I hope this Work Book will help us to be more aware of our shortcomings and actually do something about it. We are all encouraged to 'do the Father's Will' and the Father's will is to be more like Him. I hope the Work Book will give you the incentive to work on yourself and help to turn flesh into soul. The Fruits of the Spirit are mentioned many times in the Urantia Book as necessary qualities to attain true self-mastery. I have taken each 'fruit' and suggested ways of developing the qualities in your day to day lives. Other topics such as Education, Relationships, Marriage, Prayer and Worship are also explored.",Religion,52,N/A,0,en

Let's Study James,Sinclair B.

It can be read out loud in twenty minutes. It is very direct and extremely practical. Several themes run through the Letter of James and make clear what his burden is. He writes about suffering and joy, riches and poverty, faith and works, the tongue and speech, and about wisdom and folly. In a word, he writes about the heart and life of the Christian believer. James's bƒte noire is false and hollow piety; pious platitudes are anathema to him. Faith that does not issue in good works, a holy life, concern for the needy, and a disciplined use of the tongue, is for James no faith at all.

Energy Law and Policy,"Lincoln Davies, Alexandra Klass, Hari Osofsky, Joseph Tomain, Elizabeth Wilson",West Academic Publishing,2021-12,"New book purchase includes complimentary digital access to the eBook. This casebook serves as a guide to energy law and policy for students who seek to practice in the field and anyone interested in better understanding this critical area of law. It introduces the key federal, state, and local government actors shaping energy issues and explores the multi-jurisdictional approach to energy regulation pervasive in the United States. The book explains the foundations of the laws and policies governing energy extraction, use, markets, and disposal. It covers how we make energy from renewable and non-renewable resources and examines the future of the energy sector in light of new technologies, market trends, emerging risks, and the need for greater equality. The authors use a systemic approach that allows for a deeper exploration of the linkages between the resources, technologies, law, policy, and markets that make up our core energy systems, including electricity and transportation. Energy Law and Policy contains cases, sample statutes and regulations, and pertinent excerpts from experts. These policy-oriented, often empirical materials offer the necessary building blocks for a public law course, particularly one covering a rapidly transitioning field. The book is organized into three parts that introduce students to the fundamental aspects of the energy sector, energy law, and the most pressing energy topics of the 21st century. The third edition expands and deepens coverage in important ways: Updated treatment of state and federal policy initiatives such as community solar, 100% clean energy laws, energy transition and energy markets.

Starting Off Right in Law School,Carolyn Nygren,N/A,2011,"The 2018 printing of Starting Off Right in Law School, Second Edition, contains a new chapter, ""Organizing Your Reading."" To access the bonus chapter online, click here. Law school is different. Incoming students, confronted with an entirely new vocabulary and unfamiliar with the discipline's unique and demanding educational methods, are often disoriented. This book is designed to give these students a head start, both by introducing them to the fundamentals of the legal process and by helping them acquire the study skills necessary for success. Starting Off Right in Law School introduces new law students to the practice and study of law by following a lawsuit from its inception through the appeals process, illustrating what lawyers actually do, how they prepare, how they interact with clients and in courtrooms, how a lawsuit proceeds, and how students can effectively read and analyze cases, outline, and apply what they have learned on the exams. Widely used in law schools, the first edition of Starting Off Right in Law School prepared new law students to excel in doctrinal courses. The second edition has been updated to prepare students both for the broader demands of doctrinal courses and for the more distinct reading and writing demands of legal writing courses. This book is the perfect tool for pre-law students to read on their own or for law school orientation required reading.",Law,0,N/A,0,en

LEED v4 BD&C EXAM GUIDE,Gang Chen,"ArchiteG, Inc.",2015-06-26,"Pass the LEED AP BD&C Exam, Get Your Building LEED Certified, Fight Global Warming and Save Money! The USGBC released LEED v4 in GreenBuild International Conference and Expo in November, 2013. The GBCI started to include the new LEED v4 content for all LEED exams in late Spring 2014. We have incorporated the new LEED v4 content in this book. Starting on December 1, 2011, GBCI began to draw LEED AP BD+C Exam questions from Green Building and LEED Core Concepts Guide. We have also incorporated the latest information from this book. LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is one of the most important trends in development and is revolutionizing the construction industry. It has gained tremendous momentum and has a profound impact on our environment. From this book, you will learn how to: 1. Pass the LEED AP BD+C Exam. 2. Register and achieve LEED certification for a building. 3. Understand the intent of each LEED prerequisite and credit. 4. Calculate points for LEED credits. 5. Indentify the credit path, submittal requirements, synergies, possible strategies and technologies, project phase, LEED submittal phase, and responsible party for each prerequisite and credit. 6. Earn extra credit (exemplary performance) for LEED. 7. Implement the related codes and standards. 8. Obtain points for categories not yet clearly defined by the USGBC. Most of the existing books on LEED and the LEED exams are too expensive and complicated to be practical or helpful. This guide fills in the blanks and demystifies LEED. It uncovers the secrets, codes, and jargon for LEED as well as the true meaning of ""going green."" It provides a solid foundation and fundamental framework for LEED. It covers every major aspect of LEED in plain and concise language, and introduces it to ordinary people. This guide is easy to carry around. You can read it whenever you have a few extra minutes. It is an indispensable book for ordinary people, developers, brokers, contractors, administrators, architects, landscape architects, engineers, interns, drafters, designers, and other design professionals. What others are saying about LEED BD&C Exam Guide … “Passed on first try, only used this guide “This is the best study guide HANDS DOWN. If you're serious about passing the LEED AP BD&C exam on your first try, this is the one you've been looking for! I bought Mr. Chen's LEED Green Associate Exam Guide2 months ago and passed it on the first try as well. I purchased the USGBC reference guide and Mr. Chen's LEED BD&C Exam Guide. I never opened the USGBC reference guide, only studied from Mr. Chen's study guide. I followed Mr. Chen's instructions and studied the guide for 2 weeks (yes, I have a full-time job). I did ignore the mnemonics, not my learning style (makes it more confusing to me). The exam was not easy, but I prepared and stuck to this material. I am not a good test taker by no means. I reviewed the technical data of the guide about 6 times and ignored everything else I had read or heard about the exam. Here's a piece of advice that I picked up from this book, spend less time on practice tests and more time studying! I have a subscription to a web exam simulator (rated the best) and only did about 100 questions, until I realized that I was wasting my valuable time. Find a good book and stick to it. This is also a great reference guide to use on everyday projects. Review the material, try to understand it, then try to memorize it through repetition. I would like to shake your hand and say THANKS AGAIN MR. GANG CHEN !!! ” —LOBO “Excellent Guide and Good Manual “I passed the LEED AP BD+C and the LEED AP ID+C exams this year and Gang Chen's books were my primary study material! The books are easy to read and use. Gang Chen provides study hints and guidance as well as an outline format that makes it easy for the reader to grasp key points. He also provides an excellent review of the entire accreditation process which can save people time in personal research. The books are more than study guides; they are helpful as reference manuals because of the easy to follow format. Definitely a keeper in my bookshelf for future project reference.” —Karen M. Scott “Great resource for studying for the LEED Exam! “I have taken and passed the LEED AP BD+C exam and know what it takes. As this author says, it's not an easy exam and he is right. What is critical to passing is having great teaching tools and this book is one of them. He touches on every aspect of how to memorize data, how questions are formed, what to expect on tricky questions, the content the test writers are looking for and every little detail you need to know when preparing for this exam. I highly recommend this author's books if you are serious about passing any of the LEED exams, hopefully on the first try!” —S. Jennifer Sakiewicz “LEED BD & C Exam Study Guide “Gang Chan's study guide is an excellent resource in preparing to take the LEED AP BD+C exam particularly if one follows the study recommendation made in the guide. It does not replace the LEED Reference manual as the definitive source for technical information but more importantly provides a structure for the study of the information that is easily understood and when followed should provide good assurance of success in passing the exam the 1st time. This is a 'keeper'!” —Spock “Good summary of information to memorize for the test “Chen's exam guide is a good summary of the test relevant information in the LEED reference guide. He underlines specific information that is important to commit to memory for the test. It is a good way to understand which information needs to be strictly memorized if you are preparing for the test in a short amount of time and have a good understanding of the LEED process through your professional experience. I passed the test with a very high score on my first try, and I did use this guide, one other, the LEED reference manual, online sources, a class, and many years of personally working on and completing online LEED submittals through my work. The week before taking the test I used it to commit point values and those kind of details to memory... ” —Denver “Not a bulky ref guide “LEED BD&C Exam Guide does a great job in highlighting and summarizing the key points and concepts in USGBC ref guide. If you only have limited amount of time for LEED AP BD+C exam preparation, definitely go for this book.” —Metcalf “Very valuable guide! “I am a lighting designer and am preparing to take the LEED BD+C exam...I got LEED BD&C Exam Guide to prepare for the LEED AP BD+C Exam and it was fairly well organized to help me refresh my memory on the background LEED knowledge I had. All the specifics that one needs to know about each credit such as the Purpose of the credit, Credit path, Submittals, Strategies and technologies etc, are clearly organized for every credit. In addition the author also employs the smart technique of Mnemonics which helps in memorizing the vast amount of information in a simplified manner.” —Visswapriya Prabakar “Immensely valuable and utterly to the point, a true must have! “This is an excellent publication by Gang Chen that outlines precisely all the key points one need for success. I personally appreciate the easy to adopt memorization technique offered by the author. Practice exams are very comprehensive yet summarized and not to mention highly effective learning tool as it is designed in this book. It is a very delightful experience for me to have this outstanding publication. In a word, this definitely worth the money and for me it turns out extraordinarily helpful.” —Shanaz, who passed LEED AP BD+C Exam on the first try “Very Helpful! “I found LEED BD&C Exam Guide to be very detailed and very helpful. I plan to take the exam soon, and I feel fully prepared for it.” — Yousuf Asadzoi “Good book! “I had appeared for GA and passed. I loved the content and the underlined highlights. I read your book; it gave me insight and knowledge on how credits are applied. Some questions in your book helped me answer ones on the test. Good book, I'll go through it once again when I appear for AP.” —Haresh Vibhakar, AIIA (India), AIA, LEED Green Associate, Architect “A good outline “The book is an excellent outline to learn the necessary items required to study for the exam. It is not a comprehensive study guide in and of itself. Practice exam is good indicator of test preparation.” —Paul Levine “Solid LEED Study Guide “This is the kind of book I wish was available when I did my original LEED AP exam. It teaches you how to study, which is so important when school is a distant memory. The bulk of the book helps you review and memorize with mnemonics the concepts for each credit that you need to know for the exam. The questions are good representations of questions on the exam. I would recommend to anyone studying for their exam, that they: - First read the chapters in this book on how to study; - Second read the actual LEED BD+C guide to give you the background information on the credits and gain comprehension. Underline and review as the author indicates to get the most out of your study time. - Finally read the rest of this exam guide to help you review and memorize for the exam.” —missfitz ""missfitz"" “Very Helpful Guide “Gang Chen's LEED BD&C Exam Guides very helpful in consolidating information from USGBC and GBCI sources as well as providing the information that is necessary for the exam without excess irrelevant information. I highly recommend this book for preparation for the LEED BD+C exams.” —leedap",Technology & Engineering,330,N/A,0,en

HIV and Liver Disease,Kenneth E. Sherman,Springer Science & Business Media,2011-09-22,"Liver disease has been identified as a leading cause of death in HIV-infected patients since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in 1996. The HIV treatment community has been caught largely unaware of this emerging dilemma. Many HIV care providers are ill-equipped to understand and interpret liver injury patterns, or to provide comprehensive care and management for viral coinfections which they are not familiar with. HIV and Liver Disease provides a comprehensive update of the field covering the epidemiology, pathogenesis, management and treatment of liver disease in patients with HIV infection. The volume will help HIV care providers understand and interpret liver injury patterns, and/or provide comprehensive care and management for viral coinfections. Gastroenterologists and hepatologists will gain an understanding of complex drug regimens that are used to treat HIV and which may impact HCV and HBV treatment. Written by expert clinicians and researchers across multiple disciplines, HIV and Liver Disease will be of great value to gastroenterologists, hepatologists, infectious disease practitioners, as well as other health care providers who provide care or participate in research in the field of HIV.",Medical,211,N/A,0,en

Academic Misconduct and Plagiarism,Bernard Montoneri,Rowman & Littlefield,2020-11-15,"This book discusses the issue of academic misconduct and publication ethics in general and plagiarism in particular, with a focus on case studies in various universities around the world (notably in Japan, Singapore, Australia, USA, and Canada). We are especially interested in students’ and teachers’ perception of academic misconduct and their definition and understanding of plagiarism. Most chapters discuss undergraduates’ understanding of academic dishonesty and students’ experiences using plagiarism softwares. The book also analyzes teachers’ perception of cheating and how they respond to it. Writing is perceived by all of the teachers to be the most important form of assessment that required preventative measures in order to reduce the occurrence of academic dishonesty among students. Each chapter recommends strategies to fight plagiarism, such as establishing guidelines and regulations concerning academic integrity, awareness of the scale of the issue (scandals at all levels in most countries, even including famous scholars, administrators, and elected officials), assessing the damage done to academic reputation and credibility, developing trust and credibility on social media (especially with the recent disturbing growth of fake news and data), minimizing the proliferation of dishonest accreditation, of identity theft, of fake peer-reviews, and fighting the growing number of fake papers, with or without the use of computer-generated academic works.",Education,319,N/A,0,en

Linear Algebra and Its Applications,David C. Lay,Addison Wesley Longman,2012,"Linear algebra is relatively easy for students during the early stages of the course, when the material is presented in a familiar, concrete setting. But when abstract concepts are introduced, students often hit a brick wall. Instructors seem to agree that certain concepts (such as linear independence, spanning, subspace, vector space, and linear transformations), are not easily understood, and require time to assimilate. Since they are fundamental to the study of linear algebra, students' understanding of these concepts is vital to their mastery of the subject. David Lay introduces these concepts early in a familiar, concrete Rn setting, develops them gradually, and returns to them again and again throughout the text so that when discussed in the abstract, these concepts are more accessible.

Getting to Maybe,"Richard Michael Fischl, Jeremy R. Paul",Carolina Academic Press,1999-05-01,"Professors Fischl and Paul explain law school exams in ways no one has before, all with an eye toward improving the reader’s performance. The book begins by describing the difference between educational cultures that praise students for “right answers,” and the law school culture that rewards nuanced analysis of ambiguous situations in which more than one approach may be correct. Enormous care is devoted to explaining precisely how and why legal analysis frequently produces such perplexing situations. But the authors don’t stop with mere description. Instead, Getting to Maybe teaches how to excel on law school exams by showing the reader how legal analysis can be brought to bear on examination problems. The book contains hints on studying and preparation that go well beyond conventional advice. The authors also illustrate how to argue both sides of a legal issue without appearing wishy-washy or indecisive. Above all, the book explains why exam questions may generate feelings of uncertainty or doubt about correct legal outcomes and how the student can turn these feelings to his or her advantage. In sum, although the authors believe that no exam guide can substitute for a firm grasp of substantive material, readers who devote the necessary time to learning the law will find this book an invaluable guide to translating learning into better exam performance. “This book should revolutionize the ordeal of studying for law school exams… Its clear, insightful, fun to read, and right on the money.” — Duncan Kennedy, Carter Professor of General Jurisprudence, Harvard Law School “Finally a study aid that takes legal theory seriously… Students who master these lessons will surely write better exams. More importantly, they will also learn to be better lawyers.” — Steven L. Winter, Brooklyn Law School “If you can't spot a 'fork in the law' or a 'fork in the facts' in an exam hypothetical, get this book. If you don’t know how to play 'Czar of the Universe' on law school exams (or why), get this book. And if you do want to learn how to think like a lawyer—a good one—get this book. It's, quite simply, stone cold brilliant.” — Pierre Schlag, University of Colorado School of Law (Law Preview Book Review on The Princeton Review website) Attend a Getting to Maybe seminar!

At the beginning and often within each Part of the Black Letter, Professor Dressler conducts ?Conversations with Students? in which he talks to student-readers in an informal way, much as a professor might do at the beginning of a class, to better prepare students for what follows.

This book synthesizes and reviews the latest efforts to identify, develop, and integrate biomarkers as a key strategy in translational medicine and the drug development process. Filled with case studies, the book demonstrates how biomarkers can improve drug development timelines, lower costs, facilitate better compound selection, reduce late-stage attrition, and open the door to personalized medicine. Biomarkers in Drug Development is divided into eight parts: Part One offers an overview of biomarkers and their role in drug development. Part Two highlights important technologies to help researchers identify new biomarkers. Part Three examines the characterization and validation process for both drugs and diagnostics, and provides practical advice on appropriate statistical methods to ensure that biomarkers fulfill their intended purpose. Parts Four through Six examine the application of biomarkers in discovery, preclinical safety assessment, clinical trials, and translational medicine. Part Seven focuses on lessons learned and the practical aspects of implementing biomarkers in drug development programs. Part Eight explores future trends and issues, including data integration, personalized medicine, and ethical concerns.

International Criminal Law,"BETH VAN. SLYE SCHAACK (RONALD C.), Ronald C. Slye",Foundation Press,2020-11-27,"This engaging primer presents the field of International Criminal Law (ICL) in new and accessible ways. It provides a concise summary of key ICL doctrines while also raising novel and interdisciplinary perspectives. It targets a wide range of audiences, including law and other graduate students studying international law and related disciplines, such as human rights, transitional justice, peacebuilding, and conflict resolution. The book will also be useful for those working in the field--including diplomats, mediators, government officials, and negotiators--who need to understand the foundations and core concepts of ICL. It offers a useful primer for someone new to the field, and provides thought-provoking discussions for more seasoned practitioners. Part I introduces the domain of ICL. Specific chapters are devoted to the different strands of the field's history; the web of institutions that apply and interpret ICL; how the rules of international law generally, and ICL in particular, are created; theories that attempt to explain why certain crimes are subject to international regulation; and the unique challenges posed by the principle of legality within ICL. Part II is devoted to the intersecting elements of the major crimes recognized by international law (war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, aggression, and terrorism), the unique development of modes of liability under international law (including superior responsibility, complicity, co-perpetration, and joint criminal enterprise), and some of the defenses that might be deployed to block or mitigate liability (immunities, amnesties, and excuses). The text ends with two synthesis chapters. The first provides an in-depth case study of Syria to illustrate the way in which members of the international community can attempt to invoke, and block access to, the architecture of ICL and related accountability mechanisms. The second revisits some of the fundamental objectives underlying ICL, the more trenchant critiques of the project of international justice, and the breadth of creativity underlying alternative mechanisms developed under the cognate fields of transitional justice and conflict resolution. More than a hornbook, the text goes beyond a straight doctrinal discussion of ICL and offers insightful and provocative insights into the field. In so doing, it highlights points of intersection and divergence within core doctrines and offers a candid assessment of challenges in the field and opportunities for growth and development.",,377,N/A,0,en

What the L?,"Kelsey May, Samantha Roberts, Elizabeth Shelton",N/A,2010,"Law school can be a terrifying experience if you don't know what you're getting yourself into. For students who don't have their career paths or pedagogic goals mapped out, law school is even more terrifying. There are so many questions that accompany the decision to apply to law school: Is it worth the money? Is it worth the time? Is this the right time to go? Will I do well? How can I do well? How do I find a job? What kind of job is right for me? Is law school like college? And if you decide to go to law school, there are even more questions: What is an outline? How is an exam structured? How do I get a job at a big firm? What is a legal fraternity? What is the bar exam and when do I take it? This book is a firsthand account of trudging through law school without the answers to any of these questions. Three students offer a completely candid student perspective on every aspect of law school, from classmates to bar review, and outlines to studying abroad. While other law school preparation books are helpful, this account is a true story of how things really work, from the ground up. We are not law school experts, we are law school students: just like you. If you've ever wanted to know the real story on law school, this is it.

Nutrition and HIV,"Saurabh Mehta, Julia Finkelstein",CRC Press,2018-05-15,"The world continues to lose more than a million lives each year to the HIV epidemic, and nearly two million individuals were infected with HIV in 2017 alone. The new Sustainable Development Goals, adopted by countries of the United Nations in September 2015, include a commitment to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030. Considerable emphasis on prevention of new infections and treatment of those living with HIV will be needed to make this goal achievable. With nearly 37 million people now living with HIV, it is a communicable disease that behaves like a noncommunicable disease. Nutritional management is integral to comprehensive HIV care and treatment. Improved nutritional status and weight gain can increase recovery and strength of individuals living with HIV/AIDS, improve dietary diversity and caloric intake, and improve quality of life. This book highlights evidence-based research linking nutrition and HIV and identifies research gaps to inform the development of guidelines and policies for the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. A comprehensive approach that includes nutritional interventions is likely to maximize the benefit of antiretroviral therapy in preventing HIV disease progression and other adverse outcomes in HIV-infected men and women. Modification of nutritional status has been shown to enhance the quality of life of those suffering HIV/AIDS, both physically in terms of improved body mass index and immunological markers, and psychologically, by improving symptoms of depression. While the primary focus for those infected should remain on antiretroviral treatment and increasing its availability and coverage, improvement of nutritional status plays a complementary role in the management of HIV infection.",Medical,328,N/A,0,en

Make It Stick,"Peter C. Brown, Henry L. Roediger III, Mark A. McDaniel",Harvard University Press,2014-04-14,"To most of us, learning something ""the hard way"" implies wasted time and effort. Good teaching, we believe, should be creatively tailored to the different learning styles of students and should use strategies that make learning easier. Make It Stick turns fashionable ideas like these on their head. Drawing on recent discoveries in cognitive psychology and other disciplines, the authors offer concrete techniques for becoming more productive learners. Memory plays a central role in our ability to carry out complex cognitive tasks, such as applying knowledge to problems never before encountered and drawing inferences from facts already known. New insights into how memory is encoded, consolidated, and later retrieved have led to a better understanding of how we learn. Grappling with the impediments that make learning challenging leads both to more complex mastery and better retention of what was learned. Many common study habits and practice routines turn out to be counterproductive. Underlining and highlighting, rereading, cramming, and single-minded repetition of new skills create the illusion of mastery, but gains fade quickly. More complex and durable learning come from self-testing, introducing certain difficulties in practice, waiting to re-study new material until a little forgetting has set in, and interleaving the practice of one skill or topic with another. Speaking most urgently to students, teachers, trainers, and athletes, Make It Stick will appeal to all those interested in the challenge of lifelong learning and self-improvement.",Psychology,330,N/A,0,en

Oxford Textbook of Public Mental Health,"Dinesh Bhugra, Kamaldeep Bhui, Samuel Yeung Shan Wong, Stephen E. Gilman",Oxford University Press,2018-09-13,"Prevention of mental illness and mental health promotion have often been ignored in the past, both in undergraduate and postgraduate curricula. Recently, however, there has been a clear shift towards public mental health, as a result of increasing scientific evidence that both these actions have a serious potential to reduce the onset of illness and subsequent burden as a result of mental illness and related social, economic and political costs. A clear distinction between prevention of mental illness and mental health promotion is critical. Selective prevention, both at societal and individual level, is an important way forward. The Oxford Textbook of Public Mental Health brings together the increasing interest in public mental health and the growing emphasis on the prevention of mental ill health and promotion of well-being into a single comprehensive textbook. Comprising international experiences of mental health promotion and mental well-being, chapters are supplemented with practical examples and illustrations to provide the most relevant information succinctly. This book will serve as an essential resource for mental and public health professionals, as well as for commissioners of services, nurses and community health visitors.",Medical,617,N/A,0,en

Teach Students How to Learn,Saundra Yancy McGuire,Taylor & Francis,2023-07-03,"Co-published with and Miriam, a freshman Calculus student at Louisiana State University, made 37.5% on her first exam but 83% and 93% on the next two. Matt, a first year General Chemistry student at the University of Utah, scored 65% and 55% on his first two exams and 95% on his third—These are representative of thousands of students who decisively improved their grades by acting on the advice described in this book.What is preventing your students from performing according to expectations? Saundra McGuire offers a simple but profound answer: If you teach students how to learn and give them simple, straightforward strategies to use, they can significantly increase their learning and performance. For over a decade Saundra McGuire has been acclaimed for her presentations and workshops on metacognition and student learning because the tools and strategies she shares have enabled faculty to facilitate dramatic improvements in student learning and success. This book encapsulates the model and ideas she has developed in the past fifteen years, ideas that are being adopted by an increasing number of faculty with considerable effect.The methods she proposes do not require restructuring courses or an inordinate amount of time to teach. They can often be accomplished in a single session, transforming students from memorizers and regurgitators to students who begin to think critically and take responsibility for their own learning. Saundra McGuire takes the reader sequentially through the ideas and strategies that students need to understand and implement. First, she demonstrates how introducing students to metacognition and Bloom’s Taxonomy reveals to them the importance of understanding how they learn and provides the lens through which they can view learning activities and measure their intellectual growth. Next, she presents a specific study system that can quickly empower students to maximize their learning. Then, she addresses the importance of dealing with emotion, attitudes, and motivation by suggesting ways to change students’ mindsets about ability and by providing a range of strategies to boost motivation and learning; finally, she offers guidance to faculty on partnering with campus learning centers.She pays particular attention to academically unprepared students, noting that the strategies she offers for this particular population are equally beneficial for all students. While stressing that there are many ways to teach effectively, and that readers can be flexible in picking and choosing among the strategies she presents, Saundra McGuire offers the reader a step-by-step process for delivering the key messages of the book to students in as little as 50 minutes. Free online supplements provide three slide sets and a sample video lecture.This book is written primarily for faculty but will be equally useful for TAs, tutors, and learning center professionals. For readers with no background in education or cognitive psychology, the book avoids jargon and esoteric theory.",Education,182,N/A,0,en

Norton & Company,2009-10-21,"""A masterpiece of contemporary Bible translation and commentary.""—Los Angeles Times Book Review, Best Books of 1999 Acclaimed for its masterful new translation and insightful commentary, The David Story is a fresh, vivid rendition of one of the great works in Western literature. Robert Alter's brilliant translation gives us David, the beautiful, musical hero who slays Goliath and, through his struggles with Saul, advances to the kingship of Israel. But this David is also fully human: an ambitious, calculating man who navigates his life's course with a flawed moral vision. The consequences for him, his family, and his nation are tragic and bloody. Historical personage and full-blooded imagining, David is the creation of a literary artist comparable to the Shakespeare of the history plays.",Religion,452,N/A,0,en

Day by day, as we come to God's Enduring Word, He has wisdom, strength, and blessing to give us. We can weather storms and enjoy calm waters. We can grow in seasons of drought and bear a harvest for God's kingdom year-round. For 25 years I have prepared a weekly devotional.

Many use recently revealed papers of Supreme Court Justices to discuss often surprising elements of the decision by the Court. Students can learn a good deal about the handling of these disputes at the administrative level, before they ever get to court -- a perspective essential to understanding the field, but hard to pick up from the reported cases. Attention is paid to the ways in which many of these decisions affected future developments, with primary focus on context and on understanding the ways in which administrative disputes develop, and the roles that lawyers play in developing them.",Law,486,N/A,0,en

Articles deal with private law, public law, and constitutional/higher law throughout the world and are written and signed by one of the many noteworthy contributors, which include major scholars and experts.

This encyclopedia will bring together the study of ancient law with the study of modern law-examining statutes and administrative rulings as well as judicial decisions, legislatures, agencies, and courts. The Encyclopedia will cover ancient, medieval, early modern, and modern law in eight legal traditions and geographical/cultural areas: Ancient Greek Law, Ancient Roman Law, Chinese Law, English Common Law, Islamic Law, Medieval Roman Law, United States Law, and law in other regions (Africa, Latin America, and South Asia among them). It will address major categories of law within these traditions, including private law (contract, tort, civil procedure), varieties of public law (criminal law, administrative law, statutory law), and higher law/ constitutional law.

Disclosure Within HIV-Affected Families,"Grace Gachanja, Gary J. Burkholder, Aimee Ferraro",Frontiers Media SA,2018-08-29,"While HIV/AIDS is a global public heath challenge, its impact is arguably greatest in the Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where new infections account for approximately 66% of the total number of HIV-positive persons globally. In SSA, medical, social, and economic resources are limited, thus necessitating innovative approaches to disease prevention. One of the mechanisms of prevention that is most promising occurs through HIV disclosure to family members (e.g., adult sexual partners) generally, and to children in particular. Our emphasis in this eBook is on HIV disclosure to children because it has multiple benefits, including improved adherence to antiretroviral medication treatment and understanding at an early age of the impact of sexual activity on the spread of HIV. While there is a noticeable gap in research on HIV disclosure to younger children, some of the general reasons for non-disclosure include concerns about fear of adult partners leaving relationships, and that children are too young to comprehend the severity of the situation and may tell others outside the family. Thus, it is critical to better understand how the HIV disclosure process happens (or does not happen) within HIV-affected families, as well as the best practices on how to disclose. In this eBook, we present a combination of empirical research studies and critical literature reviews that investigate the reasons for and for not disclosing HIV status within HIV-affected families and provide evidence-based practices that could be adopted by healthcare professionals to help HIV-positive parents facilitate disclosure activities within these families. This information can also be used by researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders who are in a position to influence policies on effective HIV disclosure practices, guidelines, and programs.",AIDS (Disease),130,N/A,0,en

Now The Chicago Homer presents an easily searchable, web-accessible database of Homer in the original and in Lattimore's translations.

In addition to providing Greek and English texts in an interlinear display, The Chicago Homer gives complete information (tense, mood, voice, case, gender, and number) on the morphology of each Greek word. Invaluable for students learning Greek, this information is also important to researchers investigating the frequency or distribution of grammatical phenomena; only The Chicago Homer provides these data in readily searchable electronic form. But the most distinctive feature of The Chicago Homer is its ability to analyze and display the wealth of repeated phrases -- such as"" rosy-fingered dawn"" and ""swift-footed Achilles"" -- that are considered to be the hallmark of Homeric poetry. For the first time in any medium, The Chicago Homer presents a complete index of all repeated phrases in Early Greek epic.

Understanding Contracts,Jeffrey Thomas Ferriell,N/A,2014,"This Understanding treatise is designed for first-year law students enrolled in Contracts. The text explains common law principles of contract law using cases and examples that students commonly encounter in this first-year course. It draws illustrations from the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, and from Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code as it has been adopted in all fifty states. This edition includes expanded material on the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods, and the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts, appropriate to a basic course in Contracts, and on modern statutes regarding electronic contracting. Understanding Contracts was written with the understanding that Contracts will be one of the most challenging courses first-year law students will take. It explains how key concepts apply in several recurring basic fact patterns. It then builds on those fact patterns to explain how the law is more difficult to apply in business transactions with more complex facts. A key feature of Understanding Contracts that is not found in other similar books is its conscious incorporation of basic explanations of the common business practices to which the law of contracts applies. The feature helps students, many of whom have not had any background in the business world, understand contract law in the business settings in which it frequently applies.

Synthetic biology, which collectively refers to concepts, approaches, and tools that enable the modification or creation of biological organisms, is being pursued overwhelmingly for beneficial purposes ranging from reducing the burden of disease to improving agricultural yields to remediating pollution. Although the contributions synthetic biology can make in these and other areas hold great promise, it is also possible to imagine malicious uses that could threaten U.S. citizens and military personnel. Making informed decisions about how to address such concerns requires a realistic assessment of the capabilities that could be misused. Biodefense in the Age of Synthetic Biology explores and envisions potential misuses of synthetic biology.

How to Listen to God,Charles F. Stanley,Thomas Nelson,2002-09-01,"Every day, we hear dozens of outside opinions: from our spouses and our family members to our coworkers and our church community, but how can we shift our focus away from the clamor of other voices so we don't miss what God is trying to tell us? How to Listen to God helps you distinguish God's voice from all the rest. Bestselling author Dr. Charles Stanley shares the lessons he's learned on his own journey to listening to the God who wants to communicate personally with you, including: How God gets your attention Four ways God speaks to you The importance of your own spiritual mindset Scriptural guidelines for recognizing God's voice The joys and fruits from listening to God Ten hindrances to hearing God Along the way, you'll learn firsthand that just a few minutes of sitting before the God who speaks can transform a life, refocus a mind, and reset purpose and direction for eternity. The sad heart is cheered, the confused mind is ordered, the pessimistic outlook is eliminated, the lonely spirit is befriended, the rebellious will is subdued, and the drifting seeker is made steadfast. Join Dr. Stanley as he shows us that we've never been more equipped to confidently hear from God.

These struggles are common to every human. Yet not all circumstances or negative emotions originate within. They could be the result of a willful, coordinated assault of Satan. In When the Enemy Strikes, best-selling author Dr. Charles Stanley explores the often-overlooked reality of spiritual warfare?the tactics used by Satan to taunt, confuse, slander, and harm. Your adversary wants to crush your will, delay your promise, hinder your destiny, destroy your relationships, and lead you into sin. Dr. Stanley reveals how you should respond. The most important component of warfare, says Dr. Stanley, is the supremacy of God?both His sovereignty and His power. Practically, this means the battles you face are ultimately allowed by God to bring you to a place of greater reliance on Him. His strength crushes the enemy. This is a world of conflict between good and evil, of powers beyond the merely human. The battle is unavoidable, but take heart! God has given you the strength to stand.",Religion,224,N/A,0,en

In Step With God,Charles F. Stanley,Thomas Nelson,2010-09-12,"What is God like? Can I trust Him? Does He know me and can He help me tackle the challenges I face? Most people know a little something about God, but their knowledge of who He is and how He works stops just past the point of an initial introduction. Why is it so important to know the One who knows all about you? The answer is simple: when you come to a point where you understand His ways, your life takes on new meaning. You stop looking at old problems and feeling defeat, fear, and anxiety. Suddenly, you realize that the Person who gave you life has set an amazing course for you to follow. In Step with God offers simple, clear teaching that encourages and challenges you to approach life and its decisions—both big and small—by first knowing and considering God’s character. “The nearer I draw to the Lord,” writes Dr. Stanley, “the more I will know about Him—His love for me and His good plans and desires for my life. Plus, the more intimate I become with God, the better I understand His way, and this understanding leads to a deeper longing to know God better. I learn how to discern His will for my life and the situations I encounter.”",Religion,241,4,1,en

Yet Dr. Stanley contends, ""As much as we all want to know the answer to the why question, it is really not the most significant question. The real question each of us needs to ask is, 'How should I respond?'"" How to Handle Adversity helps you learn to Ask the right questions about adversity Become a comfort to others Rediscover the faithfulness of God Deal with pride and weakness Look at adversity from God's perspective Glorify God in your adversity If you are a child of God whose heart's desire is to see God glorified through you, adversity will not put you down for the count.

Unbound,Tarana Burke,Flatiron Books: An Oprah Book,2021-09-14,"INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER ""Searing. Powerful. Needed."" —Oprah “Sometimes a single story can change the world. Unbound is one of those stories. Tarana’s words are a testimony to liberation and love.” —Brené Brown From the founder and activist behind one of the largest movements of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the ""me too"" movement, Tarana Burke debuts a powerful memoir about her own journey to saying those two simple yet infinitely powerful words—me too—and how she brought empathy back to an entire generation in one of the largest cultural events in American history. Tarana didn’t always have the courage to say ""me too."" As a child, she reeled from her sexual assault, believing she was responsible. Unable to confess what she thought of as her own sins for fear of shattering her family, her soul split in two. One side was the bright, intellectually curious third generation Bronxite steeped in Black literature and power, and the other was the bad, shame ridden girl who thought of herself as a vile rule breaker, not as a victim. She tucked one away, hidden behind a wall of pain and anger, which seemed to work...until it didn’t. Tarana fought to reunite her fractured self, through organizing, pursuing justice, and finding community. In her debut memoir she shares her extensive work supporting and empowering Black and brown girls, and the devastating realization that to truly help these girls she needed to help that scared, ashamed child still in her soul. She needed to stop running and confront what had happened to her, for Heaven and Diamond and the countless other young Black women for whom she cared. They gave her the courage to embrace her power. A power which in turn she shared with the entire world. Through these young Black and brown women, Tarana found that we can only offer empathy to others if we first offer it to ourselves. Unbound is the story of an inimitable woman’s inner strength and perseverance, all in pursuit of bringing healing to her community and the world around her, but it is also a story of possibility, of empathy, of power, and of the leader we all have inside ourselves. In sharing her path toward healing and saying ""me too,"" Tarana reaches out a hand to help us all on our own journeys.",Biography & Autobiography,209,N/A,0,en

Creating Significant Learning Experiences,L.

In the process of addressing this question, he urges teachers to shift from a content-centered approach to a learning-centered approach that asks ""What kinds of learning will be significant for students, and how can I create a course that will result in that kind of learning?"" Fink provides several conceptual and procedural tools that will be invaluable for all teachers when designing instruction. He takes important existing ideas in the literature on college teaching (active learning, educative assessment), adds some new ideas (a taxonomy of significant learning, the concept of a teaching strategy), and shows how to systematically combine these in a way that results in powerful learning experiences for students. Acquiring a deeper understanding of the design process will empower teachers to creatively design courses for significant learning in a variety of situations.",Education,317,N/A,0,en
Dare to Lead,Brené Brown,Random House,2018-10-09,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Brené Brown has taught us what it means to dare greatly, rise strong, and brave the wilderness. Now, based on new research conducted with leaders, change makers, and culture shifters, she’s showing us how to put those ideas into practice so we can step up and lead. Don’t miss the five-part Max docuseries Brené Brown: Atlas of the Heart! ONE OF BLOOMBERG’S BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR Leadership is not about titles, status, and wielding power. A leader is anyone who takes responsibility for recognizing the potential in people and ideas, and has the courage to develop that potential. When we dare to lead, we don’t pretend to have the right answers; we stay curious and ask the right questions. We don’t see power as finite and hoard it; we know that power becomes infinite when we share it with others. We don’t avoid difficult conversations and situations; we lean into vulnerability when it’s necessary to do good work. But daring leadership in a culture defined by scarcity, fear, and uncertainty requires skill-building around traits that are deeply and uniquely human. The irony is that we’re choosing not to invest in developing the hearts and minds of leaders at the exact same time as we’re scrambling to figure out what we have to offer that machines and AI can’t do better and faster. What can we do better? Empathy, connection, and courage, to start. Four-time #1 New York Times bestselling author Brené Brown has spent the past two decades studying the emotions and experiences that give meaning to our lives, and the past seven years working with transformative leaders and teams spanning the globe. She found that leaders in organizations ranging from small entrepreneurial startups and family-owned businesses to nonprofits, civic organizations, and Fortune 50 companies all ask the same question: How do you cultivate braver, more daring leaders, and how do you embed the value of courage in your culture? In Dare to Lead, Brown uses research, stories, and examples to answer these questions in the no-BS style that millions of readers have come to expect and love. Brown writes, “One of the most important findings of my career is that daring leadership is a collection of four skill sets that are 100 percent teachable, observable, and measurable. It’s learning and unlearning that requires brave work, tough conversations, and showing up with your whole heart. Easy? No. Because choosing courage over comfort is not always our default. Worth it? Always. We want to be brave with our lives and our work. It’s why we’re here.” Whether you’ve read Daring Greatly and Rising Strong or you’re new to Brené Brown’s work, this book is for anyone who wants to step up and into brave leadership.",Business & Economics,321,N/A,0,en

Essential Japanese Grammar,E. F. Bleiler,Courier Corporation,2012-06-07,"Although not a member of the Indo-European language family, Japanese is not too difficult grammatically for an English speaker. It is astonishingly regular in its formations — exceptions and irregularities can usually be numbered on one's fingers — and once the student masters a few conventions of linguistic classifications of experience, he will find that he can express most of his wants. This is the first Japanese grammar written for the adult with a limited objective in studying Japanese: to express oneself orally with reasonable accuracy; to understand simple material addressed to oneself; and to be able to analyze, understand, and enlarge material in a phrase approach. The author has limited this book to modern colloquial Japanese, and does not overburden the student with literary language, rarely used alternate forms, unnecessary abrupt forms, causatives and direct conditionals, and similar forms that might be required for a full knowledge of the written language. On the other hand, this book is not simplified Japanese, nor baby Japanese, nor kitchen Japanese. It is the full idiomatic language, with thorough treatments of the material you really need: the noun, pronoun, adjective, demonstrative words, adverb, verb, negative forms, Chinese forms, courtesy and honorific forms, idiomatic constructions, word order, relationship of ideas, syntax, etc. Emphasis has been placed upon clarity of exposition, so that the English-speaking reader can understand what is really happening in Japanese, even if he has never studied any foreign language before. For this reason, explanation rather than brute memory work is stressed, examples are given for all constructions, and both word-for-word and free translations are given, to acquaint the reader with thought processes. Hints are given on avoiding difficult constructions. Japanese is presented in the Romaji transliteration, which can be read at sight. Characters are not used.",Foreign Language Study,173,N/A,0,en
Revelation,John F. MacArthur,HarperChristian Resources,2016-06-28,"The book of Revelation unveils Jesus Christ in his glory and victorious return. And yet no other New Testament book of the Bible poses more serious and difficult interpretative challenges. John MacArthur will take you through the book, passage by passage, so that you can better understand everything from the historical context to the coming of Christ's Kingdom. The apostle John wrote this letter to the churches in Asia Minor who were feeling the overwhelming effects of persecution from all sides. It was a reminder to them that God saw their hardships, cared about them, and would reward them for their faithfulness. Through the use of vivid imagery, John writes Revelation to reveal the end of human history, the return of Christ, and the establishment of a new heaven and a new earth. John's message of hope in Revelation assures Christians that God is in sovereign control of all past, present, and future events. He encourages believers to trust that Jesus Christ will judge the lost and will rule in ultimate victory over all human and demonic opposition. —ABOUT THE SERIES— The MacArthur Bible Study series is designed to help you study the Word of God with guidance from widely respected pastor and author John MacArthur.

Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results No matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for improving--every day. James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results. If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights. Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field. Learn how to: make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy); overcome a lack of motivation and willpower; design your environment to make success easier; get back on track when you fall off course; ...and much more. Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.",Business & Economics,321,3.5,7,en
Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy,Vincent Bugliosi,W. W. Norton & Company,2007-05-17,"For fifty years the truth about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy has been obscured. This book releases us from a crippling distortion of American history. At 1:00 p.m. on November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was pronounced dead, the victim of a sniper attack during his motorcade through Dallas. That may be the only fact generally agreed upon in the vast literature spawned by the assassination. National polls reveal that an overwhelming majority of Americans (75%) believe that there was a high-level conspiracy behind Lee Harvey Oswald. Many even believe that Oswald was entirely innocent. In this continuously absorbing, powerful, ground-breaking book, Vincent Bugliosi shows how we have come to believe such lies about an event that changed the course of history. The brilliant prosecutor of Charles Manson and the man who forged an iron-clad case of circumstantial guilt around O. J. Simpson in his best-selling Outrage Bugliosi is perhaps the only man in America capable of writing the definitive book on the Kennedy assassination. This is an achievement that has for years seemed beyond reach. No one imagined that such a book would ever be written: a single volume that once and for all resolves, beyond any reasonable doubt, every lingering question as to what happened in Dallas and who was responsible. There have been hundreds of books about the assassination, but there has never been a book that covers the entire case, including addressing every piece of evidence and each and every conspiracy theory, and the facts, or alleged facts, on which they are based. In this monumental work, the author has raised scholarship on the assassination to a new and final level, one that far surpasses all other books on the subject. It adds resonance, depth, and closure to the admirable work of the Warren Commission. Reclaiming History is a narrative compendium of fact, forensic evidence, reexamination of key witnesses, and common sense. Every detail and nuance is accounted for, every conspiracy theory revealed as a fraud on the American public. Bugliosi's irresistible logic, command of the evidence, and ability to draw startling inferences shed fresh light on this American nightmare. At last it all makes sense.

Looking for Lovely,Annie F. Downs,B&H Publishing Group,2016-04-05,"“I want you to take every step of your life with excitement for where you are headed. And I want you to feel beautiful and confident as you do.” But how? When the enemy whispers lies that you are not smart enough, pretty enough, or rich enough? Or you are too dumb, too loud, too quiet, too thin, too fat, too much or not enough? What if you don’t have what it takes to be who you really want to be? In Looking for Lovely, Annie F. Downs shares personal stories, biblical truth, and examples of how others have courageously walked the path God paved for their lives by remembering all God had done, loving what was right in front of them, and seeing God in the everyday—whether that be nature, friends, or the face they see in the mirror.

Because the Time is Near,John MacArthur,Moody Publishers,2007-03-01,"The end of the world is coming. From roadside signs to science fiction films, this slogan underscores our society’s nervous fascination with the future. Whether it’s a giant asteroid, a worldwide plague, or some other global catastrophe, the end of the world is a terrifying prospect—at least for those who have no idea what it will be like. For Christians, however, the end of the world should be anything but dreadful. In fact, it should be something we actually look forward to. Why? Because God has told us how the world will end. And He has assured us that the end of this age will mark the beginning of a new, glorious one in which we will serve and worship Him in sinless perfection. Our eternal hope, as believers, is intimately tied to the end of this world. All of this is laid out in the book of Revelation. Not only is Revelation the inspired Word of God, it is also the only New Testament book that includes a promised spiritual blessing for those who study and apply its message. As such, it is an essential part of every Christian’s devotional life. Those who ignore Revelation deprive themselves of a rich treasure of divine truth, and the promised blessings that come from understanding that truth. Join John MacArthur as he explains the book of Revelation in a way that is both doctrinally precise and intensely practical.",Religion,364,N/A,0,en

Study Guide for Use with Financial Accounting,"Robert Libby, Patricia A. Libby, Daniel G. Short",McGraw-Hill/Irwin,2003,"Libby/Libby/Short wrote this text based on their belief that the subject of financial accounting is inherently interesting, but financial accounting textbooks are often not. They believe most financial accounting textbooks fail to demonstrate that accounting is an exciting field of study and one that is important to future careers in business. When writing this text, they considered career relevance as their guide when selecting material, and the need to engage the student as their guide to style, pedagogy, and design. Libby/Libby/Short is the only financial accounting text to successfully implement a real-world, single focus company approach in every chapter. Students and instructors have responded very favorably to the use of focus companies and the real-world financial statements.

Getting to the Promised Land,Kevin W. Cosby,Westminster John Knox Press,2021-06-22,"Too often, all oppressed people in America are lumped together under the moniker ""people of color,"" as if each group's experience under the yoke of systemic racism has the same economic and social repercussions. But the American Descendants of Slavery (ADOS) hold a unique claim to economic and reparative justice: for ADOS, after all, is the only group whose ancestors were forcibly brought to America, enslaved, built much of the wealth of the country, yet continue to be specifically excluded from the same social, political, and economic rights of other Americans. To that end, Rev. Dr. Kevin W. Cosby lays out the first theology of the ADOS movement, turning the traditional lens of Black liberation theology from Moses leading escaped Hebrew slaves in Exodus to other biblical leaders like Solomon, Daniel, and Nehemiah. A Jew born in exile, Nehemiah landed a somewhat privileged position in the Persian king's court. After learning about his people’s dire situation in Jerusalem, Nehemiah wept and was moved to lead efforts to rebuild the wall around the city with money (reparations) obtained from the imperial government. In the stories of Nehemiah and other biblical leaders, Cosby finds inspiration on how to rebuild Black America including the necessity of government reparations for ADOS. Cosby calls all Americans to move from a place of relative nonengagement and detachment to a place of active support of ADOS’s efforts for justice and healing.",Political Science,130,N/A,0,en

Springer Handbook of Robotics,"Bruno Siciliano, Oussama Khatib",Springer,2016-07-27,"The second edition of this handbook provides a state-of-the-art overview on the various aspects in the rapidly developing field of robotics. Reaching for the human frontier, robotics is vigorously engaged in the growing challenges of new emerging domains. Interacting, exploring, and working with humans, the new generation of robots will increasingly touch people and their lives. The credible prospect of practical robots among humans is the result of the scientific endeavour of a half a century of robotic developments that established robotics as a modern scientific discipline. The ongoing vibrant expansion and strong growth of the field during the last decade has fueled this second edition of the Springer Handbook of Robotics. The first edition of the handbook soon became a landmark in robotics publishing and won the American Association of Publishers PROSE Award for Excellence in Physical Sciences & Mathematics as well as the organization’s Award for Engineering & Technology. The second edition of the handbook, edited by two internationally renowned scientists with the support of an outstanding team of seven part editors and more than 200 authors, continues to be an authoritative reference for robotics researchers, newcomers to the field, and scholars from related disciplines. The contents have been restructured to achieve four main objectives: the enlargement of foundational topics for robotics, the enlightenment of design of various types of robotic systems, the extension of the treatment on robots moving in the environment, and the enrichment of advanced robotics applications. Further to an extensive update, fifteen new chapters have been introduced on emerging topics, and a new generation of authors have joined the handbook’s team. A novel addition to the second edition is a comprehensive collection of multimedia references to more than 700 videos, which bring valuable insight into the contents. The videos can be viewed directly augmented into the text with a smartphone or tablet using a unique and specially designed app. Springer Handbook of Robotics Multimedia Extension Portal: http://handbookofrobotics.org/",Technology & Engineering,2259,5,2,en

Searching the Scriptures,Charles R. Swindoll,NavPress,2016-09-13,"2017 ECPA Christian Book Award Finalist (Christian Living category) Are you getting the spiritual nourishment you need? Optimal health requires optimal nutrition. The same is true spiritually speaking. Without sufficient and regular biblical nutrition, our inner lives begin to suffer the consequences. We become shallow and selfish, more demanding and less gentle, and quick to react impatiently, rashly, and angrily. These are telltale signs of inner malnutrition. In Searching the Scriptures, respected Bible teacher Chuck Swindoll shows us how to dig deep into Scripture and uncover its profound truths for our lives. He outlines the principles of Bible study that will help you understand God’s Word, apply it, and communicate it clearly to those around you. Too many people try to go it alone, without a guide, for this life and the next. Chuck explains how we can fix our own spiritual meals, then invites us to feast on nourishing truths we can discover in God’s Word.",Religion,185,N/A,0,en

Filled to Be Emptied,Brandan J. Robertson,Presbyterian Publishing Corp,2022-02-15,"""Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not regard equality with God as something to be exploited, but emptied himself . . ."" (Philippians 2:5–7a) These ancient words offer a guide for modern Christians wrestling with their privileged place in an unequal and unjust world. The Kenosis Hymn (as this passage quoted by the apostle Paul is known) celebrates Jesus for his willingness to forego the divine glory that he is due, instead humbling himself to serve the oppressed and outcast of his society. Through a combination of in-depth Bible study and social analysis, Filled to Be Emptied invites readers to explore the hymn verse by verse and see Jesus' self-emptying example as a model for privileged people to see their advantages not “as something to be exploited” but as something to be laid aside to seek the good of others. Brandan J. Robertson walks readers through a step-by-step process of identifying their privilege, exploring their privilege, and ultimately leveraging their privilege as a tool for the liberation and redemption of the world. Filled to Be Emptied is an essential book for all followers of Christ who are seeking to live lives of justice.",Religion,158,N/A,0,en

Cuttin' Up,Court Carney,University Press of Kansas,2009-11-19,"The emergence of jazz out of New Orleans is part of the American story, but the creation of this music was more than a regional phenomenon: it also crossed geographical, cultural, and technological lines. Court Carney takes a new look at the spread and acceptance of jazz in America, going beyond the familiar accounts of music historians and documentarians to show how jazz paralleled and propelled the broader changes taking place in America's economy, society, politics, and culture. Cuttin' Up takes readers back to the 1920s and early 1930s to describe how jazz musicians navigated the rocky racial terrain of the music business-and how new media like the phonograph, radio, and film accelerated its diffusion and contributed to variations in its styles. The first history of jazz to emphasize the connections between these disseminating technologies and specific locales, it describes the distinctive styles that developed in four cities and tells how the opportunities of each influenced both musicians' choices and the marketing of their music. Carney begins his journey in New Orleans, where pioneers like Jelly Roll Morton and Buddy Bolden set the tone for the new music, then takes readers up the river to Chicago, where Joe Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, featuring a young Louis Armstrong, first put jazz on record. The genre received a major boost in New York through radio's live broadcasts from venues like the Cotton Club, then came to a national audience when Los Angeles put it in the movies, starting with the appearance of Duke Ellington's orchestra in Check and Double Check. As Carney shows, the journey of jazz had its racial component as well, ranging from New Orleans' melting pot to Chicago's segregated music culture, from Harlem clubs catering to white clienteles to Hollywood's reinforcement of stereotypes. And by pinpointing specific cultural turns in the process of bringing jazz to a national audience, he shows how jazz opens a window on the creation of a modernist spirit in America. A 1930 tune called ""Cuttin' Up"" captured the freewheeling spirit of this new music-an expression that also reflects the impact jazz and its diffusion had on the nation as it crossed geographic and social boundaries and integrated an array of styles into an exciting new hybrid. Deftly blending music history, urban history, and race studies, Cuttin' Up recaptures the essence of jazz in its earliest days.",Music,232,N/A,0,en
Can We Trust the Bible on the Historical Jesus?,"Bart D. Ehrman, Craig A. Evans, Robert B. Stewart",Westminster John Knox Press,2020-09-22,"This book features a learned and fascinating debate between two great Bible scholars about the New Testament as a reliable source on the historical Jesus. Bart Ehrman, an agnostic New Testament scholar, debates Craig Evans, an evangelical New Testament scholar, about the historical Jesus and what constitutes ""history."" Their interaction includes such compelling questions as: What are sound methods of historical investigation? What are reliable criteria for determining the authenticity of an ancient text? What roles do reason and inference play? And, of course, interpretation? Readers of this debate—regardless of their interpretive inclinations and biases—are sure to find some confirmation of their existing beliefs, but they will surely also find an honest and well-informed challenge to the way they think about the historical Jesus. The result? A more open, better informed, and questioning mind, which is better prepared for discovering both truth and contrivance. The debate between Ehrman and Evans along with Stewart's introductory framework make this book an excellent primer to the study of the historical Jesus, and readers will come away with a deeper appreciation for the ongoing quest for the historical Jesus.",Religion,114,N/A,0,en

Civil Rights Queen,Tomiko Brown-Nagin,Vintage,2022-01-25,"A TIME BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR • The first major biography of one of our most influential judges—an activist lawyer who became the first Black woman appointed to the federal judiciary—that provides an eye-opening account of the twin struggles for gender equality and civil rights in the 20th Century. • “Timely and essential.""—The Washington Post “A must-read for anyone who dares to believe that equal justice under the law is possible and is in search of a model for how to make it a reality.” —Anita Hill With the US Supreme Court confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson, “it makes sense to revisit the life and work of another Black woman who profoundly shaped the law: Constance Baker Motley” (CNN). Born to an aspirational blue-collar family during the Great Depression, Constance Baker Motley was expected to find herself a good career as a hair dresser. Instead, she became the first black woman to argue a case in front of the Supreme Court, the first of ten she would eventually argue. The only black woman member in the legal team at the NAACP's Inc. Fund at the time, she defended Martin Luther King in Birmingham, helped to argue in Brown vs. The Board of Education, and played a critical role in vanquishing Jim Crow laws throughout the South. She was the first black woman elected to the state Senate in New York, the first woman elected Manhattan Borough President, and the first black woman appointed to the federal judiciary. Civil Rights Queen captures the story of a remarkable American life, a figure who remade law and inspired the imaginations of African Americans across the country. Burnished with an extraordinary wealth of research, award-winning, esteemed Civil Rights and legal historian and dean of the Harvard Radcliffe Institute, Tomiko Brown-Nagin brings Motley to life in these pages. Brown-Nagin compels us to ponder some of our most timeless and urgent questions--how do the historically marginalized access the corridors of power? What is the price of the ticket? How does access to power shape individuals committed to social justice? In Civil Rights Queen, she dramatically fills out the picture of some of the most profound judicial and societal change made in twentieth-century America.",Biography & Autobiography,529,N/A,0,en

HIV Infection and the Cardiovascular System,Giuseppe Barbaro,Karger Medical and Scientific Publishers,2003-01-01,"Past studies revealed that HIV infection may implicate diverse cardiac diseases such as cardiomyopathy, coronary heart disease, cardiac neoplasms, endocarditis or pericarditis. In addition, it was found that highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) often causes - as an adverse effect - a metabolic syndrome characterized by lipodystrophy/lipoatrophy, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, leading to an increase in coronary artery disease and stroke. This book focuses on the most recent findings in HIV-associated heart disease and HAART-associated metabolic and cardiovascular complications. In a first part, the epidemiology, pathogenesis and molecular biology of HIV-associated cardiovascular disease, pulmonary hypertension, lipodystrophy and HAART-associated metabolic syndrome are reviewed. The second part offers clinical and therapeutic insights into HIV/HAART-associated atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, stroke, vasculitic syndromes, and pulmonary hypertension. Besides, cardiovascular complications in HIV-infected children, cardiac surgery in HIV-infected patients, and the prevention and management of HAART-associated cardiovascular complications are points under discussion. Finally, the interaction between HAART and drugs commonly used to treat cardiovascular disease is carefully analyzed. HIV Infection and the Cardiovascular System presents state-of-the-art findings of basic and clinical scientists and is a valuable reference for specialists in cardiology and internal medicine as well as for infectiologists.",Medical,256,N/A,0,en
HIV and Aging,"M. Brennan-Ing, R.F. DeMarco",Karger Medical and Scientific Publishers,2016-11-22,"Despite decades of attention on building a global HIV research and programming agenda, HIV in older populations has generally been neglected until recently. This new book focuses on HIV and aging in the context of ageism with regard to prevention, treatment guidelines, funding, and the engagement of communities and health and social service organizations. The lack of perceived HIV risk in late adulthood among older people themselves, as well on the part of providers and society in general, has led to a lack of investment in education, testing, and programmatic responses. Ageism perpetuates the invisibility of older adults and, in turn, renders current medical and social service systems unprepared to respond to patients’ needs. While ageism may lead to some advantages – discounts for services, for example – it is the negative aspects that must be addressed when determining the appropriate community-level response to the epidemic.",Psychology,256,N/A,0,en

"""Destined to Fail""",Julia Eklund Koza,University of Michigan Press,2021-08-31,"A little-known fact about the prominent US psychologist and educator Carl E. Seashore (1866–1949) is that he was deeply involved in the American eugenics movement. He was among the US academics to support eugenics long before German Nazis embraced it. A titan in a host of disciplines and a proponent of radical education reform, Seashore used his positional power to promote a constellation of education reforms consistent with central precepts of eugenics. Many of these reforms, including tracking, gifted and talented programs, and high-stakes standardized testing, were adopted and remain standard practice in the United States today. He promulgated the idea that musical talent is biologically inheritable, and he developed the first standardized tests of musical talent; these tests were used by early-twentieth-century researchers in their attempts to determine whether there are race differences in musical talent. Seashore’s ideas and work profoundly shaped music education’s research trajectory, as well as enduring “commonsense” beliefs about musical ability. An intersectional analysis, “Destined to Fail” focuses on the relationship between eugenics and Seashore’s views on ability, race, and gender. Koza concludes that Seashore promoted eugenics and its companion, euthenics, because he was a true believer. She also discusses the longstanding silences surrounding Seashore’s participation in eugenics. As a diagnosis and critique of the present, “Destined to Fail” identifies resemblances and connections between past and present that illustrate the continuing influence of eugenics—and the systems of reasoning that made early-twentieth-century eugenics imaginable and seem reasonable—on education discourse and practice today. It maps out discursive, citational, and funding connections between eugenicists of the early twentieth-century and contemporary White supremacists; this mapping leads to some of Donald Trump’s supporters and appointees.",Education,813,N/A,0,en

A Focus on Gender,Sunita Kishor,N/A,2005,"This report presents a collection of six working papers on the dynamics of gender in developing countries. The papers, commissioned by the MEASURE DHS project, were prepared by researchers recognized for their work in the areas of demography, reproductive health, and gender. The analyses presented are based on data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) project. Funding was provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development (US AID). A common theme of several of the papers is the struggle to define women's empowerment and/or autonomy and then to adequately measure it. Five of the working papers in this volume focus on the gender questions in the core DHS questionnaire, particularly the questions on household decision making and women's autonomy and empowerment, and their relationship to different population, health, and nutrition (PHN) outcomes of interest. The last paper examines whether PHN outcomes of interest vary by women's experience of domestic violence. The PHN outcomes studied by the papers include child health, nutrition, mortality, women's nutrition, maternal care and reproductive health, as well as condom use and thetheir risk of sexually transmitted infections and condom uses.",Man-woman relationships,200,N/A,0,en

To Err Is Human,"Institute of Medicine, Committee on Quality of Health Care in America",National Academies Press,2000-03-01,"Experts estimate that as many as 98,000 people die in any given year from medical errors that occur in hospitals. That's more than die from motor vehicle accidents, breast cancer, or AIDSâ€""three causes that receive far more public attention. Indeed, more people die annually from medication errors than from workplace injuries. Add the financial cost to the human tragedy, and medical error easily rises to the top ranks of urgent, widespread public problems. To Err Is Human breaks the silence that has surrounded medical errors and their consequenceâ€""but not by pointing fingers at caring health care professionals who make honest mistakes. After all, to err is human. Instead, this book sets forth a national agendaâ€""with state and local implicationsâ€""for reducing medical errors and improving patient safety through the design of a safer health system. This volume reveals the often startling statistics of medical error and the disparity between the incidence of error and public perception of it, given many patients' expectations that the medical profession always performs perfectly. A careful examination is made of how the surrounding forces of legislation, regulation, and market activity influence the quality of care provided by health care organizations and then looks at their handling of medical mistakes. Using a detailed case study, the book reviews the current understanding of why these mistakes happen. A key theme is that legitimate liability concerns discourage reporting of errorsâ€""which begs the question, ""How can we learn from our mistakes?"" Balancing regulatory versus market-based initiatives and public versus private efforts, the Institute of Medicine presents wide-ranging recommendations for improving patient safety, in the areas of leadership, improved data collection and analysis, and development of effective systems at the level of direct patient care. To Err Is Human asserts that the problem is not bad people in health careâ€""it is that good people are working in bad systems that need to be made safer. Comprehensive and straightforward, this book offers a clear prescription for raising the level of patient safety in American health care. It also explains how patients themselves can influence the quality of care that they receive once they check into the hospital. This book will be vitally important to federal, state, and local health policy makers and regulators, health professional licensing officials, hospital administrators, medical educators and students, health caregivers, health journalists, patient advocatesâ€""as well as patients themselves.

The seven chapters that follow focus on basic foundational subjects: constitutional law, civil procedure, contracts, torts, property, criminal procedure, and criminal law, each in a separate chapter.

All of the chapters contain notes and questions, highlighting important issues for discussion and providing citations to cases, articles, and other materials for more in-depth study. The book is intended for several types of students: First, it is designed for international students who are attending a U.S. law school to pursue an LL.M degree or an S.J.D. degree. This book gives such students the opportunity to take an intensive course on U.S. law, thus enabling them to learn the fundamental concepts before taking upper-division courses. Second, this book is designed for international students who want to learn about U.S. law but who are not planning to attend a U.S. law school. U.S. law professors can teach the course in foreign law schools using this text. Also, foreign professors who have been trained at a U.S. law school can teach U.S. law at their home institutions. Third, the book is designed for an undergraduate pre-law course at a U.S. college or university. Fourth, the book can be used at U.S. schools that train and certify paralegals.

Deo reveals how race and gender intersect to create profound implications for women of color law faculty members, presenting unique challenges as well as opportunities to improve educational and professional outcomes in legal education. Deo shares the powerful stories of law faculty who find themselves confronting intersectional discrimination and implicit bias in the form of silencing, mansplaining, and the presumption of incompetence, to name a few. Through hiring, teaching, colleague interaction, and tenure and promotion, Deo brings the experiences of diverse faculty to life and proposes several mechanisms to increase diversity within legal academia and to improve the experience of all faculty members. Praise for Unequal Profession “Fascinating, shocking, and infuriating, Meera Deo’s careful qualitative research exposes the institutional practices and cultural norms that maintain a separate and unequal race-gender order even within the privileged ranks of tenure-track law professors. With riveting quotes from faculty across a range of institutional and social positions, Unequal Profession powerfully reminds us that we must do better. I saw my own career in this book—and you might, too.” —Angela P. Harris, University of California, Davis “A powerful account of inequality in legal academia. Quantitative data and compelling narratives bring to life the challenges and roadblocks in gaining not just entry and tenure but also respect for the voices of minority women within the academy. There are no easy remedies, but reading this book is a good place to start for lawyers and law professors to understand what minority women face and which practices can increase the odds of success.” —Bryant G. Garth, University of California, Irvine “Unequal Profession should be mandatory reading for everyone in legal academia . . . . By providing concrete evidence of systemic discrimination, Meera Deo illuminates a long-standing problem needing to be remedied.” —Sarah Deer, University of Kansas",Law,287,N/A,0,en

Studies show the majority of Christians don’t even understand the basics of faith. But how do you tackle such a big problem? Replicate shows church leaders how to make disciples who make disciples and get the rest of your church on board as well. This one-on-one relational ministry is how Jesus laid the foundation for His church that is still growing today, and it’s how we continue the work in our own local congregations.

The Handbook of White-Collar Crime,Melissa L. Rorie,John Wiley & Sons,2019-11-12,"A comprehensive and state-of the-art overview from internationally-recognized experts on white-collar crime covering a broad range of topics from many perspectives Law enforcement professionals and criminal justice scholars have debated the most appropriate definition of “white-collar crime” ever since Edwin Sutherland first coined the phrase in his speech to the American Sociological Society in 1939. The conceptual ambiguity surrounding the term has challenged efforts to construct a body of science that meaningfully informs policy and theory. The Handbook of White-Collar Crime is a unique re-framing of traditional discussions that discusses common topics of white-collar crime—who the offenders are, who the victims are, how these crimes are punished, theoretical explanations—while exploring how the choice of one definition over another affects research and scholarship on the subject. Providing a one-volume overview of research on white-collar crime, this book presents diverse perspectives from an international team of both established and newer scholars that review theory, policy, and empirical work on a broad range of topics. Chapters explore the extent and cost of white-collar crimes, individual- as well as organizational- and macro-level theories of crime, law enforcement roles in prevention and intervention, crimes in Africa and South America, the influence of technology and globalization, and more. This important resource: Explores diverse implications for future theory, policy, and research on current and emerging issues in the field Clarifies distinct characteristics of specific types of offences within the general archetype of white-collar crime Includes chapters written by researchers from countries commonly underrepresented in the field Examines the real-world impact of ambiguous definitions of white-collar crime on prevention, investigation, and punishment Offers critical examination of how definitional decisions steer the direction of criminological scholarship Accessible to readers at the undergraduate level, yet equally relevant for experienced practitioners, academics, and researchers, The Handbook of White-Collar Crime is an innovative, substantial contribution to contemporary scholarship in the field.",Social Science,543,N/A,0,en

This manual continues the work begun in their earlier book and provides a full range of tools for conducting effective assessments.

Your Blood Never Lies,James B. LaValle,"Square One Publishers, Inc.",2013-07-02,"​*** OVER 47,000 COPIES SOLD ​*** If you’re like most people, you probably rely on your doctor to interpret the results of your blood tests, which contain a wealth of information on the state of your health. A blood test can tell you how well your kidneys and liver are functioning, your potential for heart disease and diabetes, the strength of your immune system, the chemical profile of your blood, and many other important facts about the state of your health. And yet, most of cannot decipher these results ourselves, nor can we even formulate the right questions to ask about them—that is, until now. In Your Blood Never Lies, best-selling author Dr. James LaValle clears the mystery surrounding blood test results. In simple language, he explains all the information found on a typical lab report—the medical terminology, the numbers and percentages, and the laboratory jargon—and makes it accessible. This means that you will be able to look at your own blood test results and understand the significance of each biological marker being measured. To help you take charge of your health, Dr. LaValle also recommends the most effective standard and complementary treatments for dealing with any problematic findings. Rounding out the book are explanations of lab values that do not appear on the typical blood test, but that should be requested for a more complete picture of your current physiological condition. A blood test can reveal so much about your body, but only if you can interpret the results. Your Blood Never Lies provides the up-to-date information you need to take control of your health.",Health & Fitness,340,1,1,en

AIDS and Accusation,Paul Farmer,Univ of California Press,1992,"In this book ethnographic, historical and epidemiologic data are brought to bear on the subject of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in Haiti. The forces that have helped to determine rates and pattern of spread of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are examined, as are social responses to AIDS in rural and urban Haiti, and in parts of North America. History and its calculus of economic and symbolic power also help to explain why residents of a small village in rural Haiti came to understand AIDS in the manner that they did. Drawing on several years of fieldwork, the evolution of a cultural model of AIDS is traced. In a small village in rural Haiti, it was possible to document first the lack of such a model, and then the elaboration over time of a widely shared representation of AIDS. The experience of three villagers who died of complications of AIDS is examined in detail, and the importance of their suffering to the evolution of a cultural model is demonstrated. Epidemiologic and ethnographic studies are prefaced by a geographically broad historical analysis, which suggests the outlines of relations between a powerful center (the United States) and a peripheral client state (Haiti). These relations constitute an important part of a political-economic network termed the ""West Atlantic system."" The epidemiology of HIV and AIDS in Haiti and elsewhere in the Caribbean is reviewed, and the relation between the degree of involvement in the West Atlantic system and the prevalence of HIV is suggested. It is further suggested that the history of HIV in the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Bahamas is similar to that documented here for Haiti.",Health & Fitness,362,N/A,0,en

It is beautifully written in modern, page-turning prose and complemented with 106 paintings from 35 renowned artists, including 42 originally commissioned works you will see for the first time. The paintings run the gamut of fine art celebrating the life of Christ, both classic and modern. These artists poured their souls into these portraits of higher spiritual reality. Our deep appreciation and humble gratitude go out to each one of them. These paintings illustrate Jesus' life journey from his humble birth and childhood to adolescence and manhood; from private to public ministry and on to his death, resurrection, and ascension. The artwork celebrates his diverse life as son, father-brother, carpenter, boat designer and builder, tutor, translator, caravan conductor, teacher, healer, minister, and friend. No one knows what Jesus looked like, but these artists painted their soulful interpretations to spark our imagination of these scenes from the Master's life. Our intent is to give you a visual communion with Jesus that complements the enthralling narrative. This impeccably designed book provides relevant and empowering spiritual insights, helping you navigate the challenging yet promising conditions of the 21st century. We live in an exciting era of unprecedented improvements in our material lives brought about by scientific, industrial, and social achievements. Yet despite all this progress, many souls feel lonely and displaced. We need God and have an innate thirst for spiritual answers because of that ""still, small voice"" that lives within us. Finding God by living the personal religion of Jesus satisfies that thirst. The search for the genuine Jesus continues to intrigue humanity. Since the Bible only records an estimated 50 days of his life, it follows that there is more to his story. You will find it here in this detailed history of the Master's entire life, including the public ministry recorded in the Gospels. It provides a coherent and seamless biography of this magnificent personality who continues to shape spiritual progress in our world. The story of Jesus is one of the most enthralling chapters in human history. The closing passage of the Apostle John's gospel speaks to a life larger than even the world itself. How fitting that the last words of his gospel should be the first words of this book: ""But there are also many things which Jesus did; were every one of them to be written, I suppose that the world itself would not contain the books that would be written."" In John's day the Word was made flesh. In these days the Word is made book. The Untold Story of Jesus reveals the living Christ to members of the church that bears his name, as well as to worshipers of all world religions. It is sure to become a favorite volume for all who seek God.",Biography & Autobiography,0,N/A,0,en

Choosing Courage,Jim Detert,Harvard Business Press,2021-05-18,"An inspirational, practical, and research-based guide for standing up and speaking out skillfully at work. Have you ever wanted to disagree with your boss? Speak up about your company's lack of diversity or unequal pay practices? Make a tough decision you knew would be unpopular? We all have opportunities to be courageous at work. But since courage requires risk—to our reputations, our social standing, and, in some cases, our jobs—we often fail to act, which leaves us feeling powerless and regretful for not doing what we know is right. There's a better way to handle these crucial moments—and Choosing Courage provides the moral imperative and research-based tactics to help you become more competently courageous at work. Doing for courage what Angela Duckworth has done for grit and Brene Brown for vulnerability, Jim Detert, the world's foremost expert on workplace courage, explains that courage isn't a character trait that only a few possess; it's a virtue developed through practice. And with the right attitude and approach, you can learn to hone it like any other skill and incorporate it into your everyday life. Full of stories of ordinary people who've acted courageously, Choosing Courage will give you a fresh perspective on the power of voicing your authentic ideas and opinions. Whether you’re looking to make a mark, stay true to your values, act with more integrity, or simply grow as a professional, this is the guide you need to achieve greater impact at work.",Business & Economics,227,N/A,0,en

Confronting Injustice without Compromising Truth Study Guide,Thaddeus J. Williams,Zondervan Academic,2022-06-28,"Enacting social justice is essential to the Christian faith. But the Bible's call to seek justice is not a call to superficial activism. True justice requires biblical wisdom and communal discernment. Maybe you're frustrated with a version of Christianity that doesn't seem to take justice seriously. Perhaps you've witnessed the rise of ideologies that brand themselves as 'social justice,' but you have a sense that something is off about them. Maybe you have a hunch that God offers a better way to do justice than what's offered by the snarky memes on our news feeds. In this 14-session, video-based study guide, teacher and lecturer Thaddeus Williams furthers the case he made in his book, taking study groups and individuals deeper into complex question of how to pursue a path of justice without compromising the truth of the gospel. Participants will watch video segments (DVD/streaming video sold separately), hear from a diverse range of experts, interact in group discussions, and answer personal reflection questions to discover what the Bible and the example of Jesus have to teach us about justice. Williams confronts religious and political tribalism and challenges participants to discover a compelling vision of justice for all God's image-bearers that offers hopeful answers to life's biggest questions and a way forward.

The Art of Lamination,Jimmy Griffin,N/A,2020-08-20,"To build a good house, it must first have a solid foundation! The same principles apply when making laminated pastry products. My book The Art of Lamination is built on a solid knowledge of understanding the recipes, methods, processes and ingredients required to make the finest laminated viennoiserie possible. This book is the culmination of seven years of research, in particular, it was my chosen subject during my masters degree studies. As an international competitor, lecturer, businessman and international jury member, I have witnessed the work of exceptional craftsmen and carefully documented procedures and practices. In my business, I was able to try the latest cutting edge techniques and sell beautiful products to my customers. In my role as a lecturer at TU Dublin, I generated much new class content and took note of the most common problems encountered by students in pastry making and also the questions asked by my students. I identified and documented all the stages of production of laminated pastry and engaged in problem solving for students and bakers during my masterclasses in foreign countries. The result is a clearly explained road map, how to plan and execute perfect pastry. I explain some of the basic lamination systems used in industry with a modern twist, and take the reader through a step by step approach on how to become proficient at making laminated viennoiserie. In my capacity as a jury member at the world championships I have witnessed as close to perfection as is possible to make beautiful products. Many of the more advanced products in the book have been inspired directly by my observations over the past 25 years of competitive baking at the cutting edge of creativity. This book will serve as an essential guide for students, bakers, pastry chefs, home bakers and hobbyists. I include detailed process notes for both commercial bakers using mechanical sheeters and home bakers and students, who want to make laminated pastry at home. I have stripped down the procedures of laminated pastry production to the very basics, building on that knowledge and adding more advanced levels throughout the book. I hope my book will both educate and inspire you, the readers now, and in your future baking.",Cooking,190,N/A,0,en

Optimizing Student Learning,"Betty Ziskovsky, Joe Ziskovsky",CRC Press,2019-02-13,"This book is a fictionalized account of how a licensed school teacher developed, implemented, and refined the application of Lean principles and applied them to her classroom instructional practice to complete the delivery of her assigned curriculum while at the same time ensuring her students achieved mastery learning of the material presented. While the first edition focused on instructional process improvement, this second edition expands on that foundation to include application of the Lean principles and strategies to enable students to improve their individual learning processes and thus become more successful learners. This second edition lays out a blueprint for schools and teachers across the USA, and indeed around the world, who are struggling with how to use traditional education techniques to improve student learning outcomes. This elusive goal has been the number one focus of the American education industry and trillions of dollars of investment for the past 50 years. Up until the previous decade, educators refused to look outside their own industry for solutions. But financial challenges have forced them to look outside that box. Many schools and districts are now discovering the benefits of adopting Lean into their business model to achieve greater efficiency with taxpayer dollars on the administrative side. Some larger districts have established Lean offices or departments within their organization. This has helped with budgeting, but the model has not yet been used on a large scale to improve student learning performance – every school/district’s primary mission. This book lays out the blueprint for teachers and administrators to use simple Lean strategies and tools to achieve that elusive goal. The application is no longer theoretical. It has been proven to be effective by those who have used it. Lean principles and strategies, as applied to education through this real-life case study, are explained in easy-to-understand terms, not in manufacturing Lean jargon. Scenarios used are from real life events common to all educators. Examples of forms, tools adapted to the needs of educators, and results are included. The book is written in an easy to understand narrative style. Reviewers of the original version – educators who knew nothing about Lean – stated they could easily understand the concepts presented and implement the model using nothing more than the book as a guide. The book’s presentation eliminates teacher procrastination resulting from having to figure something out and how to apply it to your work yourself when you have no extra time available for that purpose. It also eliminates the need to hire a Lean consultant – a plus for districts strapped for cash but desiring to implement an improvement solution.",Business & Economics,199,N/A,0,en

I Give Up Bible Study Guide,Laura Story,HarperChristian Resources,2019-07-30,"Recording artist and bestselling author Laura Story demonstrates the unexpected joy found when we surrender it all to God and simply give up. It's natural to want to be in control. Most of us can't easily accept the idea of giving up that control. But when your need for peace surpasses your desire to be in command of your life, God—who truly uses all things for our good—demonstrates how much we can trust him. The very act of completely surrendering our will to his can become the one act that will change your life forever. In the I Give Up Bible Study Guide (DVD/digital video sold separately), Laura uses a combination of Bible stories and personal experiences to teach you and your group what true surrender is—and what it's not: Surrender does not come naturally to any of us. Surrender is not acquiescing to an enemy who wants to dominate us. Surrender is not ""My will be done!"" Surrender makes it impossible for you, and the people around you, to stay the same. Though surrender sometimes flies in the face of our instincts, hopes, and dreams, it's never without benefit as God leads us into his peace that surpasses understanding. As Laura found in her own life, a surrendered life includes the surprise of a truly full and satisfying existence where trust is reasonable, reconciliation possible, and relationships can finally heal. Sessions include: What Is Surrender Anyway? God's Character Matters Giving In and Up Being Transformed The Ripple Effect of Surrender Designed for use with the I Give Up Video Study available on DVD or streaming video, sold separately.",Religion,113,N/A,0,en

"No Reserves, No Retreats, No Regrets",Ed Erny,Aneko Press,2015-05-15,"My life story begins with a preacher who, by the leading of the Spirit, refused to end a service until my father, a successful businessman, had given his heart to the Lord. I eventually followed in my father’s footsteps into full-time ministry, but only after overcoming self-doubt and self-consciousness in my ability to share the gospel. God took that doubt away when a young man gave his heart to the Lord after I told him about Jesus. From that moment on, in Taiwan, the Philippines, and other places where I served, I saw the tremendous hand of the Lord at work as I allowed Him to lead and work through me.

Who Am I,Adekemi Adebiyi,Syncterface Media,2011-06,"In a world of constant change and chaos, it is so easy to get caught up in living life. More than ever before we realise that we are defined by the challenges and circumstances we encounter. Many believers find themselves torn between earthly realities and heavenly possibilities, a situation that tends to bring about an identity crisis. But is there actually a way of making these heavenly possibilities earthly realities? Is there a place we can go to find answers to the question, ""Who Am I?"" without building beliefs on an ever changing foundation? Adekemi defines who a believer is by using the word of God, with salvation through Jesus Christ as a foundation. Without this foundation our belief will be meaningless as we would be unstable, being tossed around with all manner of doctrine. As you take in the pages of this book you will receive insight into: - Who God says you are - The promise that makes your identity sure - Practical steps to develop yourself in your new identity - How what you say and think affects who you become - The high calling of God",Religion,168,N/A,0,en

Beyond Brilliance,Lucas Miller,N/A,2016-11-26,"Most books for students give you the same old advice: work hard, take detailed notes, use a planner, yadda yadda. If you're looking for a book like that, ignore this one. Beyond Brilliance shows you a better, faster, and easier way to succeed in school and develop mastery (according to decades of science). Read it and you'll know why certain memories are stickier than others, why self-control is more important than effort, and why snoozing more can mean studying less. The truth is, getting top grades and becoming an effective learner is something anyone can do. You don't need to be naturally ""brilliant""-intelligence is something we can all develop over time. You don't need to pull all-nighters. You don't need to sacrifice your social life. You don't even need to give up the gym.What you really need to do is learn how learning actually works. Then, you can use that skill to get better at anything you like. This book shows you the way. You'll learn why certain myths about learning might be holding you back, the most practical and most efficient tools researchers know about how to absorb material, how to conquer procrastination, and tons more straightforward insights that will inspire and empower you.Unlike vague, scammy self-help books, Beyond Brilliance is helpful. And unlike academic textbooks, it's understandable and to the point. With its short, illustrated chapters and focus on general principles, it's the perfect playbook for any student who's ever dreamed of a better way.

We all have things that are trying to hold us back: guilt from past mistakes, temptations that we can't seem to overcome, or dysfunctions that have been passed down. It's easy to learn to live with these problems and accept them as who we are. We can all find a reason to live like we're at a disadvantage and become negative and bitter-we came down with an illness, somebody walked out of a relationship, our boss overlooked us. But we have to say, ""I'm done making excuses. I'm not going to let the past keep me from moving forward and benefitting from the good things God has in store."" It is time to say, ""It is finished."" In Next Level Thinking, Joel Osteen writes that we weren't created to go through life weighed down by addictions, dysfunction, guilt, or the past. God created us to be free. Joel encourages readers to leave behind the negative mindsets, the scarcity mentality, and the limitations others have put on us, and shows us how to step into new levels of victory, new levels of favor.",Religion,134,N/A,0,en

ACTS,Ralph Robert Gomez,"Covenant Books, Inc.",2022-12-27,"This is a Precept Bible Study on the book of Acts, which means you will be looking at the Bible, one verse at a time to help you understand God's Word so that you can apply it to your daily life. The four Gospels described Jesus's life and ended with His death and resurrection. The book of Acts continues His-story after the resurrection and follows the transition from the Old Covenant into the New Covenant, where the Holy Spirit came to live in the heart of the believer. This is a twelve-week study and is the first of three studies on the book of Acts: Acts: The Birth of the Church (12 weeks) Acts: Paul's Three Missionary Journeys (10 weeks) Acts: Paul's Arrest, Trial and Imprisonment (8 weeks) This study is about God's plan to establish His church by empowering His people with the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, to proclaim the good news of salvation to a fallen world and save people from the gates of hell. God used ordinary people like Peter, James, Stephen, Philip, Barnabas and Paul to be the ""salt of the earth"" and the ""light of the world"" to carry out the great commission. You will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and Samaria, and as far as the remotest part of the earth. (Acts 1:8 NASB) The early church faced strong resistance from the religious and political leaders of the day, as they tried to intimidate the apostles through lies, betrayals, violence and murder. The book of Acts contains some of the Bible's biggest villains attempting to silence God's people. But their bullying did not work. God is bigger than any villain and through the power of the Holy Spirit, many heroes emerged, who overcame their fears and despite great danger, they continued to proclaim the good news. We cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard. (Acts 4:20 NASB) There is even a villain who became a hero after encountering Jesus on the road to Damascus. God changed the heart of Saul of Tarsus and used him to plant churches and evangelize most of the Mediterranean world. If God can forgive a murderer like Saul and use him to write half the New Testament, then God can certainly use you and I for His plan of redemption. This study ends with Barnabas and Paul returning to Jerusalem after spending a year discipling the elders in the church at Antioch. After Paul and Barnabas returned, King Herod beheaded the Apostle James and threw Peter into prison. This signified a shift in the way the apostles were being treated and ushered in a new wave of persecution against the believers. Buckle up and get ready to experience the power of the Holy Spirit working through the lives of some of God's most faithful servants!",Bibles,203,N/A,0,en

A Study Guide to the Facsimiles of the Book of Abraham,Allen J. Fletcher,Cedar Fort,2006-03,"Many readers of the Pearl of Great Price give the facsimiles in the book of Abraham only a cursory glance before turning to something more familiar and understandable. That's because the facsimiles are Egyptian in nature and do not seem relevant in our modern world of gospel enlightenment. So what is their worth? It is self-evident that we have received no useless and unneeded revelations, said Elder Bruce R. McConkie. All that the Lord does has a purpose and serves a need. A Study Guide to the Facsimiles of the Book of Abraham shows the meaning of every character in the facsimiles and helps readers comprehend their great value. As translated by the Prophet Joseph Smith, they bear witness of the gospel as had by Adam, Noah, and other ancient patriarchs. Appealing to translation, inspiration, and likening, author Allen J.

The Red Sea Rules,Robert J. Morgan,Thomas Nelson,2014-05-13,"Bestselling author Robert Morgan offers ten strategies for dealing with hard times and discouragements in order to move from fear to faith—a divine protocol for handling life. Red Sea Rules has been updated with new study questions. Life is hard, especially for Christians. It is certain that we will face difficulties and that God will allow them. But just as certain is the fact that the same God who led us in will lead us out. As The Red Sea Rules makes comfortingly clear, He is in control. Using the Israelites' story in Exodus 14 as an example, Robert Morgan offers ten sound strategies for moving from fear to faith. Just as Moses and the Israelites became trapped between Pharaoh's rushing armies and the uncrossable Red Sea, so are we sometimes overwhelmed by life's problems. In The Red Sea Rules, readers will learn strategies to: Realize that God means for you to be where you are Acknowledge your enemy, but keep your eyes on the Lord Stay calm and confident, and give God time to work View your current crisis as a faith builder for the future The Red Sea Rules reveals that even in the midst of seemingly impossible situations, God promises to make a way for us.

International Relations,Manuela Spindler,Verlag Barbara Budrich,2013-04-10,"The book is written for active learners – those keen on cutting their own path through the complex and at times hardly comprehensible world of THEORY in International Relations. To aid this process as much as possible, this book employs the didactical and methodical concept of integrating teaching and self-study. The criteria for structured learning about IR theory will be derived from an extensive discussion of the questions and problems of philosophy of science (Part 1). Theory of IR refers to the scientific study of IR and covers all of the following subtopics: the role and status of theory in the academic discipline of IR; the understanding of IR as a science and what a """"scientific"""" theory is; the different assumptions upon which theory building in IR is based; the different types of theoretical constructions and models of explanations found at the heart of particular theories; and the different approaches taken on how theory and the practice of international relations are linked to each other. The criteria for the structured learning process will be applied in Part 2 of the book during the presentation of five selected theories of International Relations. The concept is based on """"learning through example"""" – that is, the five theories have been chosen because, when applying the criteria developed in Part 1 of the book, each single theory serves as an example for something deeply important to learn about THEORY of IR more generally.",Political Science,232,N/A,0,en

Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time,Marcus J. Borg,Harper Collins,2009-03-17,"Of the many recent books on the historical Jesus, none has explored what the latest biblical scholarship means for personal faith. Now, in Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time, Marcus Borg addresses the yearnings of those who want a fully contemporary faith that welcomes rather than oppresses our critical intelligence and openness to the best of historical scholarship. Borg shows how a rigorous examination of historical findings can lead to a new faith in Christ, one that is critical and, at the same time, sustaining. ""Believing in Jesus does not mean believing doctrines about him,"" Borg writes. ""Rather, it means to give one's heart, one's self at its deepest level, to . . . the living Lord."" Drawing on his own journey from a naive, unquestioning belief in Christ through collegiate skepticism to a mature and contemporary Christian faith, Borg illustrates how an understanding of the historical Jesus can actually lead to a more authentic Christian life—one not rooted in creeds or dogma, but in a life of spiritual challenge, compassion, and community. In straightforward, accessible prose, Borg looks at the major findings of modern Jesus scholarship from the perspective of faith, bringing alive the many levels of Jesus' character: spirit person, teacher of alternative wisdom, social prophet, and movement founder. He also reexamines the major stories of the Old Testament vital to an authentic understanding of Jesus, showing how an enriched understanding of these stories can uncover new truths and new pathways to faith. For questioning believers, doubters, and reluctant unbelievers alike, Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time frees our understanding of Jesus' life and message from popular misconceptions and outlines the way to a sound and contemporary faith: ""For ultimately, Jesus is not simply a figure of the past, but a figure of the present. Meeting that Jesus—the living one who comes to us even now—will be like meeting Jesus again for the first time.""",Religion,223,N/A,0,en

Handbook of Medical Neuropsychology,"Carol L.

This interaction can be found in both clinical settings and research l- oratories, often between research teams and clinical practitioners. It accounts for the rapidity with which awareness and understanding of the neuropsychological com- nents of many common medical disorders have recently advanced. The introduction of neuropsychology into practice and research involving conditions without obvious neurological components follows older and eminently successful models of integrated care and treatment of the classical brain disorders. In the last 50 years, with the growing understanding of neurological disorders, neuropsychologists and medical specialists in clinics, at bedside, and in laboratories together have contributed to important clinical and scienti c advances in the und- standing of the common pathological conditions of the brain: stroke, trauma, epilepsy, certain movement disorders, tumor, toxic conditions (mostly alcohol-related), and degenerative brain diseases.

Had there been no Bible, there would be no America as we know it. It is the Bible that made America. When George Washington was sworn into office as our first president, he did not place his hand on the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution of the United States, as important as those documents are. Instead, he swore upon and even kissed the Bible to sanctify this important moment. The Bible, Washington knew, had ushered American history to this point. While not every Founding Father was a Christian, each was knowledgeable about the Bible. And while none of them was perfect, many embraced a deep faith in the unfailing Word of God. 100 Bible Verses That Made America contains: Short, devotional-style chapters, each featuring a Bible verse and how it influenced a historical figure Engaging stories spanning from the Mayflower to modern day Vivid segments that emphasize the Bible as the cornerstone of American history Journey with Robert J.

"Study Guide for the Therapeutic Recreation Specialist Certification Examination, 5th Ed. - Book/Flashcards Bundle","NORMA J. FOLKERTH STUMBO (JEAN E.), Jean E. Folkerth",N/A,2019-03-31,"Compare our prices! The purpose of this study guide is to assist candidates in preparing for the NCTRC national certification examination for Certified Therapeutic Recreation Specialists. 850 flashcards (included in the bundle and separately) on the 6 topic areas of the test: Foundational knowledge; Assessment; Documentation; Implementation; Administration of TR; Advancement of the profession. We are excited to tell you that this fifth edition of the Study Guide for the Therapeutic Recreation Specialist Certification Examination has changed significantly from previous editions. This is largely due to two reasons: (a) the National Council for Therapeutic Recreation Certification (NCTRC) has recently updated the Job Analysis, which helps structure the content of the test, and (b) the computerized test has a newer format of a 150-item test. Therefore, we have restructured the Study Guide to align more closely with the most recent NCTRC exam content and format. In addition, weve added over 100 new items for a total of over 850 practice test items! The Study Guide offers over 250 random practice items, plus four practice exams, each with 150 items distributed across the job analysis that mirrors the national exam. In preparing this Study Guide, we had a twofold mission: (a) to provide information that helps candidates reduce test anxiety and maximize test performance and (b) to provide numerous sample questions, similar to those actually found on the exam, that will allow candidates to practice and self-assess their own readiness for the test. For many individuals, the thought of taking a certification examination can be unsettling. We often hear statements such as I have never taken a comprehensive exam. There is so much information. How do I learn it all? This Study Guide will help you to identify areas where you need further study to help you ace your NCTRC certification examination!",,164,N/A,0,en

HIV Infection in the Era of Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatment and Some of Its Associated Complications,Elaheh Aghdassi,BoD – Books on Demand,2011-11-14,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a complex illness affecting the immune system. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is an advanced form of HIV infection in which the patient has developed opportunistic infections or certain types of cancer and/or the CD4+ T cell count has dropped below 200/μL. More than 40 million persons around the world are infected with HIV, with approximately 14,000 new infections every day. The disease causes 3 million deaths worldwide each year, 95% of them in developing countries. Optimal management of human immunodeficiency virus requires strict adherence to highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) regimens, but the complexity of these regimens (e.g., pill burden, food requirements, drug interactions, and severe adverse effects) limits effective treatment. However, more patients with HIV are surviving longer today because of these drugs. This allows further study of commonly associated adverse effects. These may affect all body systems and range from serious toxicities to uncomfortable but manageable events. This book reviews some of HAART-related metabolic and neurological complications.",Medical,226,N/A,0,en

The Pituitary,Shlomo Melmed,Academic Press,2010-12-09,"The pituitary, albeit a small gland, is known as the ""master gland"" of the endocrine system and contributes to a wide spectrum of disorders, diseases, and syndromes. Since the publication of the second edition of The Pituitary, in 2002, there have been major advances in the molecular biology research of pituitary hormone production and action and there is now a better understanding of the pathogenesis of pituitary tumors and clinical syndromes resulting in perturbation of pituitary function. There have also been major advances in the clinical management of pituitary disorders. Medical researchers and practitioners now better understand the morbidity and mortality associated with pituitary hormone hyposecretion and hypersecretion. Newly developed drugs, and improved methods of delivering established drugs, are allowing better medical management of acromegaly and prolactinoma. These developments have improved the worldwide consensus around the definition of a ""cure"" for pituitary disease, especially hormone hypersecretion, and hence will improve the success or lack of success of various forms of therapy. It is therefore time for a new edition of The Pituitary. The third edition will continue to be divided into sections that summarize normal hypothalamic-pituitary development and function, hypothalamic-pituitary failure, and pituitary tumors; additional sections will describe pituitary disease in systemic disorders and diagnostic procedures, including imaging, assessment of the eyes, and biochemical testing. The first chapter will be completely new – placing a much greater emphasis on physiology and pathogenesis. Two new chapters will be added on the Radiation and Non-surgical Management of the Pituitary and Other Pituitary Lesions. Other chapters will be completely updated and many new author teams will be invited. The second edition published in 2002 and there have been incredible changes in both the research and clinical aspects of the pituitary over the past 8 years – from new advances in growth hormones to pituitary tumor therapy. - Presents a comprehensive, translational source of information about the pituitary in one reference work - Pituitary experts (from all areas of research and practice) take readers from the bench research (cellular and molecular mechanism), through genomic and proteomic analysis, all the way to clinical analysis (histopathology and imaging) and new therapeutic approaches - Clear presentation by endocrine researchers of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying pituitary hormones and growth factors as well as new techniques used in detecting lesions (within the organ) and other systemic disorders - Clear presentation by endocrinologists and neuroendocrine surgeons of how imaging, assessment of the eyes, and biochemical testing can lead to new therapeutic approaches",Medical,745,N/A,0,en

Addressing the Sexually Transmitted Infections Epidemic in the United States: A Sociomedical Perspective,"Christopher Williams, Laura Skrip, Darren Whitfield, Keith L. Gray",Frontiers Media SA,2023-12-04,"Rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have significantly increased in the United States. Per-capita estimates reveal approximately 68 million prevalent and 26 million incident STIs nationally. Gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia—the three reportable STIs—reached levels not seen in the last fifty years and this resurgence is concurrent with increasing antimicrobial resistance and a dearth of viable candidates in the vaccine pipeline. A seminal report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, Sexually Transmitted Infections: Adopting a Sexual Health Paradigm, confirms that STIs rank among the most pressing and intractable public health threats. Furthermore, rising rates of STIs exact a substantial societal, medical, and economic burden that strain public health capacity, which has been substantially debilitated in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. STIs can have serious consequences for sexual, reproductive, and overall health. Untreated syphilis, for instance, is directly implicated in neurological, cardiovascular, and dermatological disease. Human papillomavirus is a known cause of cervical cancer and is the most common cancer among women globally. Hepatitis B increases risk for cirrhosis and primary liver cancer. Despite reductions in HIV transmission and improvements in prevention and treatment, infections among women, girls, adolescents, and mother-to-child transmission remain unacceptably high. Marginalized racial/ethnic minorities, LGBTQ persons, vulnerable at-risk adolescents and young adults, and other underrepresented populations are more susceptible to STIs as they negotiate an array of factors that can delay and even preclude access to preventive interventions. The United States spends substantially more on STI prevention and treatment yet it consistently bares a disproportionate burden of sexually transmitted infections compared to other Western industrialized nations. Access to healthcare, erosion and diversion of public health capacity, racism, discrimination, stigma, substandard education, and poverty have all been identified as important contributors to the trajectory of acute sexually transmitted infections. Furthermore, upstream drivers such as national, state, and local public health policies have been associated with population-level STI risk, prevention, and treatment and as such offer opportunities for ecological, observational, and multi-level analyses to assess their direct and indirect impact on sexual health outcomes. In this thematic collection, we aim to present an interdisciplinary collection of high-quality articles centered on the premise that the rise of emerging and re-emerging STIs can be attributed, in part, to a complex interaction of sociomedical factors beyond individual behavioral risk profiles. This Research Topic welcomes a variety of manuscript formats including original research, brief reports, systematic reviews, and perspective manuscripts involving sociomedical factors, social determinants of health, health disparities, infectious disease epidemiology, and other drivers including health policies that act as barriers and facilitators of effective STI prevention and treatment. Manuscripts that examine structural, community, institutional, interpersonal, and broad individual factors linked to STIs are very well suited for this collection. Topic areas include, but are not limited to: • Structural racism, discrimination, and stigma and their influence on prevention, treatment, and support services among vulnerable and marginalized populations; • Housing and income insecurity that impede sexual, reproductive, and overall health; • Biological factors that affect the spread of STIs including their asymptomatic nature and the influence of sex as a biological variable; • Intimate partner violence, harassment, and intimidation; • Substance abuse, sex work, sexual networks, and normative sexual attitudes and beliefs that impede the adoption of preventive health-promoting behaviors; • Priority populations including adolescents, men who have sex with men, youth who are LGBTQ, and the incarcerated; • Impact of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake on STI incidence; • Culturally-specific biopsychosocial, behavioral, and community-based STI interventions to treat and support those afflicted with STIs; • Community mobilization and community-based organization to reduce STIs; • Community-level prevalence of infectious agents; • Local and holistically-integrated STI clinics; • Public health STI workforce capacity; • Health in All Policies (HiAP) approaches to STI prevention and treatment. Christopher Williams is the Senior Vice President and Director of Research at National Health Promotion Associates, a private research and development firm that specializes in the development, testing and dissemination of evidence-based approaches to target behavioral risk factors associated with major chronic diseases, violence, accidents and preventable injuries.

"Money, Sex and Power",Richard Foster,N/A,2009,"No issues touch us more profoundly or universally,' writes Richard Foster. 'No topics cause more controversy. No human realities have greater power to bless or curse. No three things have been more sought after or are more in need of a Christian response.' Money, Sex and Power discerns the biblical principles that enable us to live out a relevant and authentic response to the three greatest temptations of our age. Gerard Kelly writes: 'Foster follows a road few in recent years have travelled, and does so with depth, wit and down-to-earth wisdom. Don't assume for one moment that this book is anti-money, anti-sex or anti-power: the author has a healthy respect and admiration for all three as sacred gifts of a loving creator.

It builds a story about the power of teachers, feedback, and a model of learning and understanding. The research involves many millions of students and represents the largest ever evidence based research into what actually works in schools to improve learning. Areas covered include the influence of the student, home, school, curricula, teacher, and teaching strategies. A model of teaching and learning is developed based on the notion of visible teaching and visible learning. A major message is that what works best for students is similar to what works best for teachers – an attention to setting challenging learning intentions, being clear about what success means, and an attention to learning strategies for developing conceptual understanding about what teachers and students know and understand. Although the current evidence based fad has turned into a debate about test scores, this book is about using evidence to build and defend a model of teaching and learning.

The Republic of Therapy,Vinh-Kim Nguyen,Duke University Press,2010-11-01,"The Republic of Therapy tells the story of the global response to the HIV epidemic from the perspective of community organizers, activists, and people living with HIV in West Africa. Drawing on his experiences as a physician and anthropologist in Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire, Vinh-Kim Nguyen focuses on the period between 1994, when effective antiretroviral treatments for HIV were discovered, and 2000, when the global health community acknowledged a right to treatment, making the drugs more available. During the intervening years, when antiretrovirals were scarce in Africa, triage decisions were made determining who would receive lifesaving treatment. Nguyen explains how those decisions altered social relations in West Africa. In 1994, anxious to “break the silence” and “put a face to the epidemic,” international agencies unwittingly created a market in which stories about being HIV positive could be bartered for access to limited medical resources. Being able to talk about oneself became a matter of life or death. Tracing the cultural and political logic of triage back to colonial classification systems, Nguyen shows how it persists in contemporary attempts to design, fund, and implement mass treatment programs in the developing world. He argues that as an enactment of decisions about who may live, triage constitutes a partial, mobile form of sovereignty: what might be called therapeutic sovereignty.",Social Science,252,5,1,en

A Scrum Book,"Jeff Sutherland, James O.

The ninety-four patterns contained within are elaborated nuggets of insight into Scrumâ€™s building blocks, how they work, and how to use them. They offer novices a roadmap for starting from scratch, yet they help intermediate practitioners fine-tune or fortify their Scrum implementations. Experienced practitioners can use the patterns and supporting explanations to get a better understanding of how the parts of Scrum complement each other to solve common problems in product development. The patterns are written in the well-known Alexandrian form, whose roots in architecture and design have enjoyed broad application in the software world. The form organizes each pattern so you can navigate directly to organizational design tradeoffs or jump to the solution or rationale that makes the solution work. The patterns flow together naturally through the context sections at their beginning and end.

For the Children's Sake,Susan Schaeffer Macaulay,Crossway,2022-06-06,"An Effective, Holistic Guide for Teaching Children in Any Educational Setting Every parent and teacher wants to give his or her children the best education possible. They hope that the teaching they provide is a joyful adventure, a celebration of life, and preparation for living. But sadly, most education today falls short of this goal. For the Children's Sake imagines what education can be based on a Christian understanding of the meaning of life and what it means to be human—a child, a parent, a teacher. The central ideas have been proven over many years and in almost every kind of educational situation, including ideas that author Susan Schaeffer Macaulay and her husband, Ranald, have implemented in their own family and school experience. Includes a foreword by daughter and educator Fiona Fletcher. Simple and Practical: This user-friendly guide helps educators build a stable, enriching, and intellectually stimulating environment for children and also includes a list of additional resources Immersive Teaching: Shows parents and teachers how children's learning experiences can be extended to every aspect of life Proven Methodology: Used in school settings for 14 years, these easily applicable ideas will benefit parents and teachers in homeschooling, public school, or private school",Religion,190,N/A,0,en

HIV/AIDS in South Africa 25 Years On,"Poul Rohleder, Leslie Swartz, Seth C. Kalichman, Leickness Chisamu Simbayi",Springer Science & Business Media,2009-09-01,"Much has happened since the first appearance of AIDS in 1981: it has been identified, studied, and occasionally denied. The virus has shifted host populations and spread globally. Medicine, the social sciences, and world governments have joined forces to combat and prevent the disease. And South Africa has emerged as ground zero for the pandemic. The editors of HIV/AIDS in South Africa 25 Years On present the South African crisis as a template for addressing the myriad issues surrounding the epidemic worldwide, as the book brings together a widely scattered body of literature, analyzes psychosocial and sexual aspects contributing to HIV transmission and prevention, and delves into complex intersections of race, gender, class, and politics. Including largely overlooked populations and issues (e.g., prisoners, persons with disabilities, stigma), as well as challenges shaping future research and policy, the contributors approach their topics with rare depth, meticulous research, carefully drawn conclusions, and profound compassion. Among the topics covered: The relationship between HIV and poverty, starting from the question, ""Which is the determinant and which is the consequence?"" Epidemiology of HIV among women and men: concepts of femininity and masculinity, and gender inequities as they affect HIV risk; gender-specific prevention and intervention strategies. The impact of AIDS on infants and young children: risk and protective factors; care of children by HIV-positive mothers; HIV-infected children. Current prevention and treatment projects, including local-level responses, community-based work, and VCT (voluntary counseling and testing) programs. New directions: promoting circumcision, vaccine trials, ""positive prevention."" South Africa’s history of AIDS denialism. The urgent lessons in this book apply both globally and locally, making HIV/AIDS in South Africa 25 Years On uniquely instructive and useful for professionals working in HIV/AIDS and global public health.",Medical,396,N/A,0,en

The Future of the Internet,Jonathan Zittrain,Penguin UK,2009-05-28,"In The Future of the Internet: And How to Stop It Jonathan Zittrain explores the dangers the internet faces if it fails to balance ever more tightly controlled technologies with the flow of innovation that has generated so much progress in the field of technology. Zittrain argues that today's technological market is dominated by two contrasting business models: the generative and the non-generative. The generative models - the PCs, Windows and Macs of this world - allow third parties to build upon and share through them. The non-generative model is more restricted; appliances such as the xbox, iPod and tomtom might work well, but the only entity that can change the way they operate is the vendor. If we want the internet to survive we need to change. People must wake up to the risk or we could lose everything.",Computers,413,5,1,en

Barron’s Painless books make learning easier while you balance home and school. Titles in Barron's extensive Painless Series cover a wide range of subjects as they are taught on middle school and high school levels. Perfect for supporting state standards, these books are written for students who find the subjects unusually difficult and confusing--or in many cases, just plain boring, and may need a little extra help. Barron's Painless Series authors' main goal is to clear up students' confusion and perk up their interest by emphasizing the intriguing and often exciting ways in which they can put each subject to practical use. Most of these books take a light-hearted approach to their subjects, often employing humor, and always presenting fun-learning exercises that include puzzles, games, and challenging ""Brain Tickler"" problems to solve. This title describes the exciting revolution in our understanding of Earth's processes and changes, focusing on movement of tectonic plates, earthquakes, volcanoes, and much more.",Science,336,N/A,0,en

Girl Waits With Gun,Amy Stewart,HarperCollins,2015-09-01,"NATIONAL BESTSELLER. The first in the Kopps Sisters Novel Series, Girl Waits with Gun is an enthralling novel based on the forgotten true story of one of the nation’s first female deputy sheriffs. Constance Kopp doesn’t quite fit the mold. She towers over most men, has no interest in marriage or domestic affairs, and has been isolated from the world since a family secret sent her and her sisters into hiding fifteen years ago. One day a belligerent and powerful silk factory owner runs down their buggy, and a dispute over damages turns into a war of bricks, bullets, and threats as he unleashes his gang on their family farm. When the sheriff enlists her help in convicting the men, Constance is forced to confront her past and defend her family — and she does it in a way that few women of 1914 would have dared. A New York Times Editors' Choice “A smart, romping adventure, featuring some of the most memorable and powerful female characters I've seen in print for a long time. I loved every page as I followed the Kopp sisters through a too-good-to-be-true (but mostly true!) tale of violence, courage, stubbornness, and resourcefulness.”—Elizabeth Gilbert",Fiction,421,N/A,0,en

National Standards & Grade-Level Outcomes for K-12 Physical Education,SHAPE America - Society of Health and Physical Educators,Human Kinetics,2014-03-13,"Focused on physical literacy and measurable outcomes, empowering physical educators to help students meet the Common Core standards, and coming from a recently renamed but longstanding organization intent on shaping a standard of excellence in physical education, National Standards & Grade-Level Outcomes for K-12 Physical Education is all that and much more. Created by SHAPE America — Society of Health and Physical Educators (formerly AAHPERD) — this text unveils the new National Standards for K-12 Physical Education. The standards and text have been retooled to support students’ holistic development. This is the third iteration of the National Standards for K-12 Physical Education, and this latest version features two prominent changes: •The term physical literacy underpins the standards. It encompasses the three domains of physical education (psychomotor, cognitive, and affective) and considers not only physical competence and knowledge but also attitudes, motivation, and the social and psychological skills needed for participation. • Grade-level outcomes support the national physical education standards. These measurable outcomes are organized by level (elementary, middle, and high school) and by standard. They provide a bridge between the new standards and K-12 physical education curriculum development and make it easy for teachers to assess and track student progress across grades, resulting in physically literate students. In developing the grade-level outcomes, the authors focus on motor skill competency, student engagement and intrinsic motivation, instructional climate, gender differences, lifetime activity approach, and physical activity. All outcomes are written to align with the standards and with the intent of fostering lifelong physical activity. National Standards & Grade-Level Outcomes for K-12 Physical Education presents the standards and outcomes in ways that will help preservice teachers and current practitioners plan curricula, units, lessons, and tasks. The text also • empowers physical educators to help students meet the Common Core standards; • allows teachers to see the new standards and the scope and sequence for outcomes for all grade levels at a glance in a colorful, easy-to-read format; and • provides administrators, parents, and policy makers with a framework for understanding what students should know and be able to do as a result of their physical education instruction. The result is a text that teachers can confidently use in creating and enhancing high-quality programs that prepare students to be physically literate and active their whole lives.",Education,136,N/A,0,en

Constitutional Interpretation,"Sotirios A. Barber, James E. Fleming",Oxford University Press,2007-06-27,"Ronald Dworkin famously argued that fidelity in interpreting the Constitution as written calls for a fusion of constitutional law and moral philosophy. Barber and Fleming take up that call, arguing for a philosophic approach to constitutional interpretation. In doing so, they systematically critique the competing approaches - textualism, consensualism, originalism, structuralism, doctrinalism, minimalism, and pragmatism - that aim and claim to avoid a philosophic approach. Constitutional Interpretation: The Basic Questions illustrates that these approaches cannot avoid philosophic reflection and choice in interpreting the Constitution. Barber and Fleming contend that fidelity in constitutional interpretation requires a fusion of philosophic and other approaches, properly understood. Within such a fusion, interpreters would begin to think of text, consensus, intentions, structures, and doctrines not as alternatives to, but as sites of philosophic reflection about the best understanding of our constitutional commitments. Constitutional Interpretation: The Basic Questions, examines the fundamental inquiries that arise in interpreting constitutional law. In doing so, the authors survey the controversial and intriguing questions that have stirred constitutional debate in the United States for over two centuries, such as: how and for what ends should governmental institutions and powers be arranged; what does the Constitution mean under general circumstances and how should it be interpreted during concrete controversies; and finally how do we decide what our constitution means and who ultimately decides its meaning.",Law,219,N/A,0,en

Macaulay updates the current reader on the book's continued relevance and application, offers a practical perspective to new law students, and places the original edition in its historical context. Simply put, Macaulay writes, this ""is a book that anyone interested in law schools or law should read."" The Quid Pro Books edition of the classic work also includes several unobtrusive annotations, to update the reader on legal terms and cultural references made in the original that may not be clear to today's reader. Moreover, this is a carefully proofread and presented edition, lacking the errors and scanning mistakes of other presses' editions in print.

Absolutely Not Another Reading Test Study Guide,"Cindy Cate, Jeannette E Armstrong",Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2017-08-30,"Reading methods instructors, preservice and practicing teachers must meet the challenges of cultivating a solid understanding of effective literacy practices to get ready to teach in classrooms across the country. If necessary-depending on the state you live in-you must pass the required foundational reading tests and student teacher performance assessments. Policies and mandates come and go, but meeting the challenge of understanding and implementing effective literacy practices never fades. This book is organized into five sections with 14 chapters. Features include more than 70 chapter questions (similar to those found on literacy exams for teacher certification), teacher performance assessment support, a delightful cast of animated characters, graphic organizers at the end of each chapter, and QR code links to a custom website. Section I: Preparing to Teach nurtures the heart and mind of preservice teachers and educators alike. The content commits to a comprehensive view of mindful, responsive, and effective teaching and learning. It provides instructors, preservice and practicing teachers a welcoming place to return, tracking their connections as they explore the other chapters. It celebrates community, conversation, and a commitment to the students we teach. Like starting a garden from scratch or improving the soil of an existing one, we begin with a deeper, more fertile view of literacy, so in turn, all learners thrive. Section II: Literacy-Rich Environment examines how literacy behaviors intertwine and grow through each developmental stage. From the beginning, young children need quality literacy instruction and authentic reading and writing tasks. Whether a student is producing or receiving language, proficiency in the written, oral and visual skills of the language arts is critical. Like the master gardener, the most fertile literacy conditions nourish our students' minds and hearts. Section III: Essential Components is devoted to teaching practices that support knowing how words work and their meanings, fluency, comprehension, and assessment. These essential components are highlighted in their respective chapters; however, they are also dispersed throughout all our chapters. Suggestions are also offered for working with English language learners as well as reluctant and struggling learners. Section IV: Cultivating Knowledge waters the seeds of learning from each chapter to pass reading tests and educational teacher performance assessments. It is vital to share with readers the vision of effective and responsive literacy practices while still recognizing the gravity of initial teacher assessments. The authors share variegated voices, strategies, and tips to successfully answer multiple-choice questions, open response essays, and written commentaries. Section V: Literacy Supplies farms our favorite teaching methods and strategies that instructors use in their methods courses. Know and Grow words in each chapter are presented through a manipulative, engaging vocabulary strategy. This activity is an effective way to learn words in the context before and after reading. The Flashcard Glossary chapter puts a unique twist on learning words, as words are organized into flashcard format. The editors and contributors are a diverse village of concerned literacy experts, educators, preservice teachers, and friends. With determination, they mindfully plow these assessments within responsive literacy practices in preparation to teach and if necessary pass specific assessments that many states have mandated for initial teaching and reading licensure. In doing so, our practices match our beliefs about teaching and learning.",,362,N/A,0,en

HIV and Breastfeeding,Pamela Morrison,Pinter & Martin,2022-02-24,"In the early 1980s it was discovered that HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, could be passed through a mother's milk to her baby. Almost overnight in the industrialised countries, and later in the African countries most ravaged by HIV, breastfeeding became an endangered practice. But in the rush to reduce transmission of HIV, everything we already knew about breastfeeding's life-saving effects was overlooked, with devastating consequences for mothers and babies. In HIV and Breastfeeding: the untold story, former IBCLC Pamela Morrison, an acknowledged authority on HIV and breastfeeding, reveals how women in the world's most poverty-stricken areas were persuaded to abandon breastfeeding as part of a short-sighted and deadly policy that led to an humanitarian disaster.The dilemma that breastfeeding, an act of nurturing which confers food, comfort and love, could be at once life-saving yet lethal, has been called 'the ultimate paradox'. This critical account reveals how vital breastfeeding is, even in the most difficult of circumstances, and examines the lessons that can be learned from the mistakes of the past - which is particularly relevant as we deal with the consequences for mothers and babies of another global pandemic, Covid-19. With detailed information for HIV-positive mothers and their caregivers, and success stories from mothers themselves, this book is essential reading for anyone involved in protecting and supporting breastfeeding, or with a need for evidence-based information about breastfeeding and HIV.",Health & Fitness,419,N/A,0,en

The Little Black Book,"Barbara Kay Bucholtz, Martin A. Frey, Melissa L. Tatum",N/A,2002,"The Little Black Book is designed to fill a gap in law school pedagogy: the skills needed for succeeding in law school competitions. Law schools perpetually struggle with the need to fit an ever-expanding universe of both doctrinal studies and skills development into a finite curriculum. Training in competition skills inevitable gets squeezed and edited down, and sometimes even left on the cutting room floor. Yet students can benefit enormously from these competitions, as they provide a way for students to practice and develop skills that will benefit themselves and their clients once they enter the workforce. Part I of this manual is designed to guide the user in applying the analytical, writing, and research skills students learned (or are learning) in the first-year courses to the task of preparing an appellate brief. The manual does presuppose some background in legal analysis and persuasive argument. Part I also instructs students on developing and presenting an oral argument based on their briefs. Part II focuses on non-brief writing competitions, specifically the Client Counseling, Negotiation, and Mediation Competitions. Bucholtz, Frey, and Tatum have created a book that is easily adapted to a broad spectrum of instruction: individual, self-teaching, coach-student training, and classroom teaching. ""At last, there is a guide for the uninitiated who need a concise guide on how to conduct themselves at law school competitions... This compact guide to student competitions should be required reading for coaches as well as student competitors."" -- Bimonthly Review of Law Books, January/February 2003",Law,148,N/A,0,en

The Zen of Passing the Bar Exam,Chad Noreuil,N/A,2011,"Zen is a way of life--and so is studying for the bar exam. The Zen of Passing the Bar Exam offers a comprehensive approach to studying for (and passing) the bar exam, drawing a parallel between how one should approach the bar exam, and how Zen principles teach one to approach life. Each section of the book offers a Zen quote to introduce concepts that can be applied to studying for the bar exam in order to maximize your chances of passing. Zen teaches that in order to reach enlightenment, one must strive to be balanced, know your true self, know your universe, and stay focused on your path. Similarly, in order to reach the ""enlightenment"" of passing the bar exam, one must have the attributes of balance (between studying and other aspects of life, as well as balancing your study time between subjects, and between essays, MBE questions, etc.), knowing your true self (what type of essay writer you are, what type of learner you are, what type of exam taker you are, etc.), knowing your universe (knowing the law, how the questions are constructed, what to look for, etc.), and staying focused on your path (when to study, what to do when you are stressed/panicked, what to do when you don't know a subject very well, etc.). In addition to offering a comprehensive approach to studying for the bar exam, the book also offers specific, practical advice for doing well on both the essay and MBE portions of the bar exam. The book outlines specific organizational/formatting tips for how to write effective (and efficient) essays under bar exam time constraints. The book is ideal for adoption for any law school bar preparation course (or Academic Support Program), providing many exercises, examples, and model answers applicable to any state's bar exam.",Bar examinations,0,N/A,0,en

The Killing of Uncle Sam,"Rodney Howard-Browne, Paul L.

But how did this happen on American soil? How did the downfall begin and who were the predators that the ""land of the free and home of the brave"" fell victim to? And is all hope lost? This book captures details of the last 200 years of American history that mainstream media does not want you to know. It dissects the ""legalized"" system of the private central banks that has gone unchecked, and delivers gut-wrenching truths about the real domestic and foreign enemies of the United States. With over 1000 footnotes and quotes from former presidents, prime ministers, and state officials, it will equip you with the facts that the elites have covered up for centuries and empower you to stand up for the truth""--Dust jacket.",History,496,5,13,en

Morgan, Andrew Carnegie, Andrew Mellon, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Paul Warburg, Mortimer I. Schiff, Otto Kahn, and John D. Rockefeller. Although the Pilgrim Society and the powerful men involved are often praised for their philanthropic actions, Howard-Browne and Williams show that the Society was self-serving and subjected the American people to a brutal system of economic tyranny, one which is still in place today. As a sequel to The Killing of Uncle Sam, Killing the Planet is a thoroughly documented and impeccably researched book, with over 1,500 footnotes. It shows how mankind has become enslaved within the Luciferian world system that is managed and controlled by the world's wealthiest families.

Moving Politics,Deborah B. Gould,University of Chicago Press,2009-12-15,"In the late 1980s, after a decade spent engaged in more routine interest-group politics, thousands of lesbians and gay men responded to the AIDS crisis by defiantly and dramatically taking to the streets. But by the early 1990s, the organization they founded, ACT UP, was no more—even as the AIDS epidemic raged on. Weaving together interviews with activists, extensive research, and reflections on the author’s time as a member of the organization, Moving Politics is the first book to chronicle the rise and fall of ACT UP, highlighting a key factor in its trajectory: emotion. Surprisingly overlooked by many scholars of social movements, emotion, Gould argues, plays a fundamental role in political activism. From anger to hope, pride to shame, and solidarity to despair, feelings played a significant part in ACT UP’s provocative style of protest, which included raucous demonstrations, die-ins, and other kinds of street theater. Detailing the movement’s public triumphs and private setbacks, Moving Politics is the definitive account of ACT UP’s origin, development, and decline as well as a searching look at the role of emotion in contentious politics.",Social Science,537,N/A,0,en

Section 1 provides 380 practice questions organized by the seven parts of the 2015 Body of Knowledge (BOK). Section 2 gives the reader 205 additional practice questions from each of the seven parts, in a randomized order. For every question in both sections, detailed solutions are provided that explain why each answer is the correct one and also which section of the BOK the question corresponds to so that any further study needed can be focused on specific sections. A secondary audience is those taking exams for ASQ certifications whose BOKs’ have some crossover with the CQE. Namely, the Certified Six Sigma Black Belt (CSSBB), Certified Six Sigma Green Belt (CSSGB), Certified Reliability Engineer (CRE), and Certified Quality Inspector (CQI). Using this guide in studying for any of these exams would be extremely useful, particularly for the statistics portions of the BOKs. Unlike other resources on the market, all these questions and solutions were developed specifically to address the 2015 CQE Body of Knowledge and help those studying for it, including taking into account the proper depth of knowledge and required levels of cognition. None of this material has appeared in any previous resource or been shoehorned into fitting under the BOK’s topics. NOTE: Practice/sample test questions such as those in this study guide cannot be taken into ASQ certification exam rooms.",Technology & Engineering,360,N/A,0,en

Learning Outside the Box,Leah M. Christensen,N/A,2011,"More law students than ever before come to law school having been diagnosed with a learning disability. The purpose of this book is to provide research-based learning strategies for law students who learn differently. If you are a student who has been diagnosed with a learning disability or if you simply have a unique learning style, you may need to outline differently, read cases differently, and approach law school in a more active, engaged, and efficient manner. This book offers learning strategies grounded in empirical research to help law students who learn differently maximize their academic success. ""Learning Outside the Box provides a concise map to the tricky terrain of law school success while simultaneously offering practical and emotional support to readers with nontraditional learning styles. The book will benefit both prospective law students and those current students who see a 'mismatch between how law professors teach . . . and the way in which [the students] learn' (p.19). These readers may find it most useful simply to skim the text initially and then reread pertinent sections later as the content becomes applicable to their studies. In addition to students, law school faculty members, administrators, and staff responsible for counseling law students should also become familiar with this text.

Few, if any, published books have dealt in a comprehensive way with public health aspects of these two strongly interrelated areas of health.

The volume covers topics in depth that other books in the field may not cover at all, such as the use of herbal and nutritional therapies for medical-psychiatric symptoms and syndromes, and the choice of questionnaires to supplement history-taking. It looks at old topics in a new way: The chapter on the physical examination applies psychometric considerations to the Babinski sign, describes the method and application of quantitative bedside olfactory testing, and discusses smartphone apps to improve the sensitivity of the examination. Psychiatric Care of the Medical Patient, 3rd Edition provides concepts and information to facilitate the dialogue between psychiatrists and general medical specialists - minimizing psychiatric jargon and speaking in the common language of caring and curious physicians.",Medical,1813,N/A,0,en

Terrified that her vision might never return, Tessa feels like she has nothing left to be happy about. But when her grandparents place an ad in the local newspaper looking for a typist to help Tessa continue writing and blogging, an unlikely answer knocks at their door: Weston Ludovico, a boy her age with bright eyes, an optimistic smile...and no legs. Knowing how angry and afraid Tessa is feeling, Weston thinks he can help her. But he has one condition -- no one can tell Tessa about his disability. And because she can't see him, she treats him with contempt: screaming at him to get out of her house and never come back. But for Weston, it's the most amazing feeling: to be treated like a normal person, not just a sob story. So he comes back. Again and again and again. Tessa spurns Weston's ""obnoxious optimism"", convinced that he has no idea what she's going through. But Weston knows exactly how she feels and reaches into her darkness to show her that there is more than one way to experience the world. As Tessa grows closer to Weston, she finds it harder and harder to imagine life without him -- and Weston can't imagine life without her. But he still hasn't told her the truth, and when Tessa's sight returns he'll have to make the hardest decision of his life: vanish from Tessa's world...or overcome his fear of being seen. 100 Days of Sunlight is a poignant and heartfelt novel by author Abbie Emmons.

Aesthetics Exposed,Terri Wojak,N/A,2014-05-23,"Do you own a skin care business or are you an esthetician wishing for new opportunities? Discover the business, treatments and skills needed to work in a medical setting.Estheticians have an increased value to the medical profession now more than ever. The role of the esthetician in a clinical setting be it surgical consultation, medi-spa, or general practice office is a fast-growing one. Pre- and post-operative care is oftentimes a secondary concern, despite the fact that it is absolutely crucial to the overall health and well-being of the patient/client and a requisite regimen toward realizing the results desired or promised from the medical procedure. Demand continues to grow for non-surgical services including chemical peels and microdermabrasion. In addition, physicians are offering cosmetic treatments, pre-and post-surgical treatments, and skin care products. For the esthetician and medical professional alike, this book emphasizes a working philosophy that esthetic treatment should benefit the mental and emotional well-being of the patient/client, along with healing the body. In eight well-organized sections comprising 32 chapters, Wojak discusses topics that include: The Science of Beauty Regulatory Implications to Treatment and Proper Documentation Procedures Common Skin Conditions, including but not limited to Acne, Rosacea, and Age-compromised Skin LED and IPL Therapy Understanding Ingredients and Products in Order to Make Proper Recommendations and Applications Ultrasound Microneedling and Microcurrent Advanced Esthetic Treatments, such as Dermaplaning and Chemical and Oxygen Treatments Techniques for Building Your Esthetic Business and Client Roster And more...",,0,N/A,0,en

After the Wrath of God,Anthony M. Petro,Oxford University Press,2015-06-01,"On a cold February morning in 1987, amidst freezing rain and driving winds, a group of protesters stood outside of the Unitarian Universalist Church in Amherst, Massachusetts. The target of their protest was the minister inside, who was handing out condoms to his congregation while delivering a sermon about AIDS, dramatizing the need for the church to confront the seemingly ever-expanding crisis. The minister's words and actions were met with a standing ovation from the overflowing audience, but he could not linger to enjoy their applause. Having received threats in advance of the service, he dashed out of the sanctuary immediately upon finishing his sermon. Such was the climate for religious AIDS activism in the 1980s. In After the Wrath of God, Anthony Petro vividly narrates the religious history of AIDS in America. Delving into the culture wars over sex, morality, and the future of the American nation, he demonstrates how religious leaders and AIDS activists have shaped debates over sexual morality and public health from the 1980s to the present day. While most attention to religion and AIDS foregrounds the role of the Religious Right, Petro takes a much broader view, encompassing the range of mainline Protestant, evangelical, and Catholic groups--alongside AIDS activist organizations--that shaped public discussions of AIDS prevention and care in the U.S. Petro analyzes how the AIDS crisis prompted American Christians across denominations and political persuasions to speak publicly about sexuality--especially homosexuality--and to foster a moral discourse on sex that spoke not only to personal concerns but to anxieties about the health of the nation. He reveals how the epidemic increased efforts to advance a moral agenda regarding the health benefits of abstinence and monogamy, a legacy glimpsed as much in the traction gained by abstinence education campaigns as in the more recent cultural purchase of gay marriage. The first book to detail the history of religion and the AIDS epidemic in the U.S., After the Wrath of God is essential reading for anyone concerned with the intersection of religion and public health.",Religion,307,N/A,0,en

Patient Treatment Adherence,"Hayden B. Bosworth, Eugene Z.

It provides a comprehensive source on the conceptualization, interventions, and measurement of treatment adherence and a synthesis of the research across demographic and chronic diseases. The text presents problems associated with treatment adherence; theoretical models that have commonly been used to understand, predict, and/or improve adherence; adherence with specific behaviors including exercise, diet, rehabilitation, medication, and psychological therapies; and strategies in enhancing adherence. Because chronic diseases involve similar behaviors, the handbook is organized by specific behaviors and special populations, and not by disease. Every chapter is sub-organized by specific diseases to ensure easy access for the readers and features a discussion of adherence across demographic and chronic conditions, a review of previous interventions directed at the particular behavior or population, questions and scoring algorithms for widely used measures of treatment adherence, a discussion of the clinical research, and where appropriate, policy implications. Patient Treatment Adherence addresses: practical recommendations to improve adherence; the impact of non-adherence including costs and health-related quality of life; methodological issues such as assessing cost-effectiveness; and the use of technological advances to improve adherence. Intended for health service professionals, health, clinical, social, and cognitive psychologists, primary care physicians, pharmacists, and policy-makers, this text is also an excellent resource for graduate courses on health psychology and public health.",Medical,697,N/A,0,en

The Men We Need,Brant Hansen,Baker Books,2022-03-29,"The world needs real men, real bad. And there are all sorts of conflicting ideas and messages about what a ""real man"" is (and is not). Is a real man one who hunts, loves sports, grills meat, fixes cars, and climbs mountains? Sure, sometimes. But that's not really the point of being a man and it's not the purpose for which men were made. Into our cultural confusion, Brant Hansen paints a refreshingly specific, compelling picture of what men are made to be: ""Keepers of the Garden."" Protectors and defenders. He calls for men of all interests and backgrounds (including ""avid indoorsmen"" like himself) to be ambitious about the right things and to see themselves as defenders of the vulnerable, with whatever resources they have. Using short chapters loaded with must-have wisdom and Brant's signature humor, The Men We Need explains the essence of masculinity in a fresh, thoughtful, and entertaining way that will inspire any man who dares to read it.",Religion,248,N/A,0,en
Faith's Checkbook (Sea Harp Timeless series),Charles H. Spurgeon,Destiny Image Publishers,2022-09-20,"Throughout Scripture, God promises the impossible to those who believe. For many Christians, the promises of God have lost their power. Deemed as irrelevant or simply misunderstood, God's promises—of triumph, abundance, redemption, and countless blessings—are often ignored, forgotten, and seemingly unfulfilled. However, for Charles H. Spurgeon, God’s promises were timeless. In fact, they seemed to grow in power and hope over the course of his life. In Faith’s Checkbook, Spurgeon shares his personal experience testing and proving Scripture’s promises and his ongoing discovery of a relentlessly good, kind and faithful God. He urges believers to treat God’s promises as they would a check—to receive them, endorse them and actively ""cash them in."" Charles Spurgeon (1834-1892), renowned 19th century Baptist preacher, is best known for his 1866 publication Morning and Evening. Over 20 years later, Spurgeon wrote Faith’s Checkbook, a yearlong devotional that inspires believers to see and experience God’s goodness. Written near the end of his life, in the depths of a season marked by incredible loneliness, spiritual controversies and health complications, Faith’s Checkbook is full of honest, heartfelt and mature hope. Spurgeon’s breathtaking sincerity and provoking thoughts will encourage believers to: Study and engage God’s promises throughout Scripture Expect these promises to be fulfilled in their daily life Participate by receiving God’s promises and praying for their fulfillment Glimpse God’s boundless goodness and faithfulness Discover a renewed, child-like trust in Him In Faith’s Checkbook, the reader will encounter God’s outstretched hand—through promises of provision, wisdom, fruitfulness, presence and much more—and be invited to respond with hopeful anticipation.",Religion,394,N/A,0,en

Visual Complex Functions,Elias Wegert,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-08-30,"This book provides a systematic introduction to functions of one complex variable. Its novel feature is the consistent use of special color representations – so-called phase portraits – which visualize functions as images on their domains. Reading Visual Complex Functions requires no prerequisites except some basic knowledge of real calculus and plane geometry. The text is self-contained and covers all the main topics usually treated in a first course on complex analysis. With separate chapters on various construction principles, conformal mappings and Riemann surfaces it goes somewhat beyond a standard programme and leads the reader to more advanced themes. In a second storyline, running parallel to the course outlined above, one learns how properties of complex functions are reflected in and can be read off from phase portraits. The book contains more than 200 of these pictorial representations which endow individual faces to analytic functions. Phase portraits enhance the intuitive understanding of concepts in complex analysis and are expected to be useful tools for anybody working with special functions – even experienced researchers may be inspired by the pictures to new and challenging questions. Visual Complex Functions may also serve as a companion to other texts or as a reference work for advanced readers who wish to know more about phase portraits.",Mathematics,374,N/A,0,en

How to College,"Andrea Malkin Brenner, Lara Hope Schwartz",St. Martin's Griffin,2019-04-23,"The first practical guide of its kind that helps students transition smoothly from high school to college The transition from high school—and home—to college can be stressful. Students and parents often arrive on campus unprepared for what college is really like. Academic standards and expectations are different from high school; families aren’t present to serve as “scaffolding” for students; and first-years have to do what they call “adulting.” Nothing in the college admissions process prepares students for these new realities. As a result, first-year college students report higher stress, more mental health issues, and lower completion rates than in the past. In fact, up to one third of first-year college students will not return for their second year—and colleges are reporting an increase in underprepared first-year students. How to College is here to help. Professors Andrea Malkin Brenner and Lara Schwartz guide first-year students and their families through the transition process, during the summer after high school graduation and throughout the school year, preparing students to succeed and thrive as they transition and adapt to college.

Patient Zero and the Making of the AIDS Epidemic,Richard A. McKay,University of Chicago Press,2017-11-22,"Now an award-winning documentary feature film The search for a “patient zero”—popularly understood to be the first person infected in an epidemic—has been key to media coverage of major infectious disease outbreaks for more than three decades. Yet the term itself did not exist before the emergence of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1980s. How did this idea so swiftly come to exert such a strong grip on the scientific, media, and popular consciousness? In Patient Zero, Richard A. McKay interprets a wealth of archival sources and interviews to demonstrate how this seemingly new concept drew upon centuries-old ideas—and fears—about contagion and social disorder. McKay presents a carefully documented and sensitively written account of the life of Gaétan Dugas, a gay man whose skin cancer diagnosis in 1980 took on very different meanings as the HIV/AIDS epidemic developed—and who received widespread posthumous infamy when he was incorrectly identified as patient zero of the North American outbreak. McKay shows how investigators from the US Centers for Disease Control inadvertently created the term amid their early research into the emerging health crisis; how an ambitious journalist dramatically amplified the idea in his determination to reframe national debates about AIDS; and how many individuals grappled with the notion of patient zero—adopting, challenging and redirecting its powerful meanings—as they tried to make sense of and respond to the first fifteen years of an unfolding epidemic. With important insights for our interconnected age, Patient Zero untangles the complex process by which individuals and groups create meaning and allocate blame when faced with new disease threats. What McKay gives us here is myth-smashing revisionist history at its best.",History,447,N/A,0,en

Hashtag Islam,Gary R. Bunt,UNC Press Books,2018-09-25,"Gary R. Bunt is a twenty-year pioneer in the study of cyber-Islamic environments (CIEs). In his new book, Bunt explores the diverse and surprising ways digital technology is shaping how Muslims across vast territories relate to religious authorities in fulfilling spiritual, mystical, and legalistic agendas. From social networks to websites, essential elements of religious practices and authority now have representation online. Muslims, embracing the immediacy and general accessibility of the internet, are increasingly turning to cyberspace for advice and answers to important religious questions. Online environments often challenge traditional models of authority, however. One result is the rise of digitally literate religious scholars and authorities whose influence and impact go beyond traditional boundaries of imams, mullahs, and shaikhs. Bunt shows how online rhetoric and social media are being used to articulate religious faith by many different kinds of Muslim organizations and individuals, from Muslim comedians and women’s rights advocates to jihad-oriented groups, such as the “Islamic State” and al-Qaeda, which now clearly rely on strategic digital media policies to augment and justify their authority and draw recruits. This book makes clear that understanding CIEs is crucial for the holistic interpretation of authority in contemporary Islam.",Religion,233,5,1,en

Far North,Will Hobbs,Harper Collins,2009-10-13,"From the window of the small floatplane, fifteen-year-old Gabe Rogers is getting his first look at Canada's magnificent Northwest Territories with Raymond Providence, his roommate from boarding school. Below is the spectacular Nahanni River -- wall-to-wall whitewater racing between sheer cliffs and plunging over Virginia Falls. The pilot sets the plane down on the lake-like surface of the upper river for a closer look at the thundering falls. Suddenly the engine quits. The only sound is a dull roar downstream, as the Cessna drifts helplessly toward the falls . . . With the brutal subarctic winter fast approaching, Gabe and Raymond soon find themselves stranded in Deadmen Valley. Trapped in a frozen world of moose, wolves, and bears, two boys from vastly different cultures come to depend on each other for their very survival.",Juvenile Fiction,234,4,7,en

Smoothing Spline ANOVA Models,Chong Gu,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-01-26,"Nonparametric function estimation with stochastic data, otherwise known as smoothing, has been studied by several generations of statisticians. Assisted by the ample computing power in today's servers, desktops, and laptops, smoothing methods have been finding their ways into everyday data analysis by practitioners. While scores of methods have proved successful for univariate smoothing, ones practical in multivariate settings number far less. Smoothing spline ANOVA models are a versatile family of smoothing methods derived through roughness penalties, that are suitable for both univariate and multivariate problems. In this book, the author presents a treatise on penalty smoothing under a unified framework. Methods are developed for (i) regression with Gaussian and non-Gaussian responses as well as with censored lifetime data; (ii) density and conditional density estimation under a variety of sampling schemes; and (iii) hazard rate estimation with censored life time data and covariates. The unifying themes are the general penalized likelihood method and the construction of multivariate models with built-in ANOVA decompositions. Extensive discussions are devoted to model construction, smoothing parameter selection, computation, and asymptotic convergence. Most of the computational and data analytical tools discussed in the book are implemented in R, an open-source platform for statistical computing and graphics. Suites of functions are embodied in the R package gss, and are illustrated throughout the book using simulated and real data examples. This monograph will be useful as a reference work for researchers in theoretical and applied statistics as well as for those in other related disciplines. It can also be used as a text for graduate level courses on the subject. Most of the materials are accessible to a second year graduate student with a good training in calculus and linear algebra and working knowledge in basic statistical inferences such as linear models and maximum likelihood estimates.",Mathematics,446,N/A,0,en

North and South,Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell,N/A,1855,"When her father leaves the Church in a crisis of conscience, Margaret Hale is uprooted from her comfortable home in Hampshire to move with her family to the north of England. Initially repulsed by the ugliness of her new surroundings in the industrial town of Milton, Margaret becomes aware of the poverty and suffering of the local mill workers and develops a passionate sense of social justice. This is intensified by her tempestuous relationship with the mill-owner and self-made man, John Thornton, as their fierce opposition over his treatment of his employees masks a deeper attraction. In North and South, Elizabeth Gaskell skillfully fuses individual feeling with social concern, and in Margaret Hale creates one of the most original heroines of Victorian literature.",Fiction,440,5,1,en

The New Public Health and STD/HIV Prevention,"Sevgi O. Aral, Kevin A. Fenton, Judith A. Lipshutz",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-09,"Despite effective approaches to prevention, STD and HIV infection rates remain fairly constant. Targeting, implementation, and monitoring of interventions have posed widespread problems, and the recent spate of cuts to prevention budgets has made these roadblocks even more challenging. It is clear that working in sexual health requires both a deeper understanding of STI/HIV epidemiology and an ongoing quest for up-to-date, realistic prevention strategies. The New Public Health and STD/HIV Prevention offers readers leading-edge access to both. Focusing on social determinants of sexual health, at-risk populations, critical factors in approaches to prevention, and reviews of new research, this authoritative volume explores areas as varied as HPV prevention, technology-based interventions, migration as a factor in disease transmission, and competencies key to effective leadership in the field. Dispatches from the frontlines of theory, research, and practice in the U.S. and abroad include: Personal risk, public impact: balancing individual rights and STD/HIV prevention. Distribution of prevention resources and its impact on sexual health. Prevention measures in diverse populations of women. Toward a better approach to preventive interventions with men who have sex with men. Adolescent sexual health and STIs. Reducing disparities in sexual health: lessons from the campaign to eliminate infectious syphilis. Public health professionals of all backgrounds interested in or working in improving sexual health will find The New Public Health and STD/HIV Prevention an indispensable guide to conceptualizing the problems and clarifying possible solutions.",Medical,440,N/A,0,en

Pediatric Hematology-Oncology in Countries with Limited Resources,"Daniela Cristina Stefan, Carlos Rodriguez-Galindo",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-11-18,"Typically, manuals of pediatric hematology-oncology are written by specialists from high-income countries, and usually target an audience with a sub-specialist level of training, often assisted by cutting-edge diagnostic and treatment facilities. However, approximately 80% of new cases of cancer in children appear in mid- and low-income countries. Almost invariably, general practitioners or general pediatricians without special training in oncology will look after children with malignancies who enter the health care system in these countries. The diagnostic facilities are usually limited, as are the treatment options. The survival figures in these conditions are somewhere below 20%, while in high-income countries they are in the range of 80% for many childhood cancers. Pediatric Hematology-Oncology in Countries with Limited Resources is the only book of its kind to provide specific guidance applicable to limited resource settings and builds up from the foundation of general practitioner or general pediatrician competence. Written and edited by leaders in the field, this manual educates physicians on the essential components of the discipline, filtered through the experience of specialists from developing countries, with immediate applicability in the specific healthcare environment in these countries.​",Medical,418,N/A,0,en

How to College,"Andrea Malkin Brenner, Lara Hope Schwartz",St. Martin's Griffin,2019-04-23,"The first practical guide of its kind that helps students transition smoothly from high school to college The transition from high school—and home—to college can be stressful. Students and parents often arrive on campus unprepared for what college is really like. Academic standards and expectations are different from high school; families aren’t present to serve as “scaffolding” for students; and first-years have to do what they call “adulting.” Nothing in the college admissions process prepares students for these new realities. As a result, first-year college students report higher stress, more mental health issues, and lower completion rates than in the past. In fact, up to one third of first-year college students will not return for their second year—and colleges are reporting an increase in underprepared first-year students. How to College is here to help. Professors Andrea Malkin Brenner and Lara Schwartz guide first-year students and their families through the transition process, during the summer after high school graduation and throughout the school year, preparing students to succeed and thrive as they transition and adapt to college.

Nclex-RN Practice Questions: NCLEX Practice Tests & Exam Review for the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses,Exam Secrets Test Prep Staff Nclex,N/A,2018-04-12,"NCLEX-RN Practice Questions are the simplest way to prepare for the NCLEX-RN test. Practice is an essential part of preparing for a test and improving a test taker's chance of success. The best way to practice taking a test is by going through lots of practice test questions. If someone has never taken a practice test, then they are unprepared for the types of questions and answer choices that they will encounter on the official test. There is a tremendous advantage to someone taking the test that is already familiar with the questions and answer choices. Another advantage of taking practice tests is that you can assess your performance and see if you need to study and practice more, or if you're already prepared enough to achieve success on your test day. If you do well on the practice test, then you know you're prepared. If you struggle on the practice test, then you know you may still have more work to do to get prepared. Taking lots of practice tests helps ensure that you are not surprised or disappointed on your test day. Our NCLEX-RN Practice Questions give you the opportunity to test your knowledge on a set of questions. You can know everything that is going to be covered on the test and it will not do you any good on test day if you have not had a chance to practice. Repetition is a key to success and using practice test questions allows you to reinforce your strengths and improve your weaknesses. Detailed answer explanations are also included for each question. It may sound obvious, but you have to know which questions you missed (and more importantly why you missed them) to be able to avoid making the same mistakes again when you take the real test. That's why our NCLEX-RN Practice Questions include answer keys with detailed answer explanations. These in-depth answer explanations will allow you to better understand any questions that were difficult for you or that you needed more help to understand.",Medical,0,N/A,0,en

Ultralearning,Scott H. Young,HarperCollins,2019-08-06,"Now a Wall Street Journal bestseller. Learn a new talent, stay relevant, reinvent yourself, and adapt to whatever the workplace throws your way. Ultralearning offers nine principles to master hard skills quickly. This is the essential guide to future-proof your career and maximize your competitive advantage through self-education. In these tumultuous times of economic and technological change, staying ahead depends on continual self-education—a lifelong mastery of fresh ideas, subjects, and skills. If you want to accomplish more and stand apart from everyone else, you need to become an ultralearner. The challenge of learning new skills is that you think you already know how best to learn, as you did as a student, so you rerun old routines and old ways of solving problems. To counter that, Ultralearning offers powerful strategies to break you out of those mental ruts and introduces new training methods to help you push through to higher levels of retention. Scott H. Young incorporates the latest research about the most effective learning methods and the stories of other ultralearners like himself—among them Benjamin Franklin, chess grandmaster Judit Polgár, and Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynman, as well as a host of others, such as little-known modern polymath Nigel Richards, who won the French World Scrabble Championship—without knowing French. Young documents the methods he and others have used to acquire knowledge and shows that, far from being an obscure skill limited to aggressive autodidacts, ultralearning is a powerful tool anyone can use to improve their career, studies, and life. Ultralearning explores this fascinating subculture, shares a proven framework for a successful ultralearning project, and offers insights into how you can organize and exe - cute a plan to learn anything deeply and quickly, without teachers or budget-busting tuition costs. Whether the goal is to be fluent in a language (or ten languages), earn the equivalent of a college degree in a fraction of the time, or master multiple tools to build a product or business from the ground up, the principles in Ultralearning will guide you to success.",Business & Economics,278,N/A,0,en

Grateful,Diana Butler Bass,HarperCollins,2018-04-03,"The Wilbur Award-winning book Grateful is now available in paperback and with an updated subtitle. If gratitude is good, why is it so hard to do? In Grateful, Diana Butler Bass untangles our conflicting understandings of gratitude and sets the table for a renewed practice of giving thanks. We know that gratitude is good, but many of us find it hard to sustain a meaningful life of gratefulness. Four out of five Americans report feeling gratitude on a regular basis, but those private feelings seem disconnected from larger concerns of our public lives. In Grateful, cultural observer and theologian Diana Butler Bass takes on this “gratitude gap” and offers up surprising, relevant, and powerful insights to practice gratitude. Bass, author of the award-winning Grounded and ten other books on spirituality and culture, explores the transformative, subversive power of gratitude for our personal lives and in communities. Using her trademark blend of historical research, spiritual insights, and timely cultural observation, she shows how we can overcome this gap and make change in our own lives and in the world. With honest stories and heartrending examples from history and her own life, Bass reclaims gratitude as a path to greater connection with god, with others, with the world, and even with our own souls. It’s time to embrace a more radical practice of gratitude—the virtue that heals us and helps us thrive.",Religion,235,N/A,0,en

Whether it’s hearing God’s voice (the Word), having his ear (prayer), or participating in his body (fellowship), such spiritual rhythms of the Christian life have the power to awaken our souls to God’s glory and stir our hearts for lifelong service in his name. What’s more, these seemingly simple practices grant us access to a host of spiritual blessings that we can only begin to imagine this side of eternity—and the incredible joy that such blessings bring to God’s children today.",Religion,146,N/A,0,en

Summistae,"Lidia Lanza, Marco Toste",Leuven University Press,2021-03-15,"Thomas Aquinas’ Summa theologiae is one of the classics in the history of theology and philosophy. Beyond its influence in the Middle Ages, its importance is also borne out by the fact that it became the subject of commentary. During the sixteenth century it was gradually adopted as the official text for the teaching of scholastic theology in most European Catholic universities. As a result, university professors throughout Europe and the colonial Americas started lecturing and producing commentaries on the Summa and using it as a starting point for many theological and philosophical discussions. Some of the works of major authors such as Vitoria, Soto, Molina, Suárez and Arriaga are nothing more than commentaries on the Summa. This book is the first scholarly endeavour to investigate this commentary tradition. As it examines late scholasticism against its institutional backdrop and contains studies of manuscripts and texts unpublished, it will remain an authoritative source for the research of late scholasticism.",Philosophy,458,N/A,0,en

Helping Students Make Sense of the World Using Next Generation Science and Engineering Practices," Christina V. Schwarz, Cynthia Passmore, Brian J. Reiser ",NSTA Press,2017-01-31,"When it’s time for a game change, you need a guide to the new rules. Helping Students Make Sense of the World Using Next Generation Science and Engineering Practices provides a play-by-play understanding of the practices strand of A Framework for K–12 Science Education (Framework) and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Written in clear, nontechnical language, this book provides a wealth of real-world examples to show you what’s different about practice-centered teaching and learning at all grade levels. The book addresses three important questions: 1. How will engaging students in science and engineering practices help improve science education? 2. What do the eight practices look like in the classroom? 3. How can educators engage students in practices to bring the NGSS to life? Helping Students Make Sense of the World Using Next Generation Science and Engineering Practices was developed for K–12 science teachers, curriculum developers, teacher educators, and administrators. Many of its authors contributed to the Framework’s initial vision and tested their ideas in actual science classrooms. If you want a fresh game plan to help students work together to generate and revise knowledge—not just receive and repeat information—this book is for you.",Education,393,N/A,0,en

Romans,Jared C. Wilson,Crossway,2013-04-30,"The Knowing the Bible series is a new resource designed to help Bible readers better understand and apply God's Word. Each 12-week study leads participants through one book of the Bible and is made up of four basic components: (1) Reflection questions designed to help readers engage the text at a deeper level; (2) ""Gospel Glimpses"" highlighting the gospel of grace throughout the book; (3) ""Whole-Bible Connections"" showing how any given passage connects to the Bible's overarching story of redemption culminating in Christ; and (4) ""Theological Soundings"" identifying how historic orthodox doctrines are taught or reinforced throughout Scripture. With contributions from a wide array of influential pastors and church leaders, these gospel-centered studies will help Christians see and cherish the message of God's grace on each and every page of the Bible. The book of Romans was Paul's greatest literary achievement, a majestic letter in which the apostle expounds on crucial doctrines such as original sin, election, substitutionary atonement, the role of the law, and justification by faith alone. Plumbing the theological depths, Jared Wilson writes with a pastor's eye toward understanding and application as he explains the biblical text with clarity and passion, helping readers follow along as Paul recounts the history of salvation and illuminates the glories of the cross of Christ.",Religion,98,N/A,0,en

After Evangelicalism,David P. Gushee,Westminster John Knox Press,2020-08-25,"Named one of the Top 10 Books of the Year in 2020 by the Academy of Parish Clergy ""Drawing on his own spiritual journey, David Gushee provides an incisive critique of American evangelicalism [and] offers a succinct yet deeply informed guide for post-evangelicals seeking to pursue Christ-honoring lives."" —Kristin Kobes Du Mez, Calvin University Millions are getting lost in the evangelical maze: inerrancy, indifference to the environment, deterministic Calvinism, purity culture, racism, LGBTQ discrimination, male dominance, and Christian nationalism. They are now conscientious objectors, deconstructionists, perhaps even ""none and done."" As one of America's leading academics speaking to the issues of religion today, David Gushee offers a clear assessment and a new way forward for disillusioned post-evangelicals. Gushee starts by analyzing what went wrong with U.S. white evangelicalism in areas such as evangelical history and identity, biblicism, uncredible theologies, and the fundamentalist understandings of race, politics, and sexuality. Along the way, he proposes new ways of Christian believing and of listening to God and Jesus today. He helps post-evangelicals know how to belong and behave, going from where they are to a living relationship with Christ and an intellectually cogent and morally robust post-evangelical faith. He shows that they can have a principled way of understanding Scripture, a community of Christ's people, a healthy politics, and can repent and learn to listen to people on the margins. With a foreword from Brian McLaren, who says, “David Gushee is right: there is indeed life after evangelicalism,” this book offers an essential handbook for those looking for answers and affirmation of their journey into a future that is post-evangelical but still centered on Jesus. If you, too, are struggling, After Evangelicalism shows that it is possible to cut loose from evangelical Christianity and, more than that, it is necessary.",Religion,245,N/A,0,en
Legal Research Demystified,Eric P. Voigt,N/A,2019,"Legal Research Demystified offers a real-world approach to legal research for first-year law students. The book guides students through eight steps to research common law issues and ten steps to research statutory issues. It breaks down the research steps and process into ""bite-size"" pieces for novice researchers, minimizing the frustration often associated with learning new skills. This text also gives students context, explaining why and when a source or finding tool should be used when researching the law. The process of legal research, of course, is not linear. This book constantly reminds students of the recursive nature of legal research, and it identifies specific situations when they may deviate from the research steps. Through the book's step-by-step approach, students will connect seemingly unrelated tools (e.g., citators and the Key Number System) and understand how to leverage them to answer legal questions. Every chapter includes charts, diagrams, and screen captures to illustrate the research steps and finding methods. Each chapter concludes with a ""summary of key points"" section that reinforces important concepts from the chapter. This book provides students and professors with multiple assessment tools. Each chapter ends with true-false and multiple-choice questions that test students' understanding of chapter content. These questions are replicated on the book's companion website, Core Knowledge. Students may answer these end-of-chapter questions, as well as more advanced questions, on Core Knowledge and receive immediate feedback, including an explanation of why the answer is correct or incorrect. Professors can generate reports to track students' performance. Based on students' performance, professors will know whether to review a topic in more detail or to move to the next topic. (New books contain an access code to Core Knowledge; students purchasing used books can buy an access code separately.) Core Knowledge offers yet another assessment tool: interactive research exercises. These online exercises walk students through the research steps on Westlaw and Lexis Advance, giving professors the option to ""flip"" the classroom. Through many screen captures and tips, students can navigate both research platforms outside of class, allowing students and professors to dig deeper into the material during class. Each research exercise simulates a real-world research experience and contains self-grading questions. For example, in one exercise, students research on Westlaw to determine whether the client could recover damages against a neighbor for the emotional distress for the death of the client's dog. To answer the client's question, students must complete the research steps, including finding and reviewing secondary sources on Westlaw, using the Key Number System and KeyCite, and performing keyword searches. Professor support materials include a Teacher's Manual, sample syllabi, and sample research exams.",Legal research,0,5,4,en

The Pre-writing Handbook for Law Students,"Laura P. Graham, Miriam E. Felsenburg",N/A,2013,"Intended primarily for use in the first few weeks of the first-semester legal writing course, The Pre-Writing Handbook for Law Students takes a systematic approach to the process of learning legal analysis. The Handbook is designed to help students focus on and become competent in the process of legal analysis that precedes their work on early legal writing products such as memos, case briefs, and other documents. This book teaches a new approach to learning legal analysis through the introduction of a series of repeatable steps that students can apply to any legal scenario. By practicing and internalizing these analytic steps, students will experience a smoother writing process that translates into a better written product. Each chapter of the Handbook contains several useful features: Frequent metacognitive ""checkpoints""--text boxes that prompt students to pause or stop in their pre-writing work and assess their own efficiency and effectiveness. Concrete examples of how the steps in the pre-writing process actually work in two fully developed recurring legal scenarios. End-of-chapter recaps that summarize the desired results of the student's work during each step of the pre-writing process. Independent Practice Exercises. The Teacher's Manual includes advice on how to incorporate this book's new approach into an existing first-semester legal writing course; complete keys to all of the book's exercises; and complete samples of objective memos, a trial brief, an opinion letter, and a demand letter for use with the recurring scenarios and the independent exercises. The thorough content of the Teacher's Manual should enable professors to use the Handbook effectively with minimal additional preparation. ""The Handbook hits the nail on the head! It centers on exactly what is missing from all the other legal writing books: the deep thinking that is necessary before pen hits paper."" -- Joi Montiel, Faulkner University School of Law ""Writing professors have claimed for years that learning to write is learning to think; legal writing professors have claimed for years that learning legal writing entails learning legal analysis. This book makes good on both claims and provides a welcome and useful tool for anyone trying to master legal writing."" -- J. Christopher Rideout, Professor of Lawyering Skills and Associate Director of the Legal Writing Program, Seattle University School of Law ""You need to crawl before you can walk, walk before you can run, and run before you can fly.

HIV Infection and the Cardiovascular System,"Giuseppe Barbaro, J.S. Borer",Karger Medical and Scientific Publishers,2003,"Past studies revealed that HIV infection may implicate diverse cardiac diseases such as cardiomyopathy, coronary heart disease, cardiac neoplasms, endocarditis or pericarditis. In addition, it was found that highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) often causes - as an adverse effect - a metabolic syndrome characterized by lipodystrophy/lipoatrophy, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, leading to an increase in coronary artery disease and stroke. This book focuses on the most recent findings in HIV-associated heart disease and HAART-associated metabolic and cardiovascular complications. In a first part, the epidemiology, pathogenesis and molecular biology of HIV-associated cardiovascular disease, pulmonary hypertension, lipodystrophy and HAART-associated metabolic syndrome are reviewed. The second part offers clinical and therapeutic insights into HIV/HAART-associated atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, stroke, vasculitic syndromes, and pulmonary hypertension. Besides, cardiovascular complications in HIV-infected children, cardiac surgery in HIV-infected patients, and the prevention and management of HAART-associated cardiovascular complications are points under discussion. Finally, the interaction between HAART and drugs commonly used to treat cardiovascular disease is carefully analyzed. HIV Infection and the Cardiovascular System presents state-of-the-art findings of basic and clinical scientists and is a valuable reference for specialists in cardiology and internal medicine as well as for infectiologists.",Medical,256,N/A,0,en

China combines financial firepower—currently the world's second largest economy—with a clear intent of fielding a modern military capable of competing not only in the physical environments of land, sea, air, and outer space, but especially in the electromagnetic and cyber domains.

Parents and Children,Charlotte Mason,Simon and Schuster,2013-05-20,"Parents and Children consists of a collection of 26 articles from the original Parent's Review magazines to encourage and instruct parents. Topics include The Family; Parents as Rulers; Parents as Inspirers; Parents as Schoolmasters; The Culture of Character; Parents as Instructors in Religion; Faith and Duty (a secular writer has useful suggestions for using myths and stories to teach morals; along with the Bible, these can give examples of noble characters to emulate); Parents' Concern to Give the Heroic Impulse; Is It Possible?; Discipline; Sensations and Feelings Educable by Parents; What is Truth? (Dealing with Lying); Show Cause Why; A Scheme Of Educational Theory; A Catechism of Educational Theory; Whence and Whither; The Great Recognition Required of Parents; and The Eternal Child. Charlotte Mason was a late nineteenth-century British educator whose ideas were far ahead of her time. She believed that children are born persons worthy of respect, rather than blank slates, and that it was better to feed their growing minds with living literature and vital ideas and knowledge, rather than dry facts and knowledge filtered and pre-digested by the teacher. Her method of education, still used by some private schools and many homeschooling families, is gentle and flexible, especially with younger children, and includes first-hand exposure to great and noble ideas through books in each school subject, conveying wonder and arousing curiosity, and through reflection upon great art, music, and poetry; nature observation as the primary means of early science teaching; use of manipulatives and real-life application to understand mathematical concepts and learning to reason, rather than rote memorization and working endless sums; and an emphasis on character and on cultivating and maintaining good personal habits.

So often we characterize our food cravings as bad, especially when dieting has made us feel even more disappointed and discouraged. But the reality is we were made to crave.

Legal Ethics and Professional Responsibility,Ross Cranston,Oxford University Press on Demand,1995,"Among members of the legal profession and judiciary throughout the world, there is a genuine concern with establishing and maintaining high ethical standards. It is not difficult to understand why this should be so. Nor is it difficult to see the professional standards are not completelydivorced from ordinary morality. Indeed, legal ethics and professional responsibility are more than a set of rules of good conduct; they are also a commitment to honesty, integrity, and service in the practice of law. In order to ensure that the standards established are the right ones, it isnecessary first of all to examine important philosophical and policy issues, such as the need to reconsider the boundaries between, on the one hand, a lawyer's obligation to a client and, on the other, the public interest. It is also to be appreciated that conflicts of interest are pervasive andthat all too often they are so common that they are not recognized as such. Yet rarely is public policy clearly cut. The underlying themes of this book are: * that the move to more definite rules is not only inevitable but also desirable * that existing codes of professional practice cannot simply be treated as a system of specific rules * that the current set of ethical rules is contestable and requires further refinement, perhaps even radical surgery * and that legal ethics must be conceived in the more general area of professional responsibility The wider ethical issues of the operation of the legal profession as a whole are now firmly on the agenda. Both law schools and law professionals have a role to play in developing acceptable standards in this area and it is therefore appropriate that the essays in this volume are written by adistinguished group of law teachers and practitioners together with senior members of the judiciary. The book opens with an overview chapter, followed by three chapters analysing the ethical rules pertaining to the judiciary, the Bar, and solicitors, written by, respectively, the Master of the Rolls, Anthony Thornton, and Alison Crawley and Christopher Bramall. The following three chapters lookat the specific issues of confidentiality (Michael Brindle and Guy Dehn) and the particular ethical problems in the family and criminal law jurisdictions (Sir Alan Ward and Professor Andrew Ashworth respectively). Chapter 8, by Sir Alan Paterson, discusses the teaching of legal ethics, whilstChapters 9 and 10, by Marc Galanter, Thomas Palay, and Cyril Glasser put the subject in its wider social and professional context. The book finishes with a chapter which examines what lawyers may learn from looking at the study of medical ethics.",Law,234,N/A,0,en

It's Not Supposed to Be This Way,Lysa TerKeurst,Thomas Nelson,2018-11-13,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER What do you do when God’s timing seems questionable, his lack of intervention hurtful, and his promises doubtful? Lysa TerKeurst unveils her heart amid shattering circumstances, inviting you to live assured when life doesn't turn out like you expected. Life often looks so very different than we hoped or expected. Some events may simply catch us off guard for a season, but others shatter us completely. We feel disappointed and disillusioned at best and overwhelmed and hopeless at worst. We quietly start to wonder about the reality of God’s goodness and why he allows us to suffer and experience grief and loss. Lysa TerKeurst understands this deeply. But after many tears, godly counseling, and prayerful seeking, she's also discovered that our disappointments can be the divine appointments our souls need to radically encounter God. In It's Not Supposed to Be This Way, Lysa invites us into her own journey of faith and, with grit, vulnerability, and honest humor, helps us to: Stop being pulled into the anxiety of disappointment by discovering how to better process unmet expectations and other painful situations. Train ourselves to recognize the three strategies of the enemy, so we can stand strong and persevere through unsettling relationships and uncertain outcomes. Discover the secret of being steadfast and not panicking when God actually does give us more than we can handle. Shift our suspicion that God is cruel or unfair to the biblical assurance that God is protecting and preparing us. Know how to encourage a friend and help her navigate hard realities with real help from God's truth, the Bible. Look for additional biblically based resources and devotionals from Lysa: Good Boundaries and Goodbyes Forgiving What You Can't Forget Uninvited You're Going to Make It Embraced Seeing Beautiful Again",Religion,289,5,1,en

Environmental Law and Policy,"James Salzman, Barton H. Thompson, Barton H. Thompson (Jr.)",N/A,2007,"Environmental Law and Policy is a user-friendly, concise, inexpensive treatment of environmental law. Written to be read rather than used as a reference source, the authors provide a broad conceptual overview of environmental law while also explaining the major statutes and cases. The book is intended for four audiences ? students (both graduate and undergraduate) seeking a readable study guide for their environmental law and policy courses; professors who do not use casebooks (relying on their own materials or case studies) but want an integrating text for their courses or want to include conceptual materials on the major legal issues; and practicing lawyers and environmental professionals who want a concise, readable overview of the field. The first part of the book provides an engaging discussion of the major themes and issues that cross-cut environmental law. Starting with the first chapter's brief history of environmentalism in America, the second chapter goes on to explore the importance and implications of basic themes that occur in virtually all environmental conflicts, including scientific uncertainty, market failures, problems of scale, public choice theory, etc. It then presents three dominant perspectives in the field that drive policy development ? environmental rights, utilitarianism, and environmental justice. Chapter Three fills in the remaining legal background for understanding environmental protection, reviewing the theory of instrument choice, the basics of administrative law, core concepts in constitutional law (e.g., takings, the commerce clause), and the doctrines associated with how citizen groups shape environmental law (such as standing). The second part of the book examines the substance of environmental law, with separate sections on each of the major statutes. International issues such as ozone depletion, climate change, and transboundary waste disposal are also addressed. These chapters build on the themes and conceptual framework laid down in the first part of the text in order to integrate the discussion of individual statutes into a broad portrait of the law.",Law,356,N/A,0,en

The Death of Punishment,Robert Blecker,Macmillan + ORM,2013-11-19,"For twelve years Robert Blecker, a criminal law professor, wandered freely inside Lorton Central Prison, armed only with cigarettes and a tape recorder. The Death of Punishment tests legal philosophy against the reality and wisdom of street criminals and their guards. Some killers' poignant circumstances should lead us to mercy; others show clearly why they should die. After thousands of hours over twenty-five years inside maximum security prisons and on death rows in seven states, the history and philosophy professor exposes the perversity of justice: Inside prison, ironically, it's nobody's job to punish. Thus the worst criminals often live the best lives. The Death of Punishment challenges the reader to refine deeply held beliefs on life and death as punishment that flare up with every news story of a heinous crime. It argues that society must redesign life and death in prison to make the punishment more nearly fit the crime. It closes with the final irony: If we make prison the punishment it should be, we may well abolish the very death penalty justice now requires.",Social Science,341,N/A,0,en

The Gospel According to John,D. A. Carson,Wm. B.

I have tried to include the kind of information they need to know, but to do so in such a way that the informed layperson could also use the work in personal study of the Bible, exclusively for purposes of personal growth in edification and understanding. In particular, I have attempted: (1) To make clear the flow of the text. (2) To engage a small but representative part of the massive secondary literature on John. (3) To draw a few lines towards establishing how the Fourth Gospel contributes to biblical and systematic theology. (4) To offer a consistent exposition of John's Gospel as an evangelistic Gospel. - Preface.",Religion,736,5,3,en

EPA 608 Study Guide,Hvac Training 101,N/A,2019-12-06,"HVAC Training 101 is a site visited by over 100,000 enthusiasts monthly, who are interested in becoming HVAC technicians. The site initially began as the passion project of a retired HVAC technician. The site quickly gained popularity, building a strong community of aspiring HVAC technicians. Currently, it is managed by a team of ex-HVAC technicians with decades of experience in the industry. Head over to HVACTraining101.Com to learn more. We began by writing about how to become certified as an HVAC technician. With rules and certifications varying for each state, it was a challenging task. We had a few friends in other states help us out, but for some states, we had to dig really deep to find the information needed. Our audience at the time was very happy with the information we provided. At this point, we started getting many questions about EPA 608 certification. Once you get the education and experience needed to become a technician, prospective employers will ask for certification to handle refrigerants. When we started writing about how to become certified, viewers again requested we write a study guide to help them prepare for the 608 exams. The study guides out there were dense and had much more information than was needed to pass the test. This inspired us to embark on a journey to write the simplest study guide for the EPA 608 exam, which would still cover all the necessary information. We hope we have achieved our intended objective. The journey to becoming an HVAC technician can be long and arduous. We congratulate you on taking this path and wish you the best in cracking the EPA 608 exam.",,64,N/A,0,en

Lord of the Flies,William Golding,Faber & Faber,2012-09-20,"A plane crashes on a desert island and the only survivors, a group of schoolboys, assemble on the beach and wait to be rescued. By day they inhabit a land of bright fantastic birds and dark blue seas, but at night their dreams are haunted by the image of a terrifying beast.

Do I Stay Christian?,Brian D. McLaren,St. Martin's Essentials,2022-05-24,"Dubbed ""a heroic gate-crasher"" by New York Times bestselling author Glennon Doyle, Brian D. McLaren explores reasons to leave or stay within the church and if so how... ""Brian's new book on remaining Christian knocks it out of the ballpark in terms of framing and naming the questions. I cannot stop reading it. Thank you, Brian!"" —Fr. Richard Rohr, OFM, founder of the Center for Action and Contemplation, author of The Universal Christ ""Any thoughtful Christian has been asking the questions McLaren tackles here, but many of us are afraid to voice them aloud. In Do I Stay Christian? we’re gifted a gentle guide who opens ideas and voices the questions we cannot, naming our frustration, fear, and hesitant hope."" —Rev. Dr. Amy Butler, former Senior Minister, The Riverside Church; Founder, Invested Faith Do I Stay Christian? addresses in public the powerful question that surprising numbers of people—including pastors, priests, and other religious leaders—are asking in private. Picking up where Faith After Doubt leaves off, Do I Stay Christian? is not McLaren's attempt to persuade Christians to dig in their heels or run for the exit. Instead, he combines his own experience with that of thousands of people who have confided in him over the years to help readers make a responsible, honest, ethical decision about their religious identity. There is a way to say both yes and no to the question of staying Christian, McLaren says, by shifting the focus from whether we stay Christian to how we stay human. If Do I Stay Christian? is the question you're asking—or if it's a question that someone you love is asking—this is the book you've been waiting for.",Self-Help,289,N/A,0,en

Ideas Have Consequences,Richard M. Weaver,University of Chicago Press,2013-11-04,"A foundational text of the modern conservative movement, this 1948 philosophical treatise argues the decline of Western civilization and offers a remedy. Originally published in 1948, at the height of post–World War II optimism and confidence in collective security, Ideas Have Consequences uses “words hard as cannonballs” to present an unsparing diagnosis of the ills of the modern age. Widely read and debated at the time of its first publication, the book is now seen as one of the foundational texts of the modern conservative movement. In its pages, Richard M. Weaver argues that the decline of Western civilization resulted from the rising acceptance of relativism over absolute reality. In spite of increased knowledge, this retreat from the realist intellectual tradition has weakened the Western capacity to reason, with catastrophic consequences for social order and individual rights. But Weaver also offers a realistic remedy. These difficulties are the product not of necessity, but of intelligent choice. And, today, as decades ago, the remedy lies in the renewed acceptance of absolute reality and the recognition that ideas—like actions—have consequences. This expanded edition of the classic work contains a foreword by New Criterion editor Roger Kimball that offers insight into the rich intellectual and historical contexts of Weaver and his work and an afterword by Ted J. Smith III that relates the remarkable story of the book’s writing and publication. Praise for Ideas Have Consequences “A profound diagnosis of the sickness of our culture.” —Reinhold Niebuhr “Brilliantly written, daring, and radical. . . . It will shock, and philosophical shock is the beginning of wisdom.” —Paul Tillich “This deeply prophetic book not only launched the renaissance of philosophical conservatism in this country, but in the process gave us an armory of insights into the diseases besetting the national community that is as timely today as when it first appeared. [This] is one of the few authentic classics in the American political tradition.” —Robert Nisbet",Philosophy,224,N/A,0,en

Reproducibility and Replicability in Science,"National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, Policy and Global Affairs, Committee on Science, Engineering, Medicine, and Public Policy, Board on Research Data and Information, Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences, Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics, Board on Mathematical Sciences and Analytics, Division on Earth and Life Studies, Nuclear and Radiation Studies Board, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Committee on National Statistics, Board on Behavioral, Cognitive, and Sensory Sciences, Committee on Reproducibility and Replicability in Science",National Academies Press,2019-10-20,"One of the pathways by which the scientific community confirms the validity of a new scientific discovery is by repeating the research that produced it. When a scientific effort fails to independently confirm the computations or results of a previous study, some fear that it may be a symptom of a lack of rigor in science, while others argue that such an observed inconsistency can be an important precursor to new discovery. Concerns about reproducibility and replicability have been expressed in both scientific and popular media. As these concerns came to light, Congress requested that the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conduct a study to assess the extent of issues related to reproducibility and replicability and to offer recommendations for improving rigor and transparency in scientific research. Reproducibility and Replicability in Science defines reproducibility and replicability and examines the factors that may lead to non-reproducibility and non-replicability in research. Unlike the typical expectation of reproducibility between two computations, expectations about replicability are more nuanced, and in some cases a lack of replicability can aid the process of scientific discovery. This report provides recommendations to researchers, academic institutions, journals, and funders on steps they can take to improve reproducibility and replicability in science.",Science,257,N/A,0,en

The Regulatory State,"Dawn Oliver, Tony Prosser, Richard Rawlings",N/A,2010,"This collection of fifteen essays by leading experts in regulation is unique in its focus on the constitutional implications of recent regulatory developments in the UK, the EU, and the US. The chapters reflect current developments and crises which are significant in many areas of public policy, not only regulation. These include the development of governance in place of government in many policy areas, the emergence of networks of public and private actors, the credit crunch, techniques for countering climate change, the implications for fundamental rights of regulatory arrangements and the development of complex accountability mechanisms designed to promote policy objectives. Constitutional issues discussed in The Regulatory State include regulatory governance, models of economic and social regulation, non-parliamentary rule-making, the UK's devolution arrangements and regulation, the credit crisis, the rationing of common resources, regulation and fundamental rights, the European Competition Network, private law making and European integration, innovative regulator sanctions recently introduced in the UK, the auditing of regulatory reform, and parliamentary oversight and judicial review of regulators. The introductory chapter focuses on testing times for regulation, and the concluding chapter draws ten lessons from the substantive chapters, noting the importance of regulatory diversity, the complexity of networks and relations between regulatory actors and the executive, the new challenges to regulatory habits posed by climate change and the credit crisis, the wider economic and legal context in which regulation takes place and the accountability networks - including judicial review, parliamentary oversight and audit - within which regulation operates.",Law,365,N/A,0,en

The Lamb's Supper,Scott Hahn,Image,2002-06-18,"As seen on EWTN, bestselling author Scott Hahn unveils the mysteries of the Mass, offering readers a deeper appreciation of the most familiar of Catholic rituals. Of all things Catholic, there is nothing that is so familiar as the Mass. With its unchanging prayers, the Mass fits Catholics like their favorite clothes. Yet most Catholics sitting in the pews on Sundays fail to see the powerful supernatural drama that enfolds them. Pope John Paul II described the Mass as ""Heaven on Earth,"" explaining that what ""we celebrate on Earth is a mysterious participation in the heavenly liturgy."" The Lamb’s Supper reveals a long-lost secret of the Church: The early Christians' key to understanding the mysteries of the Mass was the New Testament Book of Revelation. With its bizarre imagery, its mystic visions of heaven, and its end-of-time prophecies, Revelation mirrors the sacrifice and celebration of the Eucharist. Beautifully written, in clear direct language, bestselling Catholic author Scott Hahn's new book will help readers see the Mass with new eyes, pray the liturgy with a renewed heart, and enter into the Mass more fully, enthusiastically, intelligently, and powerfully than ever before.",Religion,192,4.5,5,en

A Dictionary of the Book of Mormon,Elder George Reynolds,Library of Alexandria,2020-09-28,"AARON. One of the sons of the Nephite King, Mosiah II, generally supposed to have been the eldest, as it is said that the sovereignty of the people rightly belonged to him on the death of his father, but he refused this great honor on purpose to fulfil a mission to the Lamanites, upon which he and his brothers had set their hearts. Aaron was born in the land of Zarahemla, probably not earlier than B. C. 125, as his father would then have been about thirty years old. During his youth he was wayward and uncontrollable, and joined with those who persecuted the people of God. In fact he and his brothers and the younger Alma were leaders among those who harassed the church. The conduct of the young princes in this regard cannot be ascribed to the corrupting influence of lives of pomp and luxury spent at their father's court, for that was a model of simplicity and frugality, and the king himself labored with his hands to lighten the burdens of the people. But it may more justly be attributed to the want of thought, to the self-conceit and stubbornness so frequently shown in the lives of the young, until maturer years and wider experience teach them humility and reverence. From this evil course of life Aaron and his associates were rescued by the direct interposition of Heaven. He was in the traveling company that was stopped on the way by the angel of the Lord, who, in tones of thunder, which caused the solid earth to tremble, reproved its members for their sins and commanded them to molest the saints no more. From this moment Aaron was a changed man, he gave to God and heaven his undivided life. Where he had done evil he sought to make amends and where he had incited to turbulency he became a peacemaker. Shortly afterwards he and his brothers commenced to labor as missionaries among the Nephites. They next determined to lay their lives on the altar of sacrifice and go up to the land of Nephi, into the midst of the Lamanites, and bear to them the message of God's condescension and love. From this seeming rash resolve most of their friends sought to dissuade the young princes. They pictured to them the perils of the venture, the hopelessness of the task. But it availed not. The Spirit of the Lord was burning within them, they were oppressed with the thought of the value of human souls that were perishing for lack of knowledge.",Fiction,449,N/A,0,en

Now, thanks to revelation, we have been given a glimpse into the superhuman realm where the Midwayers have been living and working since human will appeared. Almost everyone has had an experience for which the only explanation is help from unseen beings. Many attribute such experiences to the Guardian Angels, and they do indeed assist and protect us, but so do the Midwayers. In fact, the two work together to advance the individual and enhance global culture. The story in these pages will describe the nature, work, and history of these unique beings who are neither humans nor angels. They are in fact midway between the two.

Hebrews: An Introduction and Study Guide,"Amy L. B. Peeler, Patrick Gray",Bloomsbury Publishing,2020-01-09,"This volume offers a compact introduction to one of the most daunting texts in the New Testament. The Letter to the Hebrews has inspired many readers with its encomium to faith, troubled others with its hard sayings on the impossibility of a second repentance, and perplexed still others with its exegetical assumptions and operations drawn from a cultural matrix that is largely alien to modern sensibilities. Long thought to be Paul, the anonymous author of Hebrews exhibits points of continuity with the apostle and other New Testament writers in the letter's (or sermon's) vision of life in the light of the crucified Messiah, but one also finds distinctive perspectives in such areas as Christology, eschatology, and atonement. Gray and Peeler survey the salient historical, social, and rhetorical factors to be considered in the interpretation of this document, as well as its theological, liturgical, and cultural legacy. They invite readers to enter the world of one of the boldest Christian thinkers of the first century.",Religion,112,N/A,0,en

This video Bible study with bestselling author and teacher Lysa TerKeurst (video streaming included) is for those of you who have been hurt by others, who feel stuck in a cycle of unresolved pain. Forgiveness is a major part of the Christian faith. We know God commands us to forgive each other. But, apart from simply saying the words, ""I forgive you,"" many of us have unasked questions about it: How does it work? On our minds, souls, circumstances—what's actually happening when we forgive? Why is it so important, and what's the difference between forgiveness and simply moving on? When should I forgive, and are their exceptions? How can I find healing for myself, even if my act of forgiveness doesn't seem to change the person who hurt me? These are just some of the questions explored in this six-session video Bible study. Lysa will walk with you on a step-by-step process—through biblical answers, deep empathy, and the therapeutic insight that comes from her personal experiences—toward the grace of forgiveness and the freedom from the pain of past wrongs.

Don't Give the Enemy a Seat at Your Table,Louie Giglio,Thomas Nelson,2021-05-11,"Louie Giglio helps you find encouragement, hope, and strength in the midst of any valley as you reject the enemy voices of fear, rage, lust, insecurity, anxiety, despair, temptation, or defeat. Scripture is clear: the Enemy is a liar who will stop at nothing to tempt you into poor decisions and self-defeating mindsets, making you feel afraid, angry, anxious, or defeated. It is all too easy for Satan to weasel his way into a seat at the table intended for only you and your King. But you can fight back. Don't Give the Enemy a Seat at Your Table outlines the ways to overcome those lies so you can find peace and security in any challenging circumstance or situation. With the same bold, exciting approach to Scripture as employed in Goliath Must Fall and his other previous works, pastor Louie Giglio examines Psalm 23 in fresh ways, highlighting verse 5: ""You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies."" You can find freedom from insecurity, temptation, and defeat--if you allow Jesus, the Shepherd, to lead the battle for your mind and heart. This spiritual warfare book for those who are leery of spiritual warfare books will resonate with Louie's core Passion tribe as well as with Christians of all ages who want to live a triumphant life in God.",Religion,208,N/A,0,en

Broken trust can send us spiraling: Can anyone really be trusted? What if distrust is actually the wisest choice to make? What do I do with my doubts about God when He allows bad things to happen? Are there biblical answers for any of this? Lysa TerKeurst understands this kind of deep wrestling and has asked these same hard questions in the midst of her own relational heartbreaks and uncontrollable circumstances. But after thousands of hours of counseling intensives and theological research, Lysa has discovered how crucial it is to develop the stability you long for within yourself and with God, so you don't become cynical and carry a broken belief system into every new relationship. Building upon and further unpacking the scriptural concepts in her book I Want to Trust You, but I Don’t, this six-session Bible study (video access included) will equip you to: Identify which of the 11 relational red flags are stirring up distrust, so you're able to better pinpoint why you're feeling uneasy. Recognize when it's possible to repair a fractured relationship and how to do it with a five-step framework you can start using today.

Don't Scare the Lost Sheep - Study Guide,"Andy Adams, Jane Adams",Xulon Press,2010-03,"Witnessing is something that Jesus has commanded all of us to do. Does that command make you a bit nervous? Would you like a new form of ""witnessing"" that is not only comfortable for everyone involved but produces exceptional results? Would you like to feel confident and relaxed while talking to others about faith? Today, there are definitely many negative stigmas surrounding the entire concept of witnessing the good news to others. In fact, while certainly well intentioned, most current witnessing practices have limited success and have even driven millions of people further away from developing a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. Christians desperately need to step back and take a strong look at the examples that Jesus Himself provided when witnessing to others. If we emulate the examples of Jesus, we can completely reinvent witnessing to once again be a positive, enjoyable, and, most importantly, successful part of every Christian's life. Andy Adams was not a Christian for most of his life. He did not come to develop a relationship with Jesus Christ until the age of forty-three. During his pre-Christian life, many well-intentioned Christians attempted to use the typical forms of witnessing on Andy. Because of his history, he has a unique perspective of what does and does not work. In Don't Scare the Lost Sheep, Andy will: ● lead you through understanding the human behaviors along with basic concepts and processes related to witnessing ● help you to prepare yourself and develop a toolkit that you can easily use when the time comes for you to talk with others ● assist you in identifying potential ""witnessees"" ● guide you to set the stage for your efforts ● teach you to apply specific techniques that have a high probability of success--with a very comfortable approach",Religion,94,N/A,0,en

7 Divine Mysteries Study Guide,Joshua Mills,Whitaker House,2021-06-08,"Connect to the Manifest Promises of God There comes a point in our spiritual journey when we must no longer sit and wait. Instead, we need to stand up and walk boldly in God’s purposes for us. We have to progress toward the blessings and provision He has shown us in the glory realms. There isn't a single area of your life for which God does not have a promise of victory. He has proclaimed breakthroughs, blessings, and, yes, miracles. In this study guide companion to 7 Divine Mysteries: Supernatural Secrets to Unlimited Abundance by Joshua Mills, you will find out how to connect to the manifest promises of God as you stretch your faith, work the Word, and allow the Spirit to lead you into overflowing abundance for spirit, soul, and body. The seven mysteries include: Divine Mystery #1: Your Vision: The Pathway for Provision Divine Mystery #2: What You Say Prepares the Way Divine Mystery #3: The Word You Work Will Work for You Divine Mystery #4: What You Sow, You Will Grow Divine Mystery #5: The Art of Generous Receiving Divine Mystery #6: Utilizing the Strength of Angels Divine Mystery #7: God’s Promised Generational Blessing There is an entire realm of supernatural abundance just waiting for you to explore and put to work in your life. In these days, God is opening untapped abundance for restoration, healing, deliverance, relationships, finances, creative ideas, and more. Many people have been waiting for God to move in their lives, but He is waiting for us to move in faith toward His promises. We must activate what He has spoken to us about—or risk losing the opportunity. God is looking for men and women who will rise up and choose to receive every promise He has given. The 7 Divine Mysteries Study Guide, which can be used by either individuals or groups, contains some brand-new material to further your understanding of supernatural abundance. The guide is also filled with key points from the book, thought questions, review questions, and supernatural activations. Joshua Mills and his wife, Janet, have proven these seven scriptural principles in their own lives. As God's children, we can confidently ask Him for miracles and provision in areas where we have experienced difficulty or lack in the past. We just need to give Him permission to upset the daily routine of our lives and let His glory flow from heaven to earth. Then, we need to take hold of our portion as it comes down from the throne.",Religion,71,N/A,0,en

A Life Beyond Amazing Bible Study Guide,Dr. David Jeremiah,HarperChristian Resources,2017-10-03,"Why were people in the first century so drawn to Jesus of Nazareth? His powerful miracles and challenging teachings, for sure. But it was also His character. Humanity had never witnessed someone who is loving, joyful, peaceful, patient, compassionate, generous, faithful, humble, and self-controlled all the time. It was as if God Himself had become a human being to demonstrate the life that is possible–a life beyond amazing. The traits that Jesus demonstrated in His life were traits empowered by the Spirit of God who filled Him. When Jesus returned to heaven, He sent His Spirit to indwell all His true followers so they could display the same character in their lives–not for their benefit alone but to show the world the kind of life God intended us to enjoy. The apostle Paul called these traits ""the fruit of the Spirit"" (Galatians 5:22–23).

How We Learn,Benedict Carey,Random House,2014-09-09,"In the tradition of The Power of Habit and Thinking, Fast and Slow comes a practical, playful, and endlessly fascinating guide to what we really know about learning and memory today—and how we can apply it to our own lives. From an early age, it is drilled into our heads: Restlessness, distraction, and ignorance are the enemies of success. We’re told that learning is all self-discipline, that we must confine ourselves to designated study areas, turn off the music, and maintain a strict ritual if we want to ace that test, memorize that presentation, or nail that piano recital. But what if almost everything we were told about learning is wrong? And what if there was a way to achieve more with less effort? In How We Learn, award-winning science reporter Benedict Carey sifts through decades of education research and landmark studies to uncover the truth about how our brains absorb and retain information. What he discovers is that, from the moment we are born, we are all learning quickly, efficiently, and automatically; but in our zeal to systematize the process we have ignored valuable, naturally enjoyable learning tools like forgetting, sleeping, and daydreaming. Is a dedicated desk in a quiet room really the best way to study? Can altering your routine improve your recall? Are there times when distraction is good? Is repetition necessary? Carey’s search for answers to these questions yields a wealth of strategies that make learning more a part of our everyday lives—and less of a chore. By road testing many of the counterintuitive techniques described in this book, Carey shows how we can flex the neural muscles that make deep learning possible. Along the way he reveals why teachers should give final exams on the first day of class, why it’s wise to interleave subjects and concepts when learning any new skill, and when it’s smarter to stay up late prepping for that presentation than to rise early for one last cram session. And if this requires some suspension of disbelief, that’s because the research defies what we’ve been told, throughout our lives, about how best to learn. The brain is not like a muscle, at least not in any straightforward sense. It is something else altogether, sensitive to mood, to timing, to circadian rhythms, as well as to location and environment. It doesn’t take orders well, to put it mildly. If the brain is a learning machine, then it is an eccentric one.

"Study Guide and Workbook to Accompany Zimbardo and Weber's Psychology, Second Edition","Peter C. Gram, Philip G.

This briefer, less expensive book presents psychology in a meaningful, manageable format that focuses on the key questions and core concepts of psychology. Introductory psychology covers such a wide range of topics and issues that it becomes difficult for readers to see the forest for the trees. To make key psychological concepts more meaningful, the authors found inspiration in a classic chess study. This study showed that experts did no better than novices at remembering the location of pieces on a chess board when they were placed randomly. Only when the patterns represented actual game situations did they make sense and therefore become more easily memorable for the experts. Clearly, meaningful patterns are easier to remember and understand than random arrangements, and Psychology applies this by presenting the field of psychology in meaningful patterns to enhance comprehension. These concepts are then applied to readers' own lives, study skills, and the world around them. Finally, Psychology integrates a cross-cultural and multicultural perspective to make psychology meaningful for everyone. For anyone interested in Introductory Psychology.",Psychology,524,N/A,0,en

Rethinking Retirement,John Piper,Crossway,2009-03-27,"John Piper challenges fellow baby boomers to forego the American dream of retirement and live out their golden years with a far greater purpose in mind.

But is retirement really the ideal? Or is it a series of poor options that ignore a greater purpose-and will kill a person more quickly than old age? John Piper responds: ""Lord, spare me this curse!"" And his resounding message is for anyone who believes there's far more to the golden years than accumulating comforts. It's for readers who long to finish better than they started, persevere for the right reasons (and without fear), experience true security, value what lies beyond their cravings, and live dangerously for the One who gave his life in his prime.

Viral Cultures,Marika Cifor,U of Minnesota Press,2022-06-07,"Delves deep into the archives that keep the history and work of AIDS activism alive Serving as a vital supplement to the existing scholarship on AIDS activism of the 1980s and 1990s, ViralCultures is the first book to critically examine the archives that have helped preserve and create the legacy of those radical activities. Marika Cifor charts the efforts activists, archivists, and curators have made to document the work of AIDS activism in the United States and the infrastructure developed to maintain it, safeguarding the material for future generations to remember these social movements and to revitalize the epidemic’s past in order to remake the present and future of AIDS. Drawing on large institutional archives such as the New York Public Library, as well as those developed by small, community-based organizations, this work of archival ethnography details how contemporary activists, artists, and curators use these records to build on the cultural legacy of AIDS activism to challenge the conditions of injustice that continue to undergird current AIDS crises. Cifor analyzes the various power structures through which these archives are mediated, demonstrating how ideology shapes the nature of archival material and how it is accessed and used. Positioning vital nostalgia as both a critical faculty and a generative practice, this book explores the act of saving this activist past and reanimating it in the digital age. While many books, popular films, and major exhibitions have contributed to a necessary awareness of HIV and AIDS activism, Viral Cultures provides a crucial missing link by highlighting the powerful role of archives in making those cultural moments possible.",Social Science,317,N/A,0,en

Macroeconomics (With Study Guide Cd-rom),Jagdish Handa,World Scientific Publishing Company,2010-09-24,"This book presents the stylized facts on the important variables (output, inflation, money supply and interest rates, etc.) of the macro economy and uses them to differentiate how well particular economic theories perform or fail to do so. On the determination of aggregate demand, this book presents two approaches: the traditional IS-LM analysis under the assumption that the money supply is exogenous because the central bank uses its monetary policy to control it, and the emerging IS-IRT analysis under the assumption that the interest rate is the exogenous monetary policy variable set by the central bank to manipulate aggregate demand in the economy. The IS-IRT analysis is important for the macro analyses of many economies, yet is totally neglected in most textbooks on macroeconomics. The chapter on Paradigms in Economics introduces students to the heritage of ideas in macroeconomics, and the evolution of ideas and approaches over the last two centuries. It also provides the justification for the simultaneous relevance of both Classical ideas and Keynesian ones. The two growth theory chapters go beyond the Solow growth model to cover the broad evolution of growth from Malthus's theory to the present endogenous approaches, and the link between money supply, inflation and growth over very long periods.",Business & Economics,611,N/A,0,en
Mastering the Discipline of Bible Study,Jenai J. Rasmussen Ed.D.,WestBow Press,2022-07-22,"This work, along with the other volumes in the Foundational Knowledge of the Bible series, can help those who are young in the faith to seek a Christian relationship with God. All who choose to enter into the new covenant must concurrently embrace a new perceptual field. By heeding God’s call to service, believers embark upon a Christian journey to become wise from the application of spiritual knowledge. This is made possible with the indwelling of the Holy Spirit who guides covenant believers in the faithful word of God, which is the source of all spiritual truth in this world. The intended purpose presented in this plan of action is to speak the truth of God in love so that the brethren can learn godly discernment, be equipped with sound doctrine, and grow together in all things according to Christ’s authoritative leadership (Eph. 4:15). By becoming covenant Christians set apart by God for his particular use, we can be diligent by precisely and accurately handling the word of truth (2 Tim. 2:15). This series can serve to edify and ground those who are new in the faith because the revelation of God provides all the essential answers to life’s pressing spiritual questions, whether general or specific. Accordingly, Christ’s disciples need to comprehend the questions before the answers can have real meaning. No greater reason can be given for studying the Bible. Therefore, the people of God are duty-bound to master this Christian discipline. The first volume in this series is divided into three phases of Bible study: “Why” addresses the importance of knowing God’s word, study motivations, conditions for discipleship, Christian distinctions, and the attributes needed to study biblical truth. “How” covers preliminary actions, Bible versions, principles, study considerations, and necessary skills. “What” offers a unique sevenfold framework for understanding the Bible. Divine power can move the Scriptures to be more than words on a page. It can become a life-changing force for good in the world. To that end, this resource directs the reader on how to inquire, search, and ask diligently concerning godly truth. Invaluable information, accessible resources, clear educational materials, and deep biblical insights will all quickly serve to establish beginning students in the Sacred Text. This work will also prepare the reader to receive the Scriptures by learning how to obtain a faithful accounting of spiritual truth. To be sure, wisdom is the result of applying biblical knowledge to our lives. By speaking divine truth in love, believers can grow together in Christ as fellow workers who labor in the word of God. There is no greater work in this world than to share this life-saving truth with others. The obligation of receiving divine knowledge requires that it be shared. Truly, giving the hope and joy that is found in Jesus Christ, and the message he brought from the Father, is the greatest privilege of a human life. Amen, and amen.",Religion,1543,N/A,0,en

Beer and Circus,Murray Sperber,Macmillan,2001-09,"In this fascinating book, Sperber uses original research culled from students, faculty, and administrators around the country, to argue that what universities offer instead of a meaningful undergraduate education is a meager and dangerous substitute: the party scene surrounding college sports that Sperber calls ""beer and circus"" and which serves to keep the students happy while tuition dollars keep rolling in. He explodes cherished myths about college sports, showing, for instance, that contrary to popular belief the money coming in to universities from sports programs never makes it to academic departments. Sperber's profound re-evaluation of college sports and higher education comes straight out of today's headlines and opens our eyes to a generation of students deprived of the education they deserve. Murray Sperber has been acknowledged for years as the country's leading authority on college sports and their role in American culture. In the wake of Indiana University's decision to fire head basketball coach Bobby Knight last year, Sperber was in constant demand across the country--on television, radio, and print media--to comment on the profound and tragic impact of big-time intercollegiate athletics on higher education.",Education,350,N/A,0,en

Rowe",N/A,2014,"This book fulfills the need of beginning legal researchers--and experienced researchers new to Florida sources--for concise explanations of Florida's essential legal resources. It combines information about specific sources with an introduction to research methods that will enable researchers to move beyond the sources described in the text as new legal research tools emerge. This fourth edition expands the treatment of online research using WestlawNext and Lexis Advance, as well as free or low-cost providers and governmental websites. The text emphasizes sources of Florida state law and includes references to analogous federal sources, making it a compact reference for planning both state and federal law research. The chapters have been reorganized so that the process of legal research is covered at the beginning of the book, along with concrete suggestions for organizing research in different media. A chapter on looseleaf services has been replaced with a new chapter covering a variety of practice tools, including blogs. The text also provides an overview of current citation rules for Florida sources. A new co-author, Jennifer LaVia, teaches at Florida State University College of Law, bringing insights to the needs of current Florida law students. This book is part of the Legal Research Series, edited by Suzanne E. Rowe, Director of Legal Research and Writing, University of Oregon School of Law. ""Barbara J. Busharis and Suzanne E. Rowe have written a fine book to teach [the] basics. It should be in every library that supports Florida research. Overall, their book is excellent. It is well-written, well-planned, and extremely useful."" -- Legal Information ALERT, on the second edition""[A] concise, no-nonsense book that will both educate lawyers anew as well as remind them about what they once knew on everything from the basics to the truly obscure...

"Women, Motherhood and Living with HIV/AIDS",Pranee Liamputtong,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-03-12,"There are about 34 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS. Half are women. There has been a dramatic global increase in the rates of women living with HIV/AIDS. Among young women, especially in developing countries, infection rates are rapidly increasing. Many of these women are also mothers with young infants. When a woman is labeled as having HIV, she is treated with suspicion and her morality is being questioned. Previous research has suggested that women living with HIV/AIDS can be affected by delay in diagnosis, inferior access to health care services, internalized stigma and a poor utilization of health services. This makes it extremely difficult for women to take care of their own health needs. Women are also reluctant to disclose their HIV-positive status as they fear this may result in physical feelings of shame, social ostracism, violence, or expulsion from home. Women living with HIV/AIDS who are also mothers carry a particularly heavy burden of being HIV-infected. This unique book attempts to put together results from empirical research and focuses on issues relevant to women, motherhood and living with HIV/AIDS which have occurred to individual women in different parts of the globe. The book comprises chapters written by researchers who carry out their projects in different parts of the world, and each chapter contains empirical information based on real life situations. This can be used as evidence for health care providers to implement socially and culturally appropriate services to assist individuals and groups who are living with HIV/AIDS in many societies. The book is of interest to scholars and students in the domains of anthropology, sociology, social work, nursing, public health & medicine and health professionals who have a specific interest in issues concerning women who are mothers and living with HIV/AIDS from cross-cultural perspective.",Social Science,324,N/A,0,en

Helgoland,Carlo Rovelli,Penguin,2021-05-25,"Named a Best Book of 2021 by the Financial Times and a Best Science Book of 2021 by The Guardian “Rovelli is a genius and an amazing communicator… This is the place where science comes to life.” ―Neil Gaiman “One of the warmest, most elegant and most lucid interpreters to the laity of the dazzling enigmas of his discipline...[a] momentous book” ―John Banville, The Wall Street Journal A startling new look at quantum theory, from the New York Times bestselling author of Seven Brief Lessons on Physics, The Order of Time, and Anaximander. One of the world's most renowned theoretical physicists, Carlo Rovelli has entranced millions of readers with his singular perspective on the cosmos. In Helgoland, he examines the enduring enigma of quantum theory. The quantum world Rovelli describes is as beautiful as it is unnerving. Helgoland is a treeless island in the North Sea where the twenty-three-year-old Werner Heisenberg made the crucial breakthrough for the creation of quantum mechanics, setting off a century of scientific revolution. Full of alarming ideas (ghost waves, distant objects that seem to be magically connected, cats that appear both dead and alive), quantum physics has led to countless discoveries and technological advancements. Today our understanding of the world is based on this theory, yet it is still profoundly mysterious. As scientists and philosophers continue to fiercely debate the meaning of the theory, Rovelli argues that its most unsettling contradictions can be explained by seeing the world as fundamentally made of relationships rather than substances. We and everything around us exist only in our interactions with one another. This bold idea suggests new directions for thinking about the structure of reality and even the nature of consciousness. Rovelli makes learning about quantum mechanics an almost psychedelic experience. Shifting our perspective once again, he takes us on a riveting journey through the universe so we can better comprehend our place in it.",Science,258,N/A,0,en

Effective Notetaking,Fiona McPherson,Wayz Press,2012-07-01,"You can predict how well a student will do simply on the basis of their use of effective study strategies. This book is for college students who are serious about being successful in study, and teachers who want to know how best to help their students learn. Being a successful student is far more about being a smart user of effective strategies than about being 'smart'. Research has shown it is possible to predict how well a student will do simply on the basis of their use of study strategies. This workbook looks at the most important group of study strategies – how to take notes (with advice on how to read a textbook and how to prepare for a lecture). You’ll be shown how to: * format your notes * use headings and highlighting * how to write different types of text summaries and pictorial ones, including concept maps and mind maps (you'll find out the difference, and the pros and cons of each) * ask the right questions * make the right connections * review your notes * evaluate text to work out which strategy is appropriate. There's advice on individual differences and learning styles, and on how to choose the strategies that are right for both you and the situation. Using effective notetaking strategies will help you remember what you read. It will help you understand more, and set you on the road to becoming an expert (or at least getting good grades!). Successful studying isn’t about hours put in, it’s about spending your time wisely. You want to study smarter not harder. As always with the Mempowered books, this thorough (and fully referenced) workbook doesn't re-hash the same tired advice that's been peddled for so long. Rather, Effective Notetaking builds on the latest cognitive and educational research to help you study for success. This 3rd edition has advance organizers and multi-choice review questions for each chapter, plus some additional material on multimedia learning, and taking notes in lectures.

Remaking the American Patient,Nancy Tomes,UNC Press Books,2016-01-06,"In a work that spans the twentieth century, Nancy Tomes questions the popular — and largely unexamined — idea that in order to get good health care, people must learn to shop for it. Remaking the American Patient explores the consequences of the consumer economy and American medicine having come of age at exactly the same time. Tracing the robust development of advertising, marketing, and public relations within the medical profession and the vast realm we now think of as “health care,” Tomes considers what it means to be a “good” patient. As she shows, this history of the coevolution of medicine and consumer culture tells us much about our current predicament over health care in the United States. Understanding where the shopping model came from, why it was so long resisted in medicine, and why it finally triumphed in the late twentieth century helps explain why, despite striking changes that seem to empower patients, so many Americans remain unhappy and confused about their status as patients today.",Medical,560,N/A,0,en

Distracted,James M. Lang,Basic Books,2020-10-20,"Keeping students focused can be difficult in a world filled with distractions—which is why a renowned educator created a scientific solution to one of every teacher's biggest problems. Why is it so hard to get students to pay attention? Conventional wisdom blames iPhones, insisting that access to technology has ruined students' ability to focus. The logical response is to ban electronics in class. But acclaimed educator James M. Lang argues that this solution obscures a deeper problem: how we teach is often at odds with how students learn. Classrooms are designed to force students into long periods of intense focus, but emerging science reveals that the brain is wired for distraction. We learn best when able to actively seek and synthesize new information. In Distracted, Lang rethinks the practice of teaching, revealing how educators can structure their classrooms less as distraction-free zones and more as environments where they can actively cultivate their students' attention. Brimming with ideas and grounded in new research, Distracted offers an innovative plan for the most important lesson of all: how to learn.",Education,254,N/A,0,en

First Ladies,Betty Caroli,Oxford University Press,2010-07-15,"Betty Boyd Caroli's engrossing and informative First Ladies is both a captivating read and an essential resource for anyone interested in the role of America's First Ladies. This expanded and updated fourth edition includes Laura Bush's tenure, Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential bid, and an in-depth look at Michelle Obama, one of the most charismatic and appealing First Ladies in recent history. Covering all forty-one women from Martha Washington to Michelle Obama and including the daughters, daughters-in-law, and sisters of presidents who sometimes served as First Ladies, Caroli explores each woman's background, marriage, and accomplishments and failures in office. This remarkably diverse lot included Abigail Adams, whose ""remember the ladies"" became a twentieth-century feminist refrain; Jane Pierce, who prayed her husband would lose the election; Helen Taft, who insisted on living in the White House, although her husband would have preferred a judgeship; Eleanor Roosevelt, who epitomized the politically involved First Lady; and Pat Nixon, who perfected what some have called ""the robot image."" They ranged in age from early 20s to late 60s; some received superb educations for their time, while others had little or no schooling. Including the courageous and adventurous, the emotionally unstable, the ambitious, and the reserved, these women often did not fit the traditional expectations of a presidential helpmate. Here then is an engaging portrait of how each First Lady changed the role and how the role changed in response to American culture. These women left remarkably complete records, and their stories offer us a window through which to view not only this particular sorority of women, but also American women in general. ""Impressive...Caroli's profiles and observations of American first ladies and their relationship to the media are intelligent and perceptive."" --Philadelphia Inquirer",History,495,N/A,0,en

Indirect Action,Lisa Diedrich,U of Minnesota Press,2016-12-19,"The experience of illness (both mental and physical) figures prominently in the critical thought and activism of the 1960s and 1970s, though it is largely overshadowed by practices of sexuality. Lisa Diedrich explores how and why illness was indeed so significant to the social, political, and institutional transformation beginning in the 1960s through the emergence of AIDS in the United States. A rich intervention—both theoretical and methodological, political and therapeutic—Indirect Action illuminates the intersection of illness, thought, and politics. Not merely a revision of the history of this time period, Indirect Action expands the historiographical boundaries through which illness and health activism in the United States have been viewed. Diedrich explores the multiplicity illness–thought–politics through an array of subjects: queering the origin story of AIDS activism by recalling its feminist history; exploring health activism and the medical experience; analyzing psychiatry and self-help movements; thinking ecologically about counterpractices of generalism in science and medicine; and considering the experience and event of epilepsy and the witnessing of schizophrenia. Indirect Action places illness in the leading role in the production of thought during the emergence of AIDS, ultimately showing the critical interconnectedness of illness and political and critical thought.",Social Science,330,N/A,0,en

The Cambridge Handbook of Environmental Justice and Sustainable Development,"Sumudu A. Atapattu, Carmen G. Gonzalez, Sara L. Seck",Cambridge University Press,2021-04-01,"Despite the global endorsement of the Sustainable Development Goals, environmental justice struggles are growing all over the world. These struggles are not isolated injustices, but symptoms of interlocking forms of oppression that privilege the few while inflicting misery on the many and threatening ecological collapse. This handbook offers critical perspectives on the multi-dimensional, intersectional nature of environmental injustice and the cross-cutting forms of oppression that unite and divide these struggles, including gender, race, poverty, and indigeneity. The work sheds new light on the often-neglected social dimension of sustainability and its relationship to human rights and environmental justice. Using a variety of legal frameworks and case studies from around the world, this volume illustrates the importance of overcoming the fragmentation of these legal frameworks and social movements in order to develop holistic solutions that promote justice and protect the planet's ecosystems at a time of intensifying economic and ecological crisis.",Political Science,841,N/A,0,en
Toward a Composition Made Whole,Jody L. Shipka,University of Pittsburgh Pre,2011-04-30,"To many academics, composition still represents typewritten texts on 8.5"" x 11"" pages that follow rote argumentative guidelines. In Toward a Composition Made Whole, Jody Shipka views composition as an act of communication that can be expressed through any number of media and as a path to meaning-making. Her study offers an in-depth examination of multimodality via the processes, values, structures, and semiotic practices people employ every day to compose and communicate their thoughts. Shipka counters current associations that equate multimodality only with computer, digitized, or screen-mediated texts, which are often self-limiting. She stretches the boundaries of composition to include a hybridization of aural, visual, and written forms. Shipka analyzes the work of current scholars in multimodality and combines this with recent writing theory to create her own teaching framework. Among her methods, Shipka employs process-oriented reflection and a statement of goals and choices to prepare students to compose using various media in ways that spur their rhetorical and material awareness. They are encouraged to produce unusual text forms while also learning to understand the composition process as a whole. Shipka presents several case studies of students working in multimodal composition and explains the strategies, tools, and spaces they employ. She then offers methods to critically assess multimodal writing projects. Toward a Composition Made Whole challenges theorists and compositionists to further investigate communication practices and broaden the scope of writing to include all composing methods. While Shipka views writing as crucial to discourse, she challenges us to always consider the various purposes that writing serves.",Language Arts & Disciplines,202,N/A,0,en

The Sum of Us,Heather McGhee,One World,2022-02-08,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • LONGLISTED FOR THE NATIONAL BOOK AWARD • One of today’s most insightful and influential thinkers offers a powerful exploration of inequality and the lesson that generations of Americans have failed to learn: Racism has a cost for everyone—not just for people of color. WINNER OF THE PORCHLIGHT BUSINESS BOOK AWARD • ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: Time, The Washington Post, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Ms. magazine, BookRiot, Library Journal “This is the book I’ve been waiting for.”—Ibram X. Kendi, #1 New York Times bestselling author of How to Be an Antiracist Look for the author’s podcast, The Sum of Us, based on this book! Heather McGhee’s specialty is the American economy—and the mystery of why it so often fails the American public. From the financial crisis of 2008 to rising student debt to collapsing public infrastructure, she found a root problem: racism in our politics and policymaking. But not just in the most obvious indignities for people of color. Racism has costs for white people, too. It is the common denominator of our most vexing public problems, the core dysfunction of our democracy and constitutive of the spiritual and moral crises that grip us all. But how did this happen? And is there a way out? McGhee embarks on a deeply personal journey across the country from Maine to Mississippi to California, tallying what we lose when we buy into the zero-sum paradigm—the idea that progress for some of us must come at the expense of others. Along the way, she meets white people who confide in her about losing their homes, their dreams, and their shot at better jobs to the toxic mix of American racism and greed. This is the story of how public goods in this country—from parks and pools to functioning schools—have become private luxuries; of how unions collapsed, wages stagnated, and inequality increased; and of how this country, unique among the world’s advanced economies, has thwarted universal healthcare. But in unlikely places of worship and work, McGhee finds proof of what she calls the Solidarity Dividend: the benefits we gain when people come together across race to accomplish what we simply can’t do on our own. The Sum of Us is not only a brilliant analysis of how we arrived here but also a heartfelt message, delivered with startling empathy, from a black woman to a multiracial America. It leaves us with a new vision for a future in which we finally realize that life can be more than a zero-sum game. LONGLISTED FOR THE ANDREW CARNEGIE MEDAL",Social Science,465,N/A,0,en

But her parents felt differently. Giving her a name meaning “Courageous Hero,” they encouraged her love of learning and science.

The Roosevelt Women,Betty Boyd Caroli,Basic Books,2018-02-27,"The Roosevelt name conjures up images of powerful Presidents and dashing men of high society. But few people know much about the extraordinary network of women that held the Roosevelt clan together through war, scandal, and disease. In The Roosevelt Women, Betty Boyd Caroli weaves together stories culled from a rich store of letters, memoirs, and interviews to chronicle nine extraordinary Roosevelt women across a century and a half of turbulent history. She examines the Roosevelt women as mothers, daughters, wives, and, beyond that, as world travelers, authors, campaigners, and socialites -- in short, as themselves. She reveals how they demonstrated the energy and intellectual curiosity that defined their famous family, as well as the roles they played in the intrigues, scandals, and accomplishments that were hallmarks of the Roosevelt clan. From the much maligned Sara Delano (who sired Franklin and by turns terrified and supported Eleanor) to Theodore's irrepressible daughter, Alice (""I can either rule the country or control Alice,"" Teddy once said) to the beloved Bamie, who was the only mother Alice ever knew, and the model of everything she never was in life, to the exceptionally beautiful but ultimately overwhelmed Mittie, Theodore's mother, The Roosevelt Women is an intricate portrait of bold and talented women, a grand tale of both unbearable tragedies and triumphant achievements.",Biography & Autobiography,635,N/A,0,en

Mutiny on the Rising Sun,Jared Ross Hardesty,NYU Press,2021-10-19,"A little-known story of mutiny and murder illustrating the centrality of smuggling and slavery in early American society On the night of June 1, 1743, terror struck the schooner Rising Sun. After completing a routine smuggling voyage where the crew sold enslaved Africans in exchange for chocolate, sugar, and coffee in the Dutch colony of Suriname, the ship traveled eastward along the South American coast. Believing there was an opportunity to steal the lucrative cargo and make a new life for themselves, three sailors snuck below deck, murdered four people, and seized control of the vessel. Mutiny on the Rising Sun recounts the origins, events, and eventual fate of the Rising Sun’s final smuggling voyage in vivid detail. Starting from that horrible night in June 1743, it narrates a deeply human history of smuggling, providing an incredible story of those caught in the webs spun by illicit commerce. The case generated a rich documentary record that illuminates an international chocolate smuggling ring, the lives of the crew and mutineers, and the harrowing experience of the enslaved people trafficked by the Rising Sun. Smuggling stood at the center of the lives of everyone involved with the business of the schooner. Larger forces, such as imperial trade restrictions, created the conditions for smuggling, but individual actors, often driven by raw ambition and with little regard for the consequences of their actions, designed, refined, and perpetuated this illicit commerce. At once startling and captivating, Mutiny on the Rising Sun shows how illegal trade created demand for exotic products like chocolate, and how slavery and smuggling were integral to the development of American capitalism.",History,278,N/A,0,en

Writing With Power,Peter Elbow,Oxford University Press,1998-07-09,"A classic handbook for anyone who needs to write, Writing With Power speaks to everyone who has wrestled with words while seeking to gain power with them. Here, Peter Elbow emphasizes that the essential activities underlying good writing and the essential exercises promoting it are really not difficult at all. Employing a cookbook approach, Elbow provides the reader (and writer) with various recipes: for getting words down on paper, for revising, for dealing with an audience, for getting feedback on a piece of writing, and still other recipes for approaching the mystery of power in writing. In a new introduction, he offers his reflections on the original edition, discusses the responses from people who have followed his techniques, how his methods may differ from other processes, and how his original topics are still pertinent to today's writer. By taking risks and embracing mistakes, Elbow hopes the writer may somehow find a hold on the creative process and be able to heighten two mentalities--the production of writing and the revision of it. From students and teachers to novelists and poets, Writing with Power reminds us that we can celebrate the uses of mystery, chaos, nonplanning, and magic, while achieving analysis, conscious control, explicitness, and care in whatever it is we set down on paper.",Language Arts & Disciplines,414,4.5,2,en

The Game of School,Robert L. Fried,Jossey-Bass,2005-04-13,"Students play it, teachers perpetuate it, parents condone it, principals endorse it, and governments legislate it. The ""game of school"" is that familiar scenario where students' natural curiosity and desire to learn are replaced with a frantic rush (or a compliant shrug) to do the work, please the teacher, and get the grades. This game is easy to master, but exerts a high price. Can we afford to pay the price in wasted time and idle minds? In this compelling book, Robert L. Fried shows how we can change the rules of the game, reclaim and refocus the learning experience, and ultimately bring joy back into the classroom. The Game of School is filled with interviews and stories of teachers and students who are struggling to put the game of school behind them and engage in authentic learning. We experience the excitement of the first day of first grade; listen to urban teens discuss Shakespeare's Othello; and meet a college student who is beginning to question her long disengagement with learning. We are introduced to seven types of learners—from ""go-getters"" to ""pluggers"" to ""rebels""—and find out how the game shapes their relationship to schooling and life. The Game of School offers workable solutions that take into account the reality of a culture consumed with testing, accountability, and the race for college. Fried redefines our common ideas of discipline, curriculum, instruction, grading, motivation, and family involvement in ways that enhance true learning and diminish the game's stranglehold on our curiosity and will. He argues that classrooms are more easily ""managed"" in a climate of mutual respect, and students are eager for ""instruction"" when it is challenging and engaging. His ""Joy and Misery Index"" serves to remind teachers of what really matters most in the classroom. Thoughtful and inspiring, The Game of School offers suggestions and ideas for teachers, parents, and students who want to free themselves from the ever-tightening grip of a game in which even winners end up losing.",Education,248,N/A,0,en

Jesus Christ: The Real Story,United Church of God,United Church of God,2018-01-02,"The story of Jesus Christ goes much deeper than His crucifixion and resurrection. Few will dispute that a man named Jesus Christ lived 2,000 years ago and that He was a great teacher who impacted the world. Christ made a controversial claim—that He was the very Son of God, the long-prophesied Messiah—causing religious authorities in Jerusalem to reject Him, hate Him and eventually succeeded in having Him put to death. Likewise, the local Roman civil authorities also saw Him as a threat and became complicit in His execution. The religions of His day, both Judaism and paganism, opposed the growth of His teachings and used unlawful and violent means to try to destroy the Church He founded. The government of Rome also came to vigorously persecute the followers of this Jewish teacher from Galilee. Today, there is much confusion and questions concerning this controversial figure. Where can you go for the answers? The Bible. This Bible Study aid booklet, ""Jesus Christ: The Real Story"" will help explain what is written in the Bible about Jesus Christ. You can discover the answers to these questions and more: Who was Jesus Christ of Nazareth? Where did He come from? When was Jesus Christ born? What did Jesus teach? Was He God in the flesh? What did Jesus look like? Was He only a man? Why did He die? Discover the true, fascinating story that so few understand. The story of the greatest Man who ever lived and the misunderstood message He preached—the gospel (good news) of the coming Kingdom of God! Chapters in this ebook: -- Introduction - Jesus Christ: The Real Story -- Who—and What—Was Jesus Christ? -- Jesus Christ's Disciples Understood Him to Be the Creator -- Jesus Christ: 'The Rock' of the Old Testament -- The Family of God -- Jesus' Amazing Fulfillment of Prophecy -- The Bible Prophesied the Exact Year the Messiah Would Appear -- Was Jesus Born on Dec. 25? -- A Sinless and Miraculous Life -- Could Jesus Perform Miracles? -- Did Jesus Really Die and Live Again? -- Roman Forms of Crucifixion -- When Was Jesus Christ Crucified and Resurrected? -- The Chronology of the Crucifixion and Resurrection -- Do Other Nonbiblical Sources Confirm Jesus Christ's Existence? -- Much More Than a Man -- Was Jesus a Created Being? -- The God Who Became a Human Being -- Jesus' Family Connections -- Did Jesus Have Long Hair? -- The Messiah's Misunderstood Mission -- What Do 'Messiah' and 'Jesus Christ' Mean? -- What Was Jesus' Gospel? -- Salvation Is Entrance Into the Kingdom of God -- Other Names for the Kingdom -- Jesus' Teaching on God's Law -- Other Important Ways Jesus Fulfilled the Law -- Christ's New Commandment -- Does the New Covenant Abolish the Commandments? -- Jesus Christ and the Festivals of the Bible -- Who Killed Jesus? -- Jesus Christ, the Wisdom of God -- The Tearing of the Temple Veil -- Alive Again Today and Forever -- Your Date With Destiny: Meeting the Real Jesus -- 'Even So, Come, Lord Jesus!' Inside this Bible Study Aid ebook: ""Perhaps the boldest claim Jesus made about His identity was the statement, “Most assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM” (John:8:58)...What was going on here? Jesus was revealing His identity as the actual One whom the Jews knew as God in the Old Testament."" ""The New Testament writers cite messianic prophecies from the Old Testament more than 130 times. By some estimates the Old Testament contains 300 prophetic passages that describe who the Messiah is and what He will do. Of these, 60 are major prophecies. What are the chances of these prophecies being fulfilled in one person?"" ""A careful analysis of Scripture, however, clearly indicates that December 25 is an unlikely date for Christ’s birth.

Waging Peace in Vietnam,"Ron Carver, David Cortright, Barbara Doherty",New Village Press,2019-09-10,"How American soldiers opposed and resisted the war in Vietnam While mainstream narratives of the Vietnam War all but marginalize anti-war activity of soldiers, opposition and resistance from within the three branches of the military made a real difference to the course of America’s engagement in Vietnam. By 1968, every major peace march in the United States was led by active duty GIs and Vietnam War veterans. By 1970, thousands of active duty soldiers and marines were marching in protest in US cities. Hundreds of soldiers and marines in Vietnam were refusing to fight; tens of thousands were deserting to Canada, France and Sweden. Eventually the US Armed Forces were no longer able to sustain large-scale offensive operations and ceased to be effective. Yet this history is largely unknown and has been glossed over in much of the written and visual remembrances produced in recent years. Waging Peace in Vietnam shows how the GI movement unfolded, from the numerous anti-war coffee houses springing up outside military bases, to the hundreds of GI newspapers giving an independent voice to active soldiers, to the stockade revolts and the strikes and near-mutinies on naval vessels and in the air force. The book presents first-hand accounts, oral histories, and a wealth of underground newspapers, posters, flyers, and photographs documenting the actions of GIs and veterans who took part in the resistance. In addition, the book features fourteen original essays by leading scholars and activists. Notable contributors include Vietnam War scholar and author, Christian Appy, and Mme Nguyen Thi Binh, who played a major role in the Paris Peace Accord. The book originates from the exhibition Waging Peace, which has been shown in Vietnam and the University of Notre Dame, and will be touring the eastern United States in conjunction with book launches in Boston, Amherst, and New York.",History,256,N/A,0,en

The Social Impact of AIDS in the United States,"National Research Council, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Commission on Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Panel on Monitoring the Social Impact of the AIDS Epidemic",National Academies Press,1993-02-01,"Europe's ""Black Death"" contributed to the rise of nation states, mercantile economies, and even the Reformation. Will the AIDS epidemic have similar dramatic effects on the social and political landscape of the twenty-first century? This readable volume looks at the impact of AIDS since its emergence and suggests its effects in the next decade, when a million or more Americans will likely die of the disease. The Social Impact of AIDS in the United States addresses some of the most sensitive and controversial issues in the public debate over AIDS. This landmark book explores how AIDS has affected fundamental policies and practices in our major institutions, examining: How America's major religious organizations have dealt with sometimes conflicting values: the imperative of care for the sick versus traditional views of homosexuality and drug use. Hotly debated public health measures, such as HIV antibody testing and screening, tracing of sexual contacts, and quarantine. The potential risk of HIV infection to and from health care workers. How AIDS activists have brought about major change in the way new drugs are brought to the marketplace. The impact of AIDS on community-based organizations, from volunteers caring for individuals to the highly political ACT-UP organization. Coping with HIV infection in prisons. Two case studies shed light on HIV and the family relationship. One reports on some efforts to gain legal recognition for nonmarital relationships, and the other examines foster care programs for newborns with the HIV virus. A case study of New York City details how selected institutions interact to give what may be a picture of AIDS in the future. This clear and comprehensive presentation will be of interest to anyone concerned about AIDS and its impact on the country: health professionals, sociologists, psychologists, advocates for at-risk populations, and interested individuals.",Medical,337,N/A,0,en

Torn,Justin Lee,Jericho Books,2012-11-13,"An evangelical Christian examines the impact of sexuality, the LGBTQ+ movement, and the future of the church in this thoughtful, deeply researched guide to navigating and mending the social and political division in our families and churches. As a teenager and young man, Justin Lee felt deeply torn. Nicknamed ""God Boy"" by his peers, he knew that he was called to a life in the evangelical Christian ministry. But Lee harbored a secret: He also knew that he was gay. In this groundbreaking book, Lee recalls the events--his coming out to his parents, his experiences with the ""ex-gay"" movement, and his in-depth study of the Bible--that led him, eventually, to self-acceptance. But more than just a memoir, TORN provides insightful, practical guidance for all committed Christians who wonder how to relate to gay friends or family members--or who struggle with their own sexuality. Convinced that ""in a culture that sees gays and Christians as enemies, gay Christians are in a unique position to bring peace,"" Lee demonstrates that people of faith on both sides of the debate can respect, learn from, and love one another.",Religion,277,4.5,2,en

Here’s a resource that uses language non-catalogers can understand and provides hands-on, user-friendly training in LCSH.

Several chapters concentrate on assigning LCSH to resources of a certain focus or genre: fiction works, biographical works (or works that focus heavily on a certain person or their works), and resources that emphasize a geographic location. A separate chapter on encoding subject information in the Machine-Readable Cataloging (MARC) standard will be particularly useful for library staff.

Bridge to Haven,Francine Rivers,"Tyndale House Publishers, Inc.",2014-04-22,"A New York Times, USA Today, and Publishers Weekly bestseller! In this riveting saga of temptation, grace, and unconditional love, the New York Times bestselling author of Redeeming Love and The Masterpiece delivers big-canvas storytelling at its very best. To those who matter in 1950s Hollywood, Lena Scott is the hottest rising star to hit the silver screen since Marilyn Monroe. Few know her real name is Abra. Even fewer know the price she’s paid to finally feel like she’s somebody. To Pastor Ezekiel Freeman, Abra will always be the little girl who stole his heart the night he found her, a wailing newborn abandoned under a bridge on the outskirts of Haven. Zeke and his son, Joshua—Abra’s closest friend—watch her grow into an exotic beauty. But Zeke knows the circumstances surrounding her birth have etched scars deep in her heart, scars that leave her vulnerable to a fast-talking charmer who lures her to Tinseltown. Hollywood feels like a million miles from Haven, and naive Abra quickly learns what’s expected of an ambitious girl with stars in her eyes. But fame comes at a devastating price. She has burned every bridge to get exactly what she thought she wanted. Now all she wants is a way back home. “One of the edgiest Christian romances I have had the pleasure of reading in a long while. Francine Rivers has woven a deeply moving story with an adept hand that knows just how to layer humanity, in all its beautiful and ugly truth, into almost every individual who steps onto the page.” —USA Today’s Happy Ever After Blog “This is another compelling and moving story by one of the genre’s most honored and talented writers.” —Library Journal, starred review “Rivers returns with a page-turning recasting of the story of the prodigal son, here a prodigal daughter. . . . This story arc will be particularly resonant for Christian readers, but Rivers has the writing ability to reel in others who enjoy a well-told tale of redemption.” —Publishers Weekly",Fiction,339,N/A,0,en
Simulation and Its Discontents,Sherry Turkle,MIT Press,2009-04-17,"How the simulation and visualization technologies so pervasive in science, engineering, and design have changed our way of seeing the world. Over the past twenty years, the technologies of simulation and visualization have changed our ways of looking at the world. In Simulation and Its Discontents, Sherry Turkle examines the now dominant medium of our working lives and finds that simulation has become its own sensibility. We hear it in Turkle's description of architecture students who no longer design with a pencil, of science and engineering students who admit that computer models seem more “real” than experiments in physical laboratories. Echoing architect Louis Kahn's famous question, “What does a brick want?”, Turkle asks, “What does simulation want?” Simulations want, even demand, immersion, and the benefits are clear. Architects create buildings unimaginable before virtual design; scientists determine the structure of molecules by manipulating them in virtual space; physicians practice anatomy on digitized humans. But immersed in simulation, we are vulnerable. There are losses as well as gains. Older scientists describe a younger generation as “drunk with code.” Young scientists, engineers, and designers, full citizens of the virtual, scramble to capture their mentors' tacit knowledge of buildings and bodies. From both sides of a generational divide, there is anxiety that in simulation, something important is slipping away. Turkle's examination of simulation over the past twenty years is followed by four in-depth investigations of contemporary simulation culture: space exploration, oceanography, architecture, and biology.",Computers,233,N/A,0,en

PWN the SAT: Math Guide,Mike McClenathan,"PWN Test Prep, LLC",2016-02-17,"PWN is back, and better than ever. The PWN the SAT Math Guide was created to help ambitious, highly motivated kids maximize their SAT math scores. Do you crave a higher score? Are you willing to do a little hard work to achieve it? Good. I knew I liked you. Read this book from beginning to end, with a pencil in hand and a calculator and an Official SAT Study Guide by your side. When you’re done, you’ll be able to approach the SAT with confidence—very few questions will surprise you, and even fewer will be able to withstand your withering attacks. Stand tall, intrepid student. Destiny awaits. Updated for the New SAT This new edition of the Math Guide has been updated, rather painstakingly, to reflect the realities of the new SAT coming March 2016. This book was not rushed to market to take advantage of interest in the new exam. I took my time, and hopefully I got it right. Chapters are broken into five major sections: Techniques, Heart of Algebra, Passport to Advanced Math, Problem Solving and Data Analysis, and Additional Topics in Math. Each chapter concludes with a reference list of similar questions from official practice tests. Practice questions are designated as either “Calculator” or “No calculator.” Students will be forbidden from using their calculators for one whole section of the new SAT. Emphasis is placed on nimbleness—the ability to approach problems in multiple ways to find the one that works best. Calculator solutions and shortcuts are provided where appropriate. Join me online Readers of this book are encouraged to register as Math Guide Owners at the PWN the SAT website. There will be video solutions and other bonus content there.

Guidelines for Diagnosing and Managing Disseminated Histoplasmosis Among People Living with HIV,Pan American Pan American Health Organization,N/A,2020-06-18,"Histoplasmosis is a disease caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. This disease is highly endemic in some regions of North America, Central America, and South America and is also reported in certain countries of Asia and Africa. It often affects people with impaired immunity, including people living with HIV, among whom the most frequent clinical presentation is disseminated histoplasmosis. The symptoms of disseminated histoplasmosis are non-specific and may be indistinguishable from those of other infectious diseases, especially disseminated tuberculosis (TB), thus complicating diagnosis and treatment. Histoplasmosis is one of the most frequent opportunistic infections caused by fungal pathogens among people living with HIV in the Americas and may be responsible for 5-15% of AIDS-related deaths every year in this Region. These guidelines aim to provide recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of disseminated histoplasmosis in persons living with HIV. Although the burden of disease is concentrated in the Americas, the recommendations presented within these guidelines are applicable globally. These guidelines were produced in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) handbook for guideline development. The Guideline Development Group elaborated the final recommendations based on a systematic review of scientific literature and critical evaluation of the evidence available using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. These guidelines are intended for health-care providers, HIV program managers, policy-makers, national treatment advisory boards, researchers, and other professionals involved in caring for people who either have or may be at risk of developing disseminated histoplasmosis.",Child health services,56,N/A,0,en

Since its beginning in 1998, this conference is devoted to new approaches in learning with a focus on collaborative learning. Nowadays the ICL conferences are a forum of the exchange of relevant trends and research results as well as the presentation of practical experiences in Learning and Engineering Pedagogy. In this way, we try to bridge the gap between ‘pure’ scientific research and the everyday work of educators.

"Cicero, Philippic 2, 44–50, 78–92, 100–119",Ingo Gildenhard,Open Book Publishers,2018-09-03,"Cicero composed his incendiary Philippics only a few months after Rome was rocked by the brutal assassination of Julius Caesar. In the tumultuous aftermath of Caesar’s death, Cicero and Mark Antony found themselves on opposing sides of an increasingly bitter and dangerous battle for control. Philippic 2 was a weapon in that war. Conceived as Cicero’s response to a verbal attack from Antony in the Senate, Philippic 2 is a rhetorical firework that ranges from abusive references to Antony’s supposedly sordid sex life to a sustained critique of what Cicero saw as Antony’s tyrannical ambitions. Vituperatively brilliant and politically committed, it is both a carefully crafted literary artefact and an explosive example of crisis rhetoric. It ultimately led to Cicero’s own gruesome death. This course book offers a portion of the original Latin text, vocabulary aids, study questions, and an extensive commentary. Designed to stretch and stimulate readers, Ingo Gildenhard’s volume will be of particular interest to students of Latin studying for A-Level or on undergraduate courses. It extends beyond detailed linguistic analysis to encourage critical engagement with Cicero, his oratory, the politics of late-republican Rome, and the transhistorical import of Cicero’s politics of verbal (and physical) violence.",Literary Collections,331,N/A,0,en

"Tacitus, Annals, 15.20–23, 33–45","Mathew Owen, Ingo Gildenhard",Open Book Publishers,2013-09-23,"e emperor Nero is etched into the Western imagination as one of ancient Rome's most infamous villains, and Tacitus' Annals have played a central role in shaping the mainstream historiographical understanding of this flamboyant autocrat. This section of the text plunges us straight into the moral cesspool that Rome had apparently become in the later years of Nero's reign, chronicling the emperor's fledgling stage career including his plans for a grand tour of Greece; his participation in a city-wide orgy climaxing in his publicly consummated 'marriage' to his toy boy Pythagoras; the great fire of AD 64, during which large parts of central Rome went up in flames; and the rising of Nero's 'grotesque' new palace, the so-called 'Golden House', from the ashes of the city. This building project stoked the rumours that the emperor himself was behind the conflagration, and Tacitus goes on to present us with Nero's gruesome efforts to quell these mutterings by scapegoating and executing members of an unpopular new cult then starting to spread through the Roman empire: Christianity. All this contrasts starkly with four chapters focusing on one of Nero's most principled opponents, the Stoic senator Thrasea Paetus, an audacious figure of moral fibre, who courageously refuses to bend to the forces of imperial corruption and hypocrisy. This course book offers a portion of the original Latin text, study aids with vocabulary, and a commentary. Designed to stretch and stimulate readers, Owen's and Gildenhard's incisive commentary will be of particular interest to students of Latin at both A2 and undergraduate level. It extends beyond detailed linguistic analysis and historical background to encourage critical engagement with Tacitus' prose and discussion of the most recent scholarly thought.",History,280,N/A,0,en

Samson X-File,Hongkil Lee,Hongkil Lee,2024-06-08,"Many Christians grew up learning about Samson through Bible studies and sermons, yet confusion remains. Traditional narratives reflect Samson has a flawed hero or a failed judge, yet many interpretations provide more confusion than clarity.

Samson X-File goes beyond the simplicity of success and failure, instead exploring the profound implications of Samson’s dual calling by God—as both a Nazirite and a judge. It poses a critical question: ""Why did God choose Samson to embody these seemingly paradoxical roles?"" The story of Samson is my story and your story. Samson X-File will challenge readers how to live as a Christian in today’s generation. Samson X-File will help readers gain a sense of calling as His chosen children and our purpose in life.",Bibles,156,N/A,0,en

Mindfulness in Internet and New Media,"Wen-Ko Chiou, Chao Liu, Hao Chen, Shuhua Zhou",Frontiers Media SA,2023-10-24,"Mindfulness is about being aware in a certain way, being consciously aware on purpose, living in the present moment without mental judgment. In addition to the in-depth application of mindfulness in different subdisciplines of psychology (e.g., social, personality, clinical, developmental, health, organizational) there is also a trend toward cross-fertilization with other social and behavioral disciplines (e.g., design, kinesiology, sociology, family studies, education, anthropology, neuroscience, philosophy, economics, medicine, organizational science). However, the application of mindfulness in the field of communication is limited. With the rapid development of the Internet and new media, the study of Internet communication is growing rapidly. The Internet and new media make it easy to connect with others, explore a new world, and regard cyberspace as an extension of one’s own thoughts and personality. Nevertheless, when people use the Internet and new media mindless, they will easily experience the social effects on their virtual selves and encounter psychological problems (e.g. network morality, network anxiety, network pornography, network addiction, and cyberbullying), which has become a widespread and serious problem. As an important part of positive psychology, mindfulness intervention has been proved to help improve a series of negative psychological states and promote positive emotions and subjective well-being. However, what theoretical and practical contributions can mindfulness in the Internet and new media bring remains unknown. Thus, this Research Topic focuses on the influence and intervention of mindfulness on the psychological problems caused by the network new media communication. We welcome high-quality studies using a variety of research methods, including quantitative, qualitative, mixed methods, and reviews, on the second generation of mindfulness interventions and other meditation-based interventions (e.g., focused-attention meditation, transcendental meditation, and loving-kindness meditation). This Research Topic encourages submissions that cover but are not limited to the following topics: (1) The internet and new media-guided mindfulness and loving-kindness meditation practice (2) Mindfulness and interpersonal communication in the network (network trust, network security, network intimacy) (3) Mindfulness and network clustering behavior (4) Mindfulness and online consumer psychology (5) Mindfulness and cyber moral psychology (cyberbullying, cyber altruism, and prosocial behavior) (6) Mindfulness and online pornography (7) Mindfulness and internet addiction (8) Mindfulness and online psychological counseling (9) Mindfulness and new media anxiety",Science,175,N/A,0,en

Stamped from the Beginning,Ibram X. Kendi,Bold Type Books,2016-04-12,"The National Book Award winning history of how racist ideas were created, spread, and deeply rooted in American society. Some Americans insist that we're living in a post-racial society. But racist thought is not just alive and well in America -- it is more sophisticated and more insidious than ever. And as award-winning historian Ibram X. Kendi argues, racist ideas have a long and lingering history, one in which nearly every great American thinker is complicit. In this deeply researched and fast-moving narrative, Kendi chronicles the entire story of anti-black racist ideas and their staggering power over the course of American history. He uses the life stories of five major American intellectuals to drive this history: Puritan minister Cotton Mather, Thomas Jefferson, abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, W.E.B. Du Bois, and legendary activist Angela Davis. As Kendi shows, racist ideas did not arise from ignorance or hatred. They were created to justify and rationalize deeply entrenched discriminatory policies and the nation's racial inequities. In shedding light on this history, Stamped from the Beginning offers us the tools we need to expose racist thinking. In the process, he gives us reason to hope.",History,594,5,2,en

Fans of Jacqueline Woodson, Meg Medina, and Jason Reynolds will fall hard for this astonishing New York Times-bestselling novel-in-verse by an award-winning slam poet, about an Afro-Latina heroine who tells her story with blazing words and powerful truth. Xiomara Batista feels unheard and unable to hide in her Harlem neighborhood. Ever since her body grew into curves, she has learned to let her fists and her fierceness do the talking. But Xiomara has plenty she wants to say, and she pours all her frustration and passion onto the pages of a leather notebook, reciting the words to herself like prayers—especially after she catches feelings for a boy in her bio class named Aman, who her family can never know about. With Mami’s determination to force her daughter to obey the laws of the church, Xiomara understands that her thoughts are best kept to herself. So when she is invited to join her school’s slam poetry club, she doesn’t know how she could ever attend without her mami finding out. But she still can’t stop thinking about performing her poems. Because in the face of a world that may not want to hear her, Xiomara refuses to be silent. “Crackles with energy and snaps with authenticity and voice.” —Justina Ireland, author of Dread Nation “An incredibly potent debut.” —Jason Reynolds, author of the National Book Award Finalist Ghost “Acevedo has amplified the voices of girls en el barrio who are equal parts goddess, saint, warrior, and hero.” —Ibi Zoboi, author of American Street This young adult novel, a selection of the Schomburg Center's Black Liberation Reading List, is an excellent choice for accelerated tween readers in grades 6 to 8.

Parrot in the Oven,Victor Martinez,Harper Collins,2013-06-11,"Perico, or parrot, was what Dad called me sometimes. It was from a Mexican saying about a parrot that complains how hot it is in the shade, while all along he's sitting inside an oven and doesn't know it.... For Manuel Hernandez, the year leading up to his test of courage, his initiation into a gang, is a time filled with the pain and tension, awkwardness and excitement of growing up in a crazy world. His dad spends most of his time and money at the local pool hall; his brother flips through jobs like a thumb through a deck of cards; and his mom never stops cleaning the house, as though one day the rooms will be so spotless they'll disappear into a sparkle, and she'll be free. Manny's dad is always saying that people are like money--there are million- and thousand- and hundred-dollar people out there, and to him, Manny is just a penny. But Manny wants to be more than a penny, smarter than the parrot in the oven. He wants to find out what it means to be a vato firme, a guy to respect. In this beautifully written novel, Victor Martinez gives readers a vivid portrait of one Mexican-American boy's life. Manny's story is like a full-color home movie--sometimes funny, sometimes sad, but always intensely original.For Manuel Hernandez, the year leading up to his test of courage, his initiation into a gang, is a time filled with the pain and tension, awkwardness and excitement of growing up in a mixed-up, crazy world. Manny’s dad is always calling him el perico, or parrot. It’s from a Mexican saying about a parrot that complains how hot it is in the shade while all along he’s sitting inside the oven and doesn’t know it. But Manny wants to be smarter than the parrot in the oven—he wants to find out what it means to be a vato firme, a guy to respect. From an exciting new voice in Chicano literature, this is a beautifully written, vivid portrait of one Mexican-American boy’s life. 1998 Pura Belpre Author Award 1996 Americas Award for Children’s and Young Adult Literature 1997 Books for the Teen Age (NY Public Library) 1996 National Book Award for Young People’s Literature",Young Adult Fiction,148,N/A,0,en

Emergent Public Health Issues in the US-Mexico Border Region,"Cecilia Ballesteros Rosales, Scott Carter Carvajal, Jill Eileen Guernsey De Zapien",Frontiers Media SA,2017-02-16,"US-Mexico border region area has unique social, demographic and policy forces at work that shape the health of its residents as well as serves as a microcosm of migration health challenges facing an increasingly mobile and globalized world. This region reflects the largest migratory flow between any two nations in the world. Data from the Pew Research Center shows over the last 25 years there has never been lower than 140,000 annual immigrants from Mexico to the United States (with peaks over 700,000). This migratory route is extremely hazardous due to natural (e.g., arid and hot desert regions) and human made barriers as well as border enforcement practices tied to socio-political and geopolitical pressures. Also, reflecting the national interdependency of public health and human services needs, during the most recent five year period surveyed the migratory flow between the US and Mexico has equaled that of the flow of Mexico to the US--both around 1.4 million persons. Of particular public health concern, within the US-Mexico region of both nations there is among the highest disparities in income, education, infrastructure and access to health care--factors within the World Health Organization’s conceptualization of the Social Determinants of Health, and among the highest rates of chronic disease. For instance obesity and diabetes rates in this region are among the highest of those monitored in the world, with adult population estimates of the former over 40% and estimates in some population sub-groups for the latter over 20%. The publications reflected in this Research Topic, all reviewed from experts in the field, addressed many of the public health issues in the US Mexico Border Health Commission’s Healthy Border 2020 objectives. Those objectives-- broad public health goals used to guide a diverse range of government, research and community-based stakeholders--include Non Communicable Diseases (including adult and childhood obesity-related ones; cancer), Infectious Diseases (e.g., tuberculosis; HIV; emerging diseases--particularly mosquito borne illnesses), Maternal and Child Health, Mental Health Disorders, and Motor Vehicle Accidents. Other relevant public health issues affecting this region, for example environmental health, binational health services coordination (e.g., immunization), the impact of migration throughout the Americas and globally in this region, health issues related to the physical climate, access to quality health care, discrimination/mistreatment and well-being, acculturative/immigration stress, violence, substance use/abuse, oral health, respiratory disease, and well-being from a social determinants of health framework, are critical areas addressed in these publications or for future research. Each of these Research Topic publications presented applied solutions (e.g., new programs, technology or infrastructure) and/or public health policy recommendations relevant to each public health challenge addressed.",Emigration and immigration,118,N/A,0,en

Finding Deep and Wide,Shellie Rushing Tomlinson,Salem Books,2020-01-28,"Stop settling for the life you have and live the one Jesus died to give you. Book summary/description: Does your relationship with God feel distant and unfulfilled? Are you exhausted by dutifully checking off a spiritual to-do list? Do you yearn for a more satisfying and joyful walk with Christ that feels less like hard work? Along comes a book daring us not to settle for anything less than what the Bible promises. Let Shellie Rushing Tomlinson illuminate a path that leads you away from formulaic, duty-bound Christianity toward a deep and wide life spent joyfully surrendered to Jesus. With her signature Southern warmth and humor and poignant storytelling, Shellie retells familiar Bible stories and recasts them in a grace-filled way that will help you see the life Jesus offers you so freely. Her honest, heartfelt, and often hilarious stories of family life in Louisiana reveal Shellie’s own journey from being a rule-following Christian to discovering “the joy of dying to all that trying.” In Finding Deep and Wide, Shellie invites you to stop trying to please God, and be beautifully transformed by Him instead.

Your DNA Guide - the Book,Diahan Southard,N/A,2020-02-26,"You don't have to learn everything about genetic genealogy before asking specific questions of your DNA! That's the premise of Diahan Southard's brand new book, Your DNA Guide - the Book, now available for pre-order at a special sale price. Your DNA Guide - the Book is like no other genetic genealogy book on the market. Instead of learning more-than-you-need-to-know in textbook style, you'll choose a specific DNA question to start exploring right away. You'll follow concrete step-by-step plans, learning important DNA concepts--in plain English--as you go. Do you want to learn who your 2X great grandmother is? Turn to page 23. Do you want to know how you are related to one of your DNA matches? Page 37. As you proceed, you check your progress and get new guidance based on your specific results at each stage. (Including troubleshooting, like when your matches just aren't responding or your great-grandparents turn out to be first cousins.) This powerful, hands-on approach is based on Diahan's 20 years of experience in the genetic genealogy industry and especially in the past five years, as she helps clients one-on-one make DNA discoveries. It became clear to her that while each client's situation may be unique, there are patterns in how you can find solutions that you can apply yourself. Your DNA Guide - the Book is for anyone who has taken a DNA test or may want to. It helps genealogists reconstruct family trees. It helps adoptees identify biological relatives. It can help you identify a specific DNA match. In short, it helps anyone explore what their DNA--and their DNA matches--can tell them about their origins.",Reference,250,N/A,0,en

Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure with Dash,"U. S. Department Human Services, National Health, Department Of Health And Human Services, Lung, and Blood, National Heart Institute, National Heart Lung Institute, And",Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2012-07-09,"This book by the National Institutes of Health (Publication 06-4082) and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute provides information and effective ways to work with your diet because what you choose to eat affects your chances of developing high blood pressure, or hypertension (the medical term). Recent studies show that blood pressure can be lowered by following the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan-and by eating less salt, also called sodium. While each step alone lowers blood pressure, the combination of the eating plan and a reduced sodium intake gives the biggest benefit and may help prevent the development of high blood pressure. This book, based on the DASH research findings, tells how to follow the DASH eating plan and reduce the amount of sodium you consume. It offers tips on how to start and stay on the eating plan, as well as a week of menus and some recipes. The menus and recipes are given for two levels of daily sodium consumption-2,300 and 1,500 milligrams per day. Twenty-three hundred milligrams is the highest level considered acceptable by the National High Blood Pressure Education Program. It is also the highest amount recommended for healthy Americans by the 2005 ""U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans."" The 1,500 milligram level can lower blood pressure further and more recently is the amount recommended by the Institute of Medicine as an adequate intake level and one that most people should try to achieve. The lower your salt intake is, the lower your blood pressure. Studies have found that the DASH menus containing 2,300 milligrams of sodium can lower blood pressure and that an even lower level of sodium, 1,500 milligrams, can further reduce blood pressure. All the menus are lower in sodium than what adults in the United States currently eat-about 4,200 milligrams per day in men and 3,300 milligrams per day in women. Those with high blood pressure and prehypertension may benefit especially from following the DASH eating plan and reducing their sodium intake.",,62,N/A,0,en

Generation Z,"Corey Seemiller, Meghan Grace",Routledge,2018-11-02,"No other generation in history has received as much coverage as the Millennial generation. Books, Google searches, blogs, and news articles are everywhere about them. Yet, Generation Z is comprised of our youth and young adults today and has received very little attention comparatively. Those in Generation Z are among our youngest consumers, students, colleagues, constituents, voters, and neighbors. Being able to better understand who they are and how they see the world can be helpful in effectively working with, teaching, supervising, and leading them. Generation Z: A Century in the Making offers insight into nearly every aspect of the lives of those in Generation Z, including a focus on their career aspirations, religious beliefs and practices, entertainment and hobbies, social concerns, relationships with friends and family, health and wellness, money management, civic engagement, communication styles, political ideologies, technology use, and educational preferences. Drawing from an unprecedented number of studies with higher education research institutions, market research firms such as Pew and Census, other generational researchers and industry leaders, this is the authoritative defining work on Generation Z that market researchers, consumer behaviour specialists, and employers sorely need – and it is a fascinating read for anyone interested in the sociology of generations.",Business & Economics,334,5,1,en

Professional Development in Applied Linguistics,Luke Plonsky,John Benjamins Publishing Company,2020-07-30,"Success in academia requires more than an understanding of discipline-specific literature and an ability to teach and do research. It is also necessary to develop an understanding of a range of professionally-oriented skills such as how to identify and apply to doctoral programs, how to make the most of conferences, how to achieve a semblance of work-life balance, and how to land a job. Unfortunately, however, training on such professional matters is often inconsistent and/or idiosyncratic. This book seeks to consolidate and demystify these critical and often-misunderstood aspects of professional development in the context of applied linguistics. Put another way, this book is an attempt at the text many of us wish we had as we began our graduate studies. Throughout the book, readers will find anecdotes and insights informed by individual authors’ first-hand experiences. The resulting tone across the volume is that of a meet-up with a trusted and thoughtful mentor. As readers “meet” with these mentors, it is the hope of this volume that their guidance will help move readers closer to realizing their professional goals in applied linguistics.",Study Aids,212,N/A,0,en

HIV/AIDS in China,"Zunyou Wu, Yu Wang, Roger Detels, Marc Bulterys, Jennifer M. McGoogan",Springer Nature,2019-10-10,"With HIV becoming the leading cause of infectious-disease mortality in Mainland China, this book focuses on tackling HIV/AIDS in the face of rapid political and economic change in China. Featuring contributions by over a dozen leading figures in the field, this book is the go-to text for any student or reader interested in how national and international organizations’ are attempting to control this epidemic. The book includes chapters on the epidemiology, treatment, and prevention of HIV, as well as several chapters that discuss in detail specific provincial- and national-level programs to control and treat HIV. It chronicles the Chinese government’s amazing about-face, as it replaced underfunded, non-evidence based policy decisions with successful, science-based approaches to disease control and prevention, including the adoption of once controversial needle-exchange programs and the establishment of a national HIV/AIDS data registry. It measures the success of national policy decisions, the implementation of treatment policies, and discusses the difficulty of accessing high-risk communities, including people who inject drugs, sex workers, and men who have sex with men – groups not easy to reach, study, engage in prevention programs, or treatment, for fear of stigmatization and loss of social status. Further, it documents the spread of HIV to other provinces, and the tragedy that befell repeat plasma donors in Henan and other poor provinces, where reused or improperly sterilized lab equipment caused some villages to have epidemic-level incidence rates. This book represents a positive contribution to the field of AIDS research, making vital, new information available to an interested readership.",Medical,681,N/A,0,en

New emerging infections continue to develop and the growing threats to health due to environmental pollution and climate change increase the need for resilience and sustainability. These threats to health are global in nature, and this Handbook will explore perspectives on current public health issues in South, Southeast and East Asia, informing global as well as regional debate. Whilst many books cite Western examples of the development of global public health, this Handbook brings together both Western and Eastern scholarship, creating a new global public health perspective suitable to face modern challenges in promoting the population’s health. This Handbook is essential reading not only for students, professionals and scholars of global public health and related fields but is also written to be accessible to those with a general interest in the health of Asia.",Health & Fitness,769,N/A,0,en

Natural Products as Antiviral Agents,"C.K. Chu, H.G. Cutler",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-11-11,"During the past fifty years, thousands of natural products have been isolated from plants, fungi, and bacteria. Apart from intense searches by pharmaceutical companies for medicinals and the concentrated effort mounted by the National Cancer Institute, many of these have not been tested in biological systems. The major reasons for this appear to be, at least, twofold. First, individual researchers looking for biologically active natural products will often isolate only small amounts of material sufficient to determine a structure and calculate the specific activity for their particular bioassay systems: insufficient funds preclude re-isolating the compound unless industrial potential is foreseen. Second, the difficulty with which original structures were proved prior to 1972. This required the isolation of relatively large quantities of a natural product and there followed extensive degradation, elemental analyses of the parent and its fragments, then synthesis, piece by piece, of the molecule. All this took time and energy. No wonder that when the structure was proved the chemist was enervated. And coupled to this was the fact that many chemists were not trained to test their materials in biological systems. In contrast, today a natural product can be isolated, its mass and molecular formula determined and, if there is some serendipity, crystals may be obtained for single crystal x-ray analysis. If conditions are near perfect, it is possible to isolate and identify a novel compound in a month.",Medical,279,N/A,0,en

Moving from the Millennium to the Sustainable Development Goals,Sefa Awaworyi Churchill,Springer Nature,2020-04-25,"This book presents a collection of chapters that examine various dimensions of development. Between 2000 and 2015, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) remained the overarching development framework that governed the international development community. After a decade and half of commitment to the MDGs, the framework is widely considered a success, although progress reported across countries has been uneven. The new overarching international development framework may not be successful or present the best opportunities for the desired global change without a better understanding of factors that contributed the most or the least to the attainment of the MDGs. The chapters presented in this book provide discussions and insights into understanding these factors better. They represent a collection of scholarship that address some of the important questions in international development. They adopt a wide range of research methods to provide insight into what works, and what does not, in promoting the stipulated development goals.",Business & Economics,375,N/A,0,en

The A to Z of Bulgaria,Raymond Detrez,N/A,2010,"Few states have fought as hard or as long to be established as that of the Republic of Bulgaria. The Bulgarians have over the centuries created their own principalities, kingdoms, and republics only to have them crushed by stronger entities, including the Byzantine and Ottoman Empires. While recently, the communist regime was largely dominated by and overly submissive to the Soviet Union. Fortunately, about 15 years ago, a new republic arose, which began revamping the economy, reviving the political life, and forging a new place in Europe. The A to Z of Bulgaria contains more than 600 cross-referenced entries on Bulgarian historical periods, places, terms, organizations, events, and personalities. The number of entries, dealing with historical figures and events, has been considerably enlarged, and all of the entries of the first edition that have remained were carefully updated. The newest insights of Bulgarian historiography as practiced in Bulgaria and abroad are also reflected. In addition, the book includes a brief introduction into Bulgarian history from the earliest times until mid-2005 (including the formation of the current cabinet), an easy-reference chronology of Bulgarian history, several maps, and lists of Bulgarian political parties, administrations, and leaders.

House of Leaves,Mark Z. Danielewski,Pantheon,2000-03-07,"THE MIND-BENDING CULT CLASSIC ABOUT A HOUSE THAT’S LARGER ON THE INSIDE THAN ON THE OUTSIDE • A masterpiece of horror and an astonishingly immersive, maze-like reading experience that redefines the boundaries of a novel. ''Simultaneously reads like a thriller and like a strange, dreamlike excursion into the subconscious."" —Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times ""Thrillingly alive, sublimely creepy, distressingly scary, breathtakingly intelligent—it renders most other fiction meaningless."" —Bret Easton Ellis, bestselling author of American Psycho “This demonically brilliant book is impossible to ignore.” —Jonathan Lethem, award-winning author of Motherless Brooklyn One of The Atlantic’s Great American Novels of the Past 100 Years Years ago, when House of Leaves was first being passed around, it was nothing more than a badly bundled heap of paper, parts of which would occasionally surface on the Internet. No one could have anticipated the small but devoted following this terrifying story would soon command. Starting with an odd assortment of marginalized youth—musicians, tattoo artists, programmers, strippers, environmentalists, and adrenaline junkies—the book eventually made its way into the hands of older generations, who not only found themselves in those strangely arranged pages but also discovered a way back into the lives of their estranged children. Now made available in book form, complete with the original colored words, vertical footnotes, and second and third appendices, the story remains unchanged. Similarly, the cultural fascination with House of Leaves remains as fervent and as imaginative as ever. The novel has gone on to inspire doctorate-level courses and masters theses, cultural phenomena like the online urban legend of “the backrooms,” and incredible works of art in entirely unrealted mediums from music to video games. Neither Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Will Navidson nor his companion Karen Green was prepared to face the consequences of the impossibility of their new home, until the day their two little children wandered off and their voices eerily began to return another story—of creature darkness, of an ever-growing abyss behind a closet door, and of that unholy growl which soon enough would tear through their walls and consume all their dreams.",Fiction,738,4.5,18,en
A Portrait of Walt Disney World,"Kevin Kern, Tim O'Day, Steven Vagnini",Disney Editions,2021-09-28,"This expansive, must-have coffee table book paints a robust portrait of the Walt Disney World Resort, across half a century, through diverse and vibrant voices and mostly unseen Disney theme park concept art and photographs. Walt Disney's vision for the Florida Project begins with Disneyland and the 1964-1965 New York World's Fair. After an imaginative and expansive design, a unique land acquisition process, and an innovative construction period, the Walt Disney World Resort celebrated its Grand Opening in October 1971. It featured a theme park dubbed the Magic Kingdom and three recreational resorts: Disney's Contemporary Resort, Disney's Polynesian Village, and Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground. As Walt Disney World consistently grew and further evolved through the five decades that followed, certain themes reverberated: an appreciation for nostalgia, a joy for fantasy, a hunger for discovery, and an unending hope for a better tomorrow. Inspirational and memorable theme parks, water parks, sports arenas, recreational water sports, world-class golf courses, vast shopping villages, and a transportation network unlike any other in the world resulted in fun, festive, and familiar characters, traditions, spectacles, merchandise, and so much more. The resort has come to represent the pulse of American leisure and has served as a backdrop for life's milestones both big and small, public and private. Walt Disney World: A Portrait of the First Half Century serves as a treasure trove for vacationers, students of hospitality, artists, and all Disney collectors.

I Am These Truths,"Sunny Hostin, Charisse Jones",HarperCollins,2020-09-22,"The Emmy Award-winning legal journalist and co-host of The View Sunny Hostin chronicles her journey from growing up in a South Bronx housing project to becoming an assistant U.S. attorney and journalist in this powerful memoir that offers an intimate and unique look at identity, intolerance, and injustice. “What are you?” has followed Sunny Hostin from the beginning of her story, as she grew up half Puerto Rican and half African-American raised by teenage parents in the South Bronx. Escaping poverty and the turbulence of her early life through hard work, a bit of luck and earning academic scholarships to college and law school, Sunny immersed herself in the workings of the criminal justice system. In Washington, D.C., Sunny became a federal prosecutor, soon parlaying her wealth of knowledge of the legal system into a successful career as a legal journalist. She was one of the first national reporters to cover Trayvon Martin’s death—which her producers erroneously labeled “just a local story.” Today, an inescapable voice from the top echelons of news and entertainment, Sunny uses her platform to advocate for social justice and give a voice to the marginalized. In her signature no-holds-barred, straight-up style, Sunny opens up and shares her intimate struggles with fertility and personal turmoil, and reflects on the high-stakes cases and stories she worked on as a prosecutor and during her time at CNN, Fox News, ABC and The View. Timely, poignant, and moving, I Am These Truths is the story of a woman living between two worlds, and learning to bridge them together to fight for what’s right.",Biography & Autobiography,272,N/A,0,en

Devolution,Max Brooks,Del Rey,2020-06-16,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • The #1 New York Times bestselling author of World War Z is back with “the Bigfoot thriller you didn’t know you needed in your life, and one of the greatest horror novels I’ve ever read” (Blake Crouch, author of Dark Matter and Recursion). FINALIST FOR THE LOCUS AWARD As the ash and chaos from Mount Rainier’s eruption swirled and finally settled, the story of the Greenloop massacre has passed unnoticed, unexamined . . . until now. The journals of resident Kate Holland, recovered from the town’s bloody wreckage, capture a tale too harrowing—and too earth-shattering in its implications—to be forgotten. In these pages, Max Brooks brings Kate’s extraordinary account to light for the first time, faithfully reproducing her words alongside his own extensive investigations into the massacre and the legendary beasts behind it. Kate’s is a tale of unexpected strength and resilience, of humanity’s defiance in the face of a terrible predator’s gaze, and, inevitably, of savagery and death. Yet it is also far more than that. Because if what Kate Holland saw in those days is real, then we must accept the impossible. We must accept that the creature known as Bigfoot walks among us—and that it is a beast of terrible strength and ferocity. Part survival narrative, part bloody horror tale, part scientific journey into the boundaries between truth and fiction, this is a Bigfoot story as only Max Brooks could chronicle it—and like none you’ve ever read before. Praise for Devolution “Delightful . . . [A] tale of supernatural mayhem that fans of King and Crichton alike will enjoy.”—Kirkus Reviews (starred review) “The story is told in such a compelling manner that horror fans will want to believe and, perhaps, take the warning to heart.”—Booklist (starred review)",Fiction,292,4,1,en

Canine Enrichment for the Real World,"Allie Bender, Emily Strong",Dogwise Publishing,2019-11-08,"In the world of dogs, there is now more awareness than ever of the need to provide enrichment, especially in shelters. But what exactly is enrichment? The concept is pretty straightforward: learn what your dog’s needs are, and then structure an environment and routine that allows them to engage in behaviors they find enriching. To truly enrich your dog’s life, you should offer them opportunities to engage in natural or instinctual behaviors. Aside from the limitations we have to place on a dog in today’s modern, busy world, the biggest constraint to enriching your dog’s life is your imagination! What the experts say about Canine Enrichment: Don’t let the word “enrichment” in the title fool you into thinking that the scope of this book is too narrow or not something you will find valuable. It focuses comprehensively on meeting your dog’s needs and is written in a holistic, science-based, practical, straightforward, and easy-to-understand way. I love this book! Ken Ramirez, author of Animal Training: Successful Animal Management Through Positive Reinforcement Canine Enrichment is a deep dive into what dogs really need and how we can provide it. It’s a great book for dog lovers who want to go beyond the standard superficialities of “dogs need exercise.” Just the chapter on agency is worth the price of the book! Patricia McConnell, Ph.D., CAAB Emeritus, author of The Other End of the Leash and The Education of Will The scope of this book is ambitious and the authors deliver, navigating the subject of enrichment with depth and relevance.

"""The Good War""",Studs Terkel,New Press/ORIM,2011-07-26,"Winner of the Pulitzer Prize: “The richest and most powerful single document of the American experience in World War II” (The Boston Globe). “The Good War” is a testament not only to the experience of war but to the extraordinary skill of Studs Terkel as an interviewer and oral historian. From a pipe fitter’s apprentice at Pearl Harbor to a crew member of the flight that dropped the atomic bomb on Nagasaki, his subjects are open and unrelenting in their analyses of themselves and their experiences, producing what People magazine has called “a splendid epic history” of WWII. With this volume Terkel expanded his scope to the global and the historical, and the result is a masterpiece of oral history. “Tremendously compelling, somehow dramatic and intimate at the same time, as if one has stumbled on private accounts in letters locked in attic trunks . . . In terms of plain human interest, Mr. Terkel may well have put together the most vivid collection of World War II sketches ever gathered between covers.” —The New York Times Book Review “I promise you will remember your war years, if you were alive then, with extraordinary vividness as you go through Studs Terkel’s book. Or, if you are too young to remember, this is the best place to get a sense of what people were feeling.” —Chicago Tribune “A powerful book, repeatedly moving and profoundly disturbing.” —People",History,707,N/A,0,en

Because of the similarities between HIV and immune deficiency infections in a variety of animals, it is only natural that scientists use these animals as models to study pathogenesis, treatment, vaccine development and many other aspects of HIV. Part of the series Infectious Agents and Pathogenesis, this volume reviews the immune deficiency virus in a variety of hosts. Pathogenesis, vaccine and drug development, epidemiology, and the natural history of the monkey, mouse, cat, cow, horse, and other animal viruses are detailed and compared to HIV.

50 Most Important Theological Terms,"J Brian Tucker, David B Finkbeiner",Moody Publishers,2021-09-07,"Some people make theology complicated. Here’s what you need to know. Theology can be intimidating, full of big words and lofty ideas. Yet theological terms aren’t just for professors to argue about in the ivory tower. These powerful words have important meanings for the everyday Christian, too. They aren’t reserved for academic theologians. These terms belong to you! In 50 Most Important Theological Terms, Moody professors David Finkbeiner and Brian Tucker offer helpful explanations of the –isms and –ologies of Bible doctrine that you’ve heard of but aren’t sure what they mean. Beyond mere explanations, the authors help you understand why these terms matter, not just for classroom textbooks but for the book of real life. You’ll learn about questions like: How is Jesus fully God and fully human at the same time? By what means was sin passed to everyone from Adam? Do humans have only a body and soul, or a body, soul, and spirit? Is repentance from sin part of saving faith? And much more . . . Despite what you may have heard, theology actually is relevant. Don’t miss out on the meanings of theological terms. Get the answers from experts and let your confusion turn to understanding.",Religion,174,3,1,en
