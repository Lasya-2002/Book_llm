A History of the Bible,John Barton,Penguin,2020-08-04,"A literary history of our most influential book of all time, by an Oxford scholar and Anglican priest In our culture, the Bible is monolithic: It is a collection of books that has been unchanged and unchallenged since the earliest days of the Christian church. The idea of the Bible as ""Holy Scripture,"" a non-negotiable authority straight from God, has prevailed in Western society for some time. And while it provides a firm foundation for centuries of Christian teaching, it denies the depth, variety, and richness of this fascinating text. In A History of the Bible, John Barton argues that the Bible is not a prescription to a complete, fixed religious system, but rather a product of a long and intriguing process, which has inspired Judaism and Christianity, but still does not describe the whole of either religion. Barton shows how the Bible is indeed an important source of religious insight for Jews and Christians alike, yet argues that it must be read in its historical context--from its beginnings in myth and folklore to its many interpretations throughout the centuries. It is a book full of narratives, laws, proverbs, prophecies, poems, and letters, each with their own character and origin stories. Barton explains how and by whom these disparate pieces were written, how they were canonized (and which ones weren't), and how they were assembled, disseminated, and interpreted around the world--and, importantly, to what effect. Ultimately, A History of the Bible argues that a thorough understanding of the history and context of its writing encourages religious communities to move away from the Bible's literal wording--which is impossible to determine--and focus instead on the broader meanings of scripture.",Religion,642,N/A,0,en

An American Bible,Paul C. Gutjahr,Stanford University Press,1999,"""An American Bible is an extremely compelling piece of cultural history that succeeds in making rich rather than schematic sense of the major dramas that lay behind the production of over 1,700 different American editions of the Bible in the century after the American Revolution. Gutjahr's book is especially powerful in demonstrating how nineteenth-century efforts to purge the Bible of textual and translational impurities in search of an 'authentic' text led ironically to the emergence of entirely new gospels like the Book of Mormon and the massive fictionalized literature dealing with the life of Christ."" --Jay Fliegelman, Stanford University During the first three-quarters of the nineteenth century, American publishing experienced unprecedented, exponential growth. An emerging market economy, widespread religious revival, educational reforms, and innovations in print technology worked together to create a culture increasingly formed and framed by the power of print. At the center of this new culture was the Bible, the book that has been called ""the best seller"" in American publishing history. Yet it is important to realize that the Bible in America was not a simple, uniform entity. First printed in the United States during the American Revolution, the Bible underwent many revisions, translations, and changes in format as different editors and publishers appropriated it to meet a wide range of changing ideological and economic demands. This book examines how many different constituencies (both secular and religious) fought to keep the Bible the preeminent text in the United States as the country's print marketplace experienced explosive growth. The author shows how these heated battles had profound consequences for many American cultural practices and forms of printed material. By exploring how publishers, clergymen, politicians, educators, and lay persons met the threat that new printed material posed to the dominance of the Bible by changing both its form and its contents, the author reveals the causes and consequences of mutating God's supposedly immutable Word.",History,292,5,1,en

Children’s Bibles in America,Russell W. Dalton,Bloomsbury Publishing,2015-11-19,"Children's Bibles have been among the most popular and influential types of religious publications in the United States, providing many Americans with their first formative experiences of the Bible and its stories. In Children's Bibles in America, Russell W. Dalton explores the variety of ways in which children's Bibles have adapted, illustrated, and retold Bible stories for children throughout U.S. history. This reception history of the story of Noah as it appears in children's Bibles provides striking examples of the multivalence and malleability of biblical texts, and offers intriguing snapshots of American culture and American religion in their most basic forms. Dalton demonstrates the ways in which children's Bibles reflect and reveal America's diverse and changing beliefs about God, childhood, morality, and what must be passed on to the next generation. Dalton uses the popular story of Noah's ark as a case study, exploring how it has been adapted and appropriated to serve in a variety of social agendas. Throughout America's history, the image of God in children's Bible adaptations of the story of Noah has ranged from that of a powerful, angry God who might destroy children at any time to that of a friendly God who will always keep children safe. At the same time, Noah has been lifted up as a model of virtues ranging from hard work and humble obedience to patience and positive thinking. Dalton explores these uses of the story of Noah and more as he engages the fields of biblical studies, the history of religion in America, religious education, childhood studies, and children's literature.",Religion,318,N/A,0,en

The Murderous History of Bible Translations,Harry Freedman,Bloomsbury Publishing,2016-05-05,"Harry Freedman recounts the fascinating and bloody history of the Bible. In 1535, William Tyndale, the first man to produce an English version of the Bible in print, was captured and imprisoned in Belgium. A year later he was strangled and then burned at the stake. His co-translator was also burned. In that same year the translator of the first Dutch Bible was arrested and beheaded. These were not the first, nor were they the last instances of extreme violence against Bible translators. The Murderous History of Bible Translations tells the remarkable, and bloody, story of those who dared translate the word of God. The Bible has been translated far more than any other book. To our minds it is self-evident that believers can read their sacred literature in a language they understand. But the history of Bible translations is far more contentious than reason would suggest. Bible translations underlie an astonishing number of religious conflicts that have plagued the world. Harry Freedman, author of The Talmud: A Biography describes brilliantly the passions and strong emotions that arise when deeply held religious convictions are threatened or undermined. He tells of the struggle for authority and orthodoxy in a world where temporal power was always subjugated to the divine. A world in which the idea of a Bible for all was so important that many were willing to give up their time, their security and often their lives.",Religion,257,N/A,0,en

The Bible and Comics,Zanne Domoney-Lyttle,Bloomsbury Publishing,2023-11-30,"This interdisciplinary volume seeks to trace the diverse ways in which stories of biblical women have been reimagined in and as comic books. Feminist biblical scholarship has previously addressed the tradition that relegates female biblical characters to secondary roles, merely enabling the male characters to attain their own goals. Using examples from both secular and religious comic Bibles, and comic Bibles aimed at children and older audiences, Zanne Domoney-Lyttle now fully considers contemporary remediations of biblical narratives to the same degree. Remediating ancient, biblical text into modern, graphical comic books affects the reception of the text in several ways. This book aims to investigate how the production, format, and function of comic Bibles encourages the depiction of biblical characters from a contemporary perspective, while also showing some fidelity to the text. By presenting a focused analysis on women in the Bible, wider issues concerning popular-cultural retellings of the Bible in general begin to surface, including matters concerning reception history, the space between art and literature inhabited by biblical comics, and issues of translation and interpretations within contemporary remediations.",Religion,169,N/A,0,en

The Making of the Bible,"Konrad Schmid, Jens Schrter",Harvard University Press,2021-10-29,"The authoritative new account of the BibleÕs origins, illuminating the 1,600-year tradition that shaped the Christian and Jewish holy books as millions know them today. The Bible as we know it today is best understood as a process, one that begins in the tenth century BCE. In this revelatory account, a world-renowned scholar of Hebrew scripture joins a foremost authority on the New Testament to write a new biography of the Book of Books, reconstructing Jewish and Christian scriptural histories, as well as the underappreciated contest between them, from which the Bible arose. Recent scholarship has overturned popular assumptions about IsraelÕs past, suggesting, for instance, that the five books of the Torah were written not by Moses but during the reign of Josiah centuries later. The sources of the Gospels are also under scrutiny. Konrad Schmid and Jens Schrter reveal the long, transformative journeys of these and other texts en route to inclusion in the holy books. The New Testament, the authors show, did not develop in the wake of an Old Testament set in stone.

The Bible in American Law and Politics,John R. Vile,Rowman & Littlefield,2020-09-19,"While scholars increasingly recognize the importance of religion throughout American history, The Bible in American Law and Politics is the first reference book to focus on the key role that the Bible has played in American public life. In considering revolting from Great Britain, Americans contemplated whether this was consistent with scripture. Americans subsequently sought to apply Biblical passages to such issues as slavery, women’s rights, national alcoholic prohibition, issues of war and peace, and the like. American presidents continue to take their oath on the Bible. Some of America’s greatest speeches, for example, Lincoln’s Second Inaugural and William Jennings Bryan’s Cross of Gold speech, have been grounded on Biblical texts or analogies. Today, Americans continue to cite the Bible for positions as diverse as LGBTQ rights, abortion, immigration, welfare, health care, and other contemporary issues. By providing essays on key speeches, books, documents, legal decisions, and other writings throughout American history that have sought to buttress arguments through citations to Scriptures or to Biblical figures, John Vile provides an indispensable guide for scholars and students in religion, American history, law, and political science to understand how Americans throughout its history have interpreted and applied the Bible to legal and political issues.",Religion,679,N/A,0,en

The Oxford Handbook of the Bible in America,Paul C. Gutjahr,Oxford University Press,2017,"Early Americans have long been considered ""A People of the Book"" Because the nickname was coined primarily to invoke close associations between Americans and the Bible, it is easy to overlook the central fact that it was a book-not a geographic location, a monarch, or even a shared language-that has served as a cornerstone in countless investigations into the formation and fragmentation of early American culture. Few books can lay claim to such powers of civilization-altering influence. Among those which can are sacred books, and for Americans principal among such books stands the Bible. This Handbook is designed to address a noticeable void in resources focused on analyzing the Bible in America in various historical moments and in relationship to specific institutions and cultural expressions. It takes seriously the fact that the Bible is both a physical object that has exercised considerable totemic power, as well as a text with a powerful intellectual design that has inspired everything from national religious and educational practices to a wide spectrum of artistic endeavors to our nation's politics and foreign policy. This Handbook brings together a number of established scholars, as well as younger scholars on the rise, to provide a scholarly overview--rich with bibliographic resources--to those interested in the Bible's role in American cultural formation.",History,737,N/A,0,en

Women and the Bible in Early Modern England,Femke Molekamp,OUP Oxford,2013-03-21,"Women and the Bible in Early Modern England provides an account of the uniquely important role of the Bible in the development of female interpretative and literary agency, as well as in the expression of female subjectivity in early modern England. In the later sixteenth and throughout the seventeenth century women's religious writing diversified in genre and entered increasingly into a public literary sphere. Femke Molekamp shows that the Bible was at the heart of female reading culture, and that women can be seen to have participated in multiple modes of reading it, which, in turn, fostered various kinds of literary writing. The sources used in this book to reconstruct reading practices, and trace their connection to religious writing, are drawn from diverse archives, to include the annotations, biographical writing, commonplace books, letters, treatises, and other literary writings in print and manuscript of both prominent early modern women well known to us, and women who have so far remained obscure. The book argues that the increased circulation of the Bible in English fostered reading practices that enabled a growth in female interpretative and literary agency.",History,281,N/A,0,en

Print and Protestantism in Early Modern England,Ian Green,OUP Oxford,2000-11-02,"In this highly innovative study, Ian Green examines the complete array of Protestant titles published in England from the 1530s to the 1720s. These range from the large specialist volumes at the top to cheap tracts at the bottom, from radical on one wing to conservative on the other, and from instructive and devotional manuals to edifying-cum-entertaining works such as religious verse and cautionary tales. Wherever possible the author adopts a statistical approach to permit a focus on those works which sold most copies over a number of years, and in an annotated Appendix provides a brief description of over seven hundred best selling or steady selling religious titles of the period. A close study of these texts and the forms in which they were offered to the public suggests a rapid diversification of both the types of work published and of the readerships at which they were targeted. It also demonstrates shrewd publishers' frequent attempts to plug gaps in a rapidly expanding market. Where previous studies of print have tended to focus on the polemical and the sensational, this one highlights the didactic, devotional, and consensual elements found in most steady selling works. It is also suggested that in these works there were at least three Protestantisms on offer an orthodox, clerical version, a moralistic, rational version favoured by the educated laity, and a popular version that was barely Protestant at all and that the impact of these probably varied both within and between different readerships. These conclusions shed much light not only on the means by which English Protestantism was disseminated, but also on the doctrinally and culturally diffused nature of English Protestantism by the end of the Stuart period. Both the text and the appendix should prove invaluable to anyone interested in the history of the Reformation or in printing as a medium of education and communication in early modern England.",History,720,N/A,0,en

How the Bible Works,Brian Malley,Rowman Altamira,2004-05-12,"What do evangelicals believe when they 'believe in the Bible?' Despite hundreds of English versions that differ in their texts, evangelicals continue to believe that there is a stable text—'the Bible'—which is the authoritative word of God and an essential guide to their everyday lives. To understand this phenomenon of evangelical Biblicism, anthropologist and biblical scholar Brian Malley looks not to the words of the Bible but to the Bible-believing communities. For as Malley demonstrates, it is less the meaning of the words of the Bible itself than how 'the Bible' provides a proper ground for beliefs that matters to evangelicals. Drawing on recent cognitive and social theory and extensive fieldwork in an evangelical church, Malley's book is an invaluable guide for seminarians, social scientists of religion, or for anyone who wants to understand just how the Bible works for American evangelicals.",Religion,183,N/A,0,en

The Reformation of Machismo,Elizabeth E. Brusco,University of Texas Press,2011-05-18,"Protestant evangelicalism has spread rapidly in Latin America at the same time that foreign corporations have taken hold of economies there. These concurrent developments have led some observers to view this religious movement as a means of melding converts into a disciplined work force for foreign capitalists rather than as a reflection of conscious individual choices made for a variety of personal, as well as economic, reasons. In this pioneering study, Elizabeth Brusco challenges such assumptions and explores the intra-household motivations for evangelical conversion in Colombia. She shows how the asceticism required of evangelicals (no drinking, smoking, or extramarital sexual relations are allowed) redirects male income back into the household, thereby raising the living standard of women and children. This benefit helps explain the appeal of evangelicalism for women and questions the traditional assumption that organized religion always disadvantages women. Brusco also demonstrates how evangelicalism appeals to men by offering an alternative to the more dysfunctional aspects of machismo. Case studies add a fascinating human dimension to her findings. With the challenges this book poses to conventional wisdom about economic, gender, and religious behavior, it will be important reading for a wide audience in anthropology, women’s studies, economics, and religion. For all students of Latin America, it offers thoughtful new perspectives on a major, grass-roots agent of social change.",Social Science,225,2,1,en

The Bible According to Mark Twain,Mark Twain,University of Georgia Press,1995,"This volume collects the most important writings by Mark Twain in which he used biblical settings, themes, and figures. Featuring Twain's singular portrayals of God, Adam, Eve, Satan, Methuselah, Shem, St. Peter, and others, the writings stand among Twain's most imaginative expressions of his views on human nature and humankind's relation to the Creator and the universe. Composed over four decades (1871-1910), the writings range from farce to fantasy to satire, each one bearing the mark of Twain's unmistakable wit and insight. Among the many delights in store for readers are Adam and Eve's divergent accounts of their domestic troubles; Methuselah's discussion of an ancient version of baseball, complete with a parody of baseball jargon; Shem's hand-wringing account of how material shortages and labor troubles were hampering the progress of the ark his father, Noah, was building; a description of the disruptive actions of the fire-and-brimstone evangelist Sam Jones upon arriving in heaven; Captain Stormfield's revelations of what heaven is really like; Satan's musings on our puerile concepts of the afterlife; and Twain's advice on how to dress and tip properly in heaven. Twain's humor, however, is never gratuitous. As readers laugh their way through this volume, they will find ample evidence of Twain's concerns about scriptural fallacies and inconsistencies, the Bible's rather flat portrayal of important characters, and our limited notions about the nature and meaning of our own--and God's--existence. Many of the pieces in this collection, even the most lighthearted, might still be considered controversial; of some of the darker pieces, Twain himself acknowledged that they would be heretical in any age. Moreover, these writings are valuable cultural artifacts of a time when, across the Western world, fundamental religious beliefs were being called into question by the precepts of Darwinism and the rapid advances of science and technology. Several of this volume's selections are previously unpublished; others, like Letters from the Earth, are classics. Virtually all have been newly edited to reflect as closely as possible Twain's final intentions for their form and content. For serious Twain devotees, editors Howard G. Baetzhold and Joseph B. McCullough have supplied an abundance of background material on the writings, including details on the history of their composition, publication, and relevance to the Twain canon.",Literary Criticism,413,N/A,0,en

The Puritans had their reasons, since Christmas was once an occasion for drunkenness and riot, when poor ""wassailers extorted food and drink from the well-to-do. In this intriguing and innovative work of social history, Stephen Nissenbaum rediscovers Christmas's carnival origins and shows how it was transformed, during the nineteenth century, into a festival of domesticity and consumerism. Bursting with detail, filled with subversive readings of such seasonal classics as ""A Visit from St. Nicholas” and A Christmas Carol, The Battle for Christmas captures the glorious strangeness of the past even as it helps us better understand our present.",History,400,N/A,0,en
Moving Forward by Looking Back,Craig Steiner,Zondervan,2009-08-30,"How many times have you poured your heart and soul into something for your youth ministry—only to have it fall flat, leaving not much more than a fond memory in the minds of students, let alone amazing life-change in their hearts? You’re not alone. Far too often, we build plans and programs and then stop to ask God to bless them. We all want a transformational student ministry, but we need to remember that God has to be the one doing the transformations in the lives of our students. Based on the principles found in the book of Acts, Moving Forward by Looking Back will help you look back at how God transformed lives through the early church, and look forward at how those principles can be applied to your youth ministry today. As you reflect on the book of Acts, you’ll explore how your youth ministry can implement the principles of: • Adoration—engaging students with God • Community—engaging students with God’s people • Truth—engaging students with God’s Word • Service—engaging students with God’s world With practical ideas that are easy to apply in any ministry context, whether you’re a rookie or a veteran, a professional or a volunteer youth worker, this book is an invaluable resource for any youth ministry that wants to see its students transformed by God.",Religion,289,N/A,0,en

Don't Know Much About the Bible,Kenneth C. Davis,Harper Collins,2009-03-17,"With wit, wisdom, and an extraordinary talent for turning dry, difficult reading into colorful and realistic accounts, the creator of the bestselling Don't Know Much About®, series now brings the world of the Old and New testaments to life as no one else can in the bestseller Don't Know Much About® The Bible. Relying on new research and improved translations, Davis uncovers some amazing questions and contradictions about what the Bible really says. Jericho's walls may have tumbled down because the city lies on a fault line. Moses never parted the Red Sea. There was a Jesus, but he wasn't born on Christmas and he probably wasn't an only child. Davis brings readers up-to-date on findings gleaned from the Dead Sea Scrolls and Gnostic Gospels that prompt serious scholars to ask such serious questions as: Who wrote the Bible? Did Jesus say everything we were taught he did? Did he say more? By examining the Bible historically, Davis entertains and amazes, provides a much better understanding of the subject, and offers much more fun learning about it.",Religion,675,N/A,0,en

The Road to Freedom,Johnny Baker,HarperChristian + ORM,2018-06-26,"The Road to Freedom is the path of hope for all of us who are stuck. With practical application and inspiration, Johnny Baker shares his story of recovering from alcoholism and offers the truths he has learned from his 25 years with Celebrate Recovery. Baker’s father, John, founded Celebrate Recovery when Baker was 15 years old. Later, Baker became involved with alcohol himself. Even though he saw his parents’ marriage heal and watched his dad become a new person, he had to experience his own journey of healing. Baker began the process of recovery as a young adult. Now he serves on the leadership team of Celebrate Recovery, sharing his testimony of how God brought him back home. In the years since leaving alcohol behind, Baker has witnessed thousands of other lives change through the power of Christ. Whether you are dealing with substance abuse, relational struggles, or eating challenges, or you simply want to let go of what is holding you back in life, you will find answers in The Road to Freedom. In addition to telling his own story, Baker offers ten principles of healing.

A Doubter's Guide to the Bible,John Dickson,Zondervan,2015-02-03,"A concise account of the whole biblical narrative and what it means—as well as the beliefs and lifestyle it inspires—for those observing Christianity from the outside, especially those who think there are good reasons not to believe. A Doubter's Guide to the Bible charts a biblical roadmap from the story of creation to the fulfillment of creation, answering many of the most frequently asked questions along the way: How can we read the creation account in Genesis in light of modern science? How should Old Testament law be understood when it appears inconsistent and irrelevant? Isn't the story of Jesus' birth a little far-fetched? What is the Gospel? Why are there four accounts of the same thing, and what are they really saying? John Dickson provides a readable and inviting Bible primer for anyone interested in informing themselves about the most widely read book in the history of humanity. By presenting the whole of the Bible as an account of God's promise to restore humanity to Himself, and humans to one another and to creation, Dickson allows believers and skeptics alike to gain insight into why the Bible has been a compelling, life-changing, and magnetic force throughout the ages—and why it still matters.",Religion,165,N/A,0,en
An Introduction to the Medieval Bible,Frans van Liere,Cambridge University Press,2014-03-31,"The Middle Ages spanned the period between two watersheds in the history of the biblical text: Jerome's Latin translation c.405 and Gutenberg's first printed version in 1455. The Bible was arguably the most influential book during this time, affecting spiritual and intellectual life, popular devotion, theology, political structures, art, and architecture. In an account that is sensitive to the religiously diverse world of the Middle Ages, Frans van Liere offers here an accessible introduction to the study of the Bible in this period. Discussion of the material evidence - the Bible as book - complements an in-depth examination of concepts such as lay literacy and book culture. This introduction includes a thorough treatment of the principles of medieval hermeneutics, and a discussion of the formation of the Latin bible text and its canon. It will be a useful starting point for all those engaged in medieval and biblical studies.",Religion,337,N/A,0,en

The Bible Tells Me So,Peter Enns,Harper Collins,2014-09-09,"The controversial Bible scholar and author of The Evolution of Adam recounts his transformative spiritual journey in which he discovered a new, more honest way to love and appreciate God’s Word. Trained as an evangelical Bible scholar, Peter Enns loved the Scriptures and shared his devotion, teaching at Westminster Theological Seminary. But the further he studied the Bible, the more he found himself confronted by questions that could neither be answered within the rigid framework of his religious instruction or accepted among the conservative evangelical community. Rejecting the increasingly complicated intellectual games used by conservative Christians to “protect” the Bible, Enns was conflicted. Is this what God really requires? How could God’s plan for divine inspiration mean ignoring what is really written in the Bible? These questions eventually cost Enns his job—but they also opened a new spiritual path for him to follow. The Bible Tells Me So chronicles Enns’s spiritual odyssey, how he came to see beyond restrictive doctrine and learned to embrace God’s Word as it is actually written. As he explores questions progressive evangelical readers of Scripture commonly face yet fear voicing, Enns reveals that they are the very questions that God wants us to consider—the essence of our spiritual study.",Religion,220,N/A,0,en

That such a book, which has influenced so many and stood the test of time for so long, is dismissed as folklore or myth, just goes to show what extremes nonbelievers will go to rationalize their behavior.

Form and Function in the Late Medieval Bible,,BRILL,2013-05-13,"Thirteenth- and fourteenth-century Latin Bibles survive in hundreds of manuscripts, one of the most popular books of the Middle Ages. Their innovative layout and organization established the norm for Bibles for centuries to come. This volume is the first study of these Bibles as a cohesive group. Multi- and inter-disciplinary analyses in art history, liturgy, exegesis, preaching and manuscript studies, reveal the nature and evolution of layout and addenda. They follow these Bibles as they were used by monks and friars, preachers and merchants. By addressing Latin Bibles alongside their French, Italian and English counterparts, this book challenges the Latin-vernacular dichotomy to show links, as well as discrepancies, between lay and clerical audiences and their books.

How the Bible Actually Works,Peter Enns,HarperCollins,2019-02-19,"Controversial evangelical Bible scholar, popular blogger and podcast host of The Bible for Normal People, and author of The Bible Tells Me So and The Sin of Certainty explains that the Bible is not an instruction manual or rule book but a powerful learning tool that nurtures our spiritual growth by refusing to provide us with easy answers but instead forces us to acquire wisdom. For many Christians, the Bible is a how-to manual filled with literal truths about belief that must be strictly followed. But the Bible is not static, Peter Enns argues. It does not hold easy answers to the perplexing questions and issues that confront us in our daily lives. Rather, the Bible is a dynamic instrument for study that not only offers an abundance of insights but provokes us to find our own answers to spiritual questions, cultivating God’s wisdom within us. “The Bible becomes a confusing mess when we expect it to function as a rulebook for faith. But when we allow the Bible to determine our expectations, we see that Wisdom, not answers, is the Bible’s true subject matter,” writes Enns. This distinction, he points out, is important because when we come to the Bible expecting it to be a textbook intended by God to give us unwavering certainty about our faith, we are actually creating problems for ourselves. The Bible, in other words, really isn’t the problem; having the wrong expectation is what interferes with our reading. Rather than considering the Bible as an ancient book weighed down with problems, flaws, and contradictions that must be defended by modern readers, Enns offers a vision of the holy scriptures as an inspired and empowering resource to help us better understand how to live as a person of faith today. How the Bible Actually Works makes clear that there is no one right way to read the Bible. Moving us beyond the damaging idea that “being right” is the most important measure of faith, Enns’s freeing approach to Bible study helps us to instead focus on pursuing enlightenment and building our relationship with God—which is exactly what the Bible was designed to do.",Religion,249,5,2,en

Bible Missals and the Medieval Dominican Liturgy,Innocent Smith,Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG,2023-11-06,"Bible Missals are manuscripts that integrate liturgical prayers for the Mass with the scriptural texts of the Latin Vulgate. Long overlooked by scholars, Bible Missals offer important evidence for the development of the medieval liturgy and the liturgical use of scripture by medieval Christians. This monograph is the first comprehensive analysis of the codicology and contents of Bible Missals. Mostly produced in the first half of the 13th century by professional book makers in centers like Paris and Oxford, these hybrid manuscripts were customized for secular, monastic, and mendicant patrons. This monograph focuses on Dominican Bible Missals, the largest group within the repertoire, providing detailed codicological descriptions of each manuscript and analyzing their texts for the Order of Mass and selected liturgical formularies, including prayers for the feast of St. Dominic. For medieval Christians, the words and events of scripture were continually called to mind and reenacted in the sacramental rites of the Mass.

The Bible is filled with inspiring stories of unlikely candidates God chose to change eternity. This bestselling compilation in one volume contains five novellas about such people―women in the family tree of Jesus Christ. Tamar. Rahab. Ruth. Bathsheba. Mary. Each was faced with extraordinary―even scandalous―challenges. But they had courage. They lived daring lives. Sometimes they made mistakes―big mistakes. And yet God, in His infinite mercy and grace, used them to bring forth the Christ, the Savior of the world. Their stories still hold great meaning and inspiration for us today. Tamar risked her life and reputation to be the woman she was called to be. See how the Lord uses our circumstances and our steps toward Him, however faltering, to fulfill His plan. Rahab was exploited by men who saw only her beauty, yet she held fast to her faith in God and was rewarded. Discover how God seeks and finds those whose hearts are tender toward Him, no matter how far away they are. Ruth’s loyalty, especially toward her mother-in-law Naomi, helped her persevere in the face of tragedy, and God gave her a second chance at love. Be encouraged that God will provide even when all hope seems lost. Bathsheba’s scandalous affair with David did not end in one night. Learn that God is willing to restore and redeem those lost in the depths of despair who call out to Him. Mary is one of the most revered women in history. But first, she was an ordinary woman striving to please God in the same way women still do today. When God spoke, Mary responded in obedience which changed the world forever. Each novella includes an in-depth Bible study perfect for personal reflection or group discussion. Watch these five women in the Bible come to life and learn from their examples of hope, faith, love, and obedience.",Fiction,554,4.5,5,en

The Bible in American Life,"Philip Goff, Arthur E. Farnsley II, Peter J. Thuesen",Oxford University Press,2017-03-01,"There is a paradox in American Christianity. According to Gallup, nearly eight in ten Americans regard the Bible as either the literal word of God or inspired by God. At the same time, surveys have revealed gaps in these same Americans' biblical literacy. These discrepancies reveal the complex relationship between American Christians and Holy Writ, a subject that is widely acknowledged but rarely investigated. The Bible in American Life is a sustained, collaborative reflection on the ways Americans use the Bible in their personal lives. It also considers how other influences, including religious communities and the Internet, shape individuals' comprehension of scripture. Employing both quantitative methods (the General Social Survey and the National Congregations Study) and qualitative research (historical studies for context), The Bible in American Life provides an unprecedented perspective on the Bible's role outside of worship, in the lived religion of a broad cross-section of Americans both now and in the past. The Bible has been central to Christian practice, and has functioned as a cultural touchstone From the broadest scale imaginable, national survey data about all Americans, down to the smallest details, such as the portrayal of Noah and his ark in children's Bibles, this book offers insight and illumination from scholars across the intellectual spectrum.

Stabnow",B&H Publishing Group,2013-03-01,"In Genesis 3:1 the serpent asked the woman, ""Did God really say, 'You can't eat from any tree in the garden'?"" What has God really said? Before we can obey Him, we must know what He has said. The Psalmist prayed twice in his affliction, ""Give me life through Your word"" (Ps 119:25, 107). When Jesus was afflicted by the Devil in the wilderness (Mt 4:1-11), He defended Himself with the sword of the Spirit (Eph 6:17) - God's Word. But Christians must know what God has said if we are to find strength and healing from affliction and defense against the Devil.

The Day I Was Crucified,Gene Edwards,Destiny Image Publishers,2011-07-28,"Quite simply, one of the most powerful, moving pieces of Christian literature of modern times. Other books have recorded the crucifixion and resurrection, but never before has the reader been ushered into unseen realms to witness the power of the cross as seen from the view of God the Father. You will discover a whole world of new meaning of Christ's death as you witness the destruction of the world systems, the annihilation of the law, the end of Adam's fallen race...and the death of Death. Here is an unequaled drama of power and depth which Christian literature has rarely, if ever, achieved. Edward's The Day I Was Crucified As Told By Jesus the Christ now takes its place among the greatest of Christian literature. We will still be reading this book 200 years from now, and still weeping (and praising) as we read. This is one of those rare life-transforming books.",Religion,449,5,1,en

This book explores this archive, but it also tracks its changes, because while biblical translations remain relatively stable over time, the paratexts cocooning a bible's first printing sometimes mutate or vanish in succeeding editions--and indeed sometimes they migrate to a competing bible.

The Book of Revelation Made Clear,"Tim LaHaye, Timothy Parker",Thomas Nelson,2014-07-15,"The Bible’s final book, Revelation, can seem intimidating or downright impossible to comprehend, but this guided tour by Bible scholar Tim LaHaye and renowned puzzle master Timothy E.

Yet the capstone of the canon need not remain a mystery. Cleverly designed for maximum learning and retention, this book covers every verse of Revelation step by step and, for each grouping of verses, includes a short three-question pre-quiz; the passage of scripture being addressed; a precise explanation of what the scripture means; and, finally, the same three questions repeated with the answers provided. By following this method, you will be amazed at how well you retain the teachings.

These essays focus on Calvin's work in his biblical commentaries with appropriate cross-referencing to his other writings, including his sermons. A concluding essay synthesizes the main features of what has gone before to present an overall view of John Calvin as an interpreter and commentator on Holy Scripture.

Your First Step to Celebrate Recovery,John Baker,Zondervan,2013-01-01,"You’ve undoubtedly heard the expression “time heals all wounds.” Unfortunately, it isn’t true. As many pastors and counselors know, people still carry hurts from thirty or forty years ago. The truth is, time often makes things worse. Wounds that are left untended fester and spread infection throughout your entire body. Time only extends the pain if the problem isn’t dealt with. Your First Step to Celebrate Recovery introduces you to a biblical and balanced program that has helped nearly a million people overcome their hurts, hang-ups, and habits. Based on the actual words of Jesus found in the Sermon on the Mount rather than psychological theory, the Celebrate Recovery program has helped people for over 20 years to grow toward full Christ-like maturity. Author and founder John Baker tells the true story of how Celebrate Recovery became one of the largest Christ-centered recovery programs in history. Baker will help you discover how God’s love, truth, grace and forgiveness can bring healing into your life.",Religion,132,N/A,0,en

Knowing Sin,Mark Jones,Moody Publishers,2022-02-01,"The first rule of combat is: know your enemy. We don’t talk a lot about sin these days. But maybe we should. The Puritans sure did—because they understood sin’s deceptive power and wanted to root it out of their lives. Shouldn’t we want the same? Though many books have been written on the “doctrine of sin,” few are as practical and applicable as this one. In Knowing Sin, Mark Jones puts his expertise in the Puritans to work by distilling the vast wisdom of our Christian forebears into a single volume that summarizes their thought on this vital subject. The result isn’t a theological tome to sit on your shelf and gather dust, but a surprisingly relevant book to keep by your bedside and refer to again and again. You’ll come to understand topics like: Sin’s Origin Sin’s Grief Sin’s Thoughts Sin’s Temptations Sin’s Misery Sin’s Secrecy and of course . . . Sin’s Defeat! None of us is free from the struggle with sin. The question isn’t whether we’re sinful, it’s what we’re doing about it. Thanks be to God, there is a path to overcoming sin. And the first step on that path to victory is knowing what we’re up against. Start Knowing Sin today!",Religion,186,N/A,0,en

Why Catholic Bibles Are Bigger,Gary Michuta,Catholic Answers Press,2017-09-15,"Some differences between Catholicism and Protestantism can be tricky to grasp, but one of them just requires the ability to count: Catholic bibles have seventy-three books, whereas Protestant bibles have sixty-sis - plus an appendix with the strange title Apocrypha. What's the story here? Protestants claim that the medieval Catholic Church added six extra books that had never been considered part of the Old Testament, either by Jews or early Christians. Catholics say that the Protestant Reformers removed those books, long considered part of Sacred Scripture, because they didn't like what they contained. In Why Catholic Bibles Are Bigger, Gary Michuta presents a revised and expanded version of his authoritative work on this key issue. Combing the historical record from pre-Christian times to the Patristic era to the Reformation and its aftermath, he traces the canon controversy through the writings and actions of its major players.",Religion,383,N/A,0,en

Contributors also consider how the relationship between Scripture and liturgy is tested by new priorities—the climate crisis, the inclusion and protection of children, the recognition and honoring of those who find themselves on the margins of the church, and the significance of gender and identity in all areas of the church’s life. This book does not offer definitive statements. It is an invitation to a wide audience to engage in new conversations with their practice of worship.",Religion,288,N/A,0,en

The Visio Pauli and the Gnostic Apocalypse of Paul,Jan N. Bremmer,Peeters Publishers,2007,"The Visio Pauli and the Gnostic Apocalypse of Paul is the first modern collection of studies on the most important aspects of the Visio Pauli, the most popular early Christian apocalypse in the Middle Ages. The volume starts with a short study of the textual traditions of the Visio Pauli, its Jewish and early Christian traditions as well as its influence on later literature, such as Dante. This is followed by studies of the Prologue, the four rivers of Eden, the place of the Ocean, the relation between body and soul, the image of hell and its punishments, and the connection with fantastic literature. Finally, a codicological, comparative, and textual re-evaluation of the Coptic translation attempts to correct earlier errors and to rehabilitate the value and interest of this long neglected version of the Visio Pauli. The book is concluded with a study of the earthly tribunal in the fourth heaven of the Gnostic Apocalypse of Paul. As has become customary, the volume is rounded off by an extensive bibliography of the Visio Pauli and the Gnostic Apocalypse of Paul and a detailed index.",Religion,268,N/A,0,en

Paul and Religion,Paul W. Gooch,N/A,2022,"""Paul and Religion demonstrates the continuing and contemporary relevance of the most important, and most controversial, figure of early Christianity. Paul Gooch interrogates the Pauline writings for their meaning as well as implications for religion as an entire form of life, a stance on the world expressed in distinctive practices. Bringing a philosophical approach to this topic, he connects Paul's ideas to lived experience. In a conversational style, Gooch explores Paul's experience of grace and his dismissal of distinctive markers of religious identity in favour of love as binding together a community. Contrary to common expectations, he finds within Paul's letters material for conversations about issues in our day, such as gender and sexuality. From his close reading of the Letters, Gooch argues that the Pauline religious form of life is not identical with institutional Christianity. Indeed, his conclusions may be welcome to those who belong to other faiths""--",,0,N/A,0,en

Why We're Catholic,Trent Horn,Catholic Answers Press,2017-05,"""How can you believe all this stuff? This is the number-one question Catholics get asked and, sometimes, we ask ourselves. Why do we believe that God exists, that he became a man and came to save us, that what looks like a wafer of bread is actually his body? Why do we believe that he inspired a holy book and founded an infallible Church to teach us the one true way to live? Ever since he became Catholic, Trent Horn has spent a lot of time answering these questions, trying to explain to friends, family, and total strangers the reasons for his Catholic faith. Some didn't believe in God, or even in the existence of truth. Others said they were spiritual but didn't think you needed religion to be happy. Some were Christians who thought Catholic doctrines over-complicated the pure gospel. And some were fellow Catholics who had a hard time understanding everything they professed to believe on Sunday. Why We're Catholic assembles the clearest, friendliest, most helpful answers that Trent learned to give to all these people and more. Beginning with how we can know reality and ending with our hope of eternal life, it s the perfect way to help skeptics and seekers (or Catholics who want to firm up their faith) understand the evidence that bolsters our belief and brings us joy"" --",Religion,240,N/A,0,en

Three Views on Israel and the Church,"Andrew David Naselli, Jared Compton",Kregel Academic,2019-01-26,"A comparison of three major views on the relationship between Israel and the church The relationship between Israel and the church is a longstanding debate in Christian theology, and Romans 9–11 are the most important chapters for understanding it. How one interprets these chapters determines how one understands biblical theology, how the New Testament uses the Old Testament, and how the old and new covenants are related. To help readers draw their own conclusion, four leading scholars on this issue present a case for their viewpoint, followed by a response and critique from the others. Michael Vlach argues for a future mass conversion and a role for ethnic Israel in the church. Fred Zaspel and Jim Hamilton present a case for a future mass conversion that does not include a role for ethnic Israel. And Benjamin Merkle contends that Romans 9–11 promises neither a future mass conversion nor a role for ethnic Israel. General editor Andrew David Naselli helpfully sets the debate in its larger biblical-theological context in the introduction, while Jared Compton provides a useful summary of the views and interactions at the end of the volume.",Religion,272,N/A,0,en

On Modesty,Tertullian,OrthodoxEbooks,2018-08-10,"Modesty, the flower of manners, the honor of our bodies, the grace of the sexes, the integrity of the blood, the guarantee of our race, the basis of sanctity, the pre-indication of every good disposition; rare though it is, and not easily perfected, and scarce ever retained in perpetuity, will yet up to a certain point linger in the world, if nature shall have laid the preliminary groundwork of it, discipline persuaded to it, censorial rigor curbed its excesses--on the hypothesis, that is, that every mental good quality is the result either of birth, or else of training, or else of external compulsion. But as the conquering power of things evil is on the increase--which is the characteristic of the last times--things good are now not allowed either to be born, so corrupted are the seminal principles; or to be trained, so deserted are studies; nor to be enforced, so disarmed are the laws. In fact, (the modesty) of which we are now beginning (to treat) is by this time grown so obsolete, that it is not the abjuration but the moderation of the appetites which modesty is believed to be; and he is held to be chaste enough who has not been too chaste. But let the world's modesty see to itself, together with the world itself: together with its inherent nature, if it was wont to originate in birth; its study, if in training; its servitude, if in compulsion: except that it had been even more unhappy if it had remained only to prove fruitless, in that it had not been in God's household that its activities had been exercised.",Religion,74,N/A,0,en

Nur Masalha's groundbreaking new book traces Zionism's evolution from a secular, settler movement in the late 19th century, to the messianic faith it has become today. He shows how the biblical language of 'chosen people' and 'promised land' has been used by many Christian and Jewish Zionists as the 'title deeds' for Israel, justifying ethnic division and violence. With Edward Said, Masalha argues that a new politics of peace can only be achieved through a single, democratic state, which replaces religious zealotry with secular equality.",History,388,N/A,0,en

The Use of the Septuagint in New Testament Research,Tim McLay,Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing,2003,"Too often the Septuagint is misunderstood or, worse, ignored in New Testament studies. In this book R.

McLay explains the use of the Septuagint in the New Testament by looking in depth at actual New Testament citations of the Jewish Scriptures. This work reveals the true extent of the Septuagint s impact on the text and theology of the New Testament. Indeed, given the textual diversity that existed during the first century, the Jewish Scriptures as they were known, read, and interpreted in the Greek language provided the basis for much, if not most, of the interpretive context of the New Testament writers. Complete with English translations, a glossary of terms, an extensive bibliography, and helpful indexes, this book will give readers a new appreciation of the Septuagint as an important tool for interpreting the New Testament.",Bibles,226,N/A,0,en

"The Supernatural, the Occult, and the Bible",Gerald A. Larue,N/A,1990,"Several New Age magazines have devoted stories to a burgeoning ""Cult of the Goddess."" But this cult isn't a result of the women's movement or the product of environmental consciousness - nor is it really new. In fact, the Catholic Church has been making use of a similar cult for two thousand years. In this book, Gerald A. Larue examines the scriptural underpinnings of occult and supernaturalistic notions that survive in contemporary society. The Supernatural, the Occult, and the Bible is based on the author's thorough knowledge of the history of ancient Near-Eastern cultures and their mythology. Larue argues that biblical supernaturalism and modern occultism are two sides of the same coin, and illustrates in fascinating detail how they engender and support each other. He suggests that contemporary religions cannot shirk responsibility for some of the more foolish excesses of occult practice. Larue points out that present-day churchgoers are not as a matter of course made aware of archaeological findings that shed light on scriptural teachings - research into biblical and related languages, literary analyses of biblical texts, and studies of the relationship between concepts found in the Bible and aspects of contemporary occult beliefs and practices - and explains why this is so. The breadth of Larue's research and depth of insight, and his common sense approach, make this book both engrossing and important.","Body, Mind & Spirit",320,N/A,0,en

Studies in the History of Medieval Italian Painting,Edward B. Garrison,N/A,1993,"The four volumes of Edward Garrison's Studies, published between 1953 and 1962, represented a landmark in the study of medieval Italian painting. They made available for the first time photographs of all miniatures of the region and period concerned - principally the former Papal States and Tuscany in the twelfth century - which the author was able to track down, along with a generous selection of ornamental initials from almost every decorated manuscript he examined. The contemporary wall-paintings and panels from these regions are also illustrated and discussed. They represent one of the most valuable sources of information about twelfth-century painting in existence, and everyone interested in European art of that period has at some time found himself gratefully using them. A serious attempt has been made to get all this material into order, and the general lines of development have been set out. Together with the author's two volumes already published in our Selected Studies Series (Early Italian Painting: Selected Studies, Vols. I & II) these four volumes make available the complete corpus of Edward Garrison's work on medieval Italian painting. The two principal studies are concerned with 'Twelfth-Century Initial Styles of Central Italy' (serialized here in eleven sections) and 'Twelfth-Century Umbro-Roman painting' (serialized in six sections). Most of the non-serialized items are studies of individual manuscripts, but one should note the presence here of Supplements IV-VI to Garrison's Italian Romanesque Panel-painting: an index (Nos. I-III are available in Early Italian Painting: Selected Studies. Vol. I). The reprinting of these four volumes should be particularly welcome to art-historians, since they were originally issued in fascicule form, and many art-historical libraries lack copies.",Illumination of books and manuscripts,472,N/A,0,en
The Truth and Beauty,Andrew Klavan,Zondervan,2022-04-05,"Follow Andrew Klavan to a deeper, richer understanding of the words of Jesus. Andrew Klavan believed what he read in the Gospels, but he often struggled to understand what Jesus really meant. So he began a journey of wrestling with the beautiful and often strange words of Jesus. He learned Greek in order to read the Gospels in their original languages, and he vowed to set aside any preconceptions about what the Scriptures say. But it wasn't until he began exploring how some of history's greatest writers wrestled with the same issues we confront today--political upheaval, rejection of social norms, growing disbelief in God--that he found a new way of understanding what Jesus meant. In The Truth and Beauty, Klavan combines a decades-long writing career with a lifetime of reading to discover a fresh understanding of the Gospels. By reading the words of Jesus through the life and work of writers such as William Wordsworth and John Keats, Mary Shelley and Samuel Taylor Coleridge--the English romantics--Klavan discovered a way to encounter Jesus in a deeper and more profound way than ever before. For readers seeking to find renewed meaning in the words of Jesus--and for those who are striving for belief in a materialistic world--The Truth and Beauty offers an intimate account of one man's struggle to understand the Gospels in all their strangeness, and so find his way to a life that is, as he says, ""the most creative, the most joyful, and surely the most true.""",Religion,270,N/A,0,en

Children’s Bibles in America,Russell W. Dalton,Bloomsbury Publishing,2015-11-19,"Children's Bibles have been among the most popular and influential types of religious publications in the United States, providing many Americans with their first formative experiences of the Bible and its stories. In Children's Bibles in America, Russell W. Dalton explores the variety of ways in which children's Bibles have adapted, illustrated, and retold Bible stories for children throughout U.S. history. This reception history of the story of Noah as it appears in children's Bibles provides striking examples of the multivalence and malleability of biblical texts, and offers intriguing snapshots of American culture and American religion in their most basic forms. Dalton demonstrates the ways in which children's Bibles reflect and reveal America's diverse and changing beliefs about God, childhood, morality, and what must be passed on to the next generation. Dalton uses the popular story of Noah's ark as a case study, exploring how it has been adapted and appropriated to serve in a variety of social agendas. Throughout America's history, the image of God in children's Bible adaptations of the story of Noah has ranged from that of a powerful, angry God who might destroy children at any time to that of a friendly God who will always keep children safe. At the same time, Noah has been lifted up as a model of virtues ranging from hard work and humble obedience to patience and positive thinking. Dalton explores these uses of the story of Noah and more as he engages the fields of biblical studies, the history of religion in America, religious education, childhood studies, and children's literature.",Religion,317,N/A,0,en

The Women of the Bible Speak,Shannon Bream,HarperCollins,2021-03-30,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER! The women of the Bible lived timeless stories—by examining them, we can understand what it means to be a woman of faith. People unfamiliar with Scripture often assume that women play a small, secondary role in the Bible. But in fact, they were central figures in numerous Biblical tales. It was Queen Esther’s bravery at a vital point in history which saved her entire people. The Bible contains warriors like Jael, judges like Deborah, and prophets like Miriam. The first person to witness Jesus’ resurrection was Mary Magdalene, who promptly became the first Christian evangelist, eager to share the news which would change the world forever. In The Women of the Bible Speak, Fox News Channel's Shannon Bream opens up the lives of sixteen of these Biblical women, arranging them into pairs and contrasting their journeys. In pairing their stories, Shannon helps us reflect not only on the meaning of each individual’s life, but on how they relate to each other and to us. From the shepherdesses of ancient Israel who helped raise the future leaders of the people of God, to the courageous early Christians, the narrative of the Bible offers us many vivid and fascinating female characters. In their lives we can see common struggles to resist bitterness, despair, and pride, and to instead find their true selves in faith, hope, and love. In studying these heroes of the faith, we can find wisdom and warnings for how to better navigate our own faith journeys. The Women of the Bible Speak outlines the lessons we can take from the valor of Esther, the hope of Hannah, the audacity of Rahab, and the faith of Mary. In broadening each woman’s individual story, Shannon offers us a deeper understanding of each, and wisdom and insights that can transform our own lives today.",Religion,256,N/A,0,en

The Invisible Bestseller,Kenneth A. Briggs,Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing,2016,"How can a book -- one that's found in courthouses, libraries, and millions of households across the land -- be everywhere and nowhere at the same time? In this book, veteran religion writer Kenneth Briggs asks how, even as the Bible remains the best-selling book of all time, fewer Americans than ever can correctly articulate what it says, much less how it might offer guidance for their lives. In a quest to make sense of the Bible's relative disappearance from public life, Briggs shares with readers his own two-year cross-country journey to a variety of places. Brigg's narrative incorporates pertinent interviews throughout with preachers, pollsters, scholars, and ordinary citizens from California to Texas to Florida to Massachusetts. As he probes and reflects on his varied findings, Briggs offers keen insight into why and how the Bible's place in American public life has shifted and shrunk -- and he suggests what role the Bible may play in the US in years to come. -- adapted from book flap.",History,255,N/A,0,en
The Jewish Annotated New Testament,"Amy-Jill Levine, Marc Z. Brettler",Oxford University Press,2011-11-15,"Although major New Testament figures--Jesus and Paul, Peter and James, Jesus' mother Mary and Mary Magdalene--were Jews, living in a culture steeped in Jewish history, beliefs, and practices, there has never been an edition of the New Testament that addresses its Jewish background and the culture from which it grew--until now. In The Jewish Annotated New Testament, eminent experts under the general editorship of Amy-Jill Levine and Marc Z. Brettler put these writings back into the context of their original authors and audiences. And they explain how these writings have affected the relations of Jews and Christians over the past two thousand years. An international team of scholars introduces and annotates the Gospels, Acts, Letters, and Revelation from Jewish perspectives, in the New Revised Standard Version translation. They show how Jewish practices and writings, particularly the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, influenced the New Testament writers. From this perspective, readers gain new insight into the New Testament's meaning and significance. In addition, thirty essays on historical and religious topics--Divine Beings, Jesus in Jewish thought, Parables and Midrash, Mysticism, Jewish Family Life, Messianic Movements, Dead Sea Scrolls, questions of the New Testament and anti-Judaism, and others--bring the Jewish context of the New Testament to the fore, enabling all readers to see these writings both in their original contexts and in the history of interpretation. For readers unfamiliar with Christian language and customs, there are explanations of such matters as the Eucharist, the significance of baptism, and ""original sin."" For non-Jewish readers interested in the Jewish roots of Christianity and for Jewish readers who want a New Testament that neither proselytizes for Christianity nor denigrates Judaism, The Jewish Annotated New Testament is an essential volume that places these writings in a context that will enlighten students, professionals, and general readers.",Religion,1268,5,1,en

The Bible presents us with a series of stories and related events. The question becomes, ""How are these stories and events connected? And what are we to do with them?"" The answer is found in understanding ""Bible Threads"". A Bible thread is the link or bridge that connects the stories and books.

God and Race,"John Siebeling, Wayne Francis",HarperCollins,2022-01-18,"A White pastor and a Black pastor, close friends who have each built racially diverse congregations, offer a model Christians can follow to open necessary conversations about race, encourage unity, and foster mutual respect to heal a wounded nation riven by racial tension and political tribalism. For years, Pastors John Siebeling and Wayne Francis have led thriving congregations that are the embodiment of diversity; Siebeling in Memphis and Francis in New York City. Many churches and leaders have sought their counsel, hoping to emulate their success. At the height of the Black Lives Matter protests in Summer 2020, they pooled their insights and experiences to help others facilitate conversations about racism. The guide they developed is the basis of God and Race. Siebeling and Francis examine the White-Black tension from both perspectives and answer all the uncomfortable questions we’re afraid to ask—regarding ourselves, our families, our work and relationships, and the church. Most important, they provide practical steps anyone can take to become part of the solution. Whether you are a church leader or just a caring person who wants to make a difference, God and Race provides inspiration and guidance to help you become an agent of reconciliation and change. These two wise pastors teach you how to find your voice and join Jesus in healing, to help bring our divided communities together with open minds, open hearts, and open hands. Many Christian books on race either do not ask the hard questions or, if they do, speak as critics outside the mainstream church. Siebeling and Francis probe the meaning of racial reconciliation and reveal how the church can be a positive and effective leader to move us forward, beyond hate and injustice, to equality and love.",Religion,250,N/A,0,en
The Aleppo Codex,Matti Friedman,Algonquin Books,2013-05-14,"Winner of the 2014 Sami Rohr Prize for Jewish Literature A thousand years ago, the most perfect copy of the Hebrew Bible was written. It was kept safe through one upheaval after another in the Middle East, and by the 1940s it was housed in a dark grotto in Aleppo, Syria, and had become known around the world as the Aleppo Codex. Journalist Matti Friedman’s true-life detective story traces how this precious manuscript was smuggled from its hiding place in Syria into the newly founded state of Israel and how and why many of its most sacred and valuable pages went missing. It’s a tale that involves grizzled secret agents, pious clergymen, shrewd antiquities collectors, and highly placed national figures who, as it turns out, would do anything to get their hands on an ancient, decaying book. What it reveals are uncomfortable truths about greed, state cover-ups, and the fascinating role of historical treasures in creating a national identity.",History,320,N/A,0,en

A Man Named Joseph,Joe Heschmeyer,Our Sunday Visitor,2021-03-05,"After spending more than a millennium in relative obscurity, Saint Joseph has become the second-most mentioned saint in the papal magisterium after the Virgin Mary. To understand the life and importance of Saint Joseph, a good place to start is with the first papal title ever granted him: “Patron of the Universal Church.” What is it that Saint Joseph has to offer the Church — and each one of us — today? That’s the question that A Man Named Joseph: Guardian for Our Times seeks to answer. To get there, author, podcaster, and blogger Joe Heschmeyer cuts through a lot of our misconceptions to see what the Bible and the earliest Christians really say about Joseph as a model husband, father, and saint. Questions at the end of each chapter help guide personal reflection and group discussion. Whatever we may be facing in life, we can go to Joseph for his example, his protection, and his prayers. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Joe Heschmeyer is an instructor at the Holy Family School of Faith and the author of Who Am I, Lord? Finding Your Identity in Christ and Pope Peter: Defending the Church’s Most Distinctive Doctrine in a Time of Crisis. He cohosts The Catholic Podcast and blogs at ShamelessPopery.com. Previously, he was a litigator in Washington, D.C., and a seminarian for the Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas.

Seized by Truth,Prof. Joel B. Green,Abingdon Press,2010-09-01,"We read the Bible and interpret Scripture in order to live in grace-filled relation to God's divine purpose.When we approach the Bible as Scripture author, Joel Green, takes seriously the faith statement that the Bible is our Book; these scriptures are our Scripture. We are not reading someone else's mail--as though reading the Bible had to do foremost with recovering an ancient meaning intended for someone else and then translating its principles for use in our own lives. When we recall that we are the people of God to whom the Bible is addressed as Scripture, we realize that the fundamental transformation is not the transformation of an ancient message into a contemporary meaning, bur rather the transformation of our lives by means of God's Word. This means that reading the Bible as Scripture has less to do with what tools we bring to the task, however important these may be, and more to do with our own dispositions as we come to our engagement with Scripture. We come not so much to retrieve facts or to gain information, but to be formed and ultimately, transformed. Scripture does not present us with texts to be mastered but with a Word, God's Word, intent on mastering us, on shaping our lives.",Religion,196,N/A,0,en

How the Bible Begins,John R. Heapes,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2021-05-24,"How the Bible Begins: A Sociological Study uses a Dramaturgical Approach, borrowed from Erving Goffman. This theatrical metaphor has readers imagining society like a play in five acts: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. The curtain goes up in Genesis to an empty, dark stage that, shortly afterwards, has its first performers appear--Adam, and then Eve. The foundation of this book rests on six fundamental questions which are answered within its pages: who, what, when, where, why, and how. Readers learn how many people populate each biblical book, each book's theme, when events took place, where action happened, what each book's purpose was, and how each book was composed. These books chronicled the passage of travelers who first departed Mesopotamia in search of the promised land, and later they left Egypt after four hundred years of slavery.

Approaching the Bible in medieval England,Eyal Poleg,Manchester University Press,2016-05-16,"How did people learn their Bibles in the Middle Ages? Did church murals, biblical manuscripts, sermons or liturgical processions transmit the Bible in the same way? This book unveils the dynamics of biblical knowledge and dissemination in thirteenth- and fourteenth-century England. An extensive and interdisciplinary survey of biblical manuscripts and visual images, sermons and chants, reveals how the unique qualities of each medium became part of the way the Bible was known and recalled; how oral, textual, performative and visual means of transmission joined to present a surprisingly complex biblical worldview. This study of liturgy and preaching, manuscript culture and talismanic use introduces the concept of biblical mediation, a new way to explore Scriptures and society. It challenges the lay-clerical divide by demonstrating that biblical exegesis was presented to the laity in non-textual means, while the ‘naked text’ of the Bible remained elusive even for the educated clergy.",History,248,N/A,0,en

Mastering the Discipline of Bible Study,Jenai J. Rasmussen Ed.D.,WestBow Press,2022-07-22,"This work, along with the other volumes in the Foundational Knowledge of the Bible series, can help those who are young in the faith to seek a Christian relationship with God. All who choose to enter into the new covenant must concurrently embrace a new perceptual field. By heeding God’s call to service, believers embark upon a Christian journey to become wise from the application of spiritual knowledge. This is made possible with the indwelling of the Holy Spirit who guides covenant believers in the faithful word of God, which is the source of all spiritual truth in this world. The intended purpose presented in this plan of action is to speak the truth of God in love so that the brethren can learn godly discernment, be equipped with sound doctrine, and grow together in all things according to Christ’s authoritative leadership (Eph. 4:15). By becoming covenant Christians set apart by God for his particular use, we can be diligent by precisely and accurately handling the word of truth (2 Tim. 2:15). This series can serve to edify and ground those who are new in the faith because the revelation of God provides all the essential answers to life’s pressing spiritual questions, whether general or specific. Accordingly, Christ’s disciples need to comprehend the questions before the answers can have real meaning. No greater reason can be given for studying the Bible. Therefore, the people of God are duty-bound to master this Christian discipline. The first volume in this series is divided into three phases of Bible study: “Why” addresses the importance of knowing God’s word, study motivations, conditions for discipleship, Christian distinctions, and the attributes needed to study biblical truth. “How” covers preliminary actions, Bible versions, principles, study considerations, and necessary skills. “What” offers a unique sevenfold framework for understanding the Bible. Divine power can move the Scriptures to be more than words on a page. It can become a life-changing force for good in the world. To that end, this resource directs the reader on how to inquire, search, and ask diligently concerning godly truth. Invaluable information, accessible resources, clear educational materials, and deep biblical insights will all quickly serve to establish beginning students in the Sacred Text. This work will also prepare the reader to receive the Scriptures by learning how to obtain a faithful accounting of spiritual truth. To be sure, wisdom is the result of applying biblical knowledge to our lives. By speaking divine truth in love, believers can grow together in Christ as fellow workers who labor in the word of God. There is no greater work in this world than to share this life-saving truth with others. The obligation of receiving divine knowledge requires that it be shared. Truly, giving the hope and joy that is found in Jesus Christ, and the message he brought from the Father, is the greatest privilege of a human life. Amen, and amen.",Religion,1543,N/A,0,en

Old-Earth Creationism on Trail,"Tim Chaffey, Dr. Jason Lisle",New Leaf Publishing Group,2008-07-01,"""Twenty-somethings once faithfully attended church. What made them stop? While most said they still believe that the Bible is God's Word, they also said that the idea that the earth is millions of years old was one thing that caused them to doubt the bible? The crumbling foundation of the church takes a devastating toll on future generations. Therefore, churches must reclaim the historical truth found in Genesis and apply the Bible's authority to every area of life."" -Ken Ham, President Answers in Genesis As the modern Church struggles to find a place of relevancy for a new generation that already has massive demands on its time and attention, more and more young people raised in the Church are leaving it - failing to find the answers to their questions of faith and life, beset with doubts raised by issues that the Church chooses not to address. Opting to skirt the controversy of Genesis as literal history, the biblical authority of the Holy Word is called into question and reduced to a collection of mere stories. More popularly considered an issue for schools or in the public realm, the conflicting views on the age of the earth also remain a pivotal issue within the Church - as it has for over two centuries. Was the Creation week literally six days? Does science really point to an old earth? Does the issue really matter for Christians? Should this issue even be discussed within the Church? Join authors Dr. Jason Lisle and Tim Chaffey as they put forth a case against an old-earth interpretation of Scripture.

Reading God's Story,George H. Guthrie,B&H Publishing Group,2011-11-01,"Stories are basic to life. Everybody loves a good story. We have been reading, listening to, or watching stories all of our lives, so we intuitively know a lot about how they work. Yet, more and more, Christians are unfamiliar with the stories of the Bible and how the grand narrative of God's Word fits together. Indeed, God gave us the stories of the Bible to reveal great truth about Himself and about our lives, and He wants to draw us into the ongoing story of what He is doing in the world. By focusing on the narrative framework of Scripture we can better understand what the Bible teaches and live out its instruction more effectively. Reading God's Story takes that clear narrative approach to the Bible, arranging the complete text into a fresh chronological reading plan developed for the Read the Bible for Life biblical literacy initiative. In this plan the books, chapters, and verses of the Bible are thoughtfully arranged so readers can track the story of Scripture, day by day, from beginning to end, understanding the flow of events and how all the different parts fit together to make sense. Reading God's Story features two-color interior page layout and is organized into 52 weeks of readings (six readings per week). It presents Scripture in three main acts (God's Plan for All People; God's Covenant People; God's New Covenant People) and seventeen total scenes, providing an introduction for each act and scene to orient the reader to its importance in the grand story. Unlike other chronological Bibles, this arrangement is not date specific (e.g. ""January 1""), so a person can begin using this edition at any point in the calendar year.",Bibles,1879,N/A,0,en

How Do You Read the Bible?,J. C. Ryle,Banner of Truth Trust,2021-11-09,"According to J. C. Ryle, next to praying there is nothing so important in practical religion as Bible reading. God in his mercy has given us a book 'which is able to make us wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus' (2 Tim. 3:15). By reading the Bible we may learn what to believe, what to be, and what to do; how to live with comfort, and how to die in peace. Can anything, therefore, be more important than being in possession of a Bible? However, to have a Bible is one thing, to read it is quite another. Happy is the one who not only has a Bible but who reads it, obeys it, and makes it the rule of one's faith and practice! In this little book Ryle clearly explains why we ought to value the Bible highly, to study it regularly, and to make ourselves thoroughly acquainted with its contents. This book consists of material extracted from Ryle's Practical Religion, which is also published by the Trust.",Religion,65,N/A,0,en

From Typology to Doxology,Andrew David Naselli,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2012-07-12,"At the end of Romans 11, Paul quotes both Isaiah and Job. As with other New Testament uses of Old Testament texts, this raises several questions. What is the context of these Old Testament passages? How are they used in other Jewish literature? What is Paul's hermeneutical warrant for using them in Romans 11? What theological use does Paul make of them? How, if at all, does their use in Romans 11 contribute to the broader discussion on the use of the Old Testament in the New? In addressing these questions, this book reveals a remarkable typological connection that climaxes in the doxology of Romans 11:33-36, exalting God's incomprehensibility, wisdom, mercy, grace, patience, independence, and sovereignty.",Religion,214,N/A,0,en

A must for every pastor and teacher who wants to clearly present the truths of the Bible."" --Dr. Jerry Falwell, Founder of Liberty University ""A compendium of charts, time lines, lists and illustrations to accompany study of the Bible. This visually appealing resource provides a wide array of illustrative and textually concise references, beginning with three sets of charts covering the Bible as a whole, the Old Testament and the New Testament. These charts cover such topics as biblical weights and measures, feasts and holidays and the 12 disciples. Most of the charts use a variety of illustrative techniques to convey lessons and provide visual interest. A worthwhile example is 'How We Got the Bible, ' which provides a time line of translation history, comparisons of canons among faiths and portraits of important figures in biblical translation, such as Jerome and John Wycliffe. The book then presents a section of maps, followed by diagrams to conceptualize such structures as Noah's Ark and Solomon's Temple. Finally, a section on Christianity, cults and other religions describes key aspects of history and doctrine for certain Christian sects and other faith traditions. Overall, the authors take a traditionalist, conservative approach. For instance, they list Moses as the author of the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible) without making mention of claims to the contrary. When comparing various Christian sects and world religions, the emphasis is on doctrine and orthodox theology. Some chapters, however, may not completely align with the needs of Catholic and Orthodox churches. But the author's leanings are muted enough and do not detract from the work's usefulness. As a resource, it's well organized, inviting and visually stimulating. Even the most seasoned reader will learn something while browsing.

Secrets from Heaven: Hidden Treasure of Faith in the Parables and Conversations of Jesus,Fr Sebastian Walshe,Catholic Answers Press,2020-05,"The greatest teacher who ever lived, Jesus knew how to reach his audience where they were at. Whether preaching to a group in parable or holding an intimate conversation, he had an unequaled ability to get across the message that his listeners needed to hear. His teachings in the Gospels speak no less directly to us today. But so rich in meaning are the words of our incarnate God, so layered and profound his messages, that often we fail to do more than scratch their surface. And over time, our habit of superficial encounter with the Word can become self- perpetuating. In Secrets from Heaven, Fr. Sebastian Walshe helps you break free from stale and familiar takes on the Gospel, giving you new eyes to see and new ears to hear the inexhaustible depths of Christ's wisdom. The Parable of the Sowers, the Good Samaritan, the Prodigal Son, the woman caught in adultery - all these and more come alive in fresh ways, revealing significant details and nuances, scriptural/historical connections, and testaments to Christ's rhetorical and pedagogical genius that you've never noted before. You'll marvel at Jesus' skill as an evangelist; but more importantly, you'll be powerfully moved to faith and love just as those who heard him in person long ago. Nothing Jesus taught was truly ""secret"" - he revealed the Father for all the world to see. But that doesn't mean his revelation is simplistic.

While some papers in the book address Luther’s antisemitism and the NS-Zeit, most papers broaden the scope of the investigation: Protestant-Jewish theological encounters shaped not only antisemitism but also the Jewish Reform movement and Protestant philosemitic post-Holocaust theology; interactions between Jews and Protestants took place not only in the German lands but also in the wider Protestant universe; theology was crucial for the articulation of attitudes toward Jews, but music and philosophy were additional spheres of creativity that enabled the process of thinking through the relations between Judaism and Protestantism. By bringing together various contributions on these and other aspects, the book opens up directions for future research on this intricate topic, which bears both historical significance and evident relevance to our own time.",History,290,N/A,0,en

The creation room, vast and sublime. The exodus room, with hardhearted pharaohs and dried-up seas. The war room, with bloody swords and crumbling walls. The tabernacle room, with smoking altars and dark inner sanctums. What does this odd and ancient world have to do with us, who are modern followers of Jesus? As it turns out, everything! Every chapter in the Old Testament, in a variety of ways, tells the story that culminates in Jesus the Messiah. What Christians today call the Old Testament is what Jesus and the earliest believers simply called the Scriptures. That was their Bible. From its pages, they taught about the Messiah's divine nature, his priestly work, his ministry of salvation. The Christ Key will reintroduce readers to these old books as ever-fresh, ever-new testimonies of Jesus.

All You Want to Know About Hell,Steve Gregg,Thomas Nelson,2013-11-12,"All You Want to Know About Hell breaks down the three most popular views on hell and tells us what the Bible really says about this terrifying and mystifying place. It is an undeniable fact that the very concept of hell is shrouded in mystery. We know what books and movies tell us hell is like, but we're left with so many questions. Is hell simply a place where sinners are sent to suffer for their sins, or is it more than that? How could a loving God send anyone to hell? Does the Bible give us a clear and consistent picture of hell? What does the existence of hell tell us about God's character? Steve Gregg--author of Revelation: Four Views--will take you on a tour of the three most popular views on hell and walk you through a clear explanation of what Scripture really says. From the ""traditional"" view of hell as a place of eternal torment to the early Christian view that hell is a place of suffering intended to purge sin and to bring about repentance, no other book gives such in-depth biblical insight into the truths about hell that are hidden in all the hype.

Martin Luther on Reading the Bible as Christian Scripture,William M. Marsh,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2017-07-17,"Above all else that the sixteenth-century German Reformer was known for, Martin Luther was a Doctor of the Holy Scriptures. One of the most characteristic features of Luther's approach to Scripture was his resolved christological interpretation of the Bible. Many of the Reformer's interpreters have looked back upon Luther's ""Christ-centered"" exposition of the Scriptures with sentimentality but have often labeled it as ""Christianization,"" particularly in regards to Luther's approach of the Old Testament, dismissing his relevance for today's faithful readers of God's Word. This study revisits this assessment of Luther's christological interpretation of Scripture by way of critical analysis of the Reformer's ""prefaces to the Bible"" that he wrote for his translation of the Scriptures into the German vernacular. This work contends that Luther foremost believes Jesus Christ to be the sensus literalis of Scripture on the basis of the Bible's messianic promise, not enforcing a dogmatic principle onto the scriptural text and its biblical authors that would be otherwise foreign to them. This study asserts that Luther's exegesis of the Bible's ""letter"" (i.e., his engagement with the biblical text) is primarily responsible for his conviction that Christ is Holy Scripture's literal sense.",Religion,226,N/A,0,en

"The Oxford Handbook of the Bible in Early Modern England, c. 1530-1700","Kevin Killeen, Helen Smith, Rachel Judith Willie",OUP Oxford,2015-08-27,"The Bible was, by any measure, the most important book in early modern England. It preoccupied the scholarship of the era, and suffused the idioms of literature and speech. Political ideas rode on its interpretation and deployed its terms. It was intricately related to the project of natural philosophy. And it was central to daily life at all levels of society from parliamentarian to preacher, from the 'boy that driveth the plough', famously invoked by Tyndale, to women across the social scale. It circulated in texts ranging from elaborate folios to cheap catechisms; it was mediated in numerous forms, as pictures, songs, and embroideries, and as proverbs, commonplaces, and quotations. Bringing together leading scholars from a range of fields, The Oxford Handbook of the Bible in Early Modern England, 1530-1700 explores how the scriptures served as a generative motor for ideas, and a resource for creative and political thought, as well as for domestic and devotional life. Sections tackle the knotty issues of translation, the rich range of early modern biblical scholarship, Bible dissemination and circulation, the changing political uses of the Bible, literary appropriations and responses, and the reception of the text across a range of contexts and media. Where existing scholarship focuses, typically, on Tyndale and the King James Bible of 1611, The Oxford Handbook of the Bible in England, 1530-1700 goes further, tracing the vibrant and shifting landscape of biblical culture in the two centuries following the Reformation.",Literary Criticism,817,5,1,en

"The Codex Amiatinus and its “Sister” Bibles: Scripture, Liturgy, and Art in the Milieu of the Venerable Bede",Celia Chazelle,BRILL,2019-03-27,"The Codex Amiatinus and its “Sister” Bibles examines the full Bibles (Bibles containing every scriptural text that producers deemed canonical) made at the northern English monastery of Wearmouth–Jarrow under Abbot Ceolfrith (d. 716) and the Venerable Bede (d. 735), and the religious, cultural, and intellectual circumstances of their production. The key manuscript witness of this monastery’s Bible-making enterprise is the Codex Amiatinus, a massive illustrated volume sent toward Rome in June 716, as a gift to St. Peter. Amiatinus is the oldest extant, largely intact Latin full Bible. Its survival is the critical reason that Ceolfrith’s Wearmouth–Jarrow has long been recognized as a pivotal center in the evolution of the design, structure, and contents of medieval biblical codices.

The Clement Bible at the Medieval Courts of Naples and Avignon,CathleenA. Fleck,Routledge,2017-07-05,"As a 'biography' of the fourteenth-century illustrated Bible of Clement VII, an opposition pope in Avignon from 1378-94, this social history traces the Bible's production in Naples (c. 1330) through its changing ownership and meaning in Avignon (c. 1340-1405) to its presentation as a gift to Alfonso, King of Aragon (c. 1424). The author's novel approach, based on solid art historical and anthropological methodologies, allows her to assess the object's evolving significance and the use of such a Bible to enhance the power and prestige of its princely and papal owners. Through archival sources, the author pinpoints the physical location and privileged treatment of the Clement Bible over a century. The author considers how the Bible's contexts in the collection of a bishop, several popes, and a king demonstrate the value of the Bible as an exchange commodity. The Bible was undoubtedly valued for the aesthetic quality of its 200+ luxurious images. Additionally, the author argues that its iconography, especially Jerusalem and visionary scenes, augments its worth as a reflection of contemporary political and religious issues. Its images offered biblical precedents, its style represented associations with certain artists and regions in Italy, and its past provided links to important collections. Fleck's examination of the art production around the Bible in Naples and Avignon further illuminates the manuscript's role as a reflection of the court cultures in those cities. Adding to recent art historical scholarship focusing on the taste and signature styles in late medieval and Renaissance courts, this study provides new information about workshop practices and techniques. In these two court cities, the author analyzes styles associated with different artists, different patrons, and even with different rooms of the rulers' palaces, offering new findings relevant to current scholarship, not only in art history but also in court and collection studies.",Art,352,N/A,0,en

The Bible on the Shakespearean Stage,"Thomas Fulton, Kristen Poole",Cambridge University Press,2018-04-26,"The Bible was everywhere in Shakespeare's England. Through sermons, catechisms, treatises, artwork, literature and, of course, biblical reading itself, the stories and language of the Bible pervaded popular and elite culture. In recent years, scholars have demonstrated how thoroughly biblical allusions saturate Shakespearean plays. But Shakespeare's audiences were not simply well versed in the Bible's content - they were also steeped in the practices and methods of biblical interpretation. Reformation and counter-reformation debate focused not just on the biblical text, but - crucially - on how to read the text. The Bible on the Shakespearean Stage is the first volume to integrate the study of Shakespeare's plays with the vital history of Reformation practices of biblical interpretation. Bringing together the foremost international scholars in the field of 'Shakespeare and the Bible', these essays explore Shakespeare's engagement with scriptural interpretation in the tragedies, histories, comedies, and romances.",Literary Criticism,322,N/A,0,en

Hagar Bible Study Guide,"Jada Edwards, Kasey Van Norman, Nicole Johnson",HarperChristian Resources,2018-12-31,"The women in the Bible asked the same three questions we all still ask today: How does everyone else see me? How do I see myself? How does God see me? The Known By Name Bible study series for women—taught by seasoned Bible teachers Jada Edwards, Kasey Van Norman, and Nicole Johnson—will take you and your group through the lives of biblical women to learn more about God and how to answer these essential questions. Hagar's story, found in Genesis 16, is a story of cultural victimization. She was betrayed, abandoned, and scorned. Her response? She did what most of us would do when deeply hurt by someone we trust—she ran away. She got defensive. She retreated to a place where she felt safe. She felt justified in her anger and hurt. But deep in her core was a woman who longed to be seen and hoped for redemption. Follow Hagar in this 4-session Bible study (DVD/video streaming sold separately) as she learns from hurt and heartache that what is unresolved is not unseen by God. The lack of finality in Hagar's story teaches us to trust God with the ending—believing that he sees us and knows.

An initial orientation introduces the origins, components, and organization of medieval Bibles. Subsequent chapters address the use of the Bible in teaching and preaching, the production and purpose of Biblical manuscripts in religious life, early vernacular versions of the Bible, its influence on medieval historical accounts, the relationship between the Bible and monasticism, and instances of privileged and practical use, as well as the various forms the text took in different parts of Europe.

The Roman Catholic Lectionary and the Bible,Mark G. Boyer,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2024-06-28,"The bishops attending the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) decreed that the treasures of the Bible were to be opened for Roman Catholics by presenting a larger part of the Bible over three years. The first one-volume Lectionary, a collection of biblical texts appointed for worship on given days--what ultimately became four volumes plus a supplement in English--was published in Latin on September 30, 1970. The result of people seeing four volumes consisting of more pages than most Bibles was the erroneous thinking that they heard (read) the whole Bible every three years! The Lectionary edits the Bible. Biblical topics offensive to modern readers are omitted. Powerful biblical women are ignored. Biblical prophetic books are chopped by piecing together verses. There is no application of modern biblical analysis. The biblical passages presented in the Lectionary have been chosen to fit the liturgical year, even though the liturgical year did not exist when the Bible was written! The purpose of this book is to present some sobering statistics about the biblical texts found (and not found) in the Roman Catholic Lectionary, reach conclusions about them, and suggest alternate biblical texts for use in the Lectionary.",Religion,135,N/A,0,en

They also show how literature excluded from the Jewish and Christian canons of Scripture remains valuable today for understanding the questions and conflicts that early Jewish and Christian faith communities faced. Through this discussion, contemporary readers acquire a broader understanding of biblical Scripture and of Jewish and Christian faith inspired by Scripture.",Religion,288,N/A,0,en

When God Spoke Greek,Timothy Michael Law,"Oxford University Press, USA",2013-08-15,"Most readers do not know about the Bible used almost universally by early Christians, or about how that Bible was birthed, how it grew to prominence, and how it differs from the one used as the basis for most modern translations. Although it was one of the most important events in the history of our civilization, the translation of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek in the third century BCE is an event almost unknown outside of academia. Timothy Michael Law offers the first book to make this topic accessible to a wider audience. Retrospectively, we can hardly imagine the history of Christian thought, and the history of Christianity itself, without the Old Testament. When the Emperor Constantine adopted the Christian faith, his fusion of the Church and the State ensured that the Christian worldview (which by this time had absorbed Jewish ideals that had come to them through the Greek translation) would leave an imprint on subsequent history. This book narrates in a fresh and exciting way the story of the Septuagint, the Greek Scriptures of the ancient Jewish Diaspora that became the first Christian Old Testament.",Bibles,229,N/A,0,en

The Case for Jesus,Brant Pitre,Image,2016-02-02,"“This book will prove to be a most effective weapon… against the debunking and skeptical attitudes toward the Gospels that are so prevalent, not only in academe, but also on the street, among young people who, sadly, are leaving the Churches in droves.” – Robert Barron, author of Catholicism For well over a hundred years now, many scholars have questioned the historical truth of the Gospels, claiming that they were originally anonymous. Others have even argued that Jesus of Nazareth did not think he was God and never claimed to be divine. In The Case for Jesus, Dr. Brant Pitre, the bestselling author of Jesus and the Jewish Roots of the Eucharist, goes back to the sources—the biblical and historical evidence for Christ—in order to answer several key questions, including: • Were the four Gospels really anonymous? • Are the Gospels folklore? Or are they biographies? • Were the four Gospels written too late to be reliable? • What about the so-called “Lost Gospels,” such as “Q” and the Gospel of Thomas? • Did Jesus claim to be God? • Is Jesus divine in all four Gospels? Or only in John? • Did Jesus fulfill the Jewish prophecies of the Messiah? • Why was Jesus crucified? • What is the evidence for the Resurrection? As The Case for Jesus will show, recent discoveries in New Testament scholarship, as well as neglected evidence from ancient manuscripts and the early church fathers, together have the potential to pull the rug out from under a century of skepticism toward the traditional Gospels. Above all, Pitre shows how the divine claims of Jesus of Nazareth can only be understood by putting them in their ancient Jewish context.",Religion,258,3,2,en

The Homeric Epics and the Gospel of Mark,"Dennis Ronald MacDonald, Professor of New Testament and Christian Origins Dennis R MacDonald",Yale University Press,2000-01-01,"In this groundbreaking book, Dennis R. MacDonald offers an entirely new view of the New Testament gospel of Mark. The author of the earliest gospel was not writing history, nor was he merely recording tradition, MacDonald argues. Close reading and careful analysis show that Mark borrowed extensively from the Odyssey and the Iliad and that he wanted his readers to recognise the Homeric antecedents in Mark's story of Jesus. Mark was composing a prose anti-epic, MacDonald says, presenting Jesus as a suffering hero modeled after but far superior to traditional Greek heroes. Much like Odysseus, Mark's Jesus sails the seas with uncomprehending companions, encounters preternatural opponents, and suffers many things before confronting rivals who have made his house a den of thieves. In his death and burial, Jesus emulates Hector, although unlike Hector Jesus leaves his tomb empty. Mark's minor characters, too, recall Homeric predecessors: Bartimaeus emulates Tiresias; Joseph of Arimathea, Priam; and the women at the tomb, Helen, Hecuba, and Andromache. And, entire episodes in Mark mirror Homeric episodes, including stilling the sea, walking on water, feeding the multitudes, the Triumphal E",Religion,284,N/A,0,en

The ESV thus provides an accurate rendering of the original texts that is in readable, high quality English prose and poetry. This Bible has been growing in popularity among students in biblical studies, mainline Christian scholars and clergy, and Evangelical Christians of all denominations. Along with that growth comes the need for the books of the Apocrypha to be included in ESV Bibles, both for denominations that use those books in liturgical readings and for students who need them for historical purposes. More Evangelicals are also beginning to be interested in the Apocrypha, even though they don't consider it God's Word. The English Standard Version Bible with the Apocrypha, for which the Apocrypha has been commissioned by Oxford University Press, employs the same methods and guidelines used by the original translators of the ESV, to produce for the first time an ESV Apocrypha. This will be the only ESV with Apocrypha available anywhere, and it includes all of the books and parts of books in the Protestant Apocrypha, the Catholic Old Testament, and the Old Testament as used in Orthodox Christian churches. It has a lovely pre-printed case binding, and includes a full-color map section, a table of weights and measures used in the Bible, and many other attractive features. The English Standard Version Bible with Apocrypha is certain to become the preferred Bible in more conservative divinity schools and seminaries, where the Apocrypha is studied from an academic perspective.

Until Unity: Study Guide,Francis Chan,David C Cook,2021-07-01,"New York Times-bestselling author Francis Chan calls for believers and churches everywhere to align our hearts with God and start taking seriously His commands to unify. It’s clear from Scripture that God desires unity for His Church. If unity is so important to the heart of God, why is the Church one of the most divided groups on earth? Chan argues that the problem is the shallowness of our love for each other—rooted in a shallowness in our understanding of the gospel. Until Unity shows us: God grieves the division in the Church, so we can’t remain indifferent Unity demands a level of humility only possible by the Spirit The power and witness of the Church hinges on our oneness Unity comes at a cost, but it commands a blessing We must come together as a Christ’s Bride. God desires His people to love one another radically and become the Church He has called us to be.

Becoming Women of the Word,Sarah Christmyer,Ave Maria Press,2019-08-02,"Winner of a 2020 Catholic Press Association book award (third place, scripture-popular studies). The women God called to bring his chosen people into the world were ordinary women who struggled with emptiness, oppression, infertility, and loss—yet who found strength and hope in God. In her first book, Sarah Christmyer—codeveloper of The Great Adventure Catholic Bible study program—pairs the stories of key Old Testament women with stories of women she has known to show us how we can hear God, say yes to his call, and share him with the world just as they did. Breaking open the scriptures to reveal the historical, cultural, and biblical context in which Old Testament women lived, Sarah Christmyer breathes new life into their stories and makes their lives surprisingly relatable. In the process, she shares stories from her own faith journey and the lives of family and friends to show how the same principles that turned ordinary women into heroines of the faith are true for our lives today. Each chapter of Becoming Women of the Word highlights the spiritual legacy of one or more women in the Old Testament. Their world was vastly different from ours, yet they faced the same questions we do: when we can’t feel God’s presence, where do we find help? When our world is collapsing, where is God? Why should we trust him? How can we trust him? Christmyer simply and clearly draws from the lives of these women important principles that help us to trust—even as we struggle with doubt. For example: Through Eve, we learn to hold on to God’s promise even when we fail. Sarah reminds us to wait on God’s timing to make us fruitful. Miriam, the sister of Moses, shows how to lead by example. Ruth and Esther challenge us to see womanhood as a gift. Hannah and Judith inspire us to trust God even in matters of life and death. These unforgettable portraits create a colorful mosaic of faith, encouraging us to mine God’s Word for spiritual treasure and to pass on the gift.",Religion,160,N/A,0,en

The Cities That Built the Bible,Robert R. Cargill,HarperCollins,2016-03-15,"For many, the names Bethlehem, Babylon, and Jerusalem are known as the setting for epic stories from the Bible featuring rustic mangers, soaring towers, and wooden crosses. What often gets missed is that these cities are far more than just the setting for the Bible and its characters—they were instrumental to the creation of the Bible as we know it today. Robert Cargill, Assistant Professor of Classics and Religious Studies at the University of Iowa, is an archeologist, Bible scholar, and host of numerous television documentaries, such as the History Channel series Bible Secrets Revealed. Taking us behind-the-scenes of the Bible, Cargill blends archaeology, biblical history, and personal journey as he explores these cities and their role in the creation of the Bible. He reveals surprising facts such as what the Bible says about the birth of Jesus and how Mary’s Virgin Birth caused problems for the early church. We’ll also see how the God of the Old Testament was influenced by other deities, that there were numerous non-biblical books written about Moses, Jacob, and Jesus in antiquity, and how far more books were left out of the Bible than were let in during the messy, political canonization process. The Cities That Built the Bible is a magnificent tour through fourteen cities: the Phoenicia cities of Tyre, Sidon, and Byblos, Ugarit, Nineveh, Babylon, Megiddo, Athens, Alexandria, Jerusalem, Qumran, Bethlehem, Nazareth, and Rome. Along the way, Cargill includes photos of artifacts, dig sites, ruins, and relics, taking readers on a far-reaching journey from the Grotto of the Nativity to the battlegrounds of Megiddo, from the towering Acropolis of Athens to the caves in Qumran where the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered. An exciting adventure through time, The Cities That Built the Bible is a fresh, fascinating exploration that sheds new light on the Bible.",Religion,217,N/A,0,en

The Protestant's Dilemma,Devin Rose,Catholic Answers,2014-02-27,"What if Protestantism were true? What if the Reformers really were heroes, the Bible the sole rule of faith, and Christ's Church just an invisible collection of loosely united believers? As an Evangelical, Devin Rose used to believe all of it. Then one day the nagging questions began. He noticed things about Protestant belief and practice that didn't add up. He began following the logic of Protestant claims to places he never expected it to go -leading to conclusions no Christians would ever admit to holding. In The Protestant's Dilemma, Rose examines over thirty of those conclusions, showing with solid evidence, compelling reason, and gentle humor how the major tenets of Protestantism - if honestly pursued to their furthest extent - wind up in dead ends. The only escape? Catholic truth. Rose patiently unpacks each instance, and shows how Catholicism solves the Protestant's dilemma through the witness of Scripture, Christian history, and the authority with which Christ himself undeniably vested his Church.",Religion,224,N/A,0,en

Bergsma employs the same conversational style and simple illustrations found in Bible Basics for Catholics and New Testament Basics for Catholics to help bridge the gap between the world of contemporary Catholics and the ancient world of the Bible. In Psalm Basics for Catholics, John Bergsma introduces us to King David, the story of Israel, and the salvation of the Jewish people through the coming of Jesus. For more than two thousand years, Christians have sung, chanted, and prayed the psalms, a practice of worship inherited from our Jewish ancestors in faith. Whether prayed during Mass, the Liturgy of the Hours, or in personal reflection, these ancient hymns continue to be a guiding light for Catholics. Yet rarely do we step back and look at how the psalms fit into the story of salvation revealed in the Bible the way Bergsma does here. Bergsma also addresses common questions about the psalms, including Do the psalms really predict Jesus? What do we make of the so-called curse psalms? Why do we pray the psalms in the Liturgy of the Hours? How do I read and pray the psalms? Bergsma's insightful, practical examination of the psalms helps Catholics see how their promise is fulfilled in Christ.",Religion,160,N/A,0,en

A New English Translation of the Septuagint,"Albert Pietersma, Benjamin G. Wright",Oxford University Press,2007-11-02,"The Septuagint (the ancient Greek translation of Jewish sacred writings) is of great importance in the history of both Judaism and Christianity. The first translation of the books of the Hebrew Bible (plus additions) into the common language of the ancient Mediterranean world made the Jewish scriptures accessible to many outside Judaism. Not only did the Septuagint become Holy Writ to Greek speaking Jews but it was also the Bible of the early Christian communities: the scripture they cited and the textual foundation of the early Christian movement. Translated from Hebrew (and Aramaic) originals in the two centuries before Jesus, the Septuagint provides important information about the history of the text of the Bible. For centuries, scholars have looked to the Septuagint for information about the nature of the text and of how passages and specific words were understood. For students of the Bible, the New Testament in particular, the study of the Septuagint's influence is a vital part of the history of interpretation.

Misquoting Jesus,Bart D. Ehrman,Harper Collins,2009-10-06,"When world-class biblical scholar Bart Ehrman first began to study the texts of the Bible in their original languages he was startled to discover the multitude of mistakes and intentional alterations that had been made by earlier translators. In Misquoting Jesus, Ehrman tells the story behind the mistakes and changes that ancient scribes made to the New Testament and shows the great impact they had upon the Bible we use today. He frames his account with personal reflections on how his study of the Greek manuscripts made him abandon his once ultraconservative views of the Bible. Since the advent of the printing press and the accurate reproduction of texts, most people have assumed that when they read the New Testament they are reading an exact copy of Jesus's words or Saint Paul's writings. And yet, for almost fifteen hundred years these manuscripts were hand copied by scribes who were deeply influenced by the cultural, theological, and political disputes of their day. Both mistakes and intentional changes abound in the surviving manuscripts, making the original words difficult to reconstruct. For the first time, Ehrman reveals where and why these changes were made and how scholars go about reconstructing the original words of the New Testament as closely as possible. Ehrman makes the provocative case that many of our cherished biblical stories and widely held beliefs concerning the divinity of Jesus, the Trinity, and the divine origins of the Bible itself stem from both intentional and accidental alterations by scribes -- alterations that dramatically affected all subsequent versions of the Bible.",Religion,258,N/A,0,en

This volume also highlights the intricate theological and philosophical deliberations that were carried out between and among influential North African Christian leaders and scholars—in diverse cultural and geopolitical settings—while paying attention to the complex manner in which these Scripture-laden discourses intersected the wide variety of religious opinions and ecclesiastical and/or theological movements that so clearly marked this region in this era.",Religion,624,N/A,0,en

A separate section interprets the thought of Johannes Scottus Eriugena, whose connections with earlier authors and influence on medieval neoplatonists constitutes a leitmotiv throughout the volume. The twelfth century is represented by articles on Gilbert of Poitiers on matter, Adelard of Bath, Honorius of Autun, Abelard's ethics and theology, monastic asceticism, Hildegard of Bingen's allegories, allegorical zoology, Alan of Lille's anthropology, the role of the Muses, and the Hermetic Asclepius.

The Latin New Testament,H. A. G. Houghton,Oxford University Press,2016,"This is an open access title available under the terms of a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 licence. It is free to read at Oxford Scholarship Online and offered as a free PDF download from OUP and selected open access locations. Latin is the language in which the New Testament was copied, read, and studied for over a millennium. The remains of the initial 'Old Latin' version preserve important testimony for early forms of text and the way in which the Bible was understood by the first translators. Successive revisions resulted in a standard version subsequently known as the Vulgate which, along with the creation of influential commentaries by scholars such as Jerome and Augustine, shaped theology and exegesis for many centuries. Latin gospel books and other New Testament manuscripts illustrate the continuous tradition of Christian book culture, from the late antique codices of Roman North Africa and Italy to the glorious creations of Northumbrian scriptoria, the pandects of the Carolingian era, eleventh-century Giant Bibles, and the Paris Bibles associated with the rise of the university. In The Latin New Testament, H. A. G. Houghton provides a comprehensive introduction to the history and development of the Latin New Testament. Drawing on major editions and recent advances in scholarship, he offers a new synthesis which brings together evidence from Christian authors and biblical manuscripts from earliest times to the late Middle Ages. All manuscripts identified as containing Old Latin evidence for the New Testament are described in a catalogue, along with those featured in the two principal modern editions of the Vulgate. A user's guide is provided for these editions and the other key scholarly tools for studying the Latin New Testament.",Literary Criticism,387,N/A,0,en

This exposition looks at what these letters teach us about God’s character, His relationship with His people, and His call for our commitment. The authors also help us better understand the book of Revelation—one of the most misunderstood books of the Bible. Though Revelation is often daunting to laypeople and scholars alike, The Bible Knowledge Commentary gives life-changing insight into the interpretation, purpose, and application of this profound book.

Old Picture Books : With other Essays on Bookish Subjects,Alfred W. Pollard,METHUEN AND CO,2013,"Old Picture Books : With other Essays on Bookish Subjects In papers brought together in this volume the reader is asked to look at the woodcuts to two old Italian Bibles, at the beautiful cuts which make the Florentine Miracle Plays or Rappresentazioni so highly esteemed, at the illustrations to French editions of the 'Hours of the Blessed Virgin,' and at some examples of the curious transformations and vicissitudes which old wood blocks and the designs for them went through ere yet either clichés or photographic processes had been invented. The reproductions which accompany these and other articles will give a better idea of these Old Picture Books to those who do not already know them than could be conveyed by any verbal descriptions. Here it may suffice to emphasise one or two points which are often overlooked. In the first place, it may have been noticed that not only do we speak of woodcuts, a common enough word, but also of woodcutters, a term which, until Sir Martin Conway used it in the title of his 'The Woodcutters of the Netherlands,' where it was ridiculed at the time as suggesting the stalwart workmen who cut down trees, was hardly ever employed in this sense. It cannot be denied that the use of the word sometimes lands us in incongruities of phrase; but inasmuch as there is no evidence of the graver having been used in woodcuts before the eighteenth century, it is clearly wrong to speak of the early craftsmen as engravers, and it is only fair in estimating their performance to remember that they worked with no better tool than a knife. As regards the material they used, it was no doubt as a rule wood; but experts are agreed—I know not on what evidence—that instead of the blocks cut across the grain adopted by the modern engraver, they used wood sawn perpendicularly down the grain, as in an ordinary plank. It is certain, however, that in addition to wood some soft kind of metal, spoken of in one place (the list of border-cuts in one of Du Pré's 'Horae') as cuivre, or copper, but generally identified with pewter, was also used. This use of metal encouraged in some of the French 'Books of Hours,' notably in those of Philippe Pigouchet, a finer and closer method of work than we can believe was at that time possible on wood; but the general handling was precisely the same, and it is often only when we see a thin line bending instead of breaking, as wood did, that we know for certain that the craftsman was working on metal. For this reason the term woodcut is often applied to metal cuts worked in the style of wood as well as to woodcuts properly so called, and though doubtless reprehensible, the confusion is not nearly so misleading as that between cuts and engravings.",,217,N/A,0,en

The Oxford Handbook of the Septuagint,"Alison G. Salvesen, Timothy Michael Law",Oxford University Press,2021-01-26,"The Septuagint is the term commonly used to refer to the corpus of early Greek versions of Hebrew Scriptures. The collection is of immense importance in the history of both Judaism and Christianity. The renderings of individual books attest to the religious interests of the substantial Jewish population of Egypt during the Hellenistic and Roman periods, and to the development of the Greek language in its Koine phase. The narrative ascribing the Septuagint's origins to the work of seventy translators in Alexandria attained legendary status among both Jews and Christians. The Septuagint was the version of Scripture most familiar to the writers of the New Testament, and became the authoritative Old Testament of the Greek and Latin Churches. In the early centuries of Christianity it was itself translated into several other languages, and it has had a continuing influence on the style and content of biblical translations. The Oxford Handbook of the Septuagint features contributions from leading experts in the field considering the history and manuscript transmission of the version, and the study of translation technique and textual criticism. The collection provides surveys of previous and current research on individual books of the Septuagint corpus, on alternative Jewish Greek versions, the Christian 'daughter' translations, and reception in early Jewish and Christian writers. The Handbook also includes several conversations with related fields of interest such as New Testament studies, liturgy, and art history.",Bibles,799,N/A,0,en

The Biblical Canon Lists from Early Christianity,"Edmon L. Gallagher, John D. Meade",Oxford University Press,2017-10-26,"The Bible took shape over the course of centuries, and today Christian groups continue to disagree over details of its contents. The differences among these groups typically involve the Old Testament, as they mostly accept the same 27-book New Testament. An essential avenue for understanding the development of the Bible are the many early lists of canonical books drawn up by Christians and, occasionally, Jews. Despite the importance of these early lists of books, they have remained relatively inaccessible. This comprehensive volume redresses this unfortunate situation by presenting the early Christian canon lists all together in a single volume. The canon lists, in most cases, unambiguously report what the compilers of the lists considered to belong to the biblical canon. For this reason they bear an undeniable importance in the history of the Bible. The Biblical Canon Lists from Early Christianity provides an accessible presentation of these early canon lists. With a focus on the first four centuries, the volume supplies the full text of the canon lists in English translation alongside the original text, usually Greek or Latin, occasionally Hebrew or Syriac. Edmon L. Gallagher and John D. Meade orient readers to each list with brief introductions and helpful notes, and they point readers to the most significant scholarly discussions. The book begins with a substantial overview of the history of the biblical canon, and an entire chapter is devoted to the evidence of biblical manuscripts from the first millennium. This authoritative work is an indispensable guide for students and scholars of biblical studies and church history.",Religion,360,N/A,0,en

Hebrew Scripture in Patristic Biblical Theory,Edmon Louis Gallagher,BRILL,2012-03-23,"The status of the Christian Old Testament as originally Hebrew scripture had certain theoretical implications for many early Christians. While they based their exegesis on Greek translations and considered the LXX inspired in its own right, the Fathers did acknowledge the Hebrew origins of their Old Testament and in some ways defined their Bible accordingly. Hebrew scripture exerted its influence on patristic biblical theory especially in regard to issues of the canon, language, and text of the Bible. For many Fathers, only documents thought to be originally composed in Hebrew could be considered canonical, the Hebrew language was considered the primordial language subsequently confined to Israel, and the LXX, as the most faithful translation, corresponded precisely to the Hebrew text.",Religion,276,N/A,0,en

In his treatise Jerome discusses different textual and exegetical options according to various Greek and Latin copies of the Psalms with input from the Hebrew. Epistle 106 provides insightful commentary on the Gallican Psalter, Jerome’s translation of Origen’s hexaplaric edition. Jerome’s work offers a unique window into the complex textual state of the Psalter in the late fourth century and serves as an outstanding example of ancient philological scholarship on the Bible. Graves’s translation and commentary is an essential resource for scholars and students of patristic exegesis, biblical textual criticism, and late antique Christianity.",Religion,384,N/A,0,en
The Psychology of the Bible,Brian J. McVeigh,Andrews UK Limited,2020-09-17,"Fire and brimstone, bellowing prophets, and a good dose of old-fashioned sermonizing — these are the images the Bible brings to mind. But this assortment of sacred writings, in particular the Old Testament, is more than a collection of colorful allegories or miracles-and-morals mythology. Though written in the first millennium BCE, these holy writings are a nostalgic recounting of a lost 'super-religious' mentality that characterized the Bronze Age. The Psychology of the Bible explores how the Old Testament provides perspective into the tumultuous transition from an earlier mentality to a new paradigm of interiorized psychology and introspective religiosity that came to characterize the first millennium BCE. By examining the Old Testament's historical background and theopolitical context, utilizing linguistic analysis, and applying systems and communication theory, this book interprets biblical passages through a new lens. It analyzes divine voices, visions, and appearances of heavenly messengers — angel and prophets — as neurocultural phenomena and explains why they were so common. This book also answers why definitions of God changed so radically, illuminates the divinatory role of idols and other oracular aids (e.g. the Ark of the Covenant), provides a framework for appreciating why ‘wisdom literature' became so significant, and clarifies the linkages among music, poetry, and inspiration.",Religion,234,N/A,0,en

This translation allows readers to experience the original Hebrew and the rich resonance of alliteration, pun, word play, and idiom that are so essential to the meaning of the Bible itself. These elements of the text are more than merely stylistic; they allow the reader to understand the echoes and meaning of the text in a way never before available.

Beyond the content, the flow and verbal rhythm of the original Hebrew is conveyed, not through English style but through a reflection of its basic structure. Countless readers pour over concordances to try to find the exact meaning of the original Bible. Interlinear translations try to convey the exact meaning of the text, but their unintelligible syntax make them impossible to read. TEB combines the power of a readable translation, with the precision of a concordance or interlinear translation. Most modern translations routinely use a wide range of traditional theological terms. Words such as: atonement, covenant, soul, angel, hell, redemption and salvation, are familiar to traditional ears but misleading and ineffective in conveying the original Hebrew or Greek concepts. This new translation reveals the original or ""plain"" meaning of the original languages allowing readers to reexamine inherited interpretations of key stories and concepts in the Bible. For example, the notion that women were given ""pain"" in childbirth as a punishment for Eve's transgression disappears in the original Hebrew text. The Hebrew word used is precisely the same as the ""hardship"" that men are allotted in working the soil of the earth, as explained below .",,188,N/A,0,en

A Dictionary of Classical Greek Quotations,Marinos Yeroulanos,Bloomsbury Publishing,2016-06-30,"'Only god is truly wise: human wisdom is of little or no value', declaimed Plato in his Apology. And yet the ancient Greeks, including Plato himself, more than any other people of antiquity were fascinated by the pursuit of the wisdom they called philosophia. That search for knowledge involved an extensive use of maxims and quotations, as we can see from those expressions of Homer prefaced by the phrase 'as people say'. Classical Greek lore and sagacity have throughout history continued to provide inspiration to figures as diverse as the Church Fathers, Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Marx and John F Kennedy. Indeed, Homer, the Seven Sages and the Pre-Socratic philosophers are still extensively quoted in all the major western languages, while the admired sayings of Heraclitus, for instance, are known only through his quotations, his actual writings having long been lost. Yet for all their popularity and ubiquity, until now there has been no single resource for these quotations to which interested readers might turn. This unique and handsome reference book offers one of the most comprehensive selections of Greek quotations ever committed to print. Organised alphabetically, with the original Greek followed by an accompanying English translation, it collects some 7500 entries, ranging from the archaic period to late antiquity, and across philosophy, drama, poetry, history, science and medicine. Containing a full list of translators and of abbreviations, its index of key words enables the fast and efficient sourcing of each entry. This is a handbook designed for years of pleasurable and profitable browsing. Many readers may find that the views expressed twenty centuries ago, and now helpfully contained between one set of covers, are as pertinent and provocative today as they were then.",Philosophy,2061,N/A,0,en

The volume also reprints the large body of preliminary matter, which includes genealogies, maps, and lists of readings, as well as the translator's preface to the reader. The text features an easy-to-read modern font instead of the black-letter type of the original, with the exception of the original decorative letters and early page ornaments, which have been reproduced. The volume concludes with an essay by Renaissance Studies expert, Gordon Campbell, on the first edition of the King James Bible.

Did Jesus Exist?,Bart D. Ehrman,Harper Collins,2012-03-20,"In Did Jesus Exist? historian and Bible expert Bart Ehrman confronts the question, ""Did Jesus exist at all?"" Ehrman vigorously defends the historical Jesus, identifies the most historically reliable sources for best understanding Jesus’ mission and message, and offers a compelling portrait of the person at the heart of the Christian tradition. Known as a master explainer with deep knowledge of the field, Bart Ehrman methodically demolishes both the scholarly and popular “mythicist” arguments against the existence of Jesus. Marshaling evidence from within the Bible and the wider historical record of the ancient world, Ehrman tackles the key issues that surround the mythologies associated with Jesus and the early Christian movement. In Did Jesus Exist?: The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth, Ehrman establishes the criterion for any genuine historical investigation and provides a robust defense of the methods required to discover the Jesus of history.",Religion,449,3.5,3,en

The Historical Jesus of the Gospels,Craig S. Keener,Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing,2012-04-13,"The earliest substantive sources available for historical Jesus research are in the Gospels themselves; when interpreted in their early Jewish setting, their picture of Jesus is more coherent and plausible than are the competing theories offered by many modern scholars. So argues Craig Keener in The Historical Jesus of the Gospels. In exploring the depth and riches of the material found in the Synoptic Gospels, Keener shows how many works on the historical Jesus emphasize just one aspect of the Jesus tradition against others, but a much wider range of material in the Jesus tradition makes sense in an ancient Jewish setting. Keener masterfully uses a broad range of evidence from the early Jesus traditions and early Judaism to reconstruct a fuller portrait of the Jesus who lived in history.",Religion,870,3,2,en

HISTORY OF ENGLISH VERSIONS OF THE BIBLE,Edward D. Andrews,Christian Publishing House,2019-10-22,"The fascinating story of how we got the English Bible in its present form starts 1,120 years ago. HISTORY OF ENGLISH VERSIONS OF THE BIBLE covers the fascinating journey of the Bible from the 9th century AD to the beginning of the 20th-century. The chief translator of the Updated American Standard Version Edward D. Andrews invites readers to explore the process of from the early manuscripts to contemporary translations today. And so, it was that translators like William Tyndale were martyred for the honor of giving the people a Bible that could easily be understood. What a price they had paid, however; it was a priceless gift! Tyndale and others before and after him had worked with the shadow of death towering over their heads. However, by delivering the Bible to many people in their native tongue, they opened up before them the possibility, not of death, but life eternal. As Jesus Christ said in the Tyndale Bible, “This is lyfe eternall that they myght knowe the that only very God and whom thou hast sent Iesus Christ.” (John 17:3) May we, therefore, know the value of what we can now hold in our hands, and may we diligently study God’s Word.",Bibles,166,N/A,0,en

The Most Significant Teachings in the Bible,Christopher D. Hudson,Zondervan,2019-06-25,"An engaging visual survey of Scripture's main lessons, this Bible companion makes Scripture accessible and memorable for students, laypeople, and anyone curious to know more about God's Word—and have it stick. Saint Augustine once referred to the Bible—this ancient collection of sacred documents—as our ""letters from home."" If Scripture feels daunting to you in some way. If its pages seem inhospitable. If the Bible isn't the kind of book you're likely to have on your coffee table, accessible to all who enter your home—than this resource may be your key to unlocking the true approachability of the Bible. Much human understanding occurs visually. When it comes to quickly grasping and retaining information, the human brain functions best with a combination of words and pictures. The Most Significant Teachings in the Bible is designed to visually communicate the wisdom of the Bible in an informative and understandable way. Organized into nine major themes that link biblical frameworks to everyday life--such as ""Getting to Know God"" and ""Struggles and Suffering""—this appealing Bible companion brings to vivid clarity the overarching message of Scripture. Inside you'll find: At-a-glance snapshots or infographics of biblical themes and Bible verses. Life application call-out boxes for easy reference. Easy-to-read written summaries of biblical topics and chapters. Useful lists, charts, and other visual aids. God's Word deserves our attention. After all, it's the greatest power on earth. But that doesn't mean it has to be a chore to read and understand. Because, as intimidating as it is, the Bible is our great ""letter from home,"" God's words to us, everything he needs us to know about himself. The Most Significant Teachings in the Bible is your gateway to a greater understanding and appreciation for those words.",Religion,184,N/A,0,en

Gospel cuts through the superficiality of religion and reacquaints you with the revolutionary truth of God's gracious acceptance of us in Christ. The gospel is the power of God, and the only true source of joy, freedom, radical generosity, and audacious faith. The gospel produces in us what religion never could: a heart that desires God. The book’s core is a “gospel prayer” by which you can saturate yourself in the gospel daily.

The Bible and Poetry,Michael Edwards,New York Review of Books,2023-08-15,"A fresh, provocative look at the link between poetry and Christianity, both as it relates to the Bible itself as well as to Christian and religious life, by an accomplished scholar. The Bible is full of poems. In the Old Testament, there are the Psalms and the Song of Songs, the great exhortations and lamentations of the Prophets, and passages of poetry woven in throughout. In the New Testament, Jesus describes the kingdom of heaven with poetic epithets such as “a treasure hid in a field,” calling the Son of God “the true vine,” “the light of the world,” “the good shepherd,” and “the way, the truth, and the life.” The Gospels reverberate with allusions to the poetry of the Old Testament; the last book of all is Revelation, a visionary poem. The Bible, in other words, asks to be read poetically from start to end, and yet readers have rarely considered what that might mean, much less heeded that call. In The Bible and Poetry, the poet and scholar Michael Edwards reshapes our understanding of the Bible and religious belief, arguing that poetry is not an ornamental or accidental feature but is central to both. He speaks personally of his early, unanticipated, transformative encounters with scripture. He offers close, insightful, and resonant readings of biblical passages. Poetry, as he sees it, is the vital and necessary medium of the Creator’s word, and the truth of the Bible is not a question of precepts and propositions but of a direct experience of its poetry, its power.",Poetry,177,N/A,0,en

With relevant quotation of the scriptures, Oswald Chambers demonstrates how the Bible's teachings and recounting of events such as the life of Christ demonstrate and reflect upon human psychology. The author eloquently establishes the connection between the spiritual essence of the human soul, with our physical form, and finally the mind. The relationship of these three constituents of the human being, and its expression upon the pages of scripture, form the central pillar of this instructional text. As a teacher and evangelist, the writer's capacity to educate and explain is in the fullest evidence upon these pages. Since its original publication in 1912, Oswald Chambers' work has been praised for its lucidity and clarity.

La Bibbia a Montecassino,"Roberta Casavecchia, Marilena Maniaci, Giulia Orofino",Brepols Publishers,2021,"The first publication offering a scientific description of the Cassinese biblical collection, which holds Bibles of all typologies. Given the large number of witnesses still held in loco and their high variety, Montecassino represents a particularly advantageous, if not unique, situation for the analysis of the material and the study of textual changes undergone by the Bible as a book during the Middle Ages.00For manuscript historians, the Bible in the form of a codex represents a handcrafted object of the utmost importance: it was the sacred text par excellence and served as a vital reference point in the lives of medieval monks. In addition, it functioned as an indispensable tool for daily liturgical celebration, and as a study text and individual reading book for the purpose of moral edification. The manuscript collection of the Montecassino Abbey presents an exemplary case study, both for the total number of biblical manuscripts it preserves (just under a hundred, and for the diversity of types (complete ?monolithic? Bibles, Old and/or New Testament sequences of varying size and physiognomy, and individual glossed books with commentary beside the text), as well as for the presence of a significant group of codices in Beneventan minuscule produced for internal use within the same Abbey or in its dependencies in a period centered around the eleventh century (with sporadic extensions into the twelfth and thirteenth).

The Normal Christian Life,Watchman Nee,Bibliotech Press,2023-01-09,"The Normal Christian Life is a book by Watchman Nee first delivered as a series of addresses to Christian workers who were gathered in Denmark for special meetings in 1938 and 1939. The messages were first published chapter by chapter in the magazine A Witness and A Testimony published by Theodore Austin-Sparks. The first chapter was published in the November-December 1940 issue. This first publication of the book can be viewed in the original magazines on Austin-Sparks.Net. The messages were later compiled into a book by Angus Kinnear in 1957 in Bombay, India. In The Normal Christian Life, Watchman Nee presents foundational principles for the Christian life and walk drawing primarily from the book of Romans. The book is generally regarded by many as the first introduction of Watchman Nee to the Western world. As of 2009, this book has sold over 1 million copies and is available in many editions and languages. Watchman Nee based his speaking on the first eight chapters of the New Testament book of Romans. Nee takes the first eight chapters of Romans as a ""self-contained unit"" and divides these chapters into two parts: Romans 1:1 to 5:11 as part one and Romans 5:12 to 8:39 as part two. In the first part of Romans ""sins"" is given prominent attention and deals with the question of the sins man has committed before God. However, the second section deals with ""sin,"" that is the inward nature, or inward working principle, within man that causes man to commit sin. Thus there is a difference between the acts of a sinner, sins, and the inward nature of a sinner, sin. Nee reveals that God's dual remedy is the Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and the Cross of Christ. The Blood ""deals with what we have done, whereas the Cross deals with what we are. The Blood disposes of our sins, while the Cross strikes at the root of our capacity for sin"". As Nee progressively moves along in his book, he first touches upon the Blood and then focuses upon the Cross for the remainder of the book. Watchman Nee gave four steps in which a Christian lives the Christian life. Basing from Romans 6:6, there is the need for the knowledge of the cross of Christ as a fact in our experience. The second step is the matter of reckoning. Reckoning is the stating and considering of facts and promises that God has revealed to be true. The third step is the matter of presenting to God. Coming to Romans 6:13, Watchman Nee says that Christians consecrate that which passed through death and resurrection in the new creation. In this way, Christians would no longer live to themselves but to Christ because He has the full authority over their lives. The fourth step is the matter of Walking after the Spirit. Firstly, walking after the Spirit does not refer to our ""working"" but of dependence on God's working and operation. Secondly, it refers to subjection. This means that the Christian life is the yielding of all the dictates of our flesh and be of subjection to the Spirit. The Normal Christian Life is one of Nee's most well known books. It is considered by many to be a spiritual classic of Christianity. It has been reprinted and reissued in many editions and in many languages. The book's enduring appeal is not only due to Nee's exposition of Romans but also to the many illustrations, personal accounts, and anecdotes that Nee used. The Normal Christian Life has impacted millions of Christians since Nee spoke it and is a major contributor to the local churches movement today. Nee was recognized in the United States House of Representatives by Christopher H. Smith of New Jersey in 2009. He recognized Nee as having been one of the most influential Chinese Christians of his era. In the Congressional record, The Normal Christian Life is highlighted by Smith as being among his most popular and influential books. (wikipedia.org)",Religion,0,N/A,0,en

While conservative scholars and pastors have struggled for years to show that the Bible is without errors, Boyd considers this a fool's errand. Instead, he says, we should embrace the mistakes and contradictions in Scripture, for they show that God chose to use fallible humans to communicate timeless truths. Just as God ultimately came to save humanity in the form of a human, God chose to impart truth through the imperfect medium of human writing.

A Bible for Today,Robert P. Vande Kappelle,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2022-09-02,"If you ever wished to read through the Bible but hit a snag along the way, this book is for you, for it presents an ideal opportunity to become intimately acquainted with the biblical message and storyline while providing momentum for even the most skeptical and hesitant reader. If you can commit fifteen to twenty minutes a day and are willing to stick to the schedule presented in this book, in less than a year, you can read through the Bible and know you have acquired a basic grasp of its individual and overall message. Aggressive readers can complete the task in half the time if they wish to double the time commitment or split their reading into two fifteen-minute blocks a day. Those who follow this method will find that the readings reduce the Old Testament by 44 percent and the New Testament by 32 percent, for a total reduction of 41 percent of the biblical text. To counter immature, skewed, or harmful attitudes regarding scripture, A Bible for Today offers an approach to biblical reading and study that is valid, inspiring, and practical. It does so by eliminating not only repetitive passages, but also blocks of material that modern readers wishing to build on a Christian foundation find ponderous, lengthy, and no longer applicable. In contrast to most abridgments and condensations of scripture, this volume provides a logical sequence of readings that students of scripture can follow in whatever version they select, acquainting themselves with essential biblical passages and teachings in less than a year's time. In addition, this book provides introductory overviews to each book of the Bible, succinct enough to be readable, yet literarily, historically, and theologically reliable and informative.",Religion,143,N/A,0,en
Digging Through the Bible,Richard A Freund,Rowman & Littlefield,2023-06-14,"A “masterful and eminently readable” journey through the fascinating insights and revelations of Biblical archeology (Publishers Weekly, starred review). Many of our religious beliefs are based on faith alone, but archaeology gives us the opportunity to find evidence about what really happened in the distant past—evidence that can have a dramatic impact on what and how we believe. In Digging Through the Bible, archaeologist and rabbi Richard Freund takes readers through digs he has led in the Holy Land, searching for evidence about key biblical characters and events. Digging Through the Bible presents overviews of the evidence surrounding figures such as Moses, Kings David and Solomon, and Mary the mother of Jesus, as well as new information that can help us more fully understand the life and times in which these people would have lived. Freund also presents new evidence about finding the grave of the Teacher of Righteousness mentioned in the Dead Sea Scrolls, and gives a compelling argument about how the Exodus of the Israelites may have taken place in three separate waves over time, rather than in a single event as presented in the Bible.",Social Science,395,N/A,0,en

I Will Go With You,ZA! Rhena Richards,"Fulton Books, Inc.",2022-07-19,"The author ZA! Rhena Richards remembered, quiet, and solemn times in her life, where her thoughts and focus became clear, as the global pandemic COVID-19 of 2020 ransacked and took hostage all rigorous lives, all lifestyles, and the comforts of ""normalcy,"" but this time, something was very different. She realized she had a purpose and needed to respond. The quiet of her became peaceful, and she took comfort in seeking this in remembrance.--a sullen, tender-aged child sat alone on the veranda of her grandmother's house. As she pined for her mother daily, she gazed into the light blue sky. All of the occupants were inside. She heard a clear audible voice, ""Where are you from? What is your name?"" She does not answer, but she heard the questions. Returning to the veranda, the following morning, she hears the same clear voice again, ask, ""Where are you from? What is your name?"" She hears the questions, and again she does not answer, but this time she begins to immediately reflect on the questions, even throughout the night where the windows were open and the house fan span, circulating heat across her skin as the mosquitoes feasted on it. Stooping to sit on the veranda on the new, born, morning, the same voice repeated the questions. Finally responding. She said, ""I don't know"" (in her head). The soft wind-like voice said, ""Go and ask her with the skirt on."" ""I'm scared,"" she said, ""they don't like me."" The clear voice said, ""I will go with you. Pull, tug on her skirt."" The sullen tender-aged child went inside and looked for her with the skirt and pulled it and asked, ""Where am I from? What's my name?"" A warm, smiling caramel-colored face embedded with alabaster eyes, shone down, and told her. The little girl walked back outside, poised herself on the steps, and said, ""America, Rhena. I want to go to America. My Mommy is there. How do I get there?"" In her head the little girl asked and finally smiled.

Signs of Change,Anthony Bartlett,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2022-03-11,"The Bible has many stories, but really there are only two. There is a story of violent humanity, and there is the story of a self-giving, nonviolent God. The question has been how to distinguish the two without creating a toxic dualism. Bartlett shows that the narratives in tension are not two opposed Testaments, even less two metaphysical principles, but the slow separating out of nonviolent revelation from the frame of violent meaning by which human beings have always signified themselves and their gods. In his prior, ground-laying book, Theology Beyond Metaphysics, Bartlett demonstrated the concept of semiotic change and how it emerges as the most appropriate way of understanding and affirming a relational shift in human and theological meaning. In this present work, he supplies a rich seam of biblical evidence with gripping essays on Old Testament books and their evolution of transformative signs and new meaning. Accounts of the life of Jesus and the teaching of Paul make the change exponential, bringing to definitive expression the inbreaking of the nonviolent divine. Signs of Change creates a theological masterstroke, showing step-by-step how semiotic evolution leads human existence to the truly saving knowledge of a nonviolent God.",Religion,233,N/A,0,en

Men who were led by the hand or groped their way along the wall to reach Jesus were touched by his finger and went home without a guide, rejoicing that Jesus Christ had opened their eyes.

Why shouldn’t those who read this be blessed with the light of heaven? This is my heart's inmost desire. I can’t put fine words together. I’ve never studied speech.

All three areas have developed much in modern research, and the auhor, the past editor-in-chief of the international Dead Sea Scrolls publication project, is a major speaker in all of them. The scrolls are of central importance in the modern textual research and this aspect is well represented in this volume. Among the studies included in this volume are central studies on coincidence, consistency, the Torah, the nature of the MT and SP, the diffusion of manuscripts, and the LXX of Genesis. The previous two volumes are: The Greek and Hebrew Bible: Collected Essays on the Septuagint (VTS 72; Leiden: Brill, 1999).

O'Mara",Boydell & Brewer,1999,"Handlist to manuscripts in one of Britain's major medieval repositories. Lambeth Palace Library, which dates from a bequest by Archbishop Bancroft in 1610, is one of England's major repositories of medieval manuscripts. More than half of the ninety-six manuscripts and documents containing items of Middle English prose were already present when the library was temporarily transferred to Cambridge in 1647. In the succeeding centuries further manuscript materials have continually been added, and within the last few years the library has become home to the older part of Sion College Library, an event that has added a further seven manuscripts to the present handlist. The collection at Lambeth is large enough to be fully representative of the corpus of Middle English prose: the Brut, the Wycliffite Bible, and Love's Mirror, for example, are all present, in some cases in multiple copies, as are writings by Hilton and Rolle. There are sermon cycles (including an almost complete set of Wycliffite sermons), medical recipes, historical works, and anthologies of religious treatises.

Misusing Scripture,"Mark Elliott, Kenneth Atkinson, Robert Rezetko",Taylor & Francis,2023-03-31,"Misusing Scripture offers a thorough and critical evaluation of American evangelical scholarship on the Bible. This strand of scholarship exerts enormous influence on the religious beliefs and practices, and even cultural and political perspectives, of millions of evangelical Christians in the United States and worldwide. The book brings together a diverse array of authors with expertise on the Bible, religion, history, and archaeology to critique the nature and growth of ""faith-based"" biblical scholarship. The chapters focus on inerrancy and textual criticism, archaeology and history, and the Bible in its ancient and contemporary contexts. They explore how evangelicals approach the Bible in their biblical interpretation, how ""biblical"" archaeology is misused to bolster distinctive views about the Bible, and how disputed interpretations of the Bible impact issues in the public square. This unique and timely volume contributes to a greater understanding and appreciation of how contemporary American evangelicals understand and use the Bible in their private and public lives.

In this book, she seeks to articulate and use biblical interpretation as intervention into the failure of the democratic cultural-political imagination. Although such an intervention is often taboo for supposedly neutral academic scholarship, Schüssler Fiorenza argues that it is politically necessary because political argument today so often utilizes biblical rhetoric in the public square. e biblical-political analysis and suggestions of this book are developed in four chapters, each focusing on the role of the Bible in struggles over women's leadership in the present, touching on the cultural ""double bind"" of women in politics, sexual abuse, power, and the #MeToo movement. Schüssler Fiorenza's insights and arguments not only lead to the development of reimagined cultural biblical imprints of women in the political arena, but they also encourage her readers to add their own biblical examples to inspire them in their struggle for a biblical vision of ""women in the public square."" is is an insightful, challenging book written for our time by someone who has always seemed to be ahead of hers.",Religion,75,N/A,0,en

Sartre’s restless intelligence may have found its most characteristic outlet in the open-ended form of the essay. For Sartre the essay was an essentially dramatic form, the record of an encounter, the framing of a choice. Whether writing about literature, art, politics, or his own life, he seizes our attention and drives us to grapple with the living issues that are at stake. We Have Only This Life to Live is the first gathering of Sartre’s essays in English to draw on all ten volumes of Situations, the title under which Sartre collected his essays during his life, while also featuring previously uncollected work, including the reports Sartre filed during his 1945 trip to America.

Revisiting the cruel hazing rituals that had accompanied his incarceration, relishing the special argot spoken behind bars, Genet bitterly denounced any improvement in the condition of young prisoners as a threat to their criminal souls.

The Bible and Morality,Catholic Church. Pontificia Commissio Biblica,N/A,2008-01-01,"For Christians, Holy Scripture is not only a source of revelation on which to ground one's faith, it is also an indispensable reference point for morality. They are convinced that in the Bible they can find indications and norms of right behaviour to attain fullness of life. This use of Scripture is not of course without its problems caused by the different times and circumstances in which people find themselves today compared with biblical times. In 2002, the Pontifical Biblical Commission, at the behest of the then-President Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, set about to examine the problem of the relationship between the Bible and morality by posing itself the question: what is the value and the significance of the inspired text for today's morality? This document seeks then to explain the context for norms of morality encountered in Scripture, and shows also that, while there remain moral questions which cannot be fully answered from Scripture, nevertheless Scripture does offer criteria which are helpful in finding solutions.",Bibles,234,N/A,0,en

Ten Words to Live By,Jen Wilkin,Crossway,2021-03-09,"New from the Best-Selling Author of Women of the Word Christianity isn't about following rules, it's about a relationship. The rise in popularity of this phrase coincides with a growing disinterest and misunderstanding regarding the role of God's life-giving, perfect law in the Christian life. Rather than the source of joy it was intended to be, the law is viewed as an angry god's restrictions for a rebellious people. In Ten Words to Live By, Jen Wilkin presents a fresh biblical look at the Ten Commandments, showing how they come to bear on our lives today as we seek to love God and others, to live in joyful freedom, and to long for that future day when God will be rightly worshiped for eternity.

Transferred Illusions,"Marilyn Deegan, Kathryn Sutherland",Routledge,2016-02-24,"This is a study of the forms and institutions of print - newspapers, books, scholarly editions, publishing, libraries - as they relate to and are changed by emergent digital forms and institutions. In the early 1990s hypertext was briefly hailed as a liberating writing tool for non-linear creation. Fast forward no more than a decade, and we are reading old books from screens. It is, however, the newspaper, for around two hundred years print's most powerful mass vehicle, whose economy persuasively shapes its electronic remediation through huge digitization initiatives, dominated by a handful of centralizing service providers, funded and wrapped round by online advertising. The error is to assume a culture of total replacement. The Internet is just another information space, sharing characteristics that have always defined such spaces - wonderfully effective and unstable, loaded with valuable resources and misinformation; that is, both good and bad. This is why it is important that writers, critics, publishers and librarians - in modern parlance, the knowledge providers - be critically engaged in shaping and regulating cyberspace, and not merely the passive instruments or unreflecting users of the digital tools in our hands.",Language Arts & Disciplines,218,N/A,0,en

The Bible and Empire,R. S. Sugirtharajah,Cambridge University Press,2005-06-16,"At a time of renewed interest in Empire, this stimulating volume explores the complex relationship between the Bible and the colonial enterprise, and examines some overlooked aspects of this relationship. These include unconventional retellings of the gospel story of Jesus by Thomas Jefferson and Raja Rammohun Roy; the fate of biblical texts when marshalled by Victorian preachers to strengthen British imperial intentions after the India uprising of 1857; the cultural-political use of the Christian Old Testament, first by the invaders to attack temple practices and rituals, then by the invaded to endorse the temple heritage scorned by missionaries; the dissident hermeneutics of James Long and William Colenso confronting and compromising with colonial ambitions; and finally the subtly seditious deployment of biblical citations in two colonial novels. This innovative book offers both practical and theoretical insights and provides compelling evidence of the continuing importance of postcolonial discourse for biblical studies.",Religion,266,N/A,0,en
Bible as Notepad,"Liv Ingeborg Lied, Marilena Maniaci",Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG,2018-09-10,"The present volume provides a comparative look at the contents and layout features of secondary annotations in biblical manuscripts across linguistic traditions. Due to the privileged focus on the text in the columns, these annotations and the practices that produced them have not received the scholarly attention they deserve. The vast richness of extant verbal and figurative notes accompanying the biblical texts in the intercolumns and margins of the manuscript pages have thus been largely overlooked. The case studies gathered in this volume explore Jewish and Christian biblical manuscripts through the lens of their annotations, addressing the various relationships between the primary layer of text and the secondary notes, and exploring the roles and functions of annotated manuscripts as cultural artifacts. By approaching biblical manuscripts as potential ""notepads"", the volume offers theoretical reflection and empirical analyses of the ways in which secondary notes may shed new light on the development and transmission of text traditions, the shifting engagement with biblical manuscripts over time, as well as the change of use and interpretation that may result from the addition of the notes themselves.",Religion,168,N/A,0,en

The Oxford Handbook of the Bible in America,Paul Gutjahr,Oxford University Press,2017-11-01,"Early Americans have long been considered ""A People of the Book"" Because the nickname was coined primarily to invoke close associations between Americans and the Bible, it is easy to overlook the central fact that it was a book-not a geographic location, a monarch, or even a shared language-that has served as a cornerstone in countless investigations into the formation and fragmentation of early American culture. Few books can lay claim to such powers of civilization-altering influence. Among those which can are sacred books, and for Americans principal among such books stands the Bible. This Handbook is designed to address a noticeable void in resources focused on analyzing the Bible in America in various historical moments and in relationship to specific institutions and cultural expressions. It takes seriously the fact that the Bible is both a physical object that has exercised considerable totemic power, as well as a text with a powerful intellectual design that has inspired everything from national religious and educational practices to a wide spectrum of artistic endeavors to our nation's politics and foreign policy. This Handbook brings together a number of established scholars, as well as younger scholars on the rise, to provide a scholarly overview--rich with bibliographic resources--to those interested in the Bible's role in American cultural formation.",Religion,737,N/A,0,en

Making the Bible Modern,Penny Schine Gold,Cornell University Press,2004,"The Bible has played a critical role in the story of Judaism, modernity, and identity. Penny Schine Gold examines the arena of children's education and the role of the Bible in the reshaping of Jewish identity, especially in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s, when a second generation of Eastern European Jews engaged the task of Americanizing Jewish culture, religion, and institutions. Professional Jewish educators based in the Reform movement undertook a multifaceted agenda for the Bible in America: to modernize it, harmonize it with American values, and move it to the center of the religious school curriculum. Through public schooling, the children of Jewish immigrants brought America home; it was up to the adults to fashion a Judaism that their children could take back out into America. Because of its historic role in the development of Judaism and its cultural significance in American life, Gold finds, the Bible provided Jews with vital links to both the past and the present. The ancient sacred text of the Bible, transformed into highly abridged and amended ""Bible tales,"" was brought into service as a bridge between tradition and modernity.Gold analyzes these American developments with reference to the intellectual history of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Europe, innovations in public schooling and social theory, Protestant religious education, and later versions of children's Bibles in the United States and Israel. She shows that these seemingly simple children's books are complex markers of the pressing concerns of Jews in the modern world.",History,300,N/A,0,en

A range of beautiful Armenian Bible manuscripts from collections throughout the world are illustrated in full color and compared with western Bible illuminations. Later printed Armenian Bibles are also examined in detail, revealing fascinating examples of religious differences between the Armenian and the Catholic Christian traditions.

The Oxford Companion to the Bible,"Bruce M. Metzger, Michael David Coogan",Oxford University Press,1993-10-14,"The Bible has had an immeasurable influence on Western culture, touching on virtually every aspect of our lives. It is one of the great wellsprings of Western religious, ethical, and philosophical traditions. It has been an endless source of inspiration to artists, from classic works such as Michaelangelo's Last Judgment, Handel's Messiah, or Milton's Paradise Lost, to modern works such as Thomas Mann's Joseph and His Brothers or Martin Scorsese's controversial Last Temptation of Christ. For countless generations, it has been a comfort in suffering, a place to reflect on the mysteries of birth, death, and immortality. Its stories and characters are an integral part of the repertoire of every educated adult, forming an enduring bond that spans thousands of years and embraces a vast community of believers and nonbelievers. The Oxford Companion to the Bible provides an authoritative one-volume reference to the people, places, events, books, institutions, religious belief, and secular influence of the Bible. Written by more than 250 scholars from some 20 nations and embracing a wide variety of perspectives, the Companion offers over seven hundred entries, ranging from brief identifications--who is Dives? where is Pisgah?--to extensive interpretive essays on topics such as the influence of the Bible on music or law. Ranging far beyond the scope of a traditional Bible dictionary, the Companion features, in addition to its many informative, factual entries, an abundance of interpretive essays. Here are extended entries on religious concepts from immortality, sin, and grace, to baptism, ethics, and the Holy Spirit. The contributors also explore biblical views of modern issues such as homosexuality, marriage, and anti-Semitism, and the impact of the Bible on the secular world (including a four-part article on the Bible's influence on literature). Of course, the Companion can also serve as a handy reference, the first place to turn to find factual information on the Bible. Readers will find fascinating, informative articles on all the books of the Bible--including the Apocrypha and many other ancient texts, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, Pseudepigrapha, and the Mishrah. Virtually every figure who walked across the biblical stage is identified here, ranging from Rebekah, Rachel, and Mary, to Joseph, Barabbas, and Jesus. The Companion also offers entries that shed light on daily life in ancient Israel and the earliest Christian communities, with fascinating articles on feasts and festivals, clothing, medicine, units of time, houses, and furniture. Finally, there are twenty-eight pages of full-color maps, providing an accurate, detailed portrait of the biblical world. A vast compendium of information related to scriptures, here is an ideal complement to the Bible, an essential volume for every home and library, the first place to turn for information on the central book of Western culture.",Religion,930,N/A,0,en

Its eternal words are transmitted across the world by fallible human hands. Following Jesus’s departing instruction to go out into the world, the Bible has been a book in motion from its very beginnings, and every community it has encountered has read, heard, and seen the Bible through its own language and culture. In The Bible, Bruce Gordon tells the astounding story of the Bible’s journey around the globe and across more than two thousand years, showing how it has shaped and been shaped by changing beliefs and believers’ radically different needs. The Bible has been a tool for violence and oppression, and it has expressed hopes for liberation. God speaks with one voice, but the people who receive it are scattered and divided—found in desert monasteries and Chinese house churches, in Byzantine cathedrals and Guatemalan villages.

Ireland and the Reception of the Bible,"Bradford A. Anderson, Jonathan Kearney",Bloomsbury Publishing,2018-04-19,"Drawing on the work of leading figures in biblical, religious, historical, and cultural studies in Ireland and beyond, this volume explores the reception of the Bible in Ireland, focusing on the social and cultural dimensions of such use of the Bible. This includes the transmission of the Bible, the Bible and identity formation, engagement beyond Ireland, and cultural and artistic appropriation of the Bible. The chapters collected here are particularly useful and insightful for those researching the use and reception of the Bible, as well as those with broader interests in social and cultural dimensions of Irish history and Irish studies. The chapters challenge the perception in the minds of many that the Bible is a static book with a fixed place in the world that can be relegated to ecclesial contexts and perhaps academic study. Rather, as this book shows, the role of the Bible in the world is much more complex. Nowhere is this clearer than in Ireland, with its rich and complex religious, cultural, and social history. This volume examines these very issues, highlighting the varied ways in which the Bible has impacted Irish life and society, as well as the ways in which the cultural specificity of Ireland has impacted the use and development of the Bible both in Ireland and further afield.",Religion,416,N/A,0,en

Your First Step to Celebrate Recovery,John Baker,Celebrate Recovery,2016-06-28,"You’ve undoubtedly heard the expression “time heals all wounds.” Unfortunately, it isn’t true. As many pastors and counselors know, people still carry hurts from thirty or forty years ago. The truth is, time often makes things worse. Wounds that are left untended fester and spread infection throughout your entire body. Time only extends the pain if the problem isn’t dealt with. Your First Step to Celebrate Recovery introduces you to a biblical and balanced program that has helped nearly a million people overcome their hurts, hang-ups, and habits. Based on the actual words of Jesus found in the Sermon on the Mount rather than psychological theory, the Celebrate Recovery program has helped people for over 20 years to grow toward full Christ-like maturity. Author and founder John Baker tells the true story of how Celebrate Recovery became one of the largest Christ-centered recovery programs in history.

Love Worth Finding (Pack Of 25),Adrian Rogers,N/A,1998-11-23,"Psychologists have long known that every person has two great longings and inward needs. The first is to be loved, and the second is to love. But when pressures and heartaches come into our lives, many give up any hope of ever finding love. The tragedy is that we often look in the wrong places to fill this deep, deep need and longing. Some substitute lust for love. Others pursue material things or superficial relationships-all in the futile attempt to fill a God-shaped vacuum in the human heart. But there is good news! There is a love worth finding and a love worth sharing. The Bible says, ""For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life"" (John 3:16). On the cross of Christ, God's mighty love was revealed and offered unconditionally to all who would be saved. Do you long to know this mighty love? Then I need to ask you the most important question you'll ever be asked: Do you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that God loves you, that your sins are forgiven, and that you are saved and on your way to heaven? The great news is, you can know! Let me share with you how to discover the greatest love worth finding. Admit Your Sin. First, you must admit that you are a sinner. The Bible says, ""There is none righteous, no, not one"" (Romans 3:10). ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God"" (Romans 3:23). It is our sin that separates us from God and from fulfilling our deepest needs and longings. Sin is an offense against God that carries a serious penalty. According to Romans 6:23, ""The wages of sin is death [eternal separation from the love and mercy of God]."" Abandon Your Efforts. Second, you must abandon any efforts to save yourself. If we could save ourselves, Jesus' death would have been unnecessary! Even ""getting religion"" cannot get you to heaven. The Bible says it is ""not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His [God's] mercy He saved us"" (Titus 3:5). Salvation is by God's grace, ""not of works, lest any man should boast"" (Ephesians 2:8-9). Acknowledge Christ's Payment. What you cannot do for yourself, Jesus Christ has done for you! ""But God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us"" (Romans 5:8). He died on the cross for you, and then rose from the dead to prove that His payment was acceptable to God. But you must acknowledge and believe this fact. ""Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved"" (Acts 16:31). Accept Christ as Your Savior. Salvation is God's gift to you. ""The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord"" (Romans 6:23). When someone offers you a priceless gift, the wisest thing you can do is accept it! This very moment, you can receive Christ's gift of salvation by sincerely praying this simple prayer from your heart: Dear God, I know that I am a sinner. I know that You love me and want to save me. Jesus, I believe You are the Son of God, who died on the cross to pay for my sins. I believe God raised You from the dead. I now turn from my sin and, by faith, receive You as my personal Lord and Savior. Come into my heart, forgive my sins, and save me, Lord Jesus. In Your name I pray. Amen. Friend, if you have not yet made a decision for Christ, I urge you to receive Him today. You'll be eternally glad to know the love worth finding!",,4,N/A,0,en

The Gospel According to the Son,Norman Mailer,Random House,2013-09-17,"Norman Mailer fused fact and fiction to create indelible portraits of such figures as Marilyn Monroe, Gary Gilmore, and Lee Harvey Oswald. In The Gospel According to the Son, Mailer reimagines, as no other modern author has, the key character of Western history. Here is Jesus Christ’s story in his own words: the discovery of his divinity and the painful, powerful journey to accepting and expressing it, “as if I were a man enclosing another man within.” In its brevity and piercing simplicity, it may be Mailer’s most accessible, direct, and heartfelt work. Praise for The Gospel According to the Son “Quietly penetrating . . . [Norman Mailer’s] gospel is written in a direct, rather relaxed English that yet has an eerie, neo-Biblical dignity.”—John Updike, The New Yorker “A book of considerable intellectual force . . .

Fix Your Eyes,Amy Gannett,B&H Publishing Group,2021-10-05,"We live in a polarized time. Christians are quick to conceive of themselves either as theologically-minded or worship-minded; either thinking Christians or feeling Christians. The results are damaging: theology without worship is muted, stifled, and cold, and worship without theology is ungrounded, unrooted, and uninformed. This is not the way it was meant to be. Theology (our study and knowledge of God) should always lead to doxology (our worship of Him). Worship should always be rooted in theology. When we study the nature and character of God as revealed in his Word, we are invited to respond in the affectionate, obedient discipleship of worship. How can we keep our theology from being mere head knowledge? How do we give our worship roots that will last? By fixing our eyes on God Himself—the object of our study and the object of our worship. Fix Your Eyes is an invitation to understand core doctrines of the Christian faith and apply them in our daily worship of God. It walks believers through key theological concepts and shows how each can be lived out in daily life.",Religion,171,N/A,0,en
Getting to the Promised Land,Kevin W. Cosby,Westminster John Knox Press,2021-06-22,"Too often, all oppressed people in America are lumped together under the moniker ""people of color,"" as if each group's experience under the yoke of systemic racism has the same economic and social repercussions. But the American Descendants of Slavery (ADOS) hold a unique claim to economic and reparative justice: for ADOS, after all, is the only group whose ancestors were forcibly brought to America, enslaved, built much of the wealth of the country, yet continue to be specifically excluded from the same social, political, and economic rights of other Americans. To that end, Rev. Dr. Kevin W. Cosby lays out the first theology of the ADOS movement, turning the traditional lens of Black liberation theology from Moses leading escaped Hebrew slaves in Exodus to other biblical leaders like Solomon, Daniel, and Nehemiah. A Jew born in exile, Nehemiah landed a somewhat privileged position in the Persian king's court. After learning about his people’s dire situation in Jerusalem, Nehemiah wept and was moved to lead efforts to rebuild the wall around the city with money (reparations) obtained from the imperial government. In the stories of Nehemiah and other biblical leaders, Cosby finds inspiration on how to rebuild Black America including the necessity of government reparations for ADOS. Cosby calls all Americans to move from a place of relative nonengagement and detachment to a place of active support of ADOS’s efforts for justice and healing.",Political Science,130,N/A,0,en

Why Children Matter,"Douglas Wilson, Nancy Wilson",Canon Press &amp; Book Service,2018-07-10,"In the Garden of Eden, there was only one ""No."" Everything else was ""Yes."" In this short book on Christian childrearing, Douglas Wilson points out that we have a Father who delights in us and makes it easy for us to love and obey him. If that is the kind of Father we have, shouldn't we earthly parents do the same? Wilson explains how parents should not just try to get their kids to obey a set of rules or to make their house so fun that following the rules is always easy. Instead, he calls for parents to instill in their kids a love for God and His standards that will serve them well all their days. This book also features an appendix in which Doug and his wife Nancy answer various parents' questions about various applications of the principles discussed in this book.",Family & Relationships,151,N/A,0,en

(Philippians 2:5–7a) These ancient words offer a guide for modern Christians wrestling with their privileged place in an unequal and unjust world. The Kenosis Hymn (as this passage quoted by the apostle Paul is known) celebrates Jesus for his willingness to forego the divine glory that he is due, instead humbling himself to serve the oppressed and outcast of his society. Through a combination of in-depth Bible study and social analysis, Filled to Be Emptied invites readers to explore the hymn verse by verse and see Jesus' self-emptying example as a model for privileged people to see their advantages not “as something to be exploited” but as something to be laid aside to seek the good of others. Brandan J. Robertson walks readers through a step-by-step process of identifying their privilege, exploring their privilege, and ultimately leveraging their privilege as a tool for the liberation and redemption of the world. Filled to Be Emptied is an essential book for all followers of Christ who are seeking to live lives of justice.",Religion,158,N/A,0,en

Can We Trust the Bible on the Historical Jesus?,"Bart D. Ehrman, Craig A. Evans, Robert B. Stewart",Westminster John Knox Press,2020-09-22,"This book features a learned and fascinating debate between two great Bible scholars about the New Testament as a reliable source on the historical Jesus. Bart Ehrman, an agnostic New Testament scholar, debates Craig Evans, an evangelical New Testament scholar, about the historical Jesus and what constitutes ""history."" Their interaction includes such compelling questions as: What are sound methods of historical investigation? What are reliable criteria for determining the authenticity of an ancient text? What roles do reason and inference play? And, of course, interpretation? Readers of this debate—regardless of their interpretive inclinations and biases—are sure to find some confirmation of their existing beliefs, but they will surely also find an honest and well-informed challenge to the way they think about the historical Jesus. The result? A more open, better informed, and questioning mind, which is better prepared for discovering both truth and contrivance. The debate between Ehrman and Evans along with Stewart's introductory framework make this book an excellent primer to the study of the historical Jesus, and readers will come away with a deeper appreciation for the ongoing quest for the historical Jesus.",Religion,114,N/A,0,en

Jesus,James Martin,Harper Collins,2014-03-11,"“James Martin’s riveting new meditation on Jesus is one of the best books I’ve read in years—on any subject.” — Mary Karr, author of Lit James Martin, SJ, gifted storyteller, editor at large of America magazine, popular media commentator, and New York Times bestselling author of The Jesuit Guide to (Almost) Everything, brings the Gospels to life in Jesus: A Pilgrimage, and invites believers and seekers alike to experience Jesus through Scripture, prayer and travel. Combining the fascinating insights of historical Jesus studies with profound spiritual insights about the Christ of faith, Father Martin recreates the world of first-century Galilee and Judea to usher you into Jesus's life and times and show readers how Jesus speaks to us today. Martin also brings together the most up-to-date Scripture scholarship, wise spiritual reflections, and lighthearted stories about traveling through the Holy Land with a fellow (and funny) Jesuit, visiting important sites in the life of Jesus of Nazareth. The person at the heart of the Gospels can seem impossibly distant. Stories about his astonishing life and ministry—clever parables that upended everyone's expectations, incredible healings that convinced even skeptics, nature miracles that dazzled the dumbstruck disciples—can seem far removed from our own daily lives, hard to understand, and at times irrelevant. But in Jesus you will come to know him as Father Martin knows him: Messiah and Savior, as well as friend and brother. WINNER OF THE 2016 ILLUMINATION AWARD (GOLD).

When Strivings Cease,Ruth Chou Simons,Thomas Nelson,2021-10-12,"Grace Secures What Striving Cannot In this hustling, image-forward age of opportunity, we feel more anxious than ever. Despite all the affirming memes and self-reflections that dominate social media feeds, approval and worth often seem assigned to what we do rather than who we are. And we end up constantly feeling like we’re behind, lacking, and failing—at home, at work, with friends, with God. Ruth Chou Simons knows something about feeling measured by achievement, performance, and the approval of others. As a Taiwanese immigrant growing up between two cultures, Ruth was always on a mission to prove her worth, until she came to truly understand the one thing that changes everything: the extravagant, undeserved gift of grace from a merciful God. In When Strivings Cease, Ruth guides you on a journey to find freedom from the never-ending quest for self-improvement. She shows you how to confront the ways you look to superficial means of acceptance and belonging; find relief in realizing self-help isn’t the answer because you can’t be so amazing that you won’t need grace; stop seeing God as someone to perform for and start finding delight in responding to his welcome; and let go of trying to rely on your own strength, your own abilities, and your own savvy by truly understanding the freedom Jesus purchased for you. With personal stories, biblical insights, practical applications, and touches of original artwork by Ruth, this transformational book helps you see the beautiful truth that God’s favor is the only currency you need—because in Christ you are enough.",Family & Relationships,257,N/A,0,en

Bad Girls of the Bible,Liz Curtis Higgs,WaterBrook,2013-07-16,"Ten of the Bible’s best-known femmes fatales parade across the pages of this popular and unforgettable study with situations that sound oh-so-familiar. Women everywhere marvel at those “good girls” in Scripture–Sarah, Mary, Esther–but on most days, that’s not who they see when they look in the mirror. Most women (if they’re honest) see the selfishness of Sapphira or the deception of Delilah. They catch of glimpse of Jezebel’s take-charge pride or Eve’s disastrous disobedience. Like Bathsheba, Herodias, and the rest, today’s modern woman is surrounded by temptations, exhausted by the demands of daily living, and burdened by her own desires. So what’s a good girl to do? Learn from their lives, says beloved Bible study teacher and speaker Liz Curtis Higgs, and choose a better path. Whether they were “Bad to the Bone,” “Bad for a Season, but Not Forever” or only “Bad for a Moment,” these infamous sisters show women how not to handle the challenges of life. With her trademark humor and encouragement, Higgs combines a contemporary retelling of the stories of these “other women” in Scripture with a solid, verse-by-verse study to teach us how to avoid their tragic mistakes and joyfully embrace grace.

Coomber,Routledge,2016-04-01,"The Bible contains a variety of passages that defend the poor and champion the cause of the oppressed, but are these ancient texts able to find a voice in confronting injustice in the modern world? 'Bible and Justice' examines the ways in which the Bible can speak to contemporary poverty, environmental issues, and state-sponsored violence, whilst exploring the difficulties that arise when ancient concepts of justice are applied to modern ideals. The book covers a range of topics from human rights to deaf biblical interpretation and from hospitality to corporate globalization. Broad and accessible, 'Bible and Justice' will be an invaluable resource for students of religious and biblical studies.",Religion,258,N/A,0,en

The Hebrew Bible Reborn,"Yaacov Shavit, Mordechai Eran",Walter de Gruyter,2008-09-25,"This work, the first of its kind, describes all the aspects of the Bible revolution in Jewish history in the last two hundred years, as well as the emergence of the new biblical culture. It describes the circumstances and processes that turned Holy Scripture into the Book of Books and into the history of the biblical period and of the people – the Jewish people. It deals with the encounter of the Jews with modern biblical criticism and the archaeological research of the Ancient Near East and with contemporary archaeology. The middle section discusses the extensive involvement of educated Jews in the Bible-Babel polemic at the start of the twentieth century, which it treats as a typological event. The last section describes at length various aspects of the key status assigned to the Bible in the new Jewish culture in Europe, and particularly in modern Jewish Palestine, as a “guide to life” in education, culture and politics, as well as part of the attempt to create a new Jewish man, and as a source of inspiration for various creative arts.",Religion,577,N/A,0,en

The Bible and Comics,Zanne Domoney-Lyttle,Bloomsbury Publishing,2023-11-30,"This interdisciplinary volume seeks to trace the diverse ways in which stories of biblical women have been reimagined in and as comic books. Feminist biblical scholarship has previously addressed the tradition that relegates female biblical characters to secondary roles, merely enabling the male characters to attain their own goals. Using examples from both secular and religious comic Bibles, and comic Bibles aimed at children and older audiences, Zanne Domoney-Lyttle now fully considers contemporary remediations of biblical narratives to the same degree. Remediating ancient, biblical text into modern, graphical comic books affects the reception of the text in several ways. This book aims to investigate how the production, format, and function of comic Bibles encourages the depiction of biblical characters from a contemporary perspective, while also showing some fidelity to the text. By presenting a focused analysis on women in the Bible, wider issues concerning popular-cultural retellings of the Bible in general begin to surface, including matters concerning reception history, the space between art and literature inhabited by biblical comics, and issues of translation and interpretations within contemporary remediations.",Religion,122,N/A,0,en

It explores the data as they relate to Abby Day’s concept of performative belief, picking up on Mia Lövheim’s challenge to see how this concept works out in digital culture and social media. It also compares the data to various construals of contemporary approaches to faith performative faith, including Christian Smith and Melissa Lundquist Denton’s concept of moralistic therapeutic deism.

African Americans and the Bible,Vincent L. Wimbush,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2012-09-01,"Perhaps no other group of people has been as much formed by biblical texts and tropes as African Americans. From literature and the arts to popular culture and everyday life, the Bible courses through black society and culture like blood through veins. Despite the enormous recent interest in African American religion, relatively little attention has been paid to the diversity of ways in which African Americans have utilized the Bible. African Americans and the Bible is the fruit of a four-year collaborative research project directed by Vincent L. Wimbush and funded by the Lilly Endowment. It brings together scholars and experts (sixty-eight in all) from a wide range of academic and artistic fields and disciplines--including ethnography, cultural history, and biblical studies as well as art, music, film, dance, drama, and literature. The focus is on the interaction between the people known as African Americans and that complex of visions, rhetorics, and ideologies known as the Bible. As such, the book is less about the meaning(s) of the Bible than about the Bible and meaning(s), less about the world(s) of the Bible than about how worlds and the Bible interact--in short, about how a text constructs a people and a people constructs a text. It is about a particular sociocultural formation but also about the dynamics that obtain in the interrelation between any group of people and sacred texts in general. Thus African Americans and the Bible provides an exemplum of sociocultural formation and a critical lens through which the process of sociocultural formation can be viewed.",Religion,912,N/A,0,en

A Methodist pastor named Harley Camden witnesses the destructive deluge and then discovers, in the debris, a dead man with a crude carving of Satan’s claws in his back. Harley is drawn into the mystery of what caused the flood and who killed the man, while diving into questions of good and evil, body and spirit, humanity and the environment—especially questions about the change in climate that now threatens life around the globe. He discovers that there is a spiritual dimension to every social issue, whether it be the violence of Central American gangs or the racism that leads a black businessman to make a fateful choice. When the windows of the heavens open, surprising truths are revealed about how people can coexist in an interfaith, multicultural community, and how humans can establish a sustainable relationship with the natural world around them.",Religion,209,N/A,0,en

It is not meant that he should read it over comfortably, and then have done with it. No, he is to treat the promise as a reality, as a man treats a check.”",Religion,383,N/A,0,en

In this lesson we will look closely at this person in order to more clearly define His true nature and character. #5 Salvation - This lesson lays out the simple yet powerful plan that God has initiated to save mankind from eternal condemnation due to personal sin and how Jesus Christ fits in to this plan of salvation. #6 The Church - The church is the physical presence of Jesus Christ in the world today.

The Old Testament - King James Version,Foundation Bible,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2015-12-21,"Volume 1 A return to elegant simplicity - Foundation Bibles look like they're meant to be read, not referenced ""Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."" -Albert Einstein The Foundation Bible has been designed to reinvent how we interact with the Bible - natural paragraphs, large text, real paper, and free of verses and encyclopedic conventions you see in Bibles today. There are no alterations or additions to existing translations. There is already a natural eloquence to the stories in the Bible - it's time to get out of the way. ""Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."" -Leonardo da Vinci Verses, chapter headings, translation notes - virtually everything surrounding the text was not by the original Biblical authors. Foundation Bibles can help you encounter the text in a totally new light. By forgoing everything besides the narrative itself, you can read the Bible through like a novel. Catch the excitement of the great flood, Jerusalem's fall, the ten plagues of Egypt, and all the Biblical stories that have been cemented in the backdrop of history. By stripping away the encyclopedic additions of conventional scripture, you actually get a more accessible, culturally relevant Bible. Foundation Bibles are not about reducing - they are about refining. Elegance is always in style ""A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."" -Antoine de Saint-Exupery, The Little Prince (Le Petit Prince) You don't have to be a Christian to see the quality and value of these texts. The design reaches beyond book enthusiasts or even religion. Some of the most enthusiastic supporters of The Foundation Bible are not religious at all, but want to understand the stories that have shaped our world and want to become a better-rounded, more informed person. Many people want to read the Bible, but it's too difficult, too unenjoyable. The problem isn't even the message - it is the presentation. There is plenty of drama, action - even romance - to engage the most casual reader. Most of the intimidation people feel about scriptures comes from the structure rather than the content. We want something that can everyone, Christian or not, would love. This softcover paperback is intended for reading on the move, to be given as gifts, or to have something easy to curl up on the couch with. This edition is printed on demand through CreateSpace, which is owned by Amazon. The obvious advantages are speed and cost, and the entire manufacturing process is directed through CreateSpace. We know you will be happy when you receive you books - and we think you'll be happiest when you start reading it.",,412,N/A,0,en

The Gnostic Gospels,Elaine Pagels,Random House,2004-06-29,"Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best nonfiction books of all time The Gnostic Gospels is a landmark study of the long-buried roots of Christianity, a work of luminous scholarship and wide popular appeal. First published in 1979 to critical acclaim, winning the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award, The Gnostic Gospels has continued to grow in reputation and influence over the past two decades. It is now widely recognized as one of the most brilliant and accessible histories of early Christian spirituality published in our time. In 1945 an Egyptian peasant unearthed what proved to be the Gnostic Gospels, thirteen papyrus volumes that expounded a radically different view of the life and teachings of Jesus Christ from that of the New Testament. In this spellbinding book, renowned religious scholar Elaine Pagels elucidates the mysteries and meanings of these sacred texts both in the world of the first Christians and in the context of Christianity today. With insight and passion, Pagels explores a remarkable range of recently discovered gospels, including the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Mary Magdalene, to show how a variety of “Christianities” emerged at a time of extraordinary spiritual upheaval. Some Christians questioned the need for clergy and church doctrine, and taught that the divine could be discovered through spiritual search. Many others, like Buddhists and Hindus, sought enlightenment—and access to God—within. Such explorations raised questions: Was the resurrection to be understood symbolically and not literally? Was God to be envisioned only in masculine form, or feminine as well? Was martyrdom a necessary—or worthy—expression of faith? These early Christians dared to ask questions that orthodox Christians later suppressed—and their explorations led to profoundly different visions of Jesus and his message. Brilliant, provocative, and stunning in its implications, The Gnostic Gospels is a radical, eloquent reconsideration of the origins of the Christian faith.",Religion,250,N/A,0,en

Traditions of the Bible,James L. Kugel,Harvard University Press,1998,"James Kugel's The Bible As It Was (1997) has been welcomed with universal praise. Here now is the full scholarly edition of this wonderfully rich and illuminating work, expanding the author's findings into an incomparable reference work. Focusing on two dozen core stories in the Pentateuch--from the Creation and Tree of Knowledge through the Exodus from Egypt and journey to the Promised Land--James Kugel shows us how the earliest interpreters of the scriptures radically transformed the Bible and made it into the book that has come down to us today. Kugel explains how and why the writers of this formative age of interpretation--roughly 200 B.C.E. to 150 C.E.--assumed such a significant role. Mining their writings--including the Dead Sea Scrolls, works of Philo and Josephus and letters of the Apostle Paul, and writings of the Apostolic Fathers and the rabbinic Sages--he quotes for us the seminal passages that uncover this crucial interpretive process. For this full-scale reference work Kugel has added a substantial treasury of sources and passages for each of the 24 Bible stories. It will serve as a unique guide and sourcebook for biblical interpretation.",Reference,1092,N/A,0,en

In fact, the Bible is made up of many separate books composed by multiple writers in a wide range of styles and perspectives. It is, as Michael Carasik demonstrates, not a remote text reserved for churches and synagogues but rather a human document full of history, poetry, politics, theology, and spirituality. ¾Using historic, linguistic, anthropological, and theological sources, Carasik helps us distinguish between the Jewish Bibleês voicesãthe mythic, the historical, the prophetic, the theological, and the legal. By articulating the differences among these voices, he shows us not just their messages and meanings but also what mattered to the authors. In these contrasts we encounter the Bible anew, as a living work whose many voices tell us about the world out of which the Bible grewãand the world that it created.",Religion,383,N/A,0,en

"Sexual and Marital Metaphors in Hosea, Jeremiah, Isaiah, and Ezekiel",Sharon Moughtin-Mumby,OUP Oxford,2008-06-05,"Sharon Moughtin-Mumby considers the often unrecognised impact of different approaches to metaphor on readings of the prophtic sexual and marital metaphorical language. She outlines a practical and consciously simplified approach to metaphor, placing strong emphasis on the influence of literary context on metaphorical meaning. Drawing on this approach, she read Hosea 4-14, Jeremiah 2:1-4:4, Isaiah, Ezekiel 16 and 23, and Hosea 1-3 with fresh eyes. Her lucid new readings reveal the way in which scholarship has repeatedly stifled the prophetic metaphorical language by reading it within the 'default contexts' of 'the marriage metaphor' and 'cultic prostitution', which for so many years have been simply assumed. Readers are encouraged instead to read these diverse metaphors and similes within their distinctive literary contexts in which they have the potential to rise vividly to life, provoking the question: how are we to respond to these disquieting, powerful texts in the midst of the Hebrew Bible?",Religion,330,N/A,0,en

If the Tomb Is Empty,Joby Martin,FaithWords,2022-02-08,"A beloved pastor and a New York Times bestselling author examine scripture and share inspiring personal stories to help reveal the important role that Jesus’ resurrection plays in our everyday lives. The Son of God was crucified, died and buried, and He lay in the tomb for three days—until He walked out shining like the sun. In a culture in which history is erased or rewritten at will, the existence of an empty tomb matters. Why? Because if the tomb is empty—then anything is possible. In his first book, Joby Martin, Lead Pastor of The Church of Eleven22, dives deep into scripture and traces the story of salvation by highlighting the seven mountains throughout scripture where God manifests himself. As he describes each encounter with God, Martin shows us how the interaction on each mountain laid the groundwork for the sacrifice of Christ on Calvary, and shows what God revealed about Himself in the process. He illuminates seven familiar passages, unveiling how God's plan for Christ's sacrifice is threaded throughout scripture, and shows why Christ's resurrection—impossible, unbelievable—means that nothing is too hard for our God. Ultimately, he asks readers, Do you live every day of your life as if the tomb is empty—or as though Jesus is still hanging on that cross? Written with New York Times bestselling author Charles Martin, If the Tomb is Empty is an insightful and spiritually rich examination of what the miracle of Christ's resurrection means for all of us.",Religion,244,N/A,0,en

The Enlightenment Bible,Jonathan Sheehan,Princeton University Press,2007-07-22,"How did the Bible survive the Enlightenment? In this book, Jonathan Sheehan shows how Protestant translators and scholars in the eighteenth century transformed the Bible from a book justified by theology to one justified by culture. In doing so, the Bible was made into the cornerstone of Western heritage and invested with meaning, authority, and significance even for a secular age. The Enlightenment Bible offers a new history of the Bible in the century of its greatest crisis and, in turn, a new vision of this century and its effects on religion. Although the Enlightenment has long symbolized the corrosive effects of modernity on religion, Sheehan shows how the Bible survived, and even thrived in this cradle of ostensible secularization. Indeed, in eighteenth-century Protestant Europe, biblical scholarship and translation became more vigorous and culturally significant than at any time since the Reformation. From across the theological spectrum, European scholars--especially German and English--exerted tremendous energies to rejuvenate the Bible, reinterpret its meaning, and reinvest it with new authority. Poets, pedagogues, philosophers, literary critics, philologists, and historians together built a post-theological Bible, a monument for a new religious era. These literati forged the Bible into a cultural text, transforming the theological core of the Judeo-Christian tradition. In the end, the Enlightenment gave the Bible the power to endure the corrosive effects of modernity, not as a theological text but as the foundation of Western culture.",Religion,294,N/A,0,en

"The Reader's Bible, a Narrative",Roland Mushat Frye,Princeton University Press,1978-07-21,"Understanding the Bible as an account of the unfolding revelation of God to humankind through history, Roland Mushat Frye suggests that the many sub-plots, monologues, and reflections of the Bible compose a coherent story that continues through both the Old and New Testaments. ""The convictions of the Bible, to be sure, are the convictions of religion and ethics,"" he writes, ""but the methods are the methods of literature."" Carefully arranging a selection of excerpts that comprise approximately one-fourth of the entire Bible, he enables the reader to follow chronologically the main narrative as well as the most significant asides. With introductory and explanatory material providing transition and background information, the reader progresses from book to book as from chapter to chapter in a novel. Thus, this is called The Reader's Bible because it may be read as a narrative, as a story that unifies consecutive events through which the character of God gradually unfolds. God first appears in the opening of Genesis with the creation of the universe; against this backdrop the human drama is played. We see Everyman and Everywoman endowed with a life in harmony as long as they accept the primacy of God. When they repudiate this primacy, chaos replaces harmony and they find themselves in a wilderness rather than in a garden. God then turns from the attempt to create a righteous and peaceful order for all of humanity to a concentration on one segment of humanity-the race of Abraham--for the development of a conception of human personality and community that may serve as a pattern for all human beings. Professor Frye writes that however miraculous the entrances of God upon the stage may appear to be, they do constitute entrances into ordinary human affairs. These encounters Invite us to look both within and beyond them to what they reveal about God and about ourselves. Concerned with the matter of living here and hereafter, the different biblical histories and stories are brought together to provide cumulative insight into human nature and destiny.",Bibles,644,N/A,0,en

Chronological Bible Reading Guide,Jane Becker Weathers,WestBow Press,2020-12-02,"Chronological Bible Reading Guide presents the arrangement of events recorded in the Bible in sequential order to help us better understand how time flows through and joins, or occasionally separates, these sixty-six individual books. When seen in context with the historical, political, and religious settings, we can better understand the different lessons told in different styles and literary forms including poetry, prophecy and epistles as they are intertwined with history. These readings are grouped by chapter, and while this does not provide a perfect chronology (if that is even possible), it comes fairly close and helps retain some of the original authors’ flow when switching between books. The daily readings provide a guide through the entire Protestant canon in one calendar year. Or read at your own rate through God’s word of truth. This guide is the result of more than a decade of personal study in Biblical history and fine-tuning the daily readings to maintain a consistent reading time.

Life with God,Richard J. Foster,Zondervan,2010-05-04,"Too often, our study of the Bible focuses on searching for specific information or some formula that will solve our pressing needs of the moment. But what if we approached the Bible differently, and instead of transforming the text to meet our needs, allowed it to transform us? That's exactly the idea behind Life with God, Richard J. Foster's much-anticipated book on the Bible. Foster, bestselling author of Celebration of Discipline and general editor of The RenovarÉ Spiritual Formation Bible, claims that God has superintended the writing of Scripture so that it serves as the most reliable guide for Christian spiritual formation. According to Foster, the Bible is all about human life ""with God."" As we read Scripture, we should consider how exactly God is with us in each story and allow ourselves to be spiritually transformed. By opening our whole selves—mind, body, spirit, thoughts, behavior, and will—to the page before us, we begin to grasp all the Bible has to teach about prayer, obedience, compassion, virtue, and grace and apply it to our everyday lives to achieve a deeper relationship with God. With a wealth of examples and simple yet crucial insights, Life with God is an indispensable guide to approaching the Bible through the lens of Christian spiritual formation, revealing that reading the Bible for interior transformation is a far different endeavor than reading the Bible for historical knowledge, literary appreciation, or religious instruction.",Religion,242,N/A,0,en

The King James Version of the Bible,"King James, Murat Ukray",CreateSpace,2014-09-23,"The King James Version (KJV), commonly known as the Authorized Version (AV) or King James Bible (KJB), is an English translation of the Christian Bible for the Church of England begun in 1604 and completed in 1611. First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities. The first was the Great Bible commissioned in the reign of King Henry VIII, and the second was the Bishops' Bible of 1568. In January 1604, King James I convened the Hampton Court Conference where a new English version was conceived in response to the perceived problems of the earlier translations as detected by the Puritans, a faction within the Church of England. James gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin. In the Book of Common Prayer (1662), the text of the Authorized Version replaced the text of the Great Bible - for Epistle and Gospel readings - and as such was authorized by Act of Parliament. By the first half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version was effectively unchallenged as the English translation used in Anglican and Protestant churches. Over the course of the 18th century, the Authorized Version supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English speaking scholars. Today, the most used edition of the King James Bible, and often identified as plainly the King James Version, especially in the United States, closely follows the standard text of 1769, edited by Benjamin Blayney at Oxford. Editorial Criticism: F. H. A. Scrivener and D. Norton have both written in detail on editorial variations which have occurred through the history of the publishing of the Authorized Version from 1611 to 1769. In the 19th century, there were effectively three main guardians of the text. Norton identified five variations among the Oxford, Cambridge and London (Eyre and Spottiswoode) texts of 1857, such as the spelling of ""farther"" or ""further"" at Matthew 26:29. In the 20th century, variations between the editions was reduced to comparing the Cambridge to the Oxford. Distinctly identified Cambridge readings included ""or Sheba"" (Josh. 19:2), ""sin"" (2 Chr. 33:19), ""clifts"" (Job 30:6), ""vapour"" (Psalm 148:8), ""flieth"" (Nah. 3:16), ""further"" (Matt. 26:39) and a number of other references. In effect the Cambridge was considered the current text in comparison to the Oxford. Cambridge University Press introduced a change at 1 John 5:8 in 1985 reverting its longstanding tradition of having the word ""spirit"" in lower case to have a capital letter ""S."" It has also done the same in some of its publications in Acts 11:12 and 11:28. These are instances where both Oxford and Cambridge have now altered away from Blayney's 1769 Edition. The distinctions between the Oxford and Cambridge editions has been a major point in the Bible version debate. Differences among Cambridge editions, in the 21st century, has become a potential theological issue, particularly in regard to the identification of the Pure Cambridge Edition. Translation The English terms ""rejoice"" and ""glory"" stand for the same word in the Greek original. In Tyndale, Geneva and the Bishops' Bibles, both instances are translated ""rejoice."" In the Douay-Rheims New Testament, both are translated ""glory."" Only in the Authorized Version does the translation vary between the two verses. In the Old Testament the translators render the Tetragrammaton YHWH by ""the LORD"" (in later editions in small capitals as LORD), or ""the LORD God""",Bibles,670,N/A,0,en

It includes Old Testament background, Second Temple Judaism, the life of Jesus, the New Testament, and the early Jewish followers of Jesus. It is intended as a resource for college and/or higher education. It is no longer a novelty to say that Jesus was a Jew.

This collection of articles aims to address those questions and serve as a comprehensive yet concise primer on the Jewish roots of the Christian faith. It consists of thirteen chapters, most of which are divided into four or five articles. It is in a ""handbook"" format, meaning that each article is brief but informative. The thirteen chapters are grouped into four major sections: (1) The Soil, (2) The Roots, (3) The Trunk, and (4) The Branches. Craig A.

In Contagious Faith, bestselling author and teacher Mark Mittelberg introduces five approaches to evangelism and helps you determine which of them fit best with your unique personality and style: Friendship-Building Selfless-Serving Story-Sharing Reason-Giving Truth-Telling He also explains in a down-to-earth fashion several key skills that will help you talk about Jesus effectively, illustrating his message with real-life accounts of ordinary believers who applied these principles for extraordinary impact.

Holman Illustrated Guide To Biblical Geography,"Holman Bible Publishers, Paul Wright",B&H Publishing Group,2020-12-01,"Reading the land enables us to read the Bible with greater insight. Though the truths of the Bible transcend time and place, they are rooted in them. Geographical data inform our understanding of activity in the land of the Bible, while the Bible’s own description of these events, embedded deeply in the realia of the land itself, helps us better understand the living context in which these events took place. When we develop a skill set that allows us to read the land of the Bible as fluently as we might read the text, we stand not only to gain a better appreciation of the divine-human events of Scripture, we also gain an understanding of how these events become relevant to us in our own particular living contexts. Chapters include: Exploring the World of the Bible Building Blocks of Biblical Geography The Land of Ancient Israel: The Southern Regions (Judah/Judea) The Land of Ancient Israel: The Central Regions (Israel/Samaria) The Land of Ancient Israel: The Northern Regions (Galilee) Transjordan Afterword: Geography of the Heart Biblical geography has great apologetic value. The biblical writers had to be accurate when presenting geographical material. Unlike some matters of history and doctrine, their assertions about the realities of land forms and climate, or about the relation of one city to another, or about the use of strategic routes could easily be verified both by their first readers as well as by contemporary readers.

The NIV Lectio Bible was created with that end in mind: to give those walking in the Way of Jesus a way of listening to God on the pages of Scripture.

From the family frictions of Genesis and King David’s flawed humanity to the serene wisdom of Psalms and Job’s incendiary questioning of God’s ways, these magnificent works of world literature resonate with a startling immediacy. Featuring Alter’s generous commentary, which quietly alerts readers to the literary and historical dimensions of the text, this is the definitive edition of the Hebrew Bible.",Religion,2966,5,1,en

How the Bible Works,Brian Malley,Rowman Altamira,2004,"What do evangelicals believe when they 'believe in the Bible?' Despite hundreds of English versions that differ in their texts, evangelicals continue to believe that there is a stable text--'the Bible'--which is the authoritative word of God and an essential guide to their everyday lives. To understand this phenomenon of evangelical Biblicism, anthropologist and biblical scholar Brian Malley looks not to the words of the Bible but to the Bible-believing communities. For as Malley demonstrates, it is less the meaning of the words of the Bible itself than how 'the Bible' provides a proper ground for beliefs that matters to evangelicals. Drawing on recent cognitive and social theory and extensive fieldwork in an evangelical church, Malley's book is an invaluable guide for seminarians, social scientists of religion, or for anyone who wants to understand just how the Bible works for American evangelicals.",Religion,188,N/A,0,en

Supernatural,"Heiser, Michael S.",Lexham Press,2015-11-10,"Dr. Michael S. Heiser presents fifteen years of research on what the Bible really says about the unseen world of the supernatural, unfiltered by tradition or by theological presuppositions. Who were the sons of God? Who were the Nephilim? Where do angels fit into the supernatural hierarchy? What relation does Jesus bear to the rest of the supernatural world? Heiser tackles these questions and many more as he shines a light on the ancient context of Scripture. After reading this book, you may never read your Bible the same way again. In Supernatural, Heiser takes the core message from his recent best-seller, The Unseen Realm, and presents it for the person in the pew. He offers the same approach to reading and understanding Scripture, but without all the extra footnotes and supporting information needed for the scholarly treatment. “We can’t believe what we don’t understand. In Supernatural, Michael Heiser helps us to do both. It may open your eyes to the scripture in a new way.” —John Ortberg, author of If You Want to Walk on Water, You’ve Got to Get Out of the Boat",Religion,161,5,1,en

From Moravia to Texas,Sam Kopecky,Trafford Publishing,2020-10-07,"As the early 20th century steadily recedes into the distant past, many details of daily life during that American pre-depression period fade to an increasingly abstract perspective, void of the feeling brought to life in this loving couple’s extensive and valuable correspondence. This is a rare first-hand account of the stress and hardships of a country nurse, and country doctor and WWI veteran, from humble origins. There is also a vivid portrayal of organized nursing at its infancy in rural communities, and the uncertain and difficult circumstances of establishing a country practice for practitioners of the Hippocratic Oath—as opposed to their big city brethren—and their transition from horse-and-buggy to Henry Ford’s first automobiles. The imagination of 21st century readers is revived with glimpses of rural life, family relations and varied problems in turn-of-the-century Texas, where disease and sudden death stalked young and old, as in all the ‘frontier’ states of the pre-WWI south western United States. Along with the moving emotions expressed through its characters, this correspondence is sure to awaken in readers, an understanding of just how much is taken for granted today and to what extent the values of the pre-depression generations have eroded.",Biography & Autobiography,646,N/A,0,en

How to Overcome the Spirit of Fear,Evangelist Prophetess Ella Knight,AuthorHouse,2010-10,"In this book, Evangelist Ella Knight shares the deep, dark valleys of life that God allowed her to travel through. From a rough marriage, severe financial struggles, vicious attacks by evil workers and more, she shares the experiences that almost caused her to go over the edge. But even more, this book is a guide to overcoming the spirit of fear with which Satan wants to suppress us all. Evangelist Knight couldn't understand why our All Wise and Almighty God Jehovah allowed her life to be so hard, difficult and fearful, until the Lord spoke and said unto her ""You can't lead where you haven't been, you can't teach what you don't know and you can't share what you haven't experienced."" Therefore, she had to go through the obstacles and be attacked by the demons, devils and evil spirits that our Heavenly Father allowed to be laid in her path, to draw her closer to Him. Now she is able to understand, identify and help His people as they go through the attacks that they don't understand. This minister of God never imagined that life could be so fearful, hard, miserable and difficult until God allowed her enemies to come upon her to chase her into the ""Potter Hands."" Now she can't believe the faith and bravery that God has planted in her and the peaceful, prosperous and joyful spirit that now lives within her.

There are no coincidents or incidentals in the daily life of the born-again believer. Life is like a stage play which consists of plots, twists and turns in various plots – we just walk through the script as it has been assigned to us. God is our Director, he writes the script, we are just the players or actors. Sometimes we are not in full agreeance with the way everything seems to be playing out – crazy scenes, dark spots, pits, escalators, roller coasters, illness – and we wonder why we’re even a part of the whole scene. Yet we’re trusting the Director knows what He is doing because all scripts under His direction has NEVER faltered or failed. Then the passage takes a turn, or twist, if you will and the fog begins to lift and we began to see a little more clearly – “Ah ha!” – and as we continue to walk through the script we see the ending, though it may not have turned out the way we would have written the script, turned out exceptionally well.

New King James - The Bridge Bible,David W. Daniels,Chick Publications,2020-05-20,"Is The New King James Bible Just An Updated King James? It promised to be a 5th edition of the KJV, preserving ""the originally intended meaning of every verse."" Did publishers and translators keep their promise? Author David Daniels shows us in this book that the classical language (including the ""thees"" and ""thous"") is not all that was changed. In fact, this Bible is not a King James at all! Some of the ""updates"" actually change doctrines! “I’M NOT SAYING WHAT COULD HAPPEN. I’M SHOWING YOU WHAT DID HAPPEN.” – DAVID W DANIELS It cannot be a true King James, if salvation is changed from a finished work to an unfinished process (1 Corinthians 1:18). How can you know you are saved? Or in Matthew 7:14 where it says, ""Because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life…""? God did not make the way ""difficult"". Salvation is as close as our mouth and our heart! These tiny changes, as well as others like it, have made a big difference, moving people from faith to doubt in God and His words. But there’s more. The publishers of the New King James said, themselves, that their goal was to provide a “transitional bridge” to a modern Bible (and they sell plenty of them). As people get used to seeing words changed in their Bible, they soon will accept a Bible that changes even more! Eventually, you have a Bible with wording vague enough, in many key areas, that all the world’s religions will be able to “fit” their doctrines into it. This is actually part of the larger plan for everyone to accept one world Bible for the Antichrist’s coming one world religion. How do we counter this? By teaching our children how to read the clear words of the King James, we can bring faith and not doubt to the next generation. In fact, as you will see in this book, if previous generations had done this, the New King James would never have been made.",Bibles,140,N/A,0,en
You Are Today’S Women of the Bible and I Can Prove It,Darci Jeffries,Archway Publishing,2018-03-26,"When Jesus was on earth, he did nothing to indicate women were second-class citizens. For example, he asked Mary Magdalene, at one of the most critical times in his life, to be the disciple to announce his resurrection. Yet somewhere in history, women have been made to feel like they shouldnt be pastors or leaders of the church because of their gender. In You Are Todays Women of the Bible and I can prove it, author Darci Jeffries shows women are just as much a child of God as anyone, no better than men and no worse than men. Through a variety of Biblical entries and scriptures, she recognizes the important roles women played in the Bible and how todays women still have significant impact influencing people for Gods kingdom. Jeffries notes the influential female of the Bible such as Jochebed (Moses mother), Esther, and Rebekah, and shares how its because of those women and the roles they played in Biblical history, that todays women have the same level of influence. Inspiring todays women to achieve all they can, You Are Todays Women of the Bible and I can prove it seeks to get more women working with others for Gods kingdom and to help them understand how important they are in Gods workplace.",Religion,178,N/A,0,en
"Pull the Chocks, I'm Launching",Major General (Ret.) David E. B. (DEB) Ward,Gatekeeper Press,2022-02-25,"For as long as I can remember, I always wanted to be a pilot, and when I first saw F-80 fighter jets making practice gunnery passes on a firefighting training tower in Anchorage, Alaska, I knew I had to become a fighter pilot. This experience happened when I was 12 years of age and during the period of the Korean War. Seventeen years later I was invited to join the Oregon Air National and informed that I was going to become a fighter pilot in the 123rd Fighter Interceptor Squadron, in Portland, Oregon. The squadron is known as the “Redhawks,” My journey in this chapter of my life began in Miles City, Montana, the place of my birth. Miles City bills itself as “The Cow Capital of the West”, holds an annual bucking horse sale in May of each year, and was the only American city in the contiguous United States to be bombed during World War II. That feat was accomplished by our own U.S. Army Air Corps. On both sides of my family, my grandparents were ranchers and farmers, and the hired workers on the ranch were trustees from the Miles City jail, reform school teenagers, and German POWs. I spent summers in the country and rode a full-size horse at the age of five. I didn’t ride a bicycle, however, until the age of eight when my family moved west to Portland, Oregon. Circumstances in my life, extending into early adulthood, generated a host of highly unusual real-life stories, ranging from the humorous to the tragic, several of which were woven into the fabric of then-current events that made their mark in history. The interesting people I came into contact with during these events contributed significantly to the richness of the experiences. A divorce and remarriages by both of my parents sent my already active early life into a tumultuous spin. In eight grades of schooling, I attended six different elementary schools in three different states plus the Territory of Alaska. Although we were settled for my years in high school and college, those disruptive moves created a restlessness within me that made it a challenge at times to remain focused on my studies. My selection as the University’s Air Force ROTC Drill Team Commander and the program’s Flight Indoctrination Program in which I received my Private Pilot License, imbued me with the direction and confidence I needed to successfully complete Air Force pilot training which I did in South Georgia. My first assignment after pilot training was as a T-33 jet pilot training instructor in Texas. The T-33 was the trainer version of the Korean War vintage F-80. In meeting my “need for speed”, I later converted as an instructor into the supersonic T-38 trainer. After four years of instructing basic flight training, I was reassigned to Korea as a Forward Air Controller and became the Air Division’s T-33 flight program manager. When I completed this overseas tour, at the height of the Air War in Vietnam, I resigned from the Air Force and joined the Oregon Air National Guard. This started a new chapter in my life.",Biography & Autobiography,438,N/A,0,en

The Making of the Bibles MoralisŽes: Volume I: The Manuscripts,,Penn State Press,N/A,"The Bibles Moralisées are by far the richest and most complex attempt at biblical illustration ever undertaken. Seven of them survive today, made primarily for the kings and queens of France between the early thirteenth and late fifteenth centuries. John Lowden's pioneering two-volume study brings new material to light and offers a wholly new approach to understanding the Bibles, which contain literally thousands of figures. Volume I, based on exhaustive codicological analysis, considers the making and the later history of use of each of the manuscripts. Volume II investigates in detail the treatment of one portion of the Bible, the Book of Ruth, in all the manuscripts. Discussion is supported by many new photographs in color and black and white. Together the two volumes challenge conventional wisdom about both the Bibles Moralisées and the relationship of word and image in medieval culture.",Art,408,N/A,0,en

The Bookshop of the World,"Andrew Pettegree, Arthur der Weduwen",Yale University Press,2019-04-02,"The untold story of how the Dutch conquered the European book market and became the world’s greatest bibliophiles. The Dutch Golden Age has long been seen as the age of Rembrandt and Vermeer, whose paintings captured the public imagination and came to represent the marvel that was the Dutch Republic. Yet there is another, largely overlooked marvel in the Dutch world of the seventeenth century: books. In this fascinating account, Andrew Pettegree and Arthur der Weduwen show how the Dutch produced many more books than pictures and bought and owned more books per capita than any other part of Europe. Key innovations in marketing, book auctions, and newspaper advertising brought stability to a market where elsewhere publishers faced bankruptcy, and created a population uniquely well-informed and politically engaged. This book tells for the first time the remarkable story of the Dutch conquest of the European book world and shows the true extent to which these pious, prosperous, quarrelsome, and generous people were shaped by what they read. “Book history at its best.” —Robert Darnton, New York Review of Books “Compelling and impressive.” —THES (Book of the Week) “An instant classic on Dutch book history.” —BMGN - Low Countries Historical Review",History,365,N/A,0,en

Yes You Can (and You Should) Read the King James Bible,David W. Daniels,Chick Publications,2020-01-08,"You Can’t Read That Old King James! ...Or Can You? The King James Bible is a true and direct translation from the original languages. But isn’t it too hard to read in the 21st century? Shouldn’t we have something easier? Why do we need a 17th century Book to tell us how to live our lives? What if you found out it’s the one English Bible that deserves your complete trust? What if the translation method tells us stuff God wanted us to know —but that modern scholars left out? Did you know there are deeply emotional words in the Bible? Did you know that there is a rhythm to reading the King James, and it was made to be read out loud? If generations of children were raised reading the King James, it shouldn’t be too hard for the rest of us! This book proves why you can read the King James English with a little effort and that it should be the only Bible that you need —and can completely trust. Includes a detailed appendix with charts, keyed to the vocabulary and verses of the King James Bible, to help you easily understand Biblical concepts, like: The Hebrew Calendar Hebrew Feast Days Hebrew Time Hebrew Weights Biblical Money Biblical Measures: Length, Dry Measure and Liquid MeasureThe Bible's Internal Timeline.

The writings that follow will seek to draw a comparison between, what I will call, man's churches, and the real Church of Jesus Christ. I am not proposing any kind of revolution. There will be no ugly criticism; just some thoughts. I will strive to show that it is a concern to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. He wants all our love and I feel He is saddened over the heart, soul, mind and money we have kept from Him.

Am I really a sinner?,Mark Schonebaum,WestBow Press,2024-08-14,"Are you really a sinner? When asked this question, most people will say that they are a good person, without stopping to think that even good people can be sinners. In fact, we are all sinners, but the problem is that many of us simply don’t know what sin is, which is what the author explores in this book. Get answers to questions such as: · How can we define what sin truly is? · How does sin hurt us and our relationships? · How can we eliminate sin? · What must we do to find salvation from sin? The author emphasizes that to follow Jesus, you must follow everything – not just what you like. The whole purpose of following Jesus is to align with God, not for God to align with you. God not only tells us that we are sinners, but He sent Jesus to cleanse us of all sin. We are no longer condemned by our sin; we are set free in Jesus.",Religion,133,N/A,0,en

In this classic theological treatise, the acclaimed theologian and religious leader Howard Thurman (1900-1981) demonstrates how the gospel may be read as a manual of resistance for the poor and disenfranchised. Jesus is a partner in the pain of the oppressed and the example of His life offers a solution to ending the descent into moral nihilism. Hatred does not empower--it decays.

The Bible With and Without Jesus,"Amy-Jill Levine, Marc Zvi Brettler",HarperCollins,2020-10-27,"The editors of The Jewish Annotated New Testament show how and why Jews and Christians read many of the same Biblical texts – including passages from the Pentateuch, the Prophets, and the Psalms – differently. Exploring and explaining these diverse perspectives, they reveal more clearly Scripture’s beauty and power. Esteemed Bible scholars and teachers Amy-Jill Levine and Marc Z. Brettler take readers on a guided tour of the most popular Hebrew Bible passages quoted in the New Testament to show what the texts meant in their original contexts and then how Jews and Christians, over time, understood those same texts. Passages include the creation of the world, the role of Adam and Eve, the Suffering Servant of Isiah, the book of Jonah, and Psalm 22, whose words, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me,” Jesus quotes as he dies on the cross. Comparing various interpretations – historical, literary, and theological - of each ancient text, Levine and Brettler offer deeper understandings of the original narratives and their many afterlives. They show how the text speaks to different generations under changed circumstances, and so illuminate the Bible’s ongoing significance.

Canon Revisited,Michael J. Kruger,Crossway,2012-04-30,"Given the popular-level conversations on phenomena like the Gospel of Thomas and Bart Ehrman's Misquoting Jesus, as well as the current gap in evangelical scholarship on the origins of the New Testament, Michael Kruger's Canon Revisited meets a significant need for an up-to-date work on canon by addressing recent developments in the field. He presents an academically rigorous yet accessible study of the New Testament canon that looks deeper than the traditional surveys of councils and creeds, mining the text itself for direction in understanding what the original authors and audiences believed the canon to be. Canon Revisited provides an evangelical introduction to the New Testament canon that can be used in seminary and college classrooms, and read by pastors and educated lay leaders alike. In contrast to the prior volumes on canon, this volume distinguishes itself by placing a substantial focus on the theology of canon as the context within which the historical evidence is evaluated and assessed. Rather than simply discussing the history of canon—rehashing the Patristic data yet again—Kruger develops a strong theological framework for affirming and authenticating the canon as authoritative. In effect, this work successfully unites both the theology and the historical development of the canon, ultimately serving as a practical defense for the authority of the New Testament books.",Religion,370,N/A,0,en
The Oxford Handbook of the Bible and American Popular Culture,"Dan W. Clanton (Jr.), Terry R. Clark",N/A,2020,"The study of the reciprocal relationship between the Bible and popular culture has blossomed in the past few decades, and the time seems ripe for a broadly-conceived work that assesses the current state of the field, offers examples of work in that field, and suggests future directions for further study. This Handbook includes a wide range of topics organized under several broad themes, including biblical characters (such as Adam, Eve, David and Jesus) and themes (like Creation, Hell, and Apocalyptic) in popular culture; the Bible in popular cultural genres (for example, film, comics, and Jazz); and ""lived"" examples (such as museums and theme parks). The Handbook concludes with a section taking stock of methodologies and the impact of the field on teaching and publishing. The Oxford Handbook of the Bible and American Popular Culture represents a major contribution to the field by some of its leading practitioners, and will be a key resource for the future development of the study of both the Bible and its role in American popular culture.",Bibles,615,N/A,0,en

Houghton Library",Yale University Press,1996-01-01,"It is equally true that the Reformation was inspired and defined by the Bible and that the Bible was reshaped by the intellectual, political, and cultural forces of the Reformation. In this book, a distinguished scholar--whose contributions to the field of religious studies have won him wide renown--explores this relationship, examining both the role of the Bible in the Reformation and the effect of the Reformation on the text of the Bible, Biblical studies, preaching and exegesis, and European culture in general. Jaroslav Pelikan begins by discussing the philological foundations of the ""reformation"" of the Biblical text, focusing on the revival of Greek and Hebrew language study and the important contributions to textual criticism by humanist scholars. He then examines the changing patterns of interpretation and communication of the Biblical text, the proliferation of vernacular versions of scripture and their impact on various national cultures, and the impact of the Reformation Bible on art, music, and literature of the period. The book is richly illustrated with examples of early printed editions of Bibles, commentaries, sermons, vernacular translations, and other works with Biblical themes, all of which are identified and discussed. The book serves as the catalog for a major exhibition of early Bibles and Reformation texts that has been organized at Bridwell Library, Perkins School of Theology, Southern Methodist University, and will also be shown at the Yale Center for British Art, the Houghton Library and the Widener Library at Harvard University, and the Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Columbia University.",Religion,232,N/A,0,en

God's Secretaries,Adam Nicolson,Zondervan,2005-08-02,"A network of complex currents flowed across Jacobean England. This was the England of Shakespeare, Jonson, and Bacon; the era of the Gunpowder Plot and the worst outbreak of the plague. Jacobean England was both more godly and less godly than the country had ever been, and the entire culture was drawn taut between these polarities. This was the world that created the King James Bible. It is the greatest work of English prose ever written, and it is no coincidence that the translation was made at the moment ""Englishness,"" specifically the English language itself, had come into its first passionate maturity. The English of Jacobean England has a more encompassing idea of its own scope than any form of the language before or since. It drips with potency and sensitivity.

Jesus and the Disinherited,Howard Thurman,Beacon Press,2022-10-11,"“No other publication in the twentieth century has upended antiquated theological notions, truncated political ideas, and socially constructed racial fallacies like Jesus and the Disinherited. Thurman’s work keeps showing up on the desk of anti-apartheid activists, South American human rights workers, civil rights champions, and now Black Lives Matter advocates.” –Rev. Otis Moss III, author of Blue Note Preaching in a Post-Soul World and senior pastor at Trinity United Church of Christ A commemorative edition of the work that inspired Martin Luther King Jr. and helped shape the civil rights movement In this beautiful gift edition of the classic theological treatise, complete with a place-marker ribbon and silver gilded edges, celebrated theologian and religious leader Howard Thurman (1899–1981) revolutionizes the way we read the gospel. Thurman lifts Jesus up as a partner in the pain of the oppressed and reveals the gospel as a manual of resistance for the poor and disenfranchised. In this view, the example of Jesus’s life shows us that hatred does not empower—it decays. Only by recognizing fear, deception, contempt, and love of one another can God’s justice prevail. With a new foreword by acclaimed womanist theologian Kelly Brown Douglas, this edition of Jesus and the Disinherited is a timeless testimony of faith that demonstrates how to thrive and flourish in a world that attempts to destroy one’s humanity from the inside out. Having witnessed firsthand the depths of white supremacy and the heights of human civility, Thurman reiterates the inherent dignity of all of God’s children.",Religion,138,N/A,0,en

Colossians and Philemon,Dr. David Jeremiah,HarperChristian Resources,2021-03-23,"Finding freedom in Christ... Follow Dr. Jeremiah through the letters of Colossians and Philemon in a chapter-by-chapter study that will help you understand what it meant to the people at the time it was written, and what it means to Christians today. The apostle Paul may never have visited the small town of Colossae, located in modern-day Turkey, but he was linked to the congregation through a coworker named Epaphras. This man came to visit Paul while he was imprisoned in Rome to deliver troubling news about destructive teachings that had taken root in the Colossian fellowship. Paul penned a letter in response, urging the believers to experience the freedom they had found in Christ, recognize their salvation came through the Lordship of Jesus alone, and reflect the light of Christ in their lives. Paul also penned a short personal letter to a Colossian believer named Philemon, urging him to forgive a slave who had departed from him and receive him back as a fellow brother. Paul's words in these letters compel us to remember everything that Jesus has done for us and treat others as we want to be treated. Each of this study's twelve lessons is clearly organized to include: Getting Started: An opening question to introduce you to the lesson. Setting the Stage: A short reflection to explain the context of the study. Exploring the Text: The Scripture reading for the lesson with related study questions. Reviewing the Story: Questions to help you identify key points in the reading. Applying the Message: Questions to help you apply the key ideas to their lives. Reflecting on the Meaning: A closing reflection on the key teachings in the lesson. —ABOUT THE SERIES— The Jeremiah Bible Study Series captures Dr. David Jeremiah's forty-plus years of commitment in teaching the Word of God. In each study, you'll gain insights into the text, identify key stories and themes, and be challenged to apply the truths you uncover to your life. By the end of each study, you'll come away with a clear and memorable understanding of that Bible book. Each study also contains a Leader's Guide.",Religion,161,N/A,0,en

To Know Christ Jesus,Frank Sheed,Ignatius Press,2011-06-03,"This modern spiritual classic by Frank Sheed, the renowned author, publisher and lecturer, is brought back into print for the benefit of new generations of readers to develop a deeper, more profound knowledge of Jesus Christ. Sheed's concern with the Gospels is to come to know Christ as he actually lived among us, interacted with all the various people he encountered from his infancy to his passion and death--the God-man who was like us in all things except sin. Sheed has tried especially to see Our Lord in his effect upon others--seeing how they saw him, trying to see why they saw him so. There is much about Mary and Joseph in their task of bringing up a baby who was literally adorable; about John the Baptist; about Mary of Bethany and Mary Magdalen; about Nicodemus; about people we meet only for a moment, like the man born blind and the owners of the drowned swine; and why the Pharisees, not only the worst of them but some of the best, would not accept Christ. Faith, doctrine, prayer, worship--all the content and consequences of Christian belief--rest on the person of Christ Jesus as recorded in the Gospels. In this classic study, Frank J. Sheed employs wide learning, theological sophistication, spiritual insight, and a lucid style to bring the reader to a personal encounter with the living Lord. To Know Christ Jesus has been justly called ""one of the most satisfying studies of the Gospel ever made."" Frank J. Sheed had a distinguished career as a publisher, lecturer, street-corner evangelist, and popular writer. He and his wife Maisie Ward were the founders of the publishing house Sheed & Ward. His many books include Christ in Eclipse, What Difference Does Jesus Make?, Theology and Sanity, and A Map of Life. ""My concern with the Gospels is to see the Face which through all the centuries has looked out from them upon men. The object is not to prove something but to meet someone--that we should know Christ Jesus, know him as one person may know another. As Christians we love him, try to live by his law, would think it a glory to die for him. But how well do we know him?"" -Frank Sheed, from the Foreword",Religion,412,N/A,0,en

Apocalypse of Moses,Scriptural Research Institute,Scriptural Research Institute,2019-10-10,"The Apocalypse of Moses is the Greek version of the Life of Adam and Eve. The original version is believed to have been written in a Semitic language, as there as terms transliterated into Greek from a Semitic language, however, it is not known positively which language, as the original text is lost, and so far, no fragments have been found among the Dead Sea Scrolls that can be firmly linked to it. The closest text discovered to date among the Dead Sea Scrolls would be the Genesis Apocryphon scroll, written in Aramaic and generally dated to between 37 BC to 50 AD. The original language of the Apocalypse of Moses was likely also Aramaic, as demonstrated by the use of the name Iah (Jah), which is found more commonly in Aramaic language books, like Tobit. A number of references circumstantially date the original work to the era when the Greeks ruled Judea, between 330 and 140 BC. The reference to Iah is itself evidence of a pre-Hasmonean origin, as the Hasmoneans’ authorized’ version of the Hebrew texts appear to have redacted Iah (יה) to Yahweh (יהוה) when they converted the Jews from the Canaanite (Samaritan/Paleo-Hebrew) script to the Assyrian (Hebrew) script. The name Iah (Jah) does show up in many ancient names, such as Josiah, and phrases such as Hallelujah, implying it was once widely accepted as the name of (a) God, however, virtually disappeared from the Hebrew scriptures at some point, likely during the Hasmonean redaction and standardization circa 140 BC. The reference to Lord Sabaoth (κυρίῳ σαβαωθ) is another indicator of a pre-Hasmonean origin for the text. Lord Sabaoth was the Major-General of the Lord God’s army that helped Joshua destroy the walls of Jericho in the Septuagint’s Book of Joshua. There are many references to Lord Sabaoth, the ‘Lord of War’ in the Greek era, however, during the early Hasmonean era, he became an epitaph of Iaw (Yahweh) the national God of Hasmonean Judea: Iaw Sabaoth (יהוה צבאות). The Hasmoneans redacted Lord Sabaoth from the Book of Joshua, replacing him with Yahweh (יהוה), meaning that Yahweh was the Major-General of his own army in the Masoretic version of Joshua. According to later-Hasmonean records, Yahweh Sabaoth became the Jewish version of Dionysus or Bacchus, a god of war, wine, and lust, before he was abandoned during the formation of the Pharisee sect, who rejected the pronunciation of any of the names of God.",Religion,63,N/A,0,en

None Like Him,Jen Wilkin,Crossway,2016-04-14,"Human beings were created to reflect the image of God—but only to a limited extent. Although we share important attributes with God (love, mercy, compassion, etc.), there are other qualities that only God possesses, such as unlimited power, knowledge, and authority. At the root of all sin is our rebellious desire to be like God in such ways—a desire that first manifested itself in the garden of Eden. In None Like Him, Jen Wilkin leads us on a journey to discover ten ways God is different from us—and why that’s a good thing.

How are we to formulate a clear, biblical understanding of the gospel? Tradition, reason, and experience all leave us ultimately disappointed. If we want answers, we must turn to the Word of God. Greg Gilbert does so in What Is the Gospel? Beginning with Paul's systematic presentation of the gospel in Romans and moving through the sermons in Acts, Gilbert argues that the central structure of the gospel consists of four main subjects: God, man, Christ, and a response. The book carefully examines each and then explores the effects the gospel can have in individuals, churches, and the world. Both Christian and non-Christian readers will gain a clearer understanding of the gospel in this valuable resource.",Religion,88,5,1,en

The present volume shows that it goes far beyond being a religious text. The essays explore how religious, political and cultural identities, including ethnicity and gender, are embodied in biblical discourse. Following the authors, we read the Bible with new eyes: as a critic of gender, ideology, politics and culture. We ask ourselves new questions: about God's body, about women's role, about racial prejudices and about the politics of the written word. Reading Bibles, Writing Bodies crosses boundaries. It questions our most fundamental assumptions about the Bible. It shows how biblical studies can benefit from the mainstream of Western intellectual discourse, throwing up entirely new questions and offering surprising answers.

The Poisonwood Bible,Barbara Kingsolver,Harper Collins,2009-10-13,"New York Times Bestseller • Finalist for the Pulitzer Prize • An Oprah's Book Club Selection “Powerful . . . [Kingsolver] has with infinitely steady hands worked the prickly threads of religion, politics, race, sin and redemption into a thing of terrible beauty.” —Los Angeles Times Book Review The Poisonwood Bible, now celebrating its 25th anniversary, established Barbara Kingsolver as one of the most thoughtful and daring of modern writers. Taking its place alongside the classic works of postcolonial literature, it is a suspenseful epic of one family's tragic undoing and remarkable reconstruction over the course of three decades in Africa. The story is told by the wife and four daughters of Nathan Price, a fierce, evangelical Baptist who takes his family and mission to the Belgian Congo in 1959. They carry with them everything they believe they will need from home, but soon find that all of it—from garden seeds to Scripture—is calamitously transformed on African soil. The novel is set against one of the most dramatic political chronicles of the twentieth century: the Congo's fight for independence from Belgium, the murder of its first elected prime minister, the CIA coup to install his replacement, and the insidious progress of a world economic order that robs the fledgling African nation of its autonomy. Against this backdrop, Orleanna Price reconstructs the story of her evangelist husband's part in the Western assault on Africa, a tale indelibly darkened by her own losses and unanswerable questions about her own culpability. Also narrating the story, by turns, are her four daughters—the teenaged Rachel; adolescent twins Leah and Adah; and Ruth May, a prescient five-year-old. These sharply observant girls, who arrive in the Congo with racial preconceptions forged in 1950s Georgia, will be marked in surprisingly different ways by their father's intractable mission, and by Africa itself. Ultimately each must strike her own separate path to salvation. Their passionately intertwined stories become a compelling exploration of moral risk and personal responsibility.",Fiction,578,5,1,en

The Loveliest Place,Dustin Benge,Crossway,2022-02-25,"How Christians Can Rediscover the Beauty and Glory of the Church Dear. Precious. Lovely. The Bible describes the church in extraordinary ways, even using beautiful poetry and metaphors. How does this compare to how Christians today describe the church? Unfortunately, many believers focus more on its mission, structure, or specific programs than on its inherent beauty. It's time to spark a renewed affection for the church. In The Loveliest Place, Dustin Benge urges Christians to see the holy assembly of God's redeemed people in all its eternal beauty. He explains what makes the church lovely, including the Trinitarian relationship, worship, service, and gospel proclamation. For those who have never learned to view the church as God sees it, or have become disillusioned by its flaws, this book is a reminder that the corporate gathering of believers is a reflection of God's indescribable beauty. This is the third book in the Union series, which invites readers to experience deeper enjoyment of God through four interconnected values: delighting in God, growing in Christ, serving the church, and blessing the world.

The Bible and Global Tourism,"James S. Bielo, Lieke Wijnia",Bloomsbury Publishing,2021-01-14,"This volume examines the ways in which biblical tourism is enmeshed within the production and management of heritage, global contexts of marketing and publicity, accessibility of sacred sites and routes for multiple audiences, and the forging of connections between travel and social identity. By exploring issues such as devotional piety, religious pedagogy, and entertainment, an interdisciplinary collection of scholars traces how biblical tourism experiences are choreographed and consumed, and how these practices shape embodied and narrative performances of scripture. Contributors focus on four major questions: How have people used tourism to develop new, or renewed, relationships with the Bible? Historically, what role has the Bible played in the development of modern tourism? In the context of the tourist encounter, how have people mobilized the Bible as a social and expressive resource? And what forms of social exchange shape acts of biblical tourism, such as among pilgrims, or between people and landscapes? These questions are centered not only around authorized shrines and “Holy Places,” but also festivals, museums, theme parks, and heritage sites. This book aims to create a comparative and interdisciplinary dialogue around the dynamic relationship between biblical heritage claims and the practices and infrastructures of modern tourism.",Religion,285,N/A,0,en

"Reading Bibles, Writing Bodies","Timothy K. Beal, David Gunn",Routledge,2002-06,"The Bible is often said to be one of the foundation texts of Western culture. The present volume shows that it goes far beyond being a religious text. The essays explore how religious, political and cultural identities, including ethnicity and gender, are embodied in biblical discourse. Following the authors, we read the Bible with new eyes: as a critic of gender, ideology, politics and culture. We ask ourselves new questions: about God's body, about women's role, about racial prejudices and about the politics of the written word. Reading Bibles, Writing Bodies crosses boundaries. It questions our most fundamental assumptions about the Bible. It shows how biblical studies can benefit from the mainstream of Western intellectual discourse, throwing up entirely new questions and offering surprising answers. Accessible, engaging and moving easily between theory and the reading of specific texts, this volume is an exciting contribution to contemporary biblical and cultural studies.",History,313,N/A,0,en

David Pawson investigates this through biblical evidence, historical figures such as Augustine, Luther and Wesley, and evangelical assumptions about grace and justification, divine sovereignty and human responsibility. He asks whether something more than being born again is required so that our inheritance is not lost. This book helps us decide whether ‘once saved, always saved’ is real assurance or a misleading assumption. The answer will have profound effects on the way we live and disciple others.",Religion,189,N/A,0,en

The Bible and Science,Vincent Smiles,Liturgical Press,2011-06-01,"Confusing paradox surrounds the Bible. Some look to it as the definition of reality and deny science; others see science alone as the arbiter of truth and deny the Bible. Both extremes are merely symptoms of a still wider debate on the place of ancient spiritual wisdom in a science-dominated world. Following the Reformation and Enlightenment, the Western world gained great power but lost its spiritual bearings. This book draws on numerous sources, ancient and modern, to examine what the missteps were that have brought us to a point of such confusion, and in doing so argues cogently against the modern philosophy of scientific materialism. With the aid of biblical stories and imagery it suggests how we might find our way back to balance, where ancient wisdom and modern science can together shed light on humans and their encompassing reality.

Classical historians and theologians will not entertain any connection between the two, because this infers that the Israelite leaders were actually pharaohs of Egypt. However, Ralph Ellis has taken this obvious comparison and demonstrated the royal Egyptian ancestry of the Judaic patriarchs and also of Jesus. Ralph has also uncovered evidence for the New Testament Saul (St Paul) in the historical record, a discovery that brings with it several new accounts of the life of Jesus. Saul, the inventor of Christianity, was actually Josephus Flavius, a well-known historian. Jesus was the governor of Tiberias and owned a castle there; and he may have died during the siege of Jerusalem in about AD70, rather than AD 33 - crucified along with two of his compatriots.

The Westminster Study Bible,Westminster John Knox Press,Presbyterian Publishing Corp,2024-10-01,"The Westminster Study Bible (WSB) is the first entirely new study Bible to utilize the recently released New Revised Standard Version Updated Edition. Soon to be an essential tool for all religious studies contexts, The Westminster Study Bible includes interpretive materials from over eighty leading biblical experts who, as teachers in a variety of educational settings, are sensitive to how the biblical texts have been received, what their cultural and social consequences have been, and how readers might hear them now in multiple contexts. The Westminster Study Bible also pays close attention to the interdisciplinary connections that contemporary students, teachers, and other readers from diverse backgrounds will find both useful and relevant. It is an ideal textbook for a range of biblical studies courses, as well as courses in religion, philosophy, and the general humanities, whether introductory or advanced. The Westminster Study Bible's emphasis on the cultural framing of the Bible's theological, historical, literary, and philosophical elements allows it to be useful beyond the university and seminary classrooms, aiding teachers in religious congregations and organizations with their ministries as well. Reading and engaging the Bible today is not as simple as discovering what it meant in its time in order to determine what it means for all time. All readers—whether students or instructors, clergy or general readers, religious or nonreligious—bring their own perspectives to the interpretation of the Bible. The themes and ideas that matter to twenty-first-century readers tend to resonate with our present situations in some way. The Westminster Study Bible takes this interactive dynamic between historical and contemporary interpretations seriously. Through study notes, thematic excursuses, and a range of illuminating essays, The Westminster Study Bible delves into the ancient contexts of the Bible, its continually evolving interpretations, and its contemporary reading and reception, critically exploring both the worlds of the text and the worlds of its many readers today.

Shocked, Ivy seeks clues to her past, but a key piece to the mystery is missing. Twenty-four years earlier, Harvey James finds an abandoned newborn who gives him a sense of human connection for the first time in his life.

The Cheque Books of the Chapel Royal,"William Lovegrove, John Harley, Andrew Ashbee, Marmaduke Alford",Routledge,2020-08-13,"This title was first published in 2000: The Chapel Royal holds a singular position in English ecclesiastical and musical life, as a body of priests and musicians appointed by and serving the personal religious needs of the sovereign. Its historical significance owes much to its location at a court which was, for many centuries, the centre of national power and culture. It was both an instrument and a visible manifestation of policy, and its history can be seen as reflecting the fortunes of government. While its origins are lost, its growth and membership become increasingly apparent from the 13th century and can be traced in detail from the 16th century. Chief among the documents which provide evidence of the Chapel's development and administration are the two surviving Cheque Books, preserved in the Archive of the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace. These cover a period from Queen Elizabeth I to Queen Victoria (with a few additional later entries). The ""Old"" Cheque Book has been widely used by scholars since an edition was published by Edward F. Rimbault in 1872.",Social Science,326,N/A,0,en

When Life and Beliefs Collide,Carolyn Custis James,Zondervan,2010-02-23,"In Praise of When Life and Beliefs Collide.Sooner or later, life’s difficulties bring every Christian woman to God’s doorstep with questions too personal to ignore. “Why does God let me go through such painful circumstances?” “Why does he seem indifferent to my prayers?” We’re tired of spiritual pie in the sky. We want authentic, God-as-he-really-is faith—the kind that holds us together when our world is falling apart and equips us to offer strength and hope to others.When Life and Beliefs Collide raises a long-overdue call for us to think seriously about what we believe about God. With passion, brilliance, and eloquence, Carolyn Custis James weaves stories of contemporary women with episodes from the life of Mary of Bethany to illustrate the practical benefits of knowing God deeply. Examining the misperceptions and abuses that discourage women from pursuing a deeper understanding of God, this insightful book demonstrates how practical and down to earth knowing God can be.“This outstanding book offers the best demonstration that everyone needs theology, the best expository account of Mary and Martha, and the best trajectory for women’s ministry in modern North America that I have yet read.” —James I.

The Old Testament Canon of the New Testament Church,Roger T. Beckwith,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2008-11-01,"This new study of the Old Testament canon by Roger Beckwith is on a scale to match H. E. Ryle's classic work, which was first published in 1892. But Beckwith has the advantage of writing after the Qumran (and other) discoveries; and he has also made full use of all the available sources, including biblical manuscripts and rabbinical and patristic literature, taking into account the seldom studied Syriac material as well as the Greek and Latin material. The result of many years of study, this book is a major work of scholarship on a subject which has been neglected in recent times. It is both historical and theological, but Beckwith's first consideration has been to make a thorough and unprejudiced historical investigation. One of his most important concerns - and one that is crucial for all students of Judaism, and Christians in particular - is to decide when the limits of the Jewish canon were settled. In the answer to this question lies an important key to the teaching of Jesus and his apostles, and the resultant beliefs of the New Testament church. Furthermore, any answers to questions about the state of the canon in the New Testament period would help to open a way through the present ecumenical (and interfaith) impasse on the subject. With its meticulous research and evenhanded approach, this book is sure to become the starting point for study of the Old Testament canon in the years to come.",Religion,545,N/A,0,en

The Rise and Fall of the Bible,Timothy Beal,HMH,2011-02-16,"A professor of religion offers an “engrossing and excellent” look at how the Good Book has changed—and changed the world—through the ages (Publishers Weekly, starred review). In a lively journey from early Christianity to the present, this book explores how a box of handwritten scrolls became the Bible, and how the multibillion-dollar business that has brought us Biblezines and Manga Bibles is selling down the Book’s sacred capital. Showing us how a single official text was created from the proliferation of different scripts, Timothy Beal traces its path as it became embraced as the word of God and the Book of books. Christianity thrived for centuries without any Bible—there was no official canon of scriptures, much less a book big enough to hold them all. Congregations used various collections of scrolls and codices. As the author reveals, there is no “original” Bible, no single source text behind the thousands of different editions on the market today. The farther we go back in the holy text’s history, the more versions we find. In calling for a fresh understanding of the ways scriptures were used in the past, the author of Biblical Literacy offers the chance to rediscover a Bible, and a faith, that is truer to its own history—not a book of answers, but a library of questions.",Religion,261,3,1,en

Constantine's Bible,David L. Dungan,Fortress Press,2007,"Most college and seminary courses on the New Testament include discussions of the process that gave shape to the New Testament. David Dungan re-examines the primary source for the history, the Ecclesiastical History of the fourth-century Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea, in the light of Hellenistic political thought. He reaches new conclusions: that we usually use the term ""canon"" incorrectly; that the legal imposition of a ""canon"" or ""rule"" upon scripture was a fourth- and fifth-century phenomenon enforced with the power of the Roman imperial government; that the forces shaping the New Testament canon are much earlier than the second-century crisis occasioned by Marcion, and that they are political forces. Dungan discusses how the scripture selection process worked, book-by-book, as he examines the criteria used-and not used-to make these decisions. He describes the consequences of the emperor Constantine's tremendous achievement in transforming orthodox, Catholic Christianity into imperial Christianity. --From publisher's description.",Religion,248,4.5,2,en

Lay Bibles in Europe 1450-1800,"Mathijs Lamberigts, A. A. den Hollander",Peeters Publishers,2006,"This volume contains the proceedings of an international conference entitled Lay Bibles in Europe 1450-1800. The conference took place in Amsterdam in April 2004 and was organized by Biblia sacra, a joint Dutch-Flemish research group. The clamor for Bibles in the vernacular flourished within lay renewal movements of the late 14th century, including groups like the Brethren and Sisters of the Common Life. In the early 16th century, humanists like Erasmus and Lefvre d'taples stimulated vernacular Bible reading. As the Protestant Reformation became established, lay Bibles were produced on a large scale. In reaction to this development, Catholic theologians issued 'orthodox' Bible translations in various vernaculars based on the Vulgate. In sum, from the 15th to the 18th century, editions from various confessional or ideological backgrounds appeared throughout Western Europe. Of course, the invention and spread of the printing press greatly enhanced the distribution of these editions. The essays collected in this volume approach Lay Bibles in Europe 1450-1800 from various perspectives, including the history of books, art history and church history.",Bibles,382,N/A,0,en

The Great Poems of the Bible,James L. Kugel,Simon and Schuster,2012-04-24,"From the Psalms to the Prophets, from job to Ecclesiastes, much of the Bible is written in poetry. The poems of the Bible include some of its best known and most beloved passages: ""The Lord is my shepherd,"" ""Let justice roll down like waters,"" ""By the rivers of Babylon,"" ""Remember your Creator,"" ""Arise, shine, for thy light is come!"" These poems live in the hearts of those who are familiar with the Bible and offer rich rewards to anyone who is approaching the world's greatest book for the first time. In The Great Poems of the Bible, Harvard scholar James Kugel presents original translations of the most beautiful and important poems of the Scripture. Taken together, these poems represent the very essence of the Hebrew Bible. Reading them one after another is like taking a guided tour through Scripture, meeting firsthand some of its most important teachings and opening the way to an understanding of the Bible as a whole. Each poem is accompanied by an eloquent and accessible explanation of the poem's language, and a reflection on its meaning. These learned, compact essays introduce readers to the broader spiritual world of ancient Israel. What did people in biblical times believe about God? Where is a person's soul located and what does it do? Is there an afterlife? How does one come to ""know"" God? Why wasn't Eve meant to be Adam's ""helpmate"" (Kugel shows how this was just a translator's slip-up), and what does the Bible have to say about the role of women? Kugel's sparkling translations of the poems, together with the fascinating insights that accompany them, distill the very best that the Bible and modern scholarship have to offer. Kugel brings new life to some of history's greatest poems, and offers a new look at a Bible we thought we already knew. Here, in one volume, is a ""Bible's bible"" that belongs in every home.",Religion,354,N/A,0,en

Menstruation and Procreation in Early Modern France,Cathy McClive,Routledge,2016-03-03,"Early modern bodies, particularly menstruating and pregnant bodies, were not stable signifiers. Menstruation and Procreation in Early Modern France presents the first full-length discussion of menstruation and its uncertain connections with embodied sex, gender and reproduction in early modern France. Attitudes to menstruation are explored in three inter-linked arenas: medicine, moral theology and law across the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries. Drawing on a wide range of diverse sources, including court records and private documents, the author uses case studies to explore the relationship between the exceptional corporeality of individuals and attempts to construct menstrual norms, reflecting on how early modern individuals, lay or otherwise, grappled with the enigma of menstruation. She analyzes how early modern men and women accounted for the function, recurrence and appearance of menstruation, from its role in maintaining health to the link between other physiological and bodily processes, including those found in both male and female bodies. She questions the assumption that menstruation was exclusively associated with women by the second half of the eighteenth century, arguing that whilst sex-related, menstruation was not sex-specific even at the turn of the nineteenth. Menstruation remains a contentious topic today. This book is not, therefore, simply a study of periods in early modern France, but is also of necessity an exploration about the nature and constitution of historical evidence, particularly bodily evidence and how historians use this evidence. It raises important questions about the concept of certainty and about the value of observation, testimony, expertise, the nature of language and the construction of bodily truths - about the body as witness and the body as evidence.",History,320,N/A,0,en
A History of the Bible,John Barton,Viking Adult,2019,"The idea of the Bible as ""Holy Scripture,"" a non-negotiable authority straight from God, has prevailed in Western society for some time. And while it provides a firm foundation for centuries of Christian teaching, it denies the depth, variety, and richness of the text. Barton argues that the Bible is not a prescription to a complete, fixed religious system, but rather a product of a long and intriguing process which has inspired Judaism and Christianity, but still does not describe the whole of either religion. He argues that it must be read in its historical context-- from its beginnings in myth and folklore to its many interpretations throughout the centuries. -- adapted from jacket",Religion,642,N/A,0,en

"The Holy Bible ""Chronicle"" of Sequential Biblical Events",Robert Killian,AuthorHouse,2012-09,"Most of us have wondered, sometime during our lifetime, about when Adam and Eve were really ""expelled from paradise"" in the Garden of Eden. ""Can"" we find a verifiable and replicable answer to this question? Most of us have questioned, sometime during our lifetime, the ""accepted"" sequential biblical timeline of Archbishop James Ussher who claimed that 4004 BC was the actual date for that initial biblical event in our current holy scriptures. Was he right? Most of us have questioned, sometime in our lifetime, how the Hebrew's ""accepted"" claim that 3761 BC could be the actual date for Adam's ""expulsion."" Were they right? ""Can"" we find a way to reconstruct the complete Hebrew Bible timeline, from Adam's ""expulsion"" from paradise to our day? Is this possible? Who believes that it can be done? Well, it has been done! Here, is how it is done! To reconstruct the Hebrew Bible timeline, we need to know only the simple math formula that they used! The employment of this simple formula shall enable us to rebuild that same sequential biblical timeline, block by block, in the exact same fashion that the Jewish people ""use from the beginning,"" at Adam's ""expulsion"" from paradise, in the Garden of Eden. The formula used in reconstructing an ""actual count"" of the Hebrew Bible is found below: 7 7 = 49 10 = 490 10 = 4,900 solar years 7 7 = 49 + 1 = 50 10 = 500 10 = 5,000 lunar years Since both of these 49 solar, and 50 lunar, periods of time contain 18,200 days (approx), we can then ""post the number"" of any given sequential biblical event in its designated year position on a side-by-side comparison chart. If we ""post the number"" in this fashion, it will show us exactly when and where, on the timeline chart, there is an error in the sequential computations of any sequential biblical event that is propounded by any biblical chronologist, past or present! In this present book, we find that the Ussher biblical timeline is 112 years ""too early."" And the Hebrew biblical timeline of Codex Judaica is 131 years ""too late."" Obviously, 3892 BC is the only ""year number"" that can work for a verifiable timeline! This book, ""The Holy Bible ""Chronicle"" of Sequential Biblical Events,"" by Robert P. Killian, is the fruit of over seventy-year search for that verifiable and replicable answer to the long-sought question: ""Can the Ussher biblical timeline be trusted?""",Bible,439,N/A,0,en

The Bible and Modern British Drama,Mary F. Brewer,Routledge,2019-10-02,"The Bible and Modern British Drama: 1930 to the Present Day is the first full-length study to explore how playwrights in the modern period have adapted popular biblical stories, such as Abraham and Isaac, Moses and the Exodus from Egypt, and the life and death of Jesus, for the stage. The book offers detailed and accessible interpretations of the work of well-known dramatists such as Christopher Fry, Howard Brenton, and Steven Berkoff, alongside the work of writers whose plays have been neglected in recent criticism, such as James Bridie and Laurence Housman. The drama is analysed within the context of changes in religious belief and practice over the course of the modern period in Britain, comparing plays that approach the Bible from a traditional religious perspective with those that offer alternative viewpoints on the text, including the voices of gay, feminist, black, Jewish, and Muslim dramatists. In doing so, the author offers a broad and in-depth exploration that is grounded in current scholarship, ranging from the past to present, across boundaries of race and gender. Ideal for students, researchers, and general readers interested in understanding how the Bible has served as an important source text for British playwrights in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, The Bible and Modern British Drama shows how Bible-based drama has been influential in creating and disseminating ideas of what constitutes a ""good"" life, both on an individual and social level.",Drama,279,N/A,0,en

"The Oxford Handbook of the Bible in Early Modern England, C. 1530-1700","Kevin Killeen, Helen Smith, Rachel Willie",N/A,2015,"The Bible was, by any measure, the most important book in early modern England. It preoccupied the scholarship of the era, and suffused the idioms of literature and speech. Political ideas rode on its interpretation and deployed its terms. It was intricately related to the project of natural philosophy. And it was central to daily life at all levels of society from parliamentarian to preacher, from the 'boy that driveth the plough', famously invoked by Tyndale, to women across the social scale. It circulated in texts ranging from elaborate folios to cheap catechisms; it was mediated in numerous forms, as pictures, songs, and embroideries, and as proverbs, commonplaces, and quotations. Bringing together leading scholars from a range of fields, The Oxford Handbook of the Bible in Early Modern England, 1530-1700 explores how the scriptures served as a generative motor for ideas, and a resource for creative and political thought, as well as for domestic and devotional life. Sections tackle the knotty issues of translation, the rich range of early modern biblical scholarship, Bible dissemination and circulation, the changing political uses of the Bible, literary appropriations and responses, and the reception of the text across a range of contexts and media. Where existing scholarship focuses, typically, on Tyndale and the King James Bible of 1611, The Oxford Handbook of the Bible in England, 1530-1700 goes further, tracing the vibrant and shifting landscape of biblical culture in the two centuries following the Reformation.",Bibles,817,N/A,0,en

PostSecret,Frank Warren,Harper Collins,2005-11-29,"The project that captured a nation's imagination. The instructions were simple, but the results were extraordinary. ""You are invited to anonymously contribute a secret to a group art project. Your secret can be a regret, fear, betrayal, desire, confession, or childhood humiliation. Reveal anything -- as long as it is true and you have never shared it with anyone before. Be brief. Be legible. Be creative."" It all began with an idea Frank Warren had for a community art project. He began handing out postcards to strangers and leaving them in public places -- asking people to write down a secret they had never told anyone and mail it to him, anonymously. The response was overwhelming. The secrets were both provocative and profound, and the cards themselves were works of art -- carefully and creatively constructed by hand. Addictively compelling, the cards reveal our deepest fears, desires, regrets, and obsessions. Frank calls them ""graphic haiku,"" beautiful, elegant, and small in structure but powerfully emotional. As Frank began posting the cards on his website, PostSecret took on a life of its own, becoming much more than a simple art project. It has grown into a global phenomenon, exposing our individual aspirations, fantasies, and frailties -- our common humanity. Every day dozens of postcards still make their way to Frank, with postmarks from around the world, touching on every aspect of human experience. This extraordinary collection brings together the most powerful, personal, and beautifully intimate secrets Frank Warren has received -- and brilliantly illuminates that human emotions can be unique and universal at the same time.",Self-Help,290,N/A,0,en

Two principal objectives motivated the creation of the present volume of essays : first, to bring out the unequaled richness of these monastic customaries for scholars, primarily medievalists in all disciplines; and second, to facilitate the use of these sources, which can be challenging at first sight. Drawing upon the multiple disciplines needed to account for the full range of information presented by the customaries, the editors have brought together varied and complementary approaches to these multifaceted documents. Among the principal themes common to the studies in this volume are the genesis and transmission of the customaries, the relationship between texts and practice, and the evidence they offer for the function of monastic spaces as well as for the ritualization of communal life.",History,404,N/A,0,en

How to Read the Bible,James L. Kugel,Simon and Schuster,2012-05-01,"James Kugel’s essential introduction and companion to the Bible combines modern scholarship with the wisdom of ancient interpreters for the entire Hebrew Bible. As soon as it appeared, How to Read the Bible was recognized as a masterwork, “awesome, thrilling” (The New York Times), “wonderfully interesting, extremely well presented” (The Washington Post), and “a tour de force...a stunning narrative” (Publishers Weekly). Now, this classic remains the clearest, most inviting and readable guide to the Hebrew Bible around—and a profound meditation on the effect that modern biblical scholarship has had on traditional belief. Moving chapter by chapter, Harvard professor James Kugel covers the Bible’s most significant stories—the Creation of the world, Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah and the flood, Abraham and Sarah, Jacob and his wives, Moses and the exodus, David’s mighty kingdom, plus the writings of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and the other prophets, and on to the Babylonian conquest and the eventual return to Zion. Throughout, Kugel contrasts the way modern scholars understand these events with the way Christians and Jews have traditionally understood them. The latter is not, Kugel shows, a naïve reading; rather, it is the product of a school of sophisticated interpreters who flourished toward the end of the biblical period. These highly ideological readers sought to put their own spin on texts that had been around for centuries, utterly transforming them in the process. Their interpretations became what the Bible meant for centuries and centuries—until modern scholarship came along. The question that this book ultimately asks is: What now? As one reviewer wrote, Kugel’s answer provides “a contemporary model of how to read Sacred Scripture amidst the oppositional pulls of modern scholarship and tradition.”",Religion,850,N/A,0,en

The Uncensored Bible,"John Kaltner, Steven McKenzie, Joel Kilpatrick",Harper Collins,2008-06-10,"We all know the story of how Eve was created from Adam's rib. But what if, perhaps, ""rib"" was a mistranslation and the body part she was really created from was Adam's penis bone? This would explain why human males don't have such a bone, unlike other male mammals. That's only one of many surprising and fun biblical twists readers will encounter in The Uncensored Bible. Here readers will learn that King David swore like a sailor, mandrakes were the biblical equivalent of Viagra®, Cain was depressed, and Joseph's ""coat of many colors"" might have actually been a dress (which may explain why his brothers picked on him). Authors Kaltner, McKenzie, and Kilpatrick bring some of the most outrageous speculations about the scriptures to light—all based on legitimate scholarship—revealing a stranger, bawdier side of the Good Book.

Fathered by God,John Eldredge,Thomas Nelson,2009-04-20,"In an age when fathers are more important than ever, how do you embark on your journey to manhood and know how to steer clear of the dangers along the way? In Fathered by God, New York Times bestselling author John Eldredge reminds us that there's a path to masculinity and, best of all, there's a loving Father ready to help us follow it. In Fathered by God, Eldredge calls men back to a simple and reassuring truth: God is our Father, and he wants to show us what masculinity really means. Eldredge teaches us that there's a path leading to authentic manhood, cut by generation after generation of men. There are perils along the trail, even disasters--all the more reason to rely on the guidance of a Father who has gone before us. A boy has a lot to learn in his journey to becoming a man, and it takes the active intervention of father figures and the fellowship of other men to guide us along the way. Eldredge shares that in all of life's trials and triumphs, God is initiating boys and men through the stages of manhood. Through personal stories and practical guidance, Eldredge provides a map through the six stages of a man's journey and answers some of the most common questions about manhood that he's received over the years, including: How can I set a good example for my son? What does the Bible teach us about masculinity? How can I become the man that God designed me to be? Fathered by God maps out the path of manhood--not more rules, not another list of principles, not formulas, but a well-worn path that men have followed for centuries before us. Discover the truth about masculinity and become the man that God sees in you.",Religion,178,N/A,0,en

Perhaps the ESV or NASB will be best for you. The answer as to which Bible you should choose seems to be, ""It's up to you. Whatever flavor you want. They all say the same thing anyway!""Is this true? Are all Bibles the same? Are the differences trivial? Is it just about ""updating language"" and ""being more readable""?A little over a year ago I wrote a book called ""A Subtle Apostasy"". It is a more ""scholarly"" and ""in-depth"" book with the intention to fully expose the movement away from God's Word and the shaky foundation that modern versions stand upon.

He illuminates intriguing and amazing passages of the Bible that have been hiding in plain sight. You'll find yourself engaged in an enthusiastic pursuit of the truth, resulting in a new appreciation for God's Word. Why wasn't Eve surprised when the serpent spoke to her? How did descendants of the Nephilim survive the flood? Why did Jacob fuse Yahweh and his Angel together in his prayer? Who are the assembly of divine beings that God presides over? In what way do those beings participate in God's decisions? Why do Peter and Jude promote belief in imprisoned spirits? Why does Paul describe evil spirits in terms of geographical rulership? Who are the ""glorious ones"" that even angels dare not rebuke? After reading this book, you may never read your Bible the same way again. Endorsements ""There is a world referred to in the Scripture that is quite unseen, but also quite present and active. Michael Heiser's The Unseen Realm seeks to unmask this world. Heiser shows how important it is to understand this world and appreciate how its contribution helps to make sense of Scripture. The book is clear and well done, treating many ideas and themes that often go unseen themselves. With this book, such themes will no longer be neglected, so read it and discover a new realm for reflection about what Scripture teaches."" --Darrell L. Bock, Executive Director for Cultural Engagement, Senior Research Professor of New Testament Studies, Howard G.

Following the authors, we read the Bible with new eyes: as a critic of gender, ideology, politics, and culture. We ask ourselves new questions: about God's body, about women's roles, about racial prejudices and about the politics of the written word.",History,316,N/A,0,en

The Jewish Novel in the Ancient World,Lawrence M. Wills,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2015-03-11,"Lawrence M. Wills here traces the literary evolution of popular Jewish narratives written during the period 200 BCE-100 CE. In many ways, these narratives were similar to Greek and Roman novels of the same era, as well as to popular novels of indigenous peoples within the Roman Empire. Yet, as a group, they demonstrated a variety of novelistic innovations: the inclusion of adventurous episodes, passages of description and of dialogue, concern with psychological motivation, and the introduction of female characters. Wills focuses on five novels: Greek Esther, Greek Daniel, Judith, Tobit, and Joseph and Aseneth. Drawing on a wide range of theoretical works, he delineates the techniques and motifs of the Jewish novel, shows how the genre both initiated and distanced itself from nonfictional prose such as historical and philosophical writing, discusses its relation to Greco-Roman romance, and describes the social conditions governing its emergence and reception. Wills also places the novels in historical context, situating them between the Hebrew Bible, on the one hand, and subsequent developments in Jewish and Christian literature on the other. Wills sees the Jewish novel as a popular form of writing that provided amusement for an expanding audience of Jewish entrepreneurs, merchants, and bureaucrats. In an important sense, he maintains, it was a product of the ""novelistic impulse"": the impulse to transfer oral stories to a written medium to reach a more literate audience.",Religion,294,N/A,0,en

The Lives of Objects,Maia Kotrosits,University of Chicago Press,2020-09-07,"Our lives are filled with objects—ones that we carry with us, that define our homes, that serve practical purposes, and that hold sentimental value. When they are broken, lost, left behind, or removed from their context, they can feel alien, take on a different use, or become trash. The lives of objects change when our relationships to them change. Maia Kotrosits offers a fresh perspective on objects, looking beyond physical material to consider how collective imagination shapes the formation of objects and the experience of reality. Bringing a psychoanalytic approach to the analysis of material culture, she examines objects of attachment—relationships, ideas, and beliefs that live on in the psyche—and illustrates how people across time have anchored value systems to the materiality of life. Engaging with classical studies, history, anthropology, and literary, gender, and queer studies, Kotrosits shows how these disciplines address historical knowledge and how an expanded definition of materiality can help us make connections between antiquity and the contemporary world.",Religion,252,N/A,0,en

The HarperCollins Study Bible,"Harold W. Attridge, Society of Biblical Literature",HarperOne,2006-08-22,"The landmark general reference Bible that offers the full text of the New Revised Standard Version, now completely revised and updated by leading biblical scholars, including, new introductions and notes, diagrams, charts and maps––25% revised or new material. After 10 years of new archeological discoveries and changes in biblical studies, it was time for an overhaul of this classic reference work. With the guidance of the Society of Biblical Literature, an organization of the best biblical scholars world wide, we have selected Dean of Yale Divinity School, Harold Attridge, to oversee the Study Bible's updating and revision. • The fundamental strengths of the first HCSB remain . . . up–to–date introductions to the Biblical books, based on the latest critical scholarship, by leading experts in the field concise notes, clearly explaining names, dates, places, obscure terms, and other difficulties in reading the Biblical text careful analysis of the structure of Biblical books abundant maps, tables, and charts to enable the reader to understand the context of the Bible, and to see the relationship among its parts. • But, in this new revised edition . . . Every introduction, essay, map, illustration and explanatory note has been reviewed and updated, and new material added. For instance, There are newly commissioned introductory essays on the archaeology of ancient Israel and the New Testament world, the religion of ancient Israel, the social and historical context of each book of the Bible, and on Biblical interpretation There are completely new introductions and notes for many of the books in the Bible, plus a full revision and updating of all others. Of special interest are: The literary history of the Pentateuch (those books between the Old and New Testament that Catholics include in their Bible) More references to ancient non–Biblical sources which seem to parallel books in the Bible like the Gnostic gospels uncovered in Egypt or the famous scrolls found near the Dead Sea in Israel.

Strange and Mysterious Stuff from the Bible,Stephen M. Miller,Harvest House Publishers,2014-09-01,"Stephen Miller, bestselling author of Complete Guide to the Bible and Who’s Who and Where’s Where in the Bible, compares reading the Bible to driving a country road. “We’re cruising along reading a fine little story when suddenly we hit a jaw dropper of a narrative pothole. Right out loud we might say, ‘What on earth is this doing in God’s holy Word?’” You can’t read far in the Bible without being jolted by an account of polygamy, slavery, or gender inequality. Other stories read almost like comedies—like the one about a dead man springing to life when his corpse touches a prophet’s bones. How do you face these things honestly? With a touch of dry humor, Miller identifies bumps in the road, briefly offers popular interpretations, and leaves you with food for thought. This is a fast-paced, fun, and reliable guide for your tour through the Bible.",Religion,226,N/A,0,en

The Bible's Cutting Room Floor,Joel M. Hoffman,Macmillan,2014-09-02,"There’s more to the story: A scholar and translator reveals the history of the Bible—and the parts that were left out, by accident or design. The Bible you usually read is not the complete story: Some holy writings were left out for political or theological reasons, others simply because of the physical restrictions of ancient bookmaking technology. At times, the compilers of the Bible skipped information that they assumed everyone knew. Some passages were even omitted by accident. In The Bible’s Cutting Room Floor, acclaimed translator Dr. Joel M. Hoffman gives us the stories and other texts that didn’t make it into the Bible even though they offer penetrating insight into the Bible and its teachings. The Book of Genesis tells us about Adam and Eve’s time in the Garden of Eden, but not their saga after they get kicked out or the lessons they have for us about good and evil. The Bible introduces us to Abraham, but it doesn’t include the troubling story of his early life, which explains how he came to reject idolatry to become the father of monotheism. And while there are only 150 Psalms in today’s Bible, there used to be many more. Dr. Hoffman deftly brings these and other ancient scriptural texts to life, exploring how they offer new answers to some of the most fundamental and universal questions people ask about their lives. An impressive blend of history, linguistics, and religious scholarship, The Bible’s Cutting Room Floor reveals what’s missing from your Bible, who left it out, and why it is so important. “Hoffman also provides an accessible and entertaining history of the context in which the ‘rejected’ works arose, a fascinating account of how the Dead Sea Scrolls came to light in the mid-20th century (and what they include), an analysis of Josephus’s contributions to history, and the relationship between the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Bible) and the Hebrew Scriptures.” —Publishers Weekly “A wonderful book to confirm the beliefs of the faithful, to strengthen those whose faith begs for more information and to enlighten those who reject the stories of the Bible as mere fiction.” —Kirkus Reviews",Religion,266,N/A,0,en

The Bible Doesn't Say That,Joel M. Hoffman,Macmillan,2016-02-16,"A “witty and accessible look at Scripture” that explores what the Bible meant before two millennia of mistranslations and misinterpretations (Publishers Weekly, starred review). In this fascinating book, acclaimed translator and biblical scholar Dr. Joel M. Hoffman walks the reader through dozens of mistranslations, misconceptions, and other misunderstandings about the Bible. In forty short, straightforward chapters, he covers morality, lifestyle, theology, and biblical imagery, including: The Bible doesn’t call homosexuality a sin, and doesn’t advocate for the one-man-one-woman model of the family that has been dubbed “biblical.” The Bible’s famous “beat their swords into plowshares” is matched by the militaristic “beat your plowshares into swords.” The often-cited New Testament quotation “God so loved the world” is a mistranslation, as are the titles “Son of Man” and “Son of God.” The Ten Commandments don’t prohibit killing or coveting. What does the Bible say about violence? About the Rapture? About keeping kosher? About marriage and divorce? Hoffman provides answers to all of these and more, succinctly explaining how so many pivotal biblical answers came to be misunderstood.",Religion,280,2.5,2,en

With insights into the biblical text drawn from decades of experience studying, preaching, and teaching Scripture, Piper helps us experience the transformative power of God's Word—a power that extends beyond the mere words on the page. Ultimately, Piper shows us that in the seemingly ordinary act of reading the Bible, something supernatural happens: we encounter the living God.",Religion,364,N/A,0,en

Made to Crave Devotional,Lysa TerKeurst,Thomas Nelson,2012-01-21,"Most of us know “how to” get healthy. Where things often fall apart is with our “want to.” In Lysa TerKeurst’s book Made to Crave, she helps women find the missing link between our desire to be healthy and the spiritual empowerment necessary to make that happen. But when French fries are so close and God feels so far away, we need more than nineteen chapters to stay motivated and on track. That’s why Lysa wrote this daily devotional with sixty inspirational entries. There is plenty of new material not in the original book, as well as your favorite nuggets of wisdom from Made to Crave. In this devotional you will find: A daily opening Scripture Thought for the Day Devotion Closing prayer Just like the Made to Crave book, this Made to Crave Devotional is not a how-to-get-healthy book. It is the road to finding the lasting “want to” that extends far beyond the surface issues of weighing less and wanting to wear a smaller clothes size. There’s a spiritual battle going on. It’s real.

The Holy Bible; What's In It for Me?,Eva M. Walters,Author House,2005-01-18,"Someone Asked, “what is the title of your book?” The response was, “The Holy Bible: Whats In It For Me?” “That’s easy”, he said, “Life”! It was obvious this person had found life fulfilled to the fullest from reading, listening, or studying the Word of God. Jesus said in Luke 11:28 “Blessed are they that hear the Word of God and keep it”. And in the Book of Revelation 1:3, “Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words, and keep those things which are written therein....” We firmly believe that the Holy Bible has within it the answers to the problems of life that concern us as individuals. While we may listen to the success stories of others, yet we ourselves face unresolved issues which become problems in our own lives on a daily basis. And so we ask, “what about me?” We must be made aware that the Holy Bible addresses your personal problem. The purpose of this book is to answer your question, “What’s in it for me”? Indeed, it calls our attention to things we need to know about living the abundant life in Christ Jesus – a life of love, joy, and peace in this world and in the world to come. No matter what your circumstances may be, God’s got the answer, and you will find it in his Word.",Religion,51,N/A,0,en

Jubilee Bible,Russell M. Stendal,Aneko Press,2014-10-15,"In the Jubilee Bible 2000 (JUB), the usage and context tends to define each key word so you don't need to depend on theological dictionaries or reference materials. Careful attention has been made to properly translate the first usage of each key word and through to the last occurrence. Then, as the word makes its way across the Old Testament and you make the correct match with the corresponding Greek word in the New Testament, an amazing pattern emerges. The Jubilee Bible is the only translation we know of that has each unique Hebrew word matched and mated with a unique English word so that the usage (number of occurrences and number of verses where the word occurs) sets forth a meaningful number pattern and a complete definition of what God means by each word.",Bibles,1152,N/A,0,en

Ancient Israel: What Do We Know and How Do We Know It?,Lester L. Grabbe,Bloomsbury Publishing,2017-02-23,"In Ancient Israel Lester L. Grabbe sets out to summarize what we know through a survey of sources and how we know it by a discussion of methodology and by evaluating the evidence. The most basic question about the history of ancient Israel, how do we know what we know, leads to the fundamental questions of Grabbe's work: what are the sources for the history of Israel and how do we evaluate them? How do we make them 'speak' to us through the fog of centuries? Grabbe focuses on original sources, including inscriptions, papyri, and archaeology. He examines the problems involved in historical methodology and deals with the major issues surrounding the use of the biblical text when writing a history of this period. Ancient Israel provides an enlightening overview and critique of current scholarly debate. It can therefore serve as a 'handbook' or reference-point for those wanting a catalogue of original sources, scholarship, and secondary studies. Grabbe's clarity of style makes this book eminently accessible not only to students of biblical studies and ancient history but also to the interested lay reader. For this new edition the entire text has been reworked to take account of new archaeological discoveries and theories. There is a major expansion to include a comprehensive coverage of David and Solomon and more detailed information on specific kings of Israel throughout. Grabbe has also added material on the historicity of the Exodus, and provided a thorough update of the material on the later bronze age.",Religion,394,N/A,0,en

What is Reformed Theology?,R. C. Sproul,Baker Books,2016-09-13,"What Do the Five Points of Calvinism Really Mean? Many have heard of Reformed theology, but may not be certain what it is. Some references to it have been positive, some negative. It appears to be important, and they'd like to know more about it. But they want a full, understandable explanation, not a simplistic one. What Is Reformed Theology? is an accessible introduction to beliefs that have been immensely influential in the evangelical church. In this insightful book, R. C. Sproul walks readers through the foundations of the Reformed doctrine and explains how the Reformed belief is centered on God, based on God's Word, and committed to faith in Jesus Christ. Sproul explains the five points of Reformed theology and makes plain the reality of God's amazing grace.",Religion,254,N/A,0,en

The Best Yes,Lysa TerKeurst,Thomas Nelson,2014-08-19,"Are you tired of living with the stress of an overwhelmed schedule and aching with the sadness of an underwhelmed soul? Do you find yourself unable to say no even when you should? Are you stuck under the weight of endless demands and responsibilities? The good news is: it doesn't have to be this way. In The Best Yes, New York Times bestselling author Lysa TerKeurst guides you through the insightful lessons she's learned about what it means to live out the purpose that God has in store for you. Lysa demonstrates the incredible power of two words--yes and no--and the way that these simple, daily decisions can shape the story of our lives. Lysa has learned firsthand that there's a big difference between saying yes to everyone and saying yes to God. Drawing from applicable scriptures and her own personal experiences, Lysa teaches us that if we know and believe that God has a plan for each of us, we'll live it out--serving as living proof of His never-ending grace and kindness. Throughout The Best Yes, Lysa will give you the practical tools you need to: Stop people-pleasing by embracing a biblical understanding of love Escape the guilt of disappointing others by learning the secret of the small no Overcome the agony of hard choices by grounding your decisions in wisdom Grow closer to God as you sharpen your own discernment Learn to be intentional with your time, your choices, and yourself Incorporate the Best Yes as a filter for your daily decision making If we take time to slow down and rise above the rush of the world's endless demands, we can rest assured that God's wisdom will help us make decisions that will still be good tomorrow.

Gospelbound,"Collin Hansen, Sarah Eekhoff Zylstra",Multnomah,2021-04-06,"A profound exploration of how to hold on to hope when our unchanging faith collides with a changing culture, from two respected Christian storytellers and thought leaders. “Offers neither spin control nor image maintenance for the evangelical tribe, but genuine hope.”—Russell Moore, president of ERLC As the pressures of health warnings, economic turmoil, and partisan politics continue to rise, the influence of gospel-focused Christians seems to be waning. In the public square and popular opinion, we are losing our voice right when it’s needed most for Christ’s glory and the common good. But there’s another story unfolding too—if you know where to look. In Gospelbound, Collin Hansen and Sarah Eekhoff Zylstra counter these growing fears with a robust message of resolute hope for anyone hungry for good news. Join them in exploring profound stories of Christians who are quietly changing the world in the name of Jesus—from the wild world of digital media to the stories of ancient saints and unsung contemporary activists on the frontiers of justice and mercy.

Idioms in the Bible Explained and a Key to the Original Gospels,George M. Lamsa,Harper Collins,2013-04-02,"Explanations of nearly 1,000 ancient idioms, metaphors, and figures of speech in the Old and New Testaments, from a renowned Bible translator. George M. Lamsa, who was raised speaking Aramaic in a community that followed customs largely unchanged since the times of Christ, offers accurate translations of important idioms, metaphors, and figures of speech found in the Scripture—and provides clear explanations of their meaning in biblical context. Just as Shakespeare, Milton, and Browning wrote in the vernacular for English-speaking people, Moses, the prophets, and the apostles wrote for their own people in the plain language of their times, so that even the unlearned might understand God’s Word. Over the centuries, inaccurate translations and misunderstandings of customs and concepts have led to difficulties in bringing the biblical message to contemporary English-speaking readers. For example, when a man says to Jesus, “let me bury my father,” Lamsa points out that this expression means, “Let me first take care of my father until he dies.” Traditionally, scholars assumed that this man’s father was dead and that Jesus was not interested in his burial. Lamsa's scholarship offers a more accurate understanding of the intent and spirit of this passage. Idioms in the Bible Explained and a Key to the Original Gospels goes far in correcting such errors that have crept into Biblical scholarship. Obscure and difficult passages from both Old and New Testaments are listed and compared with the King James version (though it will be helpful when used with any English version). These make clear the original meaning of such ancient idioms and assure that our grasp of the biblical message is more sound and rewarding. To further uncover the original teachings of Scripture, Lamsa discusses at greater length such topics as “The Language of Jesus,” “Aramaic Phraseology,” “The Sayings of Jesus,” “Early Translations,” and more.",Religion,152,N/A,0,en
"A New English Translation of the Septuagint, and Other Greek Translations Traditionally Included Under that Title",,"Oxford University Press, USA",2000,"Only two English translations of the Septuagint have ever been published, both more than 150 years ago. Since that time, significant advances have been made in Greek lexicography, numerous ancient manuscripts have come to light, and important steps have been taken in recovering the pristine text of each Septuagint book. Therefore, a new translation of the Septuagint into English is not only much needed, but long overdue. The goal of A New English Translation of the Septuagint (NETS) is to provide readers with an Old Testament freshly translated from the ancient Greek text. This volume of the Psalms of the Septuagint (the first part of the project) includes footnotes calling attention to relevant textual issues. In addition, the committee of translators has provided an extensive introduction to the project as a whole and to the particular issues involved in the rendering of the Psalms into English.",Bibles,198,N/A,0,en

The Hebrew Bible for Beginners,"Dr. Joel N. Lohr, Dr. Joel S. Kaminsky",Abingdon Press,2015-09-15,"Jews call the Hebrew Scriptures the “Tanakh” and Christians call them the “Old Testament.” It doesn't take long to see that Jews and Christians view the same set of books differently and interpret these scriptures in unique and at times conflicting ways. The Hebrew Bible for Beginners introduces students to the tremendous influence the Hebrew Bible has had on western society for over two millennia and explores the complexities of reading ancient religious literature today. The book also addresses how certain modern critical approaches may initially be alarming, indeed even shocking, to those who have not been exposed to them, but it tackles the conversation in a respectful fashion. Avoiding jargon and convoluted prose, this highly accessible volume provides textboxes, charts, a timeline, a glossary, and regularly includes artistic renderings of biblical scenes to keep lay and beginning readers engaged.",Religion,381,N/A,0,en

Picturing Kingship,Harvey Stahl,Penn State University Press,2008,"Picturing Kingship presents the first comprehensive art-historical study of the personal prayerbook of King Louis IX. The book approaches the St. Louis Psalter through a rich range of perspectives and methodologies and positions it within the contexts of its production and use. Not only is the manuscript's production and structure given detailed study, but the king's ways of handling his prayerbook--his habits of reading, looking, and praying--are also set forth in a compelling narrative of his view of his sacred responsibilities as king. In the first half of the book, Stahl investigates the Psalter's physical construction and development within the context of manuscript production in thirteenth-century Paris. The second half looks at the Psalter's thematic and iconographic workings and the role of the king's adviser--Vincent of Beauvais--in the Psalter's shaping. Most important, though, the author delves into the meanings the Psalter might have held for the king, who was a crusader and so devout a Christian that he was canonized by Boniface VIII. Stahl makes it clear that the Psalter, already recognized as one of the true masterworks of thirteenth-century French culture, should also be recognized as a significant force in Louis IX's life and reign.",Art,474,N/A,0,en

Infant Milk Or Hardy Nourishment?,"Wim François, A. A. den Hollander",N/A,2009,"The Pauline expressions ""infant milk"" and ""hardy nourishment"" or ""solid food"" (cf. 1 Cor 3,2 and Heb 5,12-14) have frequently been used by the Church fathers, medieval preachers and early modern writers, to voice the contrasting opinions that the words of Scripture are either simple to understand for the uneducated laity, or only discernable for professional theologians. Hence, the present volume considers the place of the Scriptures in both lay spirituality and in theological thinking. It includes a wide range of articles, dealing with vernacular Bible translations intended for common people, visual Bible culture, Bible commentaries written by theologically and philologically skilled scholars, and other related topics. The essays have been arranged in a chronological order, and divided into three sections, the first part considering the period from 1450 to 1520. This period begins when the mediaeval production of Bible translations is at a peak, and when another readership, other than the clergy, has increasingly found its way to the Bible. The printing press, which makes an appearance at the time, provides an immediate response to this growing demand. During the same period, also in the north, we see the gradual rise of humanism, which for figures such as Erasmus and Lefevre d'Etaples, also entailed a great interest in the Bible sources (ad fontes). In 1519 Erasmus published his Novum Testamentum (a revised version of his 1516 Novum Instrumentum), providing from 1520 the basis for various vernacular Bible publications. His Paraphrases on diverse books of the New Testament also appealed to a broad reading public. The effects of this Biblical humanism provide the point of departure for the second part of this book. During the same decennia, through the influence of the Reformation and its sola scriptura principle, new translations became available. The response to this new Bible elan in Catholic circles was varied, from an absolute prohibition of Bible translation in the vernacular, to a cautious integration of a Biblical spirituality in teaching and preaching. The different contributions demonstrate how the religious diversity and plurality continues to expand in this period, with each group increasingly accentuating its own confessional identity. The way in which the Bible is dealt with reflects this process. In the seventeenth century, on which the third section of this book focuses, this evolution is pursued further. From the middle of this century however, an evolution takes place, with a growing number of exegetes taking a critical, scholarly attitude to the Bible, a development that is in an obvious relationship with the growing contemporary phenomenon of secularisation and rationalism. The present book will serve as a valuable companion to Lay Bibles in Europe 1450-1800 (eds. August den Hollander and Mathijs Lamberigts), the proceedings of the 2004 Amsterdam Conference with the same title, which has been published as volume 198 of the BETL-series.",History,514,N/A,0,en

Bible Reading in Sweden,Gunnar Hansson,N/A,1990,"The book summarizes results and conclusions from a number of studies within Project NT81 concerning the distribution and use of a new Bible translation in Sweden. The project was initiated by the Swedish Bible Society, and also by the Swedish Bible Commission which was appointed by the Government with the mandate to make a new translation of the Bible. The background of the project is presented from both the Society's and the Commission's point of view. Data concerning the distribution and reading of the Bible, based on socio-religious surveys among representative samples of the Swedish people and among significant groups like ministers, church-goers and regular Bible readers, are summarized in four chapters. In the comprehension part of the book there is a discussion of how the inspired meaning dimension can be included in empirical research, and a summary of results from a study of how groups of ordinary readers go about creating meaning from Bible texts and how they can make use of the notes and explanations included in the new translation. It also features results from a study of how readers in two congregations of different confessions use Bible texts and interpret them.",Religion,180,N/A,0,en

Delivered out of Empire,Walter Brueggemann,Westminster John Knox Press,2021-02-16,"The Pivotal Moments in the Old Testament Series helps readers see Scripture with new eyes, highlighting short, key texts—""pivotal moments""—that shift our expectations and invite us to turn toward another reality transformed by God's purposes and action. The book of Exodus brims with dramatic stories familiar to most of us: the burning bush, Moses' ringing proclamation to Pharaoh to ""Let my people go,"" the parting of the Red Sea. These signs of God's liberating agency have sustained oppressed people seeking deliverance over the ages. But Exodus is also a complex book. Reading the text firsthand, one encounters multilayered narratives: about entrenched socioeconomic systems that exploit the vulnerable, the mysterious action of the divine, and the giving of a new law meant to set the people of Israel apart. How does a contemporary reader make sense of it all? And what does Exodus have to say about our own systems of domination and economic excess? In Delivered out of Empire, Walter Brueggemann offers a guide to the first half of Exodus, drawing out ""pivotal moments"" in the text to help readers untangle it. Throughout, Brueggemann shows how Exodus consistently reveals a God in radical solidarity with the powerless.",Religion,115,N/A,0,en

From Daughters to Disciples,Lynn Japinga,Presbyterian Publishing Corp,2021-02-09,"For too long the women of the Bible have been depicted in one-dimensional terms. On one side are saints, such as Mary, while on the other are ""bad girls,"" such as Eve and Jezebel. Just as often, the female characters of the Bible are simply ignored. However, the women of the Bible are complex, multidimensional individuals whose lives are inspiring, funny, and tragic in ways too many of us never hear. In this second of two volumes, Lynn Japinga acquaints readers with the women of the New Testament. From faithful forerunners like Anna and Elizabeth to female disciples like the sisters Mary, Martha, and Mary Magdalene to first-generation followers like Lydia and Dorcas, readers will encounter a wealth of foremothers in the faith in all their messy, yet redeemable, humanity. This Bible study introduces and retells every female character who contributes to one or more New Testament stories, diving deeply into what each woman's story means for us today with questions for reflection and discussion.",Religion,242,N/A,0,en

The Canadian Oxford Dictionary,Katherine Barber,"Oxford University Press, USA",1998,"We all use Canadian English every day: when we order a pizza ""all-dressed"", hope to get a ""seat-sale"" to go south during ""March break"", or ""book off"" work to meet with a ""CGA"" to discuss ""RRSPs"". Language embodies our nation''s identity, and The Canadian Oxford Dictionary, in its 1,728 pages,covers all aspects of Canadian life. Never before have Canadians been able to see their language, and themselves, so accurately and comprehensively described in a dictionary. The loggers of the west coast, the wheat farmers of the Prairies, the fishermen of the Atlantic provinces, the trappers ofthe North; Canada''s Aboriginal peoples, its British and French settlers, and the more recent arrivals, whether they came from Ukraine, Italy, South Asia or elsewhere - all have contributed to making Canadian English unique, and the dictionary thus reflects the great sweep of Canadian life. Itcontains over 2,000 distinctly Canadian words and meanings, more than any other Canadian dictionary, covering every region of the country. Whether you call your favorite doughnut a jambuster, a bismark, a Burlington bun, or the more prosaic jelly doughnut may depend on where you live in Canada, butthey will all be found in The Canadian Oxford Dictionary. Of course, this is not just a dictionary of Canadian words: its 130,000 entries combine in one reference book information on English as it is used worldwide and as it is used particularly in Canada. Definitions, worded for ease ofcomprehension, are presented so the meaning most familiar to Canadians appears first and foremost. Each of these entries is exceptionally reliable, the result of thorough research into the language and Oxford''s unparalleled language resources. Five professionally trained lexicographers spent fiveyears examining databases containing over 20 million words of Canadian text from more than 8,000 Canadian sources of an astonishing diversity. Inuit Art Quarterly, The Fiddlehead, Canadian Business, and Equinox; the work of writers such as Jack Hodgins, Sandra Birdsell, David Adams Richards, andPierre Berton; daily and weekly newspapers from across the country; and, of course, the Canadian Tire catalogue - all find a place in the evidence of The Canadian Oxford Dictionary. The lexicographers also examined an additional 20 million words of international English sources. For many Canadiansone of the more puzzling aspects of writing is trying to determine whether to use the American spelling or the British spelling. Should it be ""colour"" or ""color"", ""theater"" or ""theatre"", ""programme"" or ""program""? By examining our extensive Canadian databases, our lexicographers have been able todetermine which, in fact, is the more common spelling: colour, theatre and program. Favoured Canadian pronunciations have also been determined by surveying a nationwide group of respondents. Oxford''s thorough research has also ensured that new words that have recently appeared are well-represented.So if you''re someone who puts on your ""bicycle shorts"" and ""blades"" over to the gym to do some ""crunches"" for your ""abs"" followed by work on your ""lats"", ""pecs"" and ""delts"", finishing up with a ""step"" class, because you''re afraid that being a ""chocoholic"" who loves ""comfort food"" will affect your""body mass index"" and you want to avoid ""yo-yo dieting"", you''ll find all these common words in The Canadian Oxford Dictionary. An added feature of this dictionary is its encyclopedic element. It includes short biographies of over 800 Canadians, ranging from Elvis Stojko, Celine Dion and JeanBeliveau to Nellie McClung, Lester B. Pearson, and Kim Campbell. It also contains entries on 5,000 individuals and mythical figures of international significance, and almost 6,000 place names, more than 1,200 of them Canadian. Indeed, all Canadian towns with a population of 5,000 or more arefeatured, and their entries not only explain the origin of the place name, but also include the population based on the 1996 census. With the publication of The Canadian Oxford Dictionary, Oxford University Press adds another work to its highly respected range of dictionaries, and Canadians finallyhave a dictionary that truly reflects their nations.",Language Arts & Disciplines,1738,N/A,0,en

It is a work that is doctrinally true to the Bible. Rev. Tolliver ""The world is indeed hungry for the Living Word and maybe as never before in history."" Tolliver selects forty topics prevalent today. Classic religious topics are Salvation/Being Born Again, Faith in Jesus Christ, Trinity, Man's Purpose, and True Freedom. Topics regarding society values include Child Rearing, Divorce, Sexual Morality, Homosexuality, Racism, Abortion, and Civil Rights Movement. Each topic has a separate section beginning with a guided question. Questions may require a single answer which consists of Bible verse(s) that serve as commentary. Complex questions are broken down further. A sample question is: ""Notwithstanding the issues of women's rights or ""right to life,"" what does the Bible have to say about abortion?"" All Bible verses are quoted in full and taken from the King James version. Thirteen appendices support Tolliver's conclusions. An interesting example is Appendix 8: Title 89 Social Services' definition of child abuse. The author recommends that parents read section 300.20 and use wisdom in administering correction.

Ford, New York Times bestselling author of Somebody’s Daughter “Reaches deep beneath the surface of words unspoken, wounds unhealed, and secrets untempered to break them open in order for fresh light to break through.”—Morgan Jerkins, New York Times bestselling author of This Will Be My Undoing and Caul Baby ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: The Root, Library Journal “From the womb, we must repeat with regularity that to love ourselves is to survive. I believe that is what my father wanted for me and knew I would so desperately need: a tool for survival, the truth of my dignity named like a mercy new each morning.” So writes Cole Arthur Riley in her unforgettable book of stories and reflections on discovering the sacred in her skin. In these deeply transporting pages, Arthur Riley reflects on the stories of her grandmother and father, and how they revealed to her an embodied, dignity-affirming spirituality, not only in what they believed but in the act of living itself. Writing memorably of her own childhood and coming to self, Arthur Riley boldly explores some of the most urgent questions of life and faith: How can spirituality not silence the body, but instead allow it to come alive? How do we honor, lament, and heal from the stories we inherit? How can we find peace in a world overtaken with dislocation, noise, and unrest? In this indelible work of contemplative storytelling, Arthur Riley invites us to descend into our own stories, examine our capacity to rest, wonder, joy, rage, and repair, and find that our humanity is not an enemy to faith but evidence of it.

Nouwen,Image,2013-11-20,"With over a million copies sold, this classic work is essential reading for all who ask, “Where has my struggle led me?” A chance encounter with a reproduction of Rembrandt’s The Return of the Prodigal Son catapulted Henri Nouwen on an unforgettable spiritual adventure. Here he shares the deeply personal and resonant meditation that led him to discover the place within where God has chosen to dwell. As Nouwen reflects on Rembrandt’s painting in light of his own life journey, he evokes a powerful drama of the classic parable in a rich, captivating way that is sure to reverberate in the hearts of readers. Nouwen probes the several movements of the parable: the younger son’s return, the father’s restoration of sonship, the elder son’s resentfulness, and the father’s compassion. The themes of homecoming, affirmation, and reconciliation will be newly discovered by all who have known loneliness, dejection, jealousy, or anger. The challenge to love as God loves, and to be loved as God’s beloved, will be seen as the ultimate revelation of the parable known to Christians throughout time, and is here represented with a vigor and power fresh for our times.",Religion,162,N/A,0,en
Martin Luther,Eric Metaxas,Penguin,2017-10-03,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER “Metaxas is a scrupulous chronicler and has an eye for a good story. . . . full, instructive, and pacey.” —The Washington Post From #1 New York Times bestselling author Eric Metaxas comes a brilliant and inspiring biography of the most influential man in modern history, Martin Luther, in time for the 500th anniversary of the Reformation On All Hallow’s Eve in 1517, a young monk named Martin Luther posted a document he hoped would spark an academic debate, but that instead ignited a conflagration that would forever destroy the world he knew. Five hundred years after Luther’s now famous Ninety-five Theses appeared, Eric Metaxas, acclaimed biographer of the bestselling Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy and Amazing Grace: William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery, paints a startling portrait of the wild figure whose adamantine faith cracked the edifice of Western Christendom and dragged medieval Europe into the future. Written in riveting prose and impeccably researched, Martin Luther tells the searing tale of a humble man who, by bringing ugly truths to the highest seats of power, caused the explosion whose sound is still ringing in our ears. Luther’s monumental faith and courage gave birth to the ideals of liberty, equality, and individualism that today lie at the heart of all modern life.",Biography & Autobiography,498,N/A,0,en

Faith Unraveled,Rachel Held Evans,Zondervan,2014-04-08,"From New York Times bestselling author Rachel Held Evans: a must-read for anyone on the journey of doubt, deconstruction, and ultimately faith reborn. Eighty years after the Scopes Monkey Trial made a spectacle of Christian fundamentalism and brought national attention to her hometown, Rachel Held Evans faced a trial of her own when she began to have doubts about her faith. In Faith Unraveled, Rachel recounts growing up in a culture obsessed with apologetics, struggling as her own faith unraveled one unexpected question at a time. In order for her faith to survive, Rachel realizes, it must adapt to change and evolve.

Jesus and the Dead Sea Scrolls,John Bergsma,Image,2019-09-10,"A major new work on the Dead Sea Scrolls, the oldest sacred documents of Judaism, which reveals their surprising connections to early Christianity. “A luminous treatment of a fascinating subject! Highly recommended!”—Scott Hahn, author of The Fourth Cup From award-winning scholar John Bergsma comes an intriguing book that reveals new insights on the Essenes, a radical Jewish community predating Christianity, whose existence, beliefs, and practices are often overlooked in the annuls of history. Bergsma reveals how this Jewish sect directly influenced the beliefs, sacraments, and practices of early Christianity and offers new information on how Christians lived their lives, worshipped, and eventually went on to influence the Roman Empire and Western civilization. Looking to Hebrew scripture and Jewish tradition, Bergsma helps to further explain how a simple Jewish peasant could go on to inspire a religion and a philosophy that still resonates 2,000 years later. In this enriching and exciting exploration, Bergsma demonstrates how the Dead Sea Scrolls—the world's greatest modern archaeological discovery—can shed light on the Church as a sacred society that offered hope, redemption, and salvation to its member. Ultimately, these mysterious writings are a time machine that can transport us back to the ancient world, deepen our appreciation of Scripture, and strengthen our understanding of the Christian faith. “An accessible introduction . . . This is a handy entry point for readers unfamiliar with Essenes or those interested in the Dead Sea Scrolls.”—Publishers Weekly",Religion,272,N/A,0,en

The Gospel of Mary Magdalene,Jean-Yves Leloup,Simon and Schuster,2002-02-01,"Restores to the forefront of the Christian tradition the importance of the divine feminine • The first complete English-language translation of the original Coptic Gospel of Mary, with line-by-line commentary • Reveals the eminence of the divine feminine in Christian thought • Offers a new perspective on the life of one of the most controversial figures in the Western spiritual tradition Perhaps no figure in biblical scholarship has been the subject of more controversy and debate than Mary Magdalene. Also known as Miriam of Magdala, Mary Magdalene was considered by the apostle John to be the founder of Christianity because she was the first witness to the Resurrection. In most theological studies she has been depicted as a reformed prostitute, the redeemed sinner who exemplifies Christ's mercy. Today's reader can ponder her role in the gospels of Philip, Thomas, Peter, and Bartholomew--the collection of what have come to be known as the Gnostic gospels rejected by the early Christian church. Mary's own gospel is among these, but until now it has remained unknown to the public at large. Orthodox theologian Jean-Yves Leloup's translation of the Gospel of Mary from the Coptic and his thorough and profound commentary on this text are presented here for the first time in English. The gospel text and the spiritual exegesis of Leloup together reveal unique teachings that emphasize the eminence of the divine feminine and an abiding love of nature over the dualistic and ascetic interpretations of Christianity presented elsewhere. What emerges from this important source text and commentary is a renewal of the sacred feminine in the Western spiritual tradition and a new vision for Christian thought and faith throughout the world.",Religion,186,N/A,0,en

"Understanding the Bible as a Scripture in History, Culture, and Religion",James W. Watts,John Wiley & Sons,2021-04-27,"UNDERSTANDING THE BIBLE AS A SCRIPTURE IN HISTORY, CULTURE, AND RELIGION The Bible is a popular subject of study and research, yet biblical studies gives little attention to the reason for its popularity: its religious role as a scripture. Understanding the Bible as a Scripture in History, Culture, and Religion integrates the history of the religious interpretation and ritual uses of biblical books into a survey of their rhetoric, composition, and theology in their ancient contexts. Emphasizing insights from comparative studies of different religious scriptures, it combines discussion of the Bible’s origins with its cultural history into a coherent understanding of its past and present function as a scripture. A prominent expert on biblical rhetoric and the ritualization of books, James W. Watts describes how Jews and Christians ritualize the Bible by interpreting it, by expressing it in recitations, music, art, and film, and by venerating the physical scroll and book. The first two sections of the book are organized around the Torah and the Gospels—which have been the focus of Jewish and Christian ritualization of scriptures from ancient to modern times—and treat the history of other biblical books in relation to these two central blocks of the Hebrew Bible and New Testament. In addition to analyzing the semantic contents of all the Bible’s books as persuasive rhetoric, Watts describes their ritualization in the iconic and expressive dimensions in the centuries since they began to function as a scripture, as well as in their origins in ancient Judaism and Christianity. The third section on the cultural history and scriptural function of modern bibles concludes by discussing their influence today and the controversies they have fueled about history, science, race, and gender. Innovative and insightful, Understanding the Bible as a Scripture in History, Culture, and Religion is a groundbreaking introduction to the study of the Bible as a scripture, and an ideal textbook for courses in biblical studies and comparative scripture studies.",Religion,387,N/A,0,en
You've Been Made for so Much More,Rhonda Jennifer,WestBow Press,2019-10-30,"• Have the tragedies of your life kept you stuck? • Have you been conditioned to devalue yourself? • Do you feel unworthy of love and happiness? You have come to your valuable space that will accelerate you into the wholeness you have desired. There is nothing too complicated for God to reshape into a win. You deserve victories in your life! God loves you; Jesus loves you far beyond mere words. The pain, the struggles and the heartbreak you have endured, God will guide you to set you free from every oppression and repeated cycle. You’ve Been Made For So Much More is the first of the No More Crumbs, Christian non-fiction empowerment series. Providing practical tools for healing and encouragement that is intended to provide hope for others to accept their blessings by taking the initial steps of faith to progress toward their valuable space. There are so many people suffering from victimization, so take the courageous step forward to no longer settle for crumbs. (Matthew 15:25-28 New International Version - NIV). Do not look at the time lost; look forward to what is ahead and push forward to be the best versions of ourselves. The woman came and knelt before him. “Lord, help me!” He replied, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.” “Yes, it is, Lord,” she said. “Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.” Then He, Jesus said to her, “Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted.” Scripture reference - Matthew 15: 26-28 Life can be a type of bully, telling you who and what you are. This bully is Satan - the devil – the evil one who is pulling the puppet strings on every strategic and direct attack. Satan purposefully designs to distract you from living in your fullness and strategizes on how to hinder you from having the abundant blessings you are meant to have. Settling for crumbs started for me with incidents out of my control, and then the conflicts grew to a conditioned acceptance of believing I was not worth anything good. I had allowed the strategic and direct attacks that came against me to devalue me. I allowed these evils to convince me to accept only crumbs in all areas of my life. I never believed good was ever afforded for me. It was only when I began to allow Jesus to work in my heart and mind that I was able to heal and progress forward. God used the evil, the rejection and the bad that shaped my negative perception, and God turned the destruction into a positive and a higher level of thinking and living. God enabled me to learn how to value myself, to go beyond the crumbs and walk in the fullness of life through faith. My purpose is to share my story and provide you with teachings for how to have your abundant life now. No more crumbs for me and no more crumbs for you either. There is nothing too complicated for God to reshape into a win. So, I speak Jesus’ words over you, ‘Be of good cheer! Great is your faith!’ How is your faith considered great? Your faith is being activated by you taking that next courageous step in God. God honors faith above all else, and God hears your cry. He will fight your battles and lead you to your destined blessings. You’ve been made for so much more, and the devaluing of accepting crumbs ends today. God will fight for you every step of the way.",Religion,77,N/A,0,en

Lingering at Calvary,S. Franklin Logsdon,Moody Publishers,2013-04-19,"Years ago a large painting of the cruxifixion was lent to a Midwestern city for exhibition during the Easter season. Space in a department store was set aside for the exquisite work which finally was recessed in yards and yards of rich, dark blue velvet. Approximately a hundred chairs were placed at a distance from the picture for the public to view it during business hours. You could step inside that enclosed space at any hour of the day and find people sitting and standing in absolute silence as they gazed at the scene before them. The awe and worshipful reverence of the spectators can be described best by saying they could be felt. Remembrance of that place and picture can be relived in the content of Lingering at Calvary. How could the author forbear to do anything else than employ fully his gift of words in applying one brushful after another to the Calvary scene! He wants to stop readers who live much of their lives in this noncontemplative age of rush, pleasure, and ungodliness--stop them, make them sit or stand for a time in the absolute, tearful silence of sheer gratitude.",Religion,160,N/A,0,en

EDITIO PRINCEPS.,Eric Marshall White,Studies in Medieval and Early,2017,"The Gutenberg Bible is widely recognized as Europe's first printed book, a book that forever changed the world. However, despite its initial impact, fame was fleeting: for the better part of three centuries the Bible was virtually forgotten; only after two centuries of tenacious and contentious scholarship did it attain its iconic status as a monument of human invention. Editio princeps: A History of the Gutenberg Bible is the first book to tell the whole story of Europe's first printed edition, describing its creation at Mainz circa 1455, its impact on fifteenth-century life and religion, its fall into oblivion during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and its rediscovery and rise to worldwide fame during the centuries thereafter. This comprehensive study examines the forty-nine surviving Gutenberg Bibles, and fragments of at least fourteen others, in the chronological order in which they came to light. Combining close analysis of material clues within the Bibles themselves with fresh documentary discoveries, the book reconstructs the history of each copy in unprecedented depth, from its earliest known context through every change of ownership up to the present day. Along the way it introduces the colorful cast of proud possessors, crafty booksellers, observant travelers, and scholarly librarians who shaped our understanding of Europe's first printed book. Bringing the 'biographies' of all the Gutenberg Bibles together for the first time, this richly illustrated study contextualizes both the historic cultural impact of the editio princeps and its transformation into a world treasure.",History,456,N/A,0,en

Friedrich Max Müller and the Sacred Books of the East,Arie L. Molendijk,Oxford University Press,2016-07-28,"This volume offers a critical analysis of one the most ambitious editorial projects of late Victorian Britain: the edition of the fifty substantial volumes of the Sacred Books of the East (1879-1910). The series was edited and conceptualized by Friedrich Max Müller (1823-1900), a world-famous German-born philologist, orientalist, and religious scholar. Müller and his influential Oxford colleagues secured financial support from the India Office of the British Empire and from Oxford University Press. Arie L. Molendijk documents how the series has become a landmark in the development of the humanities-especially the study of religion and language-in the second half of the nineteenth century. The edition also contributed significantly to the Western perception of the 'religious' or even 'mystic' East, which was textually represented in English translations. The series was a token of the rise of 'big science' and textualized the East, by selecting their 'sacred books' and bringing them under the power of western scholarship.",Religion,273,N/A,0,en

Essayes in Divinity,John Donne,McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP,2001,"In this new edition of Donne's Essayes in Divinity Anthony Raspa demonstrates how Donne reconciles the destiny of Christians, who arose out of divine creation, with the turbulent state of the Renaissance world. Raspa argues that the purpose of Donne's work is to explain how Genesis and Exodus capture the essence of existence for a person who must deal with life as both an individual and a member of a community. Completed late in 1614, Essayes, Donne's only theological and philosophical treatise, casts considerable light on his ideas about his own future. Donne entered the Anglican priesthood soon after completing it and Raspa reveals that, particularly because of its treatment of time and destiny, Essayes is crucial to our understanding of the development of Donne's ideas about the turbulent religio-political state of the Renaissance world and how he came to see his own life within it. Raspa contends that Essayes is a peculiarly modern work and that Donne, as a Renaissance humanist, was profoundly shaken by the development of empirical thinking and the seemingly endless political conflicts among Christian denominations. He shows that Donne drew on the entirety of Renaissance humanist learning in an attempt to reconcile the state of contemporary knowledge with the destiny of humanity prophesied in the bible.",Literary Collections,304,N/A,0,en

Bible Culture and Authority in the Early United States,Seth Perry,Princeton University Press,2018-06-05,"Early Americans claimed that they looked to ""the Bible alone"" for authority, but the Bible was never, ever alone. Bible Culture and Authority in the Early United States is a wide-ranging exploration of the place of the Christian Bible in America in the decades after the Revolution. Attending to both theoretical concerns about the nature of scriptures and to the precise historical circumstances of a formative period in American history, Seth Perry argues that the Bible was not a ""source"" of authority in early America, as is often said, but rather a site of authority: a cultural space for editors, commentators, publishers, preachers, and readers to cultivate authoritative relationships. While paying careful attention to early national bibles as material objects, Perry shows that ""the Bible"" is both a text and a set of relationships sustained by a universe of cultural practices and assumptions. Moreover, he demonstrates that Bible culture underwent rapid and fundamental changes in the early nineteenth century as a result of developments in technology, politics, and religious life. At the heart of the book are typical Bible readers, otherwise unknown today, and better-known figures such as Zilpha Elaw, Joseph Smith, Denmark Vesey, and Ellen White, a group that includes men and women, enslaved and free, Baptists, Catholics, Episcopalians, Methodists, Mormons, Presbyterians, and Quakers. What they shared were practices of biblical citation in writing, speech, and the performance of their daily lives. While such citation contributed to the Bible's authority, it also meant that the meaning of the Bible constantly evolved as Americans applied it to new circumstances and identities.",Religion,216,N/A,0,en
The Sampler Bible,Steve Elzinga,Jpl Books,2017-04-12,"What is the Sampler Bible and why should you bother reading it? Although the Bible has been the best-selling book every year in a row since the invention of the printing press (a 500 year run), it often sits on shelves...unread. So how can the Sampler Bible help you overcome some of these stumbling blocks? 1. It is relatively small. At 1/4 of the full Bible, it only would take the average person 25 hours to read. 2. It is understandable. Care was exercised in choosing the main events for the Sampler Bible, and notes on the side help explain what might be difficult to figure out. 3. It is straightforward. Since the Sampler Bible is only the highlights of the full Bible, you can just start reading it from the beginning - just like any book you might read. 4. It could be life-changing.

Our Authorized Bible Vindicated,Benjamin George Wilkinson,"TEACH Services, Inc.",2014-10-29,"The Bible is an all-time bestseller, the most translated book, and the most controversial title. Throughout the ages this precious book has been persecuted and preserved, yet many today are weak in the faith and, therefore, question the inspiration of the Bible. Our Authorized Bible Vindicated explores the history of the Bible from the earliest manuscripts until now, demonstrating how it has been preserved in its entirety. Today more than ever there is a need to return to the authentic roots of our spiritual foundation. With the lines between truth and falsity blurring, it is imperative that we discern what is accurate and what is not.

These principles of translating are contrasted with the dynamic equivalence (""phrase for phrase"") and paraphrase methods seen in many modern Bible versions. This book includes detailed discussions on why the author believes the Majority Text is the most accurate of the three Greek texts used in Bible translation.

H. M. Baagil’s Muslim-Christian Dialogue,A. Yousef Al-Katib,TellerBooks,2014-02-14,"Dr. H. M. Baagil’s Muslim Christian Dialogue is a proselytic tract that sets forth Islam’s primary charges against Christianity: the corruption of Scriptures revealed to earlier prophets and the adoption of false and idolatrous doctrine. Dr. Baagil’s treatise has been used by countless Islamic organizations to urge Christians to return to the pure, authentic, uncorrupted religion of Islam. Yet Dr. Baagil’s tract employs insidious and subtle twists of logic to support its conclusions. The book is especially dangerous to the Christian or Muslim unschooled in Christian doctrine or having shallow biblical knowledge. Such a reader will fall prey to Dr. Baagil’s traps, thus being led astray from the truth of the Gospel to an impotent form of religion that denies Jesus’ salvific power. At last—there is now an answer to Dr. Baagil’s treatise. In this volume, A. Yousef Al-Katib sets forth a systemic reply to each of Dr. Baagil’s attacks on Christianity. A. Yousef Al-Katib, himself a Christian convert who spent more than five years in religious study before experiencing the miraculous power of Jesus to heal and to save, thoroughly replies to, refutes and rebuts each of Dr. Baagil’s arguments on a detailed point-by-point basis. He reveals Dr. Baagil’s innumerable contradictions, false statements, circular arguments, illogicisms and erroneous biblical interpretations.",Religion,169,N/A,0,en

THEE PSYCHICK BIBLE,Genesis Breyer P-Orridge,Feral House,2010-11-09,"Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth (TOPY) will be remembered for its crucial influence on youth culture throughout the 1980s, popularizing tattooing, body piercing, ""acid house"" raves, and other ahead-of-the-curve cultic flirtations and investigations. Its leader was Genesis P-Orridge, co-founder of Psychick TV and Throbbing Gristle, the band that created the industrial music genre. The limited signed cloth edition of Thee Psychick Bible quickly sold out, creating demand for any edition of this 544-page book, which will be available in a handsome smyth-sewn paperback edition with flaps and ribbon.

Religion and Culture in Renaissance England,"Claire McEachern, Debora Shuger",Cambridge University Press,1997-06-28,"These essays by leading historians and literary scholars investigate the role of religion in shaping political, social and literary forms, and their reciprocal role in shaping early modern religion, from the Reformation to the Civil Wars. Reflecting and rethinking the insights of new historicism and cultural studies, individual essays take up various aspects of the productive, if tense, relation between Tudor-Stuart Christianity and culture, and explore how religion informs some of the central texts of English Renaissance literature: the vernacular Bible, Foxe's Acts and Monuments, Hooker's Laws, Shakespeare's plays and sonnets, the poems of John Donne, Amelia Lanyer and John Milton. The collection demonstrates the centrality of religion to sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England, and its influence on early modern constructions of gender, subjectivity and nationhood.",Literary Criticism,316,N/A,0,en

A History of the World in Twelve Maps,Jerry Brotton,Penguin UK,2012-09-06,"Jerry Brotton is the presenter of the acclaimed BBC4 series 'Maps: Power, Plunder and Possession'. Here he tells the story of our world through maps. Throughout history, maps have been fundamental in shaping our view of the world, and our place in it. But far from being purely scientific objects, world maps are unavoidably ideological and subjective, intimately bound up with the systems of power and authority of particular times and places. Mapmakers do not simply represent the world, they construct it out of the ideas of their age. In this scintillating book, Jerry Brotton examines the significance of 12 maps - from the mystical representations of ancient history to the satellite-derived imagery of today. He vividly recreates the environments and circumstances in which each of the maps was made, showing how each conveys a highly individual view of the world - whether the Jerusalem-centred Christian perspective of the 14th century Hereford Mappa Mundi or the Peters projection of the 1970s which aimed to give due weight to 'the third world'. Although the way we map our surroundings is once more changing dramatically, Brotton argues that maps today are no more definitive or objective than they have ever been - but that they continue to make arguments and propositions about the world, and to recreate, shape and mediate our view of it. Readers of this book will never look at a map in quite the same way again.",Science,686,N/A,0,en

Martin Luther's Bible,W. Gordon Campbell,BoD – Books on Demand,2024-01-01,"Martin Luther’s 1522 September Testament marked a watershed in Bible translation, making Scripture available to ordinary German people in their own tongue and sparking similar efforts across Europe. Building on the nascent trend of vernacular Bible translations in the early sixteenth century, Luther’s translation quickly became definitive linguistically, theologically and culturally, especially once the complete Bible was published in 1534, with production of New Testaments and Bibles in French, English and other languages keeping pace. Luther and his associates constantly revised and improved their methodology for translation and interpretation over a quarter-century of Bible publishing - efforts that helped shape Bible translation, reading and exegesis, for scholars and ordinary Christians alike, well beyond his lifetime. Martin Luther’s Bible commemorates the September Testament, exploring the Wittenberg Bible project in its context and tracing aspects of its legacy in Europe and the wider world, from the sixteenth century to the present day. Essays from a range of leading experts draw upon the 2022 Martin Luther: Bible Translator, Illustrator and Publisher International Conference held at Union Theological College, Belfast. Together, they provide critical new insights into the linguistic, hermeneutical and theological history and influence of this landmark text.",Religion,202,N/A,0,en

The Sealed Portion - The Final Testament of Jesus Christ,Christopher Na,Worldwide United Publishing,2005-04,"The Sealed Portion-Another Testament of Jesus Christ is the second part of the Book of Mormon, which millions of people throughout the world accept as the word of God along with the Bible. Joseph Smith, Jr. (1830), the founder of the Mormon faith, claimed to have received gold plates from an angel of God named Moroni. When he received the plates, Smith relates that 2/3 of them were sealed. The angel Moroni commanded him not to break the seals, but to translate only the portion of the plates that was unsealed. It was prophesied that the sealed portion of the plates would one day be given to the people of the world. Using two stones called the Urim and Thummim, Joseph Smith translated the unsealed portion. Before returning the plates to the angel Moroni, Joseph showed them to several others. These men gave their personal testimony as witnesses to the existence of the plates and to the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. Claiming to have received the same instructions to translate the sealed portion of the gold plates, an obscure man, once an active member of the LDS faith, who goes only by the name of Christopher, has published the remaining sealed portion. Though others have made similar claims before him, none has ever testified that he received the Urim and Thummim that was prepared by God to translate the plates, and none has made claim that he has received the exact same gold plates that were in Joseph Smith's possession-except for Christopher. This book is a result of that translation. The Sealed Portion-The Final Testament of Jesus Christ, written by Moroni, relates the vision seen by the Brother of Jared. Within the pages, the entire history of mankind is covered. It begins with the kingdom where the spirits of the children of men were first created, and continues through until the end of the millennium, when the earth will be restored to a state similar to the garden of Eden, and the planets will be prepared as the degrees of glory in the kingdom of God. The most accurate and precise account ever given of the life of Christ is contained within the pages, including his early years with his family, his youth, baptism, marriages, mission, and death. Moroni explains the atonement, the LDS temple endowment, and some of the hidden symbolism of the book of Revelation. He recounts the prophets Ubaid, Zarathustra, Antioch, Socrates, Sythipian, Mohammad, and Joseph Smith, Jr., among others. The histories of the Egyptians, Hittites, Babylonians, Romans, and Americans are also covered. Also given is the in-depth and beautiful description of Jesus' intercessory prayer among the Nephites and the Lamanites on the American continent. Along with the translation of the sealed portion, the first part of the gold plates that was translated by Joseph Smith, Jr. and subsequently lost by his scribe, Martin Harris, is also included in this extraordinary work. This part is known as the Book of Lehi (the lost 116-page manuscript). The full text of Joseph Smith's reported First Vision, in which he claims to have been visited by God the Father and Jesus Christ, is also included in the book. The reader is lead from blindness into the light as he or she discovers the truths written within these pages.",Apocryphal books (Book of Mormon),0,5,2,en

Tyndale's Testament,Museum Plantin-Moretus,Brepols Publishers,2002,"In the era of the early Reformation many influential texts were printed in Antwerp. Not the least of these were the biblical translations of William Tyndale (c. 1494-1536). Despite the relative tolerance of Antwerp's magistrates, which made such pubications possible, Tyndale was eventually seized by officers of Charles V and was executed as a heretic in Vilvoorde, north of Brussels. Tyndale's translations of the New Testament (Worms, 1526; Antwerp, 1534, 1535, 1536) and of the Pentateuch (Antwerp, 1530) were profoundly to shape future English bibles, and through them the language and culture of the English-speaking world. Tyndale's Testament, a volume with contributions by leading international scholars, puts the achievement of Tyndale into its broad cultural and intellectual context, in which Erasmus and Luther were the key figures, and into its immediate commercial and technological location in sixteenth-century Antwerp. It also sketches the transmission of Tyndale's work to future English translations through the Coverdale Bible (Antwerp, 1535), and traces the development of his present-day recognition as the father of modern English Bible translation and of the Anglo-American Evangelical tradition. The volume Tyndale's Testament is to be published to coincide with the Fourth International Tyndale Conference, at the Lessius Hogeschool in Antwerp. It includes the catalogue of a major exhibition to be held (3 September to 1 December 2002) in the UNESCO-listed Museum Plantin-Moretus in Antwerp. The publication is richly illustrated with over a hundred pictures (ten in colour), including a full colour reproduction of the only surviving title page of the first English New Testament in print, from the unique complete copy in the Wurttembergische Landesbibliothek, Stuttgart.",Bibles,220,N/A,0,en

Jesus the Bridegroom,Brant Pitre,Image,2014-03-11,"In Jesus the Bridegroom, Brant Pitre once again taps into the wells of Jewish Scripture and tradition, and unlocks the secrets of what is arguably the most well-known symbol of the Christian faith: the cross of Christ. In this thrilling exploration, Pitre shows how the suffering and death of Jesus was far more than a tragic Roman execution. Instead, the Passion of Christ was the fulfillment of ancient Jewish prophecies of a wedding, when the God of the universe would wed himself to humankind in an everlasting nuptial covenant. To be sure, most Christians are familiar with the apostle Paul’s teaching that Christ is the ‘Bridegroom’ and the Church is the ‘Bride’. But what does this really mean? And what would ever possess Paul to compare the death of Christ to the love of a husband for his wife? If you would have been at the Crucifixion, with Jesus hanging there dying, is that how you would have described it? How could a first-century Jew like Paul, who knew how brutal Roman crucifixions were, have ever compared the execution of Jesus to a wedding? And why does he refer to this as the “great mystery” (Ephesians 5:32)? As Pitre shows, the key to unlocking this mystery can be found by going back to Jewish Scripture and tradition and seeing the entire history of salvation, from Mount Sinai to Mount Calvary, as a divine love story between Creator and creature, between God and Israel, between Christ and his bride—a story that comes to its climax on the wood of a Roman cross. In the pages of Jesus the Bridegroom, dozens of familiar passages in the Bible—the Exodus, the Song of Songs, the Wedding at Cana, the Woman at the Well, the Last Supper, the Crucifixion, and even the Second Coming at the End of Time—are suddenly transformed before our eyes. Indeed, when seen in the light of Jewish Scripture and tradition, the life of Christ is nothing less than the greatest love story ever told.",Religion,226,N/A,0,en

Philippians and Galatians,Stanley P.

Philippians is perhaps Paul's warmest letter, affirming the already close relationship between the Philippians and Paul with the language of partnership, joy, and humility. Galatians, on the other hand, reveals frustration and anger and lacks the expression of thanksgiving typically found near the beginning of Paul's letters. Although Paul presumes a relationship of trust and respect with the Philippians, the tone of Galatians suggests that he thinks he may already have lost this community to an erroneous vision of the gospel - a perspective that was not really the gospel at all.",Religion,116,N/A,0,en

Sometimes just hearing ""It is God's will"" isn't enough. Sometimes just saying ""God will turn this to good"" seems so meaningless when despair is so profound.Often the pain goes too deep, the questions won't go away, and even the assurance of faith doesn't help. How could God let this happen? How can God love us, yet allow us to suffer in this way? What is the point of this? What is the purpose?In this provocative book, Ken Ham makes clear answers found in the pages of Scripture - powerful, definitive, and in a way that helps our hearts to go beyond mere acceptance.

The book begins by looking at philosophical and methodological challenges to the Bible—questions about whether or not it is logically possible for God to communicate verbally with human beings; what it means to say the Bible is true in response to postmodern concerns about the nature of truth; defending the clarity of Scripture against historical skepticism and relativism. Contributors also explore textual and historical challenges—charges made by Muslims, Mormons, and skeptics that the Bible has been corrupted beyond repair; questions about the authorship of certain biblical books; allegations that the Bible borrows from pagan myths; the historical reliability of the Old and New Testaments. Final chapters take on ethical, scientific, and theological challenges— demonstrating the Bible’s moral integrity regarding the topics of slavery and sexism; harmonizing exegetical and theological conclusions with the findings of science; addressing accusations that the Christian canon is the result of political and theological manipulation; ultimately defending the Bible as not simply historically reliable and consistent, but in fact the Word of God.",Religion,508,N/A,0,en

God's Last Words,David S. Katz,Yale University Press,2004-02-09,"This wide-ranging book is an intellectual history of how informed readers read their Bibles over the past four hundred years, from the first translations in the sixteenth century to the emergence of fundamentalism in the twentieth century. In an astonishing display of erudition, David Katz recreates the response of readers from different eras by examining the horizon of expectations that provided the lens through which they read. In the Renaissance, says Katz, learned men rushed to apply the tools of textual analysis to the Testaments, fully confident that God's Word would open up and reveal shades of further truth. During the English Civil War, there was a symbiotic relationship between politics and religion, as the practical application of the biblical message was hammered out. Science - Newtonian and Darwinian, as well as the emerging disciplines of anthropology, archaeology, and geology - also had a great impact on how the Bible was received. The rise of the novel and the development of a concept of authorial copyright were other factors that altered readers' experience. Katz discusses all of these and more, concluding with the growth of fundamentalism in America, which broug",Religion,428,N/A,0,en

A History of the English Bible as Literature,David Norton,Cambridge University Press,2000-05-29,"Revised and condensed from David Norton's acclaimed A History of the Bible as Literature, this book, first published in 2000, tells the story of English literary attitudes to the Bible. At first jeered at and mocked as English writing, then denigrated as having 'all the disadvantages of an old prose translation', the King James Bible somehow became 'unsurpassed in the entire range of literature'. How so startling a change happened and how it affected the making of modern translations such as the Revised Version and the New English Bible is at the heart of this exploration of a vast range of religious, literary and cultural ideas. Translators, writers such as Donne, Milton, Bunyan and the Romantics, reactionary Bishops and radical students all help to show the changes in religious ideas and in standards of language and literature that created our sense of the most important book in English.",Bibles,526,N/A,0,en

The Jews and the Bible,Jean-Christophe Attias,Stanford University Press,2014-11-26,"Despite its deceptively simple title, this book ponders the thorny issue of the place of the Bible in Jewish religion and culture. By thoroughly examining the complex link that the Jews have formed with the Bible, Jewish scholar Jean-Christophe Attias raises the uncomfortable question of whether it is still relevant for them. Jews and the Bible reveals how the Jews define themselves in various times and places with the Bible, without the Bible, and against the Bible. Is it divine revelation or national myth? Literature or legislative code? One book or a disparate library? Text or object? For the Jews, over the past two thousand years or more, the Bible has been all that and much more. In fact, Attias argues that the Bible is nothing in and of itself. Like the Koran, the Bible has never been anything other than what its readers make of it. But what they've made of it tells a fascinating story and raises provocative philosophical and ethical questions. The Bible is indeed an elusive book, and so Attias explores the fundamental discrepancy between what we think the Bible tells us about Judaism and what Judaism actually tells us about the Bible. With passion and intellect, Attias informs and enlightens the reader, never shying away from the difficult questions, ultimately asking: In our post-genocide and post-Zionist culture, can the Bible be saved?",Religion,254,N/A,0,en

The Bible,Michael David Coogan,N/A,2021,"The Bible is the most influential book in Western history. As the foundational text of Judaism and Christianity, the Bible has been interpreted and reinterpreted over millennia, utilized to promote a seemingly endless run of theological and political positions. Adherents and detractors alike point to different passages throughout to justify wildly disparate behaviors and beliefs. Translated and retranslated, these texts lead both to unity and intense conflict. Influential books on any topic are typically called ""bibles."" What is the Bible? As a text considered sacred by some, its stories and language appear throughout the fine arts and popular culture, from Shakespeare to Saturday Night Live. In Michael Coogan's eagerly awaited addition to Oxford's What Everyone Needs to Know(R) series, conflicts and controversies surrounding the world's bestselling book are addressed in a straightforward Q&A format. This book provides an unbiased look at biblical authority and authorship, the Bible's influence in Western culture, the disputes over meaning and interpretation, and the state of biblical scholarship today.

African and European Readers of the Bible in Dialogue,"Gerald West, Hans (J.H) de Wit",BRILL,2008-07-31,"Far too long, the relationship between European and African biblical scholarship has been a non-relationship. Divergent insights into how biblical texts should be interpreted and made fruitful for the current context, cultural differences, colonial past and post-colonial future, radically different social situations – this all made companionship and real interaction difficult. This rich and multilayered volume (result of a Stellenbosch conference 2006) attempts to disclose new modes of dialogue between readers of the Bible from those two worlds. More than twenty theologians from Africa and Europe reflect together on how readers from radically different contexts – professional and ordinary alike –, may become allies in an ethically accountable way of relating the biblical text to their current (global) situations and how a process of mutual learning may be established. This book provides important insights in intercultural hermeneutics, the relationship between classical historico-literary approaches and new forms of interpretation. It also gives examples of new forms of how to read the Bible in the secularised European context and the HIV/Aids stricken Africa. Particularly enriching is that every contribution is followed by a personal letter of response of another contributor to the book, giving impulses for further dialogue and debate. The book is useful for all biblical scholars and students, in particular for those interested in how to do contextual exegesis in a manner that also takes into account the context of the other.",Religion,448,N/A,0,en

The Cross and Salvation (Hardcover),Bruce Demarest,Crossway,2006-08-01,"With America's confidence in the Bible at an all-time low and the strength of her spiritual convictions waning, it is essential for Christians—especially Christian leaders—to be well-grounded in biblical theology. To have a clear and comprehensive understanding of the key doctrines of evangelicalism. In response, professor and award-winning author Bruce Demarest has made plain God's glorious plan of salvation, his provision for the human dilemma through Christ's work on the cross, and the application of saving grace to unbelievers.

Ruin the Sacred Truths,"Harold BLOOM, Harold Bloom",Harvard University Press,2009-06-30,"Bloom surveys with majestic view the literature of the West from the Old Testament to Samuel Beckett. He provocatively rereads the Yahwist (or J) writer, Jeremiah, Job, Jonah, the Iliad, the Aeneid, Dante's Divine Comedy, Hamlet, King Lear, Othello, the Henry IV plays, Paradise Lost, Blake's Milton, Wordsworth's Prelude, and works by Freud, Kafka, and Beckett. In so doing, he uncovers the truth that all our attempts to call any strong work more sacred than another are merely political and social formulations. This is criticism at its best. Table of Contents: 1. The Hebrew Bible 2. From Homer to Dante 3. Shakespeare 4. Milton 5. Enlightenment and Romanticism 6. Freud and Beyond Reviews of this book: Bloom's puissance is not entirely his own; for some of it, he is indebted to Nietzsche, Freud, Schopenhauer, Gershom Scholem, and other masters. But enough of it is his own to constitute a distinctive form of splendor. --Denis Donoghue, New York Review of Books Reviews of this book: The wit, the eclecticism and the gripping paradoxes...the force of [Bloom's] intellect carries the reader from pinnacle to pinnacle, showing a new spiritual landscape from each. --Roger Scruton, Washington Times Reviews of this book: In some ways the wildest of the wild men (and women), in some ways the most traditional of the traditionalists, Harold Bloom remains serene amid the turbulence--much of it caused by him. He stands dauntless, a party of one, as thrilling to behold up on the high wire as he is (at times) throttling to read on the page...From this strong critic dealing with these strong poets comes a potent mix of insight. --Mark Feeney, Boston Globe",Literary Criticism,218,N/A,0,en

Though brief and doomed to fail, the battle is legend in both our history and in the Australian mind. Henry Lawson wrote poems about it, its symbolic flag is still raised, and even the nineteenth-century visitor Mark Twain called it ""a strike for liberty"".Was this rebellion a fledgling nation's first attempt to assert its independence under colonial rule?

"Judges, Ruth",K. Lawson Younger,Zondervan Academic,2021-01-19,"The NIV Application Commentary helps you communicate and apply biblical text effectively in today's context The books of Judges and Ruth have relevance for our lives today. Judges, because it reveals a God who employs very human deliverers but refuses to gloss over their sins and their consequences. And Ruth, because it demonstrates the far-reaching impact of a righteous character. K. Lawson Younger Jr. shares literary perspectives on the books of Judges and Ruth that reveal ageless truths for our contemporary lives. To bring the ancient messages of the Bible into today's context, each passage is treated in three sections: Original Meaning. Concise exegesis to help readers understand the original meaning of the biblical text in its historical, literary, and cultural context. Bridging Contexts. A bridge between the world of the Bible and the world of today, built by discerning what is timeless in the timely pages of the Bible. Contemporary Significance.

Look What's Missing!,David W. Daniels,Chick Publications,2011,"Publishers are removing things from new Bibles! Publishers of modern Bible versions have been removing words, phrases, and even whole verses, but their readers are often unaware of it. Few people know the Bible well enough to notice when something has been taken out. But the results are hard to believe. The removal of one tiny word turns Jesus into a liar. Callers into Christian talk shows have even used this to say that it’s okay for a Christian to lie. After all, they say, Jesus did it. A verse that’s completely missing from some of the most popular Bibles available today completely removes one of the basic doctrines found in every evangelical church. When David Daniels shows this one to people they just stand with their mouths open and say, “I can’t believe it!” In another case, Jesus’ own words are removed, taking out a famous phrase in which Jesus explains why He came to earth. People react with: “They took out Jesus words! How can they do that?” This information has been right under our noses for years, but no one has ever taken the time to cull through this many Bible versions and find the missing parts. Author David Daniels did the research and now releases his results for the Christian world to see what is really missing. How about your Bible? Is it on the list of Bibles with pieces taken out? You might be surprised when you look at what’s missing.",Religion,258,3.5,3,en

It's in the Bible!,Arthur Padilla,Xlibris Corporation,2019-09-17,"The Bible is easily the most influential and most quoted book in western society. It is revered so much that it is used to swear in to office the President of the United States, Supreme Court Justices, and other elected government officials. When the President and other U.S. government officials swear that they will carry out their duties with the help of the Biblical God, few if any are aware that according to scripture the Biblical God is actually a man. He is specifically a man of war, as stated in the following scripture, “The Lord is a man of war: the Lord is his name” (Exodus 15:3). Perhaps this is a reason why the United States has been at war 93 percent of the time since its existence. The Bible has had significant historical, social, and political influences on humanity. More importantly, the Bible continues to significantly influence humanity today. A specific example is today’s conflict in the Middle East between Israel and its neighbors. Israel bases its claim to the land in dispute with the argument that the God of the Bible gave them that land approximately 3,425 years ago as described in the Old Testament of the Judeo Christian bible. This book takes this same literal approach in interpreting the narrative/scripture concerning the God and events described in the same bible. A few of the many items discussed in this book concerning biblical scripture are: • The U.S. is the modern version of Old Testament Israel • That the Biblical God is actually a man or manlike entity • Inferences to very advanced technology • Inferences that Jesus of the Gospel was gay • More than one Jesus Christ • The second coming has already happened • Reincarnation concerning Jesus and the prophets • Periodic mass extinction",Bibles,192,N/A,0,en

There are several books about the Sabbath with regard to the Gospel of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, but nothing regarding Q. This book is designed to address the relation to the Sabbath in Q which makes it remarkable amongst other Sabbath related books with reference to the Synoptic Gospels. Considering the rabbinic writers and the early fathers, who have used, generally in a free way, the sayings of Jesus drawn from the Gospels and/or oral tradition, this book examines the apologists and the extracanonical writers, whose writings constitute a well-defined literary genre and witness a progressively more bookish use of the sayings of Jesus.

R. Crumb: Bible of Filth,Robert Crumb,David Zwirner Books,2017-12-12,"Featuring R. Crumb’s most outrageous sexual comics, Bible of Filth is possibly the dirtiest book around. One of America’s most celebrated cartoonists, Crumb helped define cartoon and punk subcultures of the 1960s and 1970s with comic strips like Fritz the Cat, Mr. Natural, and Keep on Truckin’. The open sexuality of his work, paired with frequent self-deprecation and a free, almost stream-of-consciousness style, has made Crumb into a global voice and a renowned contemporary artist. Originally published in France in 1986 by Futuropolis, the first edition of Bible of Filth was never distributed in the United States because of its graphic sexual content, which included some of Crumb’s most explicit comics from underground magazines such as Snatch, Jiz, Zap, XYZ, Big Ass, and Uneeda. This revised and expanded English edition, published by David Zwirner Books, contains all the original pieces from the 1986 volume, with over one hundred pages of additional material. Organized chronologically, there are comics from 1968 to 1986 that were omitted from the first edition and an entirely new selection of work from after 1986. Printed on bible paper and bound in leather, with gold debossing and edging, this volume looks and feels like a traditional bible, with no outward suggestion of what it contains. This revised and expanded Bible of Filth is the perfect introduction for newcomers, while retaining its status as an important collector’s item for Crumb enthusiasts around the world.",Art,336,N/A,0,en

But reading his essays is not just an exercise in studying a literary form at its finest, it is an encounter with timeless truths that jump off the page as fresh and powerful as the day they were written. The only problem with Chesterton's essays is that there are too many of them. Over five thousand! For most GKC readers it is not even possible to know where to start or how to begin to approach them. So three of the world's leading authorities on Chesterton - Dale Ahlquist, Joseph Pearce, Aidan Mackey - have joined together to select the ""best"" Chesterton essays, a collection that will be appreciated by both the newcomer and the seasoned student of this great 20th century man of letters.

The Protestant Bible Correctly Translated,William Harwood,World Audience Inc,2017-07-21,"There has long been a need for a translation of the Judaeo-Christian Bible that did not deliberately mistranslate certain words and sentences for the purpose of concealing that the biblical authors' beliefs were quite different from those of modern Jews, Christians and Muslims. For example, ""The LORD"" is a falsification of the proper name Yahweh, a god like Zeus or Jupiter. But the most blatant fraud has been the rendering of the Hebrew word allahiym as the male proper name, ""God."" Allahiym is neither a proper name nor singular nor unisexual. Al means a god. The suffix -ah is a feminine singular inflection, so that allah means ""goddess."" The suffix -iym is a masculine plural inflection, making allahiym a dual-sex, generic plural, ""male and female gods,"" or, in the common gender, ""gods.""

"The Early Prophets: Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings",,Schocken,2014-11-04,"The story of ancient Israel, from the arrival in Canaan to the destruction of the Kingdom of Judah and the Babylonian exile some six centuries later, here is the highly anticipated second volume in Everett Fox’s landmark translation of the Hebrew Bible. The personalities who appear in the pages of The Early Prophets, and the political and moral dilemmas their stories illuminate, are part of the living consciousness of the Western world. From Joshua and the tumbling walls of Jericho to Samson and Delilah, the prophet Samuel and the tragic King Saul, David and Goliath, Bathsheba and Absalom, King Solomon’s temple, Elijah and the chariot of fire, Ahab and Jezebel—the stories of these men and women are deeply etched into Western culture because they beautifully encapsulate the human experience. The four books that comprise The Early Prophets look at tribal rivalries, dramatic changes in leadership, and the intrusions of neighboring empires through the prism of the divine-human relationship. Over the centuries, the faithful have read these narratives as demonstrations of the perils of disobeying God’s will, and time and again Jews in exile found that the stories spoke to their own situations of cultural assimilation, destruction, and the reformulation of identity. They have had an equally indelible impact on generations of Christians, who have seen in many of the narratives foreshadowings of the life and death of Jesus, as well as models for their own lives and the careers of their leaders. But beyond its importance as a foundational religious document, The Early Prophets is a great work of literature, a powerful and distinctive narrative of the past that seeks meaning in the midst of national catastrophe. Accompanied by illuminating commentary, notes, and maps, Everett Fox’s masterly translation of the Hebrew original re-creates the echoes, allusions, alliterations, and wordplays that rhetorically underscore its meaning and are intrinsic to a timeless text meant to be both studied and read aloud.",Religion,881,N/A,0,en

The Access Bible®,Gail R. O'Day,"Oxford University Press, USA",1999-11-11,"Modern readers of the Bible are time travelers visiting a society and culture very different from their own. Strange customs, unfamiliar words and novel concepts encountered in the Bible's pages can make understanding the Word of God a real challenge. The Access Bible is friendly to people who've never studied the Bible before. Yes, it presents the most current scholarship, and it's based on the New Revised Standard Version translation (the new standard of scholarly excellence in Bible versions). But The Access Bible takes an important further step. It's been carefully written and edited so that those new to the world of Bible study can just pick it up - and start reading. A unique feature of The Access Bible is the running commentary which is interspersed with the Bible text. Difficult concepts are clearly explained in terms which everyday readers can easily understand. There's no need to have a dictionary by your side when you're using The Access Bible. When a technical explanation is required, all of the terms are defined right on the page, as well as in a glossary at the back. History, social contexts, religious practices, the beliefs of ancient peoples - all are explained when the Bible text requires it. In addition, this new Bible was designed to contain all the background information needed by believers from a wide spectrum of churches. The Access Bible sets a new standard for ease of understanding. It's truly a companion for life's spiritual journey The Access Bible is available both with and without the Apocrypha.",,0,N/A,0,en

All the People in the Bible,Richard R. Losch,Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing,2008-05-13,"""More than any other book, the Bible offers an amazing collection of fascinating characters ranging from the holiest of the holy to some of the most depraved scoundrels imaginable. Many are mentioned only in passing, yet history and archaeology can often fill in the blanks and flesh them out as exciting human beings. For this reason we have in many cases been able to tell much more about them than the Bible alone reveals."" -- Richard R. Losch (from the preface)A comprehensive gathering of persons found in the Bible, including the Apocrypha, All the People in the Bible really delivers on its title: literally all of the Bible's characters appear in this fascinating reference work. From the first article on Aaron to the final entry on Zophar, Richard Losch details each person in a lively narrative style.The bulk of the book consists of Losch's A-Z articles covering the familiar and the not-so-familiar figures in Scripture. Names of people who are found only in genealogies or who had no significant effect on history are included solely in the alphabetical listing starting on page 452. That listing, ""All the People in the Bible and Apocrypha,"" includes pronunciations, brief identifications, and biblical references. Persons covered in greater detail in the main part of the book are identified in bold print.Losch's intriguing look at all the people in the Bible is anything but a dry reference work.

"Bible Workbook, Volume 2: New Testament",Catherine B. Walker,Ravenio Books,2016-08-20,"Although this workbook was originally planned for high school Bible classes meeting every day for a semester, it has found a wider use by various age groups in churches and colleges and by individuals desiring direction in their personal Bible study. The workbook was first produced as a method of giving notes and assignment questions quickly, thereby leaving more valuable classroom time for explanations, discussions, and student participation. The workbook may be placed in a regulation size binder. Separate pages can be handed in when completed. Other notes, assigned papers, and themes can be placed throughout the notebook. This is in no sense a textbook. It is hoped that no one will make the completion of the workbook a goal in itself but that the questions and notes may stimulate and guide each student in searching and knowing the Bible. The questions do not cover all the important points in any chapter. It is hoped, however, in the course of the study that all the main New Testament teachings will be brought out. Most schools give about half the semester to the life of Christ in the gospels and the rest of the semester to Acts and the epistles. Three or four chapters a day are usually assigned. In order to cover all the main incidents in the life of Christ special emphasis has been chosen in each gospel. Studying Mark first, in four or five lessons, as a short survey of Christ’s life has proved a good start for students unfamiliar with the Bible. The main miracles and chief characters then become familiar. Matthew is more easily understood after having had this simple introduction to Christ through Mark. Matthew is studied with emphasis on the teachings of Christ. Students should become familiar with all unfamiliar terms. Places mentioned should be located on the map. In Luke the parables and new stories are especially noted. The more intimate revelation of Jesus given in John’s gospel should prove a personal blessing to each student. Students should become familiar with the content of the simple chronological outline of Christ’s life as drawn from the four gospels that has been included in this edition. The Acts and the epistles are taken in the order they appear in the Bible. The missionary message in Acts and the Christian life teachings in the epistles have been kept in mind. Since time prohibits the complete study of each epistle, a limited number of chapters have been selected for study. Several teachers assign the Revelation as parallel reading giving a brief preview at the time of the assignment and a discussion of the book after it has been read. It is my prayer that all who use this book will be guided by it into a deeper, more personal, knowledge of the living Word, the Lord Jesus Christ, as well as the written Word, the Bible. It is the teacher’s wonderful privilege to bring from the Scripture its vital, interesting message for personal living. Students sometimes come from a Bible course saying, “Yes, we learn the facts all right, but that Book is too dull and boring for me.” That teacher had failed to take advantage of a most wonderful privilege. The Book that was written to give men life should be taught in a way that presents real life to men. May students come from your class with the appreciation expressed in these comments: “Bible is the most interesting course I’ve ever had.” “I surely have learned to love the Bible. I read it every day, now.” “Studying Bible has not only cleared up questions that have always puzzled me but it has helped me so much in my everyday living.” “It was through that Bible course that I became a Christian. I wouldn’t have missed it for anything.” CATHERINE B. WALKER.",Religion,150,N/A,0,en

Foundations,Robby Gallaty,Lifeway Church Resources,2015-11,"The Bible, in and of itself, is a miracle. Think about it -- over centuries of time, God supernaturally moved upon a number of men's hearts, resulting in them writing down the exact words of God. God then led His people to recognize these divine writings and to distinguish them from everything else that has ever been written. Then God's people brought these 66 books together. The preservation and survival of the Bible is as miraculous as its writing. Then God gave men technological knowledge to copy and transmit the Bible so that all people could have it. All of this took place because God has something to say to you. With Foundations, you can read through all 66 of the miraculous books of the Bible in one year, while still having the flexibility of reading 5 days per week.

Within its covers lies the knowledge of God and of eternal life. It is the place where Jesus is revealed to us and where we see ourselves. Like the fields of Boaz in the book of Ruth, it is full of heaven-sent bread, open to us to come, glean, and feed upon its riches. It is a home report of heaven and a guide for getting there. The Bible truly stands alone. But perhaps Christians do not agree on which edition of the Bible is the best in the world. Having looked over the following pages, I think I may have found it. This is a study Bible whose additional articles, notes, tables, and quotations have only one purpose: to place the text of Scripture in the highest possible prominence and to help us understand it in the clearest possible way. For serious followers of Christ, the Bible is indispensable; for serious students of the Bible this edition will soon become indispensable also.

Liquid Scripture,Jeffrey S. Siker,Fortress Press,2017-09-01,"The electronic Bible is here to stay‒‒packaged in software on personal computers, available as apps on tablets and cell phones. Increasingly, students look at glowing screens to consult the Bible in class, and congregants do the same in Bible study and worship. Jeffrey S. Siker asks, what difference does it make to our experience of Scripture if we no longer hold a book in our hands, if we again “scroll” through Scripture? How does the “flow” of electronic Scripture change our perception of the Bible’s authority and significance? Siker discusses the difference made when early Christians adopted the codex rather than the scroll and Gutenberg began the mass production of printed Bibles. He also reviews the latest research on how the reading brain processes digital texts and how churches use digital Bibles, including American Bible Society research and his own surveys of church leaders. Siker asks, does the proliferation of electronic translations reduce the perceived seriousness of Scripture? Does it promote an individualistic response to the Bible? How does the change from a physical Bible affect liturgical practice? His synthesis of the advantages and risks of the digitized Bible merit serious reflection in classrooms and churches alike.",Religion,317,N/A,0,en

This Bible edition concentrates on the translation of all chapters and verses of both the Old and New Testaments. Sample chapter: Book of John About this book John's Gospel is one of the four Gospels. 'Gospel' means 'good news'. The Gospels are the books that tell us about Jesus' life on earth. John was one of the three disciples who knew the Lord Jesus Christ best. John called himself 'the disciple that Jesus loved'. We think that John wrote his Gospel in the city called Ephesus. He wrote it some years after Matthew, Mark and Luke wrote their Gospels. He wrote it about 70 years after Christ's birth. John's Gospel is different from the other three Gospels. It does not describe many things that the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke do describe. But it does include many things that are not in the other Gospels. John tells us much more about who Jesus was. John shows us Jesus as the Son of God - the only person who can cause us to live. John teaches us more about God's Spirit, too. At the beginning of his Gospel, John calls Jesus 'the Word'. Chapter 1 The Word became human 1 In the beginning, the Word was already there. The Word was with God. The Word was God. 2 He was with God in the beginning. 3 God made all things by the Word. God did not make anything without him. 4 It is the Word who causes us to live. And because of this, he was the light to all people. 5 The light shines in the dark, and the dark cannot put out the light.",,828,N/A,0,en

The Strategic Smorgasbord of Postmodernity,Deborah Bowen,Cambridge Scholars Publishing,2011-05-25,"Contemporary Christian critique often talks about postmodernism apocalyptically, in terms of cultural crisis and decline; instead, the contributors to this volume believe that there is a new place for Christian entrées on the academic Smorgasbord of postmodernity, and they see the postmodern turn as an opportunity for fresh perspectives on the spiritual dimensions of reading literature. These twenty scholars are an eclectic group, differing in theological and theoretical commitments, but all identifying as Christian. In this collection they enter into dialogue with a wide range of contemporary literary theorists and theoretical perspectives, and offer new readings of primary texts informed by both these theoretical constructs and their Christian faith. ""The manuscript strikes out in important new directions in its sympathetic reading of postmodern theory from a Christian perspective, and, even more significantly, in its careful and measured dialogic approach to the relationship of Christian thought and contemporary literary theory."" Daniel Coleman, Canada Research Chair in Critical Ethnicity and Race Studies, Department of English and Cultural Studies, McMaster University ""Too often Christian literary critics and theologians have preemptively dismissed postmodern theory, even as secular critics have been equally dismissive about the contributions that the Christian faith tradition makes to the study of literature. This volume successfully brings these two worlds together in innovative, at times challenging, and always rich ways. I do not know of a similar volume in existence, a work that gathers in one convenient publication a wide-ranging set of discussions of contemporary literary theory by Christian scholars. The editor has gathered an impressive and important set of papers here, and I believe the volume will raise much interest and provoke a good deal of constructive debate.""

Holy Bible,S. Royle,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2016-06-01,"Welcome to As Told in the Bible - a collection of Bibles translated into clear, understandable, simple English. Our mission is to help people to read, understand, and apply the ""Word of God"" to their lives by providing Bibles in easy to read - simple modern English . These easy to read bibles are suitable for all ages and can be read with your traditional bible. This collection of easy-to-read Bibles aims to give today's reader's maximum understanding of the original bible text. They do not follow the traditional vocabulary and style found in the historic English Bible versions. Instead they attempt to present the biblical content and message of the bible in everyday, simple, modern English. These easy to read bibles are suitable for all ages and can be read with your traditional bible. Our mission is to help people to read, understand, and apply the ""Word of God"" to their lives by providing Bible Translations, Bible Commentaries, and Bible Studies in simple modern English. This Bible edition concentrates on the translation of all chapters and verses of both the Old and New Testaments. Sample chapter: Book of John About this book John's Gospel is one of the four Gospels. 'Gospel' means 'good news'. The Gospels are the books that tell us about Jesus' life on earth. John was one of the three disciples who knew the Lord Jesus Christ best. John called himself 'the disciple that Jesus loved'. We think that John wrote his Gospel in the city called Ephesus. He wrote it some years after Matthew, Mark and Luke wrote their Gospels. He wrote it about 70 years after Christ's birth. John's Gospel is different from the other three Gospels. It does not describe many things that the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke do describe. But it does include many things that are not in the other Gospels. John tells us much more about who Jesus was. John shows us Jesus as the Son of God - the only person who can cause us to live. John teaches us more about God's Spirit, too. At the beginning of his Gospel, John calls Jesus 'the Word'. Chapter 1 The Word became human 1 In the beginning, the Word was already there. The Word was with God. The Word was God. 2 He was with God in the beginning. 3 God made all things by the Word. God did not make anything without him. 4 It is the Word who causes us to live. And because of this, he was the light to all people. 5 The light shines in the dark, and the dark cannot put out the light. 6 God sent a man. His name was John. 7 He came to tell people about the light. God wanted everyone to believe what John said. 8 John himself was not that light. God sent him to tell people about the light. 9 The true light, that gives light to every person, was coming into the world. 10 The Word was in the world. God made the world by him. But the world did not know who he was. 11 He came to what was his own. But his own people did not accept him. 12 But some people did accept him. Some people did believe who he was. So, he gave authority to those people so that they could become God's children. 13 These children were not born in the usual human way. They were not born because of what any people wanted. They were not born because of what any man decided. No! They were born from God. 14 The Word became human. He lived among us. We saw how great and how good he is. He is great and good as only the Father's one true Son can be. He is completely kind. He is full of what is true. 15 John told people about the Word. He shouted, 'This is the man that I told you about. He comes after me. But he is greater than I am. He was there before I was born.' 16 The Word is full of everything that we need. All of us have received from him. We have received one good thing after another good thing. 17 God gave his rules by Moses. But God has been kind to us by Jesus Christ.",,828,N/A,0,en

Should the Old Testament be read by itself or in light of the New Testament?

Three Free Sins,Steve Brown,Simon and Schuster,2012-02-07,"“Hilarious, honest, and full of the hard-won wisdom...At its core is this truth: real change only happens when we realize God loves us whether we change or not.” —Susan E. Isaacs, author of Angry Conversations With God From a popular pastor and radio host—Three Free Sins teaches that the only people who make any progress toward being better are those who know that God will still love them, regardless of how good they are. This book is about the misguided obsession with the management of sin that cripples too many Christians. It’s about the view that religion is all about sin…about how to hide side sin or how to stop sinning all together. In the Introduction, the author toys good-naturedly with an agitated caller on his radio program, teasing him in a segment where he offers three free sins. The offer is real. Not that Steve has the power to forgive sins, but he wants to make the point that Jesus has made the offer to cover all of our sins – not just three. Chapter one, titled “Teaching Frogs to Fly,” is even better. The gist of this chapter is that you can’t teach frogs to fly, just like you can’t teach people not to sin. Steve tells a story about a guy who has a frog, and he’s convinced he can teach the frog how to fly. The man keeps throwing the frog up in the air or up against walls – all to the poor frog’s demise. The message is that even though people can be better, they can never not sin—just like a frog can never learn to fly, no matter how much pressure is put on it. Steve continues through the book to show readers that while they can never manage sin, they can relax in knowing that they are completely forgiven—not just of three, but of all.",Religion,200,5,1,en

Ecclesiastes,Justin S. Holcomb,Crossway,2016-06-14,"The Knowing the Bible series is a resource designed to help Bible readers better understand and apply God’s Word. These 12-week studies lead participants through books of the Bible and are made up of four basic components: (1) reflection questions help readers engage the text at a deeper level; (2) “Gospel Glimpses” highlight the gospel of grace throughout the book; (3) “Whole-Bible Connections” show how any given passage connects to the Bible’s overarching story of redemption, culminating in Christ; and (4) “Theological Soundings” identify how historic orthodox doctrines are taught or reinforced throughout Scripture. With contributions from an array of influential pastors and church leaders, these gospel-centered studies will help Christians see and cherish the message of God’s grace on every page of the Bible. The book of Ecclesiastes powerfully conveys the meaninglessness of life without God. In this accessible study through a book of the Bible that is often viewed as confusing, Justin Holcomb helps Christians understand the necessity of fearing God in a fallen and frustrating world, pointing us to God’s ultimate mission to restore creation from the curse through the power of the gospel.",Religion,121,N/A,0,en

How did you feel afterwards: ashamed, stupid, stubborn, or did you just not care? There are lots of topics out there where people claim to be experts and in reality some of those people know very little about what they are talking about. One of these areas is the Bible, and after thousands of years, misinformation and false teachings have led many Christians and non Christians alike to believe that there are truths about the Bible that are in fact not associated with or even in the Bible at all. Through a writing style that is both personable and easy to follow, Brandon K Griffin, using a combination of personal experiences, pop culture, and scripture, looks at ten ideas that people believe are in the Bible but really aren't.

The New Testament - King James Version,The Foundation Bible,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2015-12-21,"Volume 4 A return to elegant simplicity - Foundation Bibles look like they're meant to be read, not referenced """"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."""" ""-Albert Einstein"" The Foundation Bible has been designed to reinvent how we interact with the Bible - natural paragraphs, large text, real paper, and free of verses and encyclopedic conventions you see in Bibles today. There are no alterations or additions to existing translations. There is already a natural eloquence to the stories in the Bible - it's time to get out of the way. """"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."""" ""-Leonardo da Vinci"" Verses, chapter headings, translation notes - virtually everything surrounding the text was not by the original Biblical authors. Foundation Bibles can help you encounter the text in a totally new light. By forgoing everything besides the narrative itself, you can read the Bible through like a novel. Catch the excitement of the great flood, Jerusalem's fall, the ten plagues of Egypt, and all the Biblical stories that have been cemented in the backdrop of history. By stripping away the encyclopedic additions of conventional scripture, you actually get a more accessible, culturally relevant Bible. Foundation Bibles are not about reducing - they are about refining. Elegance is always in style """"A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."""" ""-Antoine de Saint-Exupery, The Little Prince (Le Petit Prince)"" You don't have to be a Christian to see the quality and value of these texts. The design reaches beyond book enthusiasts or even religion. Some of the most enthusiastic supporters of The Foundation Bible are not religious at all, but want to understand the stories that have shaped our world and want to become a better-rounded, more informed person. Many people want to read the Bible, but it's too difficult, too unenjoyable. The problem isn't even the message - it is the presentation. There is plenty of drama, action - even romance - to engage the most casual reader. Most of the intimidation people feel about scriptures comes from the structure rather than the content. We want something that can everyone, Christian or not, would love. People that support us aren't part of a market - they're part of a movement. This softcover paperback is intended for reading on the move, to be given as gifts, or to have something easy to curl up on the couch with. This edition is printed on demand through CreateSpace, which is owned by Amazon. The obvious advantages are speed and cost, and the ""entire"" manufacturing process is directed through CreateSpace.

Love Me Anyway,Jared C. Wilson,Baker Books,2021-09-21,"There may be no more powerful desire in the human heart than to be loved. And not just loved, but loved anyway. In spite of what we've done or left undone, in spite of the ways we have failed or floundered. We long for an unconditional, lavish love that we know intrinsically we don't deserve. If you are tired, sad, yet always longing, bestselling author Jared C. Wilson has incredible news for you: that kind of love actually exists, and it is actually something you can experience--whether or not you're in a romantic relationship. In his signature reflective, conversational, and often humorous style, Wilson unpacks 1 Corinthians 13 to show us what real love looks like. Through engaging stories and touching anecdotes, he paints a picture of an extravagant God who not only puts the desire for love into our very souls but fulfills those desires in striking, life-changing ways.",Religion,199,N/A,0,en

The Message of Lamentations,Christopher J. H. Wright,Inter-Varsity Press,2023-08-17,"The destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians in 587 BC is the likely setting for the book of Lamentations. This was the most traumatic event in the whole of Old Testament history, with its extreme human suffering, devastation of the ancient city, national humiliation, and the undermining of all that was thought to be theologically guaranteed - the Davidic monarchy, the city of Zion, and the temple of the God of Israel. It is out of that unspeakable pain that Lamentations speaks, in poetry of astonishing beauty and intricacy, though soaked in tears. If we neglect this book, says Chris Wright, we miss the challenge and reward of wrestling with the massive theological issues that permeate it. How can suffering be endured alongside faith in an all-loving, good God? Even if these events are recognized and accepted as God's judgment, has not the flood of brutality and evil gone beyond all bounds? If anarchy, death and destruction stalk the land, can the centre of Israel's faith hold? Wright shows that as Christian readers we must not, and cannot, isolate Lamentations from the rest of the Bible; and equally, that we should not read the rest of the Bible without Lamentations. We must still let it speak for itself, as a book for today.",Religion,175,N/A,0,en

Many Christian preachers today largely neglect the Old Testament in their sermons, focusing instead on the Gospel accounts of Jesus’ teachings and activities. As Fleming Rutledge points out, however, when the New Testament is disconnected from the context of the Old Testament, it is like a house with no foundation, a plant with no roots, or a pump with no well. In this powerful collection of sixty sermons on the Old Testament, Rutledge expounds on a number of familiar Old Testament passages featuring Abraham, Samuel, David, Elijah, Job, Jonah, and many other larger-than-life figures. Applying these texts to contemporary life and Christian theology, she highlights the ways in which their multivocal messages can be heard in all their diversity while still proclaiming univocally, “Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One.”",Religion,546,N/A,0,en

Yet the traditional approaches of apologetics are often outmoded in an age of profound disenchantment and distraction, unable to meet this pressing need. This winsome apologetics book for a new generation makes the case that Christianity offers a compelling explanatory framework for making sense of our world. Pastor and writer Gavin Ortlund believes it is essential to appeal not only to the mind but also to the heart and the imagination as we articulate the beauty of the gospel. Why God Makes Sense in a World That Doesn't reimagines four classical theistic arguments--cosmological, teleological, moral, and Christological--making a cumulative case for God as the best framework for understanding the storied nature of reality. The book suggests that Christian theism can explain such things as the elegance of math, the beauty of music, and the value of love.

Reading the Bible Badly,Karl Allen Kuhn,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2020-08-31,"Reading the Bible Badly exposes how American Christians misunderstand and misuse the Bible, reading Scripture through ""lenses"" that distort its true character. As Americans, we often read the Bible's stories and instruction unmindful of their historical and cultural settings, disregarding the testimony of our spiritual ancestors, and finding mostly a mirror image of our own values and selves in Scripture. Some of us insist that the Bible must be the ""inerrant word of God,"" historically factual in every way and doctrinally infallible, and overlook so much of what makes Scripture beautiful and relevant. Others follow a lectionary that dices and splices Scripture into bite-size morsels for Sunday worship, divorces passages from their biblical settings, strikes verses deemed offensive, and undermines the literary artistry that is the lifeblood of Scripture's profound revelation. Many of us read the Bible in fear, warping our witness to Jesus and tragically neglecting Scripture's ever-persistent call to compassion, hospitality, and love. We come to the Bible looking for simple rules that affirm our sense of right and wrong, while missing the point of what Jesus taught about wisdom and true righteousness.

The Queer Evangelist,Cheri DiNovo,Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press,2021-05-11,"A queer minister, politician and staunch activist for LGBTQ rights, Cheri DiNovo went from living on the streets as a teenager to performing the first legalized same-sex marriage registered in Canada in 2001. From rights for queer parents to banning conversion therapy, her story will inspire people (queer or ally) to not only resist the system—but change it. In The Queer Evangelist, Rev. Dr. Cheri DiNovo (CM) shares her origins as a young socialist activist in the 1960s, and her rise to ordained minister in the ‘90s and New Democratic member of provincial parliament. During her tenure representing Parkdale-High Park in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2006 to 2017, DiNovo passed more LGBTQ bills than anyone in Canadian history. She describes the behind-the-scenes details of major changes to Canadian law, including Toby’s Law: the first Transgender Rights legislation in North America. She also passed bills banning conversion therapy, proclaiming parent equality for LGBTQ parents, and for enshrining Trans Day of Remembrance into Ontario law. Every year on November 20th in the legislature, the provincial government is mandated to observe a minute of silence while Trans murders and suicides are detailed. Interspersed with her political work, DiNovo describes her conversion to religious life with radical intimacy, including her theological work and her ongoing struggle with the Christian Right. Cheri DiNovo's story shows how queer people can be both people of faith and critics of religion, illustrating how one can resist and change repressive systems from within. “Living on the street, using drugs, abandoned by the adults in her life, all while identifying as ‘queer’ in a hostile world—any one of these things could have unravelled many of us. Cheri hauled herself up and not only survived but thrived. I love that this strong, brilliant, competent woman has told her story so honestly.” —Kathleen Wynne, former premier of Ontario",Biography & Autobiography,257,N/A,0,en

The Bible as Improv,Ron Martoia,Zondervan,2010-02-23,"Every Christian desires to follow the Bible. But many of the things the Bible teaches—such as its instructions on how to treat slaves or its direction to sell everything one owns—seem to have little relevance to modern life. Picking and choosing what applies today leaves many readers frustrated and confused.Is it possible that Christians are asking the wrong question of Scripture? Ron Martoia suggests that the narrative sweep of the Bible is lost when it is reduced to quips and maxims. Faithfulness to the text requires faithfulness to its narrative form. Reflecting a high view of Scripture and a profound belief in its power to change lives, Martoia helps readers read the Bible so that its story shapes their own stories. In this new light, readers can move beyond the confusion about what is true today and what is “outdated.”With a passion for seeing people experience revolutionary change in their spiritual lives, Martoia shows readers how to look at the big picture of the Bible.

God Can't,Thomas Jay Oord,SacraSage Press,2019-01-05,"Hurting people ask heart-felt questions about God and suffering. Some ""answers"" they receive appeal to mystery: “God’s ways are not our ways”. Some answers say God allows evil for a greater purpose. Some say evil is God's punishment. The usual answers fail. They don't support the truth that God loves everyone all the time. God Can't gives a believable answer to why a good and powerful God doesn't prevent evil. Author Thomas Jay Oord says God’s love is inherently uncontrolling. God loves everyone and everything, so God can't control anyone or anything. This means God cannot prevent evil singlehandedly. God can’t stop evildoers, whether human, animal, organism, or inanimate objects and forces. In God Can't, Oord gives a plausible reason why some are healed, but many others are not. God always works to heal everyone, but sometimes our bodies, organisms, or other creatures do not cooperate with God's healing work. Or the conditions of creation are not right for the healing God wants to do. Some people think God causes or allows suffering to teach us lessons or build our character. God Can't disagrees. Oord says God squeezes good from the evil God didn’t want in the first place. God uses pain and suffering without willing or even allowing it. Most people think God can overcome evil singlehandedly. In God Can't, Oord says God needs cooperation for love to reign now and later. This leads to a better view of the afterlife called “relentless love.” It rejects traditional ideas of heaven, hell, and annihilation. Relentless love holds to the possibility all creatures and all creation will respond to God’s love. God Can't is written in understandable language. As a world-renown theologian, Thomas Jay Oord brings credibility to the book’s radical ideas. He explains these ideas through true stories, illustrations, and scripture. God Can't is for those who want answers to tragedy, abuse, and other evils that make sense! What They're Saying... “If conventional notions of God make less and less sense to you, you’ll find Thomas Jay Oord’s new book a breath of fresh air. Simply put, “God Can’t” presents an understanding of God that thoughtful, ethical people can believe in.” -- Brian D. McLaren, author of The Great Spiritual Migration ""I did not want this book to end. I wish Dr. Oord had written it 100 years ago, or 1000 years ago... To find your understanding of life and your love for God renewed, read this book."" -- Dr. Karen Strand Winslow, Ph.D., Biblical and Jewish Studies Professor of Bible, Azusa Pacific University ""As a clinical psychologist working with people in trauma, I owe Thomas Jay Oord an enormous debt of gratitude for recasting the so-called problem of evil in terms that are conceptually satisfying, theologically consistent, and pastorally liberating.” -- Dr Roger Bretherton- Principal Lecturer at the University of Lincoln (UK), Chair of the British Association of Christians in Psychology “Victims of trauma sometimes hear theological responses that imply their suffering is somehow “God’s will."" A more careful theological reflection on the nature of the power of a God who is love can help. Oord gives us a clear and compelling alternative in this profoundly insightful and admirably concrete and accessible book.” -- Dr. Anna Case-Winters, Professor of Theology at McCormick Theological Seminary “I know of no book that speaks to suffering with the depth of theological sophistication and psychological sensitivity as God Can’t. This book is a rare combination of depth and accessibility, truly written for the wounded. I recommend it to my students, parishioners, and therapy clients.” -- Dr. Brad D.

How Jesus Became God,Bart D. Ehrman,Harper Collins,2014-03-25,"New York Times bestselling author and Bible expert Bart Ehrman reveals how Jesus’s divinity became dogma in the first few centuries of the early church. The claim at the heart of the Christian faith is that Jesus of Nazareth was, and is, God. But this is not what the original disciples believed during Jesus’s lifetime—and it is not what Jesus claimed about himself. How Jesus Became God tells the story of an idea that shaped Christianity, and of the evolution of a belief that looked very different in the fourth century than it did in the first. A master explainer of Christian history, texts, and traditions, Ehrman reveals how an apocalyptic prophet from the backwaters of rural Galilee crucified for crimes against the state came to be thought of as equal with the one God Almighty, Creator of all things. But how did he move from being a Jewish prophet to being God? In a book that took eight years to research and write, Ehrman sketches Jesus’s transformation from a human prophet to the Son of God exalted to divine status at his resurrection. Only when some of Jesus’s followers had visions of him after his death—alive again—did anyone come to think that he, the prophet from Galilee, had become God. And what they meant by that was not at all what people mean today. Written for secular historians of religion and believers alike, How Jesus Became God will engage anyone interested in the historical developments that led to the affirmation at the heart of Christianity: Jesus was, and is, God.",Religion,297,3,2,en

Don't Call It a Comeback (Foreword by D. A. Carson),Kevin DeYoung,Crossway,2011-01-06,"Recent cultural interest in evangelicalism has led to considerable confusion about what the term actually means. Many young Christians are tempted to discard the label altogether. But evangelicalism is not merely a political movement in decline or a sociological phenomenon on the rise, as it has sometimes been portrayed. It is, in fact, a helpful theological profile that manifests itself in beliefs, ethics, and church life. DeYoung and other key twenty- and thirty-something evangelical Christian leaders present Don't Call It a Comeback: The Same Evangelical Faith for a New Day to assert the stability, relevance, and necessity of Christian orthodoxy today. This book introduces young, new, and under-discipled Christians to the most essential and basic issues of faith in general and of evangelicalism in particular. Kevin DeYoung and contributors like Russell Moore, Darrin Patrick, Justin Taylor, Thabiti Anyabwile, and Tim Challies examine what evangelical Christianity is and does within the broad categories of history, theology, and practice. They demonstrate that evangelicalism is still biblically and historically rooted and remains the same framework for faith that we need today.",Religion,254,2,1,en

T&T Clark Companion to the Bible and Film,Richard Walsh,Bloomsbury Publishing,2018-06-28,"The first decades of the twenty-first century saw a resurgence of the biblical epic film, such as Noah and Exodus: Gods and Kings, which was in turn accompanied by a growth of biblical film criticism. This companion surveys that field of study by framing it in light of significant and recent biblical films as well as the voices of key biblical film critics. Non-Hollywood and seemingly “non-biblical” films also come under investigation. The contributors concentrate on three points: “context”, focusing on the 'Bible in' specific film genres and cultural situations; “theory”, applying theory from both religion and film studies, with an eye to their possible intersections; and “recent and significant texts”, reflecting on which texts and themes have been most important in 'biblical film' and which are currently at the fore. Exploring cinema across the globe, and accompanied by extended introductory essays for each of the three sections, this companion is an important resource for scholars in both film and biblical reception.",Religion,429,N/A,0,en
"The Gospel of Judas, Second Edition","Rodolphe Kasser, Marvin Meyer, Gregor Wurst, Francois Gaudard",National Geographic Books,2008-06-17,"For 1,600 years its message lay hidden. When the bound papyrus pages of this lost gospel finally reached scholars who could unlock its meaning, they were astounded. Here was a gospel that had not been seen since the early days of Christianity, and which few experts had even thought existed–a gospel told from the perspective of Judas Iscariot, history’s ultimate traitor. And far from being a villain, the Judas that emerges in its pages is a hero. In this radical reinterpretation, Jesus asks Judas to betray him. In contrast to the New Testament Gospels, Judas Iscariot is presented as a role model for all those who wish to be disciples of Jesus and is the one apostle who truly understands Jesus. Discovered by farmers in the 1970s in Middle Egypt, the codex containing the gospel was bought and sold by antiquities traders, secreted away, and carried across three continents, all the while suffering damage that reduced much of it to fragments. In 2001, it finally found its way into the hands of a team of experts who would painstakingly reassemble and restore it. The Gospel of Judas has been translated from its original Coptic to clear prose, and is accompanied by commentary that explains its fascinating history in the context of the early Church, offering a whole new way of understanding the message of Jesus Christ.",Religion,228,N/A,0,en

Lottie lives in Vivelle, a vibrant city where life exists in brilliant technicolor and nearly everyone is born with magic, including Lottie. But when tragedy strikes, color is stripped from Lottie’s heart and from the world around her. Taken in by her reclusive uncle, Lottie moves into Forsaken, a vast manor located in the gray wasteland between the Land of the Living and the Land of the Dead. There, Lottie discovers more secrets and mysteries than she ever dreamed possible. Even so, she is filled with nothing but despair.

22 Britannia Road,Amanda Hodgkinson,Penguin,2011-04-28,"A tour de force that echoes modern classics like Suite Francaise and The Postmistress. ""Housekeeper or housewife?"" the soldier asks Silvana as she and eight- year-old Aurek board the ship that will take them from Poland to England at the end of World War II. There her husband, Janusz, is already waiting for them at the little house at 22 Britannia Road. But the war has changed them all so utterly that they'll barely recognize one another when they are reunited. ""Survivor,"" she answers. Silvana and Aurek spent the war hiding in the forests of Poland. Wild, almost feral Aurek doesn't know how to tie his own shoes or sleep in a bed. Janusz is an Englishman now-determined to forget Poland, forget his own ghosts from the way, and begin a new life as a proper English family. But for Silvana, who cannot escape the painful memory of a shattering wartime act, forgetting is not a possibility. One of the most searing debuts to come along in years, 22 Britannia Road. is the wrenching chronicle of how these damaged people try to become, once again, a true family.

So when she discovers a magical dream world called Reverie in the woods near her home, Andrea jumps at the chance to escape her pain and go inside. But the cost of admission is high: Andrea must give up a memory in order to enter. And she knows exactly which memory she'd like to give up. Once inside, Andrea discovers tent after tent of dreams come alive; she can fly on a gust of wind, brave swashbuckling pirates and search for buried treasure, reach for--and wish on--a tangible star, and much, much more. But Andrea soon realizes that not all of Reverie's dreams are meant to delight, and the Sandman behind the circus tents seems to have plans of his own. When Andrea finds a tent in which her brother's darkest nightmare has been brought to life, she realizes the dark truth: Reverie is not an escape; it's a trap. Will Andrea and her new friend Penny have what it takes to find Francis, figure out what's really going on in Reverie, and break free from this nightmarish dream world?

If it never troubles a man's conscience to spend a great deal of his time in questionable places of amusement and to take his family into places where there are degraded people for their own pleasure's sake, if he drives like Jehu all the week to make a dollar and moves like a snail toward spiritual things on the Sabbath- I believe that man is following the flesh; the divine nature is not in him; he is not walking after the Spirit, but after the flesh. Oh, God hates a sham! It means a good deal to be a Christian, and if a person is going to be a Christian, let him put off the old man with all his deeds and put on the new man with the righteousness of Christ. That is the kind of Christians we need at the present time, for to be carnally-minded is death; but to be spiritually-minded is life and peace.",Christian life,134,N/A,0,en

However, some of these challenges are noticeably more common today, and the topic is currently of particular interest among evangelicals. In this volume, highly regarded biblical scholar Craig Blomberg offers an accessible and nuanced argument for the Bible's reliability in response to the extreme views about Scripture and its authority articulated by both sides of the debate. He believes that a careful analysis of the relevant evidence shows we have reason to be more confident in the Bible than ever before. As he traces his own academic and spiritual journey, Blomberg sketches out the case for confidence in the Bible in spite of various challenges to the trustworthiness of Scripture, offering a positive, informed, and defensible approach.",Religion,258,N/A,0,en

Forty Fathers,Tessa Lloyd,Douglas & McIntyre,2019-10-19,"When Tessa Lloyd’s sons-in-law became fathers, she searched for resources that would help inspire them—especially parenting stories from other fathers. However, that book didn’t seem to exist. As a counsellor for children and families, Lloyd understood the ways a father-child relationship can have a lasting effect through the generations. Seeing a need, Lloyd decided to gather these stories herself. This resulting volume collects the stories and portraits of forty Canadian fathers who open up about both their own fathers and their deeply personal parenting experiences. This diverse group includes Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, writer Lawrence Hill, academic Niigaan Sinclair, athlete Trevor Linden, restaurateur Vikram Vij, anthropologist Wade Davis, musician Alan Doyle, artist Robert Bateman and philanthropist Rick Hansen. The contributors reflect on their varied parenting experiences and challenges, including parenting while incarcerated, parenting across cultural barriers, parenting through divorce, parenting while transgender, parenting as a celebrity and parenting with a disability. Many common themes emerge throughout the stories, including the process of overcoming cultural messages that encourage men to be strong, authoritarian and emotionally unavailable. The stories are extraordinarily candid and vulnerable, as the fathers describe their own failings, regrets and childhood traumas, as well as the humbling process of trying to do better. In one anecdote, Dr. Greg Wells describes the experience of meeting another father walking the empty streets at three a.m. with an infant, and how that moment of shared recognition gave him strength at a difficult time. The stories in this book offer a similar glimpse into the shared experiences and trials of fatherhood, but also offer fascinating reflections on the more universal experiences of finding one’s place within a family and striving to be a better person for the sake of others.",Family & Relationships,374,N/A,0,en

The Book of Giants,,N/A,2015-08,"Take a journey with the artist and writer Petar Meseldzija, who tells how he was allowed unparalleled access through the Invisible Curtain and into the land of giants. A year in the making, this book's sixteen paintings and nearly ninety drawings bring to life Petar's experiences on this journey and secrets uncovered, going back to ancient times. He shares stories of new discoveries that free giants from the murky abyss of myth and a forgotten past. Told in three stages, The Book of Giants includes the illustrated stories The Giants Are Coming, recounting a dynamic clash that lasted one hundred years; The Little Kingdom, where a giant befriends a nation of humans and becomes their adamant protector against ferocious invaders; The Northern Giants, who embrace the warrior spirit through countless battles; Giant Velles, the story of ignorance and how the strength of goodness perseveres; and The Great Forest, wherein the author discovers little creatures called the keppetz and relates his experiences spent with ogres while on his quest to meet the Golden One and to determine the purpose of his journey. Through the strength of his own power, he discovers his blessings, his limitations and finally his personal myth. Furthermore, you will discover why giants made a push into the underground, followed by their exodus and deliverance to a new land. You'll also learn why the myth of giants is still alive, why their time spent with humans remains elusive and why giants prefer to remain hidden in their world.

1–2 Timothy and Titus,Brian J. Tabb,Crossway,2017-06-20,"The Knowing the Bible series is a resource designed to help Bible readers better understand and apply God’s Word. These 12-week studies lead participants through books of the Bible and are made up of four basic components: (1) reflection questions that help readers engage the text at a deeper level; (2) “Gospel Glimpses” that highlight the gospel of grace throughout the book; (3) “Whole-Bible Connections” that show how any given passage connects to the Bible’s overarching story of redemption, culminating in Christ; and (4) “Theological Soundings” that identify how historic orthodox doctrines are taught or reinforced throughout Scripture. With contributions from an array of influential pastors and church leaders, these gospel-centered studies will help Christians see and cherish the message of God’s grace on every page of the Bible. The letters to Timothy and Titus are among Paul's most personal and practical epistles. The apostle writes to instruct these younger men in the importance of sound doctrine and to urge them to rebuke false teaching.

No More Faking Fine,Esther Fleece Allen,Zondervan,2017-01-10,"Scripture reveals a God who meets us where we are, not where we pretend to be. No More Faking Fine is your invitation to get honest with God through the life-giving language of lament. If you've ever been given empty clichés during challenging times, you know how painful it is to be misunderstood by well-meaning people. When life hurts, we often feel pressure--from others and ourselves--to keep it together, suck it up, or pray it away. But Scripture reveals a God who lovingly invites us to give honest voice to our emotions when life hits hard. For most of her life, Esther Fleece Allen believed she could bypass the painful emotions of her broken past by shutting them down altogether. She was known as an achiever and an overcomer on the fast track to success. But in silencing her pain, she robbed herself of the opportunity to be healed. Maybe you've done the same. Esther's journey into healing began when she discovered that God has given us a real-world way to deal with raw emotions and an alternative to the coping mechanisms that end up causing more pain. It's called lament--the gut-level, honest prayer that God never ignores, never silences, and never wastes. No More Faking Fine is your permission to lament, taking you on a journey down the unexpected pathway to true intimacy with God. Drawing from careful biblical study and hard-won insight, Esther reveals how to use God's own language to come closer to him as he leads us through our pain to the light on the other side, teaching you that: We are robbing ourselves of a divine mystery and a divine intimacy when we pretend to have it all together God does not expect us to be perfect; instead, he meets us where we are There is hope beyond your heartache, disappointment, and grief Like Esther, you'll soon find that when one person stops faking fine, it gives everyone else permission to do the same.",Religion,220,N/A,0,en

A lot of Christians take their story—the narratives that give rise to their beliefs—for granted. They pray, go to church, perhaps even read their Bible.

Author, pastor, and theologian Mike Horton unpacks the essential and basic beliefs that all Christians share in a way that is easy to understand and applicable to our lives today. And in a way that will make you excited to be a Christian! Core Christianity covers topics like: Jesus as both fully God and fully man. The doctrine of the Trinity. The goodness of God despite a broken world. The ways God speaks. The meaning of salvation. What is the Christian calling? Includes discussion questions for individual or group use.

When you introduce yourself to someone for the first time, you have an opportunity to define yourself. You disclose your name, profession, and interests. These factors help our culture define us, but are those answers enough? People are struggling in ten thousand ways because of identity issues. They can't help but ask, who am I? and why do I matter? Can our culture really provide meaningful answers to those questions, or do we need something deeper and more significant? Before asking, who am I? we need to be able to answer, who is God? If we can't answer the first question, we will never answer the second. The problem with our search for identity is that we are looking in all the wrong places. Scripture teaches that we are all made in the image of God. We do not define ourselves--the Creator does. We were all created to be known and loved by God. Once those answers are clear, we can move forward and discover all God has called us to be. Session topics: 1. Uniquely Created by God 2. Uniquely Broken by Sin 3. Transformed by the Gospel 4.

Lewis,Ballantine Books,1986-01-12,"“Captivating reading that builds the faith while it fills the mind with greatness.”—Sherwood Wirt, former editor, DECISION Magazine One of this century's greatest writers of fact, fiction, and fantasy explores, in utterly beautiful terms, questions of faith in the modern world: • On the experience of miracles • On silence and religious belief • On the assumed conflict between work and prayer • On the error of trying to lead “a good life” without Christ • On the necessity of dogma to religion • On the dangers of national repentance • On the commercialization of Christmas . . . and more “The searching mind and the poetic spirit of C.S. Lewis are readily evident in this collection of essays edited by his one-time secretary, Walter Hopper. Here the reader finds the tough-mind polemicist relishing the debate; here too the kindly teacher explaining a complex abstraction by means of clarifying analogies; here the public speaker addressing his varied audience with all the humility and grace of a man who knows how much more remains to be unknown.”—The New York Times Book Review",Philosophy,178,N/A,0,en

The Bible As It Was,James L. Kugel,Harvard University Press,1999-11-01,"This is a guide to the Hebrew Bible unlike any other. Leading us chapter by chapter through its most important stories--from the Creation and the Tree of Knowledge through the Exodus from Egypt and the journey to the Promised Land--James Kugel shows how a group of anonymous, ancient interpreters radically transformed the Bible and made it into the book that has come down to us today. Was the snake in the Garden of Eden the devil, or the Garden itself ""paradise""? Did Abraham discover monotheism, and was his son Isaac a willing martyr? Not until the ancient interpreters set to work. Poring over every little detail in the Bible's stories, prophecies, and laws, they let their own theological and imaginative inclinations radically transform the Bible's very nature. Their sometimes surprising interpretations soon became the generally accepted meaning. These interpretations, and not the mere words of the text, became the Bible in the time of Jesus and Paul or the rabbis of the Talmud. Drawing on such sources as the Dead Sea Scrolls, ancient Jewish apocrypha, Hellenistic writings, long-lost retellings of Bible stories, and prayers and sermons of the early church and synagogue, Kugel reconstructs the theory and methods of interpretation at the time when the Bible was becoming the bedrock of Judaism and Christianity. Here, for the first time, we can witness all the major transformations of the text and recreate the development of the Bible ""As It Was"" at the start of the Common era--the Bible as we know it.",Religion,700,N/A,0,en

What if Charles Spurgeon helped you prepare next Sunday’s sermon? Or what if you could talk over your preaching with Joseph Parker, Richard Baxter, Henry Ward Beecher and H. P. Liddon.

The Bible Tapestry,Laus Deo,Xlibris Corporation,2012-09-06,"When reading the Bible and focusing on particular chapters, books or verses it is easy for us to get immersed in the details and to momentarily lose our appreciation for the Bible as a whole. It is not prudent to take out one chapter, one verse or even one book and focus on it in isolation. Such a practice often leads to conflicting opinions and bitter debate. Understanding and studying the Bible as a whole is very important, because every chapter and every verse was written with the intention that it be read in context, in relation to the whole. God revealed the Bible to us as a text, not a picture or a scientific formula. The word text comes from the Greek word textus from which we get the word textile closely related to fabric. As is the case in a piece of fabric, all of the fibers of this text are woven together. The finished product can be considered a tapestry composed of many threads, which portrays an entire story. It is a story that moves in a linear fashion. One way to study the Bible is to examine the tapestry up close and to investigate and study each knot, every dye, perhaps even inspecting the reverse side to see how the knots have been tied. Many Bible scholars focus on each knot and every dye and are able to extract a great wealth of information out of each element. Our purpose in this study is to take a step back and look at the tapestry in its entirety. This is admittedly a limited view, but is also one of the many approaches to studying the Bible. Together the two volumes of the Bible Tapestry offer the reader the opportunity to complete the study covering the entire Bible in 365 daily readings. Volume I consists of days 1 through 208 covering the Books of Genesis through I & II Kings of the Old Testament and the Gospels through the Book of Romans in the New Testament.Volume II consists of days 209 through 365 covering the Books of I & II Chronicles to the Book of Malachi ending the Old Testament and the Books of I & II Corinthians to the Book of Revelation ending the New Testament.",Religion,745,N/A,0,en

The Otherworld and Beyond,J.R. Freeman,AuthorHouse,2018-05-15,"The world has been taught a systematic self-perpetuating form of thinking. People have become slaves to their minds, which control how they act and think within society. This mind control is more a result of tyranny than self-righteousness. Sadly, the educational system has forced this deceit upon everyone since birth. Societys main goal is controlling thoughts by dividing and conquering the mind, driving people more toward hate than love. This tyranny has been the separation of our identity. Love is within all DNA, but this systematic thinking has been destroying love in our consciousness. You can ask one simple question using the systematic self-perpetuating form of thinking, and the entire world will know the answer. No matter the language barrier, people are socially confined to their minds. We are all taught to socially accept certain people and not others. We tend to debate whether or not it is worthwhile to help someone, but we act quickly without thinking to help defenseless animals. It is possible to illuminate the idea within the program and destroy the evil lying within the recesses of the mind. It is a dark paradox of bitterness, jealousy, envy, lust, hatred, and loathing. You likely have heard this before many times but never thought it was inside of you. It is there, and it has been there forever, controlling you. It must be destroyed by our true identity. This book provokes the innermost truth in all people as one collective thought. Our current one-sided thought will never evolve into a higher consciousness. It is the destroyer rather than the maker of thoughts. It opposes the law of righteousness within the abstract of color. This opposition of color has risen within the walls of its own kind since 1681. It is the idea within the separation of the colors black and white. It still exists, whether anyone believes it or not. It thrives among conversations, gestures, and facial expressions. It is here.",Religion,351,N/A,0,en

"THE CROWN OF WILD OLIVE ALSO MUNERA PULVERIS PRE-RAPHAELITISM ARATRA PENTELICI THE ETHICS OF THE DUST FICTION, FAIR AND FOUL THE ELEMENTS OF DRAWING","JOHN RUSKIN, M.A.",BEYOND BOOKS HUB,2022-01-01,"Twenty years ago, there was no lovelier piece of lowland scenery in South England, nor any more pathetic in the world, by its expression of sweet human character and life, than that immediately bordering on the sources of the Wandle, and including the lower moors of Addington, and the villages of Beddington and Carshalton, with all their pools and streams. No clearer or diviner waters ever sang with constant lips of the hand which 'giveth rain from heaven;' no pastures ever lightened in spring time with more passionate blossoming; no sweeter homes ever hallowed the heart of the passer-by with their pride of peaceful gladness—fain-hidden—yet full-confessed. The place remains, or, until a few months ago, remained, nearly unchanged in its larger features; but, with deliberate mind I say, that I have never seen anything so ghastly in its inner tragic meaning,—not in Pisan Maremma—not by Campagna tomb,—not by the sand-isles of the Torcellan shore,—as the slow stealing of aspects of reckless, indolent, animal neglect, over the delicate sweetness of that English scene: nor is any blasphemy or impiety—any frantic saying or godless thought—more appalling to me, using the best power of judgment I have to discern its sense and scope, than the insolent defilings of those springs by the human herds that drink of them. Just where the welling of stainless water, trembling and pure, like a body of light, enters the pool of Carshalton, cutting itself a radiant channel down to the gravel, through warp of feathery weeds, all waving, which it traverses with its deep threads of clearness, like the chalcedony in moss-agate, starred here and there with white grenouillette; just in the very rush and murmur of the first spreading currents, the human wretches of the place cast their street and house foulness; heaps of dust and slime, and broken shreds of old metal, and rags of putrid clothes; they having neither energy to cart it away, nor decency enough to dig it into the ground, thus shed into the stream, to diffuse what venom of it will float and melt, far away, in all places where God meant those waters to bring joy and health. And, in a little pool, behind some houses farther in the village, where another spring rises, the shattered stones of the well, and of the little fretted channel which was long ago built and traced for it by gentler hands, lie scattered, each from each, under a ragged bank of mortar, and scoria; and brick-layers' refuse, on one side, which the clean water nevertheless chastises to purity; but it cannot conquer the dead earth beyond; and there, circled and coiled under festering scum, the stagnant edge of the pool effaces itself into a slope of black slime, the accumulation of indolent years. Half-a-dozen men, with one day's work, could cleanse those pools, and trim the flowers about their banks, and make every breath of summer air above them rich with cool balm; and every glittering wave medicinal, as if it ran, troubled of angels, from the porch of Bethesda. But that day's work is never given, nor will be; nor will any joy be possible to heart of man, for evermore, about those wells of English waters.",Fiction,912,N/A,0,en

Evaluating our crowd by the standard of the Word of God may sometimes cost us some friends, and they may accuse us of abandoning them.

Godly Heretics,Marc DiPaolo,McFarland,2013-03-21,"When computers freeze, they are ""rebooted"" and soon working properly again. Similarly, legendary thinkers throughout history have argued that Christianity should start fresh by recapturing the humanitarian spirit of Jesus' original message. These include such disparate individuals as Thomas Jefferson, Oscar Wilde, Charles Dickens, Walt Whitman, Friedrich Nietzsche, Leo Tolstoy, George Bernard Shaw, and the religious leaders of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Surprisingly enough, even classic television shows and films meant to be entertaining--Lost, Battlestar Galactica, It's a Wonderful Life, Groundhog Day, Decalogue, and A Charlie Brown Christmas--are attempts to apply the basic principles of Christianity to modern times. This book offers new essays by scholars of literature, film, history, theology and philosophy examining how various thinkers and storytellers over time have conceived of a reinvented Christianity. In confronting this controversial idea, this book examines how unorthodox interpretations of the Bible can be some of the most valid, how visions of Jesus as a revolutionary may be the most historically sound, and how compassionate Christians such as Origen have wrestled with the eternal questions of the existence of evil, the gift of free will and the promise of universal salvation.",Religion,275,N/A,0,en

"Young, Restless, Reformed",Collin Hansen,Crossway,2008-03-17,"From places like John Piper's den, Al Mohler's office, and Jonathan Edwards's college, Christianity Today journalist Collin Hansen investigates what makes today's young Calvinists tick. Church-growth strategies and charismatic worship have fueled the bulk of evangelical growth in America for decades. While baby boomers have flocked to churches that did not look or sound like church, it seems these churches do not so broadly capture the passions of today's twenty-something evangelicals. In fact, a desire for transcendence and tradition among young evangelicals has contributed to a Reformed resurgence. For nearly two years, Christianity Today journalist Collin Hansen visited the chief schools, churches, and conferences of this growing movement. He sought to describe its members and ask its leading pastors and theologians about the causes and implications of the Calvinist resurgence. The result, Young, Restless, Reformed, shows common threads in their diverse testimonies and suggests what tomorrow's church might look like when these young evangelicals become pastors or professors.",Religion,162,3,1,en

Power in the Pulpit,"Jerry Vines, James L. Shaddix",Moody Publishers,1999-06-10,"The call to preach is just that- a call to preach. The call to preach, however, is more than just preaching. The call to preach is a call to prepare. Too many pastors have refrained from preparation while they await the Holy Spirit to do all of the work. God expects preachers to prepare sermons as much as possible and allow Him to prepare the preachers. Join Dr. Jerry Vines and Dr. Jim Shaddix as they achieve a balanced approach to teaching sermon preparation in Power in the Pulpit. This book combines the essential perspectives of a pastor of forty years with another pastor who also devotes daily time to training pastors in the context of theological education. Thus, Power in the Pulpit is a practical preaching help from a pastoral perspective in the tradition where expository preaching is a paramount and frequent event in the life of the local church. Power in the Pulpit is the combined work of Dr. Vines's two earlier publications on preaching: A Practical Guide to Sermon Preparation (Moody Press, 1985) and A Guide to Effective Sermon Delivery (Moody Press, 1986). Dr. Shaddix carefully organizes and supplements the material to offer this useful resource which closes the gap between classroom theory and what a pastor experiences in his weekly sermon preparation.",Religion,509,N/A,0,en

God Whispers,Liz Thompson,First Edition Design Pub.,2013-04-15,"Where are you at this moment? If your first reaction was to say, ""I am in a book store,"" or ""I am in my recliner,"" I would likely say the same thing. But what I am asking is where you are in your faith walk with God. Do you feel far from Him? Maybe you walk closely with Him and hear His voice in your life. Are you in a listening mode or are you tuned into the ""noise"" in your life, cluttered with things to do, places to go, and people to see? Maybe you picked up this book because you were curious how God could possibly whisper. Or maybe you needed to make a major decision and you thought this book might help. Or maybe you picked it up because when you saw ""fudge"" in the subtitle, you thought it might be a recipe book. It is a recipe book, in its own way, and for fun, you will find fudge recipes in the appendix. But I wrote this book to share some experiences of mine, and those of its contributors, about how we learned from our fudges and responded to God's nudges.

"The Complete Sermons of C. H. Spurgeon, Book 1 (Vol. 1-3)",C. H. Spurgeon,Lulu.com,2015-03-22,"The story of Charles Haddon Spurgeon's life is nothing less than titanic. Within 2 years and 6 months of accepting the pastorate of the New Park Street Chapel as a boy of 19, the Sunday service grew from 242 to over 7,000 in attendance. What can account for the meteoric rise in popularity? Why did so many wish to hear his sermons? It is the same reason why one ought to study the sermons of Spurgeon to this day: in a famished land of moralism, he preached the bread of Jesus Christ. Containing the first three volumes of the sixty-three volumes published from the Metropolitan Tabernacle pulpit, this book holds 164 sermons, 'as plump as a partridge, and as full of meat as an egg.'

The Bible Vs. The Book of Enoch,Jim Garton,N/A,2020-06-17,"The Book of Enoch is an ancient text that many are convinced should be considered as scripture. Some even claim the Book of Enoch was once in the Bible and advocate for its acceptance as God's inspired word. Are these advocates right? Is the Book of Enoch inspired scripture? Should the Book of Enoch be in the Bible? In The Bible Vs. The Book of Enoch, we will compare teachings found in the Book of Enoch with the Bible to see if they agree. We will also put the Book of Enoch through the Deuteronomy false prophet test. Will it pass? Get the book to find out. This small book is full of content that will convince any advocate of the Book of Enoch to rethink their support for this dangerous text. The Book is designed to summarize critical and alarming facts to hopefully steer Bible believers away from the multitude of false teachings found in the Book of Enoch. This book is a compact witnessing and study tool that can be shared with others in a one-on-one or group study. Some topics discussed will include: -- The Bible Vs. The Book of Enoch on specific creation passages.-- The Bible Vs. The Book of Enoch on the fall of humanity. -- The Bible Vs. The Book of Enoch on the Flood, Noah, and the Ark. -- Are the Sons of God angels? -- Strange, weird, and unbiblical concepts found in the Book of Enoch.-- A shocking revelation of who the Book of Enoch claims is the Messiah. -- Did Jude and Peter quote from the Book of Enoch or another source? What are those sources?-- Did the children of the angels become demons? -- The Biblical hell compared to the Book of Enoch's concept of hell. -- And much more..The author hopes that this book will prevent believers from getting caught up in the false doctrines and untruthful information found in the Book of Enoch by showing how the Bible and the Book of Enoch teach a very different message.",,66,N/A,0,en
A Documentary History of the Book of Mormon,,Oxford University Press,2019-01-09,"The story of the creation of the Book of Mormon has been told many times, and often ridiculed. A Documentary History of the Book of Mormon presents and examines the primary sources surrounding the origin of the foundational text of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the most successful new religion of modern times. The scores of documents transcribed and annotated in this book include family histories, journal entries, letters, affidavits, reminiscences, interviews, newspaper articles, and book extracts, as well as revelations dictated in the name of God. From these texts emerges the captivating story of what happened (and what was believed or rumored to have happened) between September 1823-when the seventeen-year-old farm boy Joseph Smith announced that an angel of God had directed him to an ancient book inscribed on gold plates-and March 1830, when the Book of Mormon was first published. By compiling for the first time a substantial collection of both first- and secondhand accounts relevant to the inception of the divine revelation-or clever fraud-that launched a new world religion, A Documentary History makes a significant contribution to the rapidly growing field of Mormon Studies.",Religion,552,N/A,0,en

A Defense for the Chronological Order of Luke's Gospel,Benjamin Wing Wo Fung,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2019-01-09,"For decades scholars have reached no consensus on the writing order of Luke’s gospel. The author, through a thorough study of the word “orderly” in Luke 1:3; a comparison of Luke’s writing methodologies with those of the Greco-Roman historians; and a detailed investigation of the differences in the narrative accounts among the Synoptic Gospels, concludes that Luke writes in chronological order. The author also explains how Luke has employed writing methodologies commonly used by Greco-Roman historians to write the prefaces in Luke-Acts and divide the Gospel into sections, and the implications of these writing methodologies on Luke’s writing order. He explicates the possible reasons behind the differences in the writing style between the “travel” section (9:52b to 19:44) and the rest of the Gospel, proposes the central theme of Luke-Acts, and assesses the possible implications for accepting Luke’s chronological writing order on biblical studies.",Religion,313,N/A,0,en

This book is about the Jesus Deception that has been passed on down through history by European historians, that is still being taught around the world today. This book takes a provocative intellectual, scholastic, historical, cultural, and sociological look at the Bible. This book identifies the names of the translators of the King James Bible of 1611 A. D., and when the chapters and verses in the Bible were created and who created them. The purpose of this book is to expose the historical, cultural, sociological, religious and theological lies of the Europeans and the Arabs. This book reveals the truth of the origination of The Bible, as There Is No Religion Higher Than The Truth. Join me in an intellectual odyssey through time. Here, I feel like a Lone Warrior standing before a mighty army. Come with me on this perilous pilgrimage as we travel through a parallel universe. I dedicate this book to my mother and father who gave me life. To the rest of my Native Afrikan family for supporting me and encouraging me on this publishing venture. To the Heavenly Father, without whom none of this would be possible. There are others I would also like to thank for being a part of helping me through this journey called Life, such as my professors at the Alabama State University where many a great scholars paths I have crossed.

But what actually happens in heaven? What are we going to be doing there? Won't it get boring at some point? According to Scripture, a large part of our experience of heaven will be a continual revealing of God's glory. Not just his glory in the moment, but during all of time. The mysteries of providence, the hidden movements of God throughout history, and the forgotten and unnoted works of even the most obscure of God's people will be unveiled so that we can see how wise, loving, gracious, and powerful our God is. And though we will experience perfection in heaven, we will never be omniscient, which means we will always be learning more about God's glory, inspiring us to return joyful praise and thanksgiving. If your vision of heaven has been limited to clouds and harps and angels, it's time to expand that view with the truth found in this biblically based look at the afterlife.",Religion,208,N/A,0,en

Catholicism,Robert Barron,Image,2011-09-06,"“Catholicism takes a path less traveled in leading us to explore the faith through stories, biographies, and images.”—Timothy M. Dolan, Archbishop of New York What is Catholicism? A 2,000-year-old living tradition? A worldview? A way of life? A relationship? A mystery? In Catholicism Father Robert Barron examines all these questions and more, seeking to capture the body, heart and mind of the Catholic faith. Starting from the essential foundation of Jesus Christ’s incarnation, life, and teaching, Father Barron moves through the defining elements of Catholicism--from sacraments, worship, and prayer, to Mary, the Apostles, and Saints, to grace, salvation, heaven, and hell. Whether discussing Scripture or the rose window at Notre Dame, he uses his distinct and dynamic grasp of art, literature, architecture, personal stories, theology, philosophy, and history to present the Church to the world. Paired with his documentary film series of the same title, Catholicism is an intimate journey, capturing “The Catholic Thing” in all its depth and beauty. Eclectic, unique, and inspiring, Father Barron brings the faith to life for a new generation, in a style that is both faithful to timeless truths, while simultaneously speaking in the language of contemporary life.",Religion,306,5,1,en
The Doctrine of Scripture,Mark D. Thompson,Crossway,2022-03-22,"A Clear and Concise Exploration of the Christian Doctrine of Scripture The Bible is the written word of the living God. He speaks through this word, working in and through human agents as he reveals himself to his people. His word is trustworthy, yet many Christians struggle to articulate why they believe that to be true. Centered in the words of Scripture and especially the teaching of Jesus himself, this volume unpacks the doctrine of Scripture as taught by the church through the ages, helping to strengthen readers' confidence in God's word. Despite the challenges that are often leveled against the Bible, Thompson clearly articulates what Jesus taught about the Scriptures, how God speaks to his people through the written word, the crucial work of the Holy Spirit to apply the word, and the vital attributes of Scripture—its clarity, truthfulness, sufficiency, and efficacy. Readers will find encouragement to walk according to the word and to delight in the God who speaks. Concise and Accessible: Intended for use by church members and leaders as well as those in academic contexts Christ-Centered: Rooted in Jesus's own words about the Old Testament and his commissioning of the apostles who would go on to write the New Testament Addresses Common Questions: Answers challenges about the Bible's clarity, truthfulness, sufficiency, and efficacy",Religion,215,N/A,0,en
God at Work,Gene Edward Veith Jr.,Crossway,2011-08-02,"When you understand it properly, the doctrine of vocation—""doing everything for God's glory""—is not a platitude or an outdated notion. This principle that we vaguely apply to our lives and our work is actually the key to Christian ethics, to influencing our culture for Christ, and to infusing our ordinary, everyday lives with the presence of God. For when we realize that the ""mundane"" activities that consume most of our time are ""God's hiding places,"" our perspective changes. Culture expert Gene Veith unpacks the biblical, Reformation teaching about the doctrine of vocation, emphasizing not what we should specifically do with our time or what careers we are called to, but what God does in and through our callings—even within the home. In each task He has given us—in our workplaces and families, our churches and society—God Himself is at work. Veith guides you to discover God's purpose and calling in those seemingly ordinary areas by providing you with a spiritual framework for thinking about such issues and for acting upon them with a changed perspective.",Religion,178,N/A,0,en

Family Vocation,"Gene Edward Veith Jr., Mary J. Moerbe",Crossway,2012-02-29,"What does it mean to be called as a husband, a wife, a parent, a child? How does the grace of the gospel impact how we carry out our particular calling? How does God's presence influence the struggles that families face? Gene Veith joins forces with his daughter Mary Moerbe to explore these kinds of questions as well as the roles of calling and vocation in family life. Though we have little control over who is in our family (other than choosing a spouse and deciding to have children), God has placed us with specific people for specific reasons. Veith and Moerbe show how our roles are distinct and important to God's plan for our lives—and that when we have a biblical understanding of those roles in our families, we can move away from common dysfunctions and toward forgiveness and healing. Writing with sensitivity and wisdom, Veith and Moerbe address the common problems facing contemporary families: the crosses, the weaknesses, and the uncertainties. They articulate a compelling, biblical paradigm for creating and sustaining loving and forgiving families who maintain hope in the face of cultural pressure. This book is an important resource for all Christians, including pastors, counselors, and those working in family ministry.",Religion,258,N/A,0,en

Bringing God Up to Date,John Hunt,John Hunt Publishing,2021-10-29,"Religion is an essential part of our humanity. We all follow some form of religion, in the original meaning of the word. But organized religion establishes definitions, boundaries and hierarchies which the founders would be amazed by. This is perhaps more true of Christianity than most other religions, due to the short life of Jesus, his sudden death, the lack of any contemporary records. His teaching about the kingdom of God is great; it could see us through our time on earth. But his followers watered it down and soon lost it altogether. It became a kingdom in heaven for the few, rather than one here and now for everyone. The Church, or Churches, that resulted became increasingly irrelevant, even a hindrance, to seeing it realized. Many will always find security and truth in the traditions that developed, and good for them. But for those who can't, for those who have given up on religion or never thought it worth considering, the original teachings are worth another look. If we could recover them and live by them, we could change ourselves and the world for the better. We could bring God up to date.",Religion,307,N/A,0,en

The Gospel in Genesis starts with the fall of man and ends with the call of Abram as it examines portions of chapters 3-12. Along the way Lloyd-Jones talks of serpents and sin, of the Word of God and the Babel of man. But the destination of The Gospel in Genesis is clear: readers will be moved from fig leaves in the garden to faith in the gospel.

Can We Trust the Gospels?,Peter J. Williams,Crossway,2018-12-10,"Is there evidence to believe the Gospels? The Gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, John—are four accounts of Jesus’s life and teachings while on earth. But should we accept them as historically accurate? What evidence is there that the recorded events actually happened? Presenting a case for the historical reliability of the Gospels, New Testament scholar Peter Williams examines evidence from non-Christian sources, assesses how accurately the four biblical accounts reflect the cultural context of their day, compares different accounts of the same events, and looks at how these texts were handed down throughout the centuries. Everyone from the skeptic to the scholar will find powerful arguments in favor of trusting the Gospels as trustworthy accounts of Jesus’s earthly life.",Religion,97,N/A,0,en
Collected Writings on Scripture,D. A.

In part 1, Carson selects essays written on such themes as how to interpret the Bible, recent developments in the doctrine of Scripture, unity and diversity in the New Testament, and redaction criticism. Presenting a theologically balanced and confessional perspective, Carson defines the terms of a number of debates, critiques interpretive methods and theories, and suggests positive guidelines for future action. Part 2 presents critical reviews of nine books dealing with the inspiration and authority of Scripture. Though substantial in content, Carson’s detailed reviews will foster careful thought and perspective in those who are relatively new to the debates surrounding biblical inspiration and authority.

"Understanding the Bible as a Scripture in History, Culture, and Religion",James W. Watts,John Wiley & Sons,2021-04-27,"UNDERSTANDING THE BIBLE AS A SCRIPTURE IN HISTORY, CULTURE, AND RELIGION The Bible is a popular subject of study and research, yet biblical studies gives little attention to the reason for its popularity: its religious role as a scripture. Understanding the Bible as a Scripture in History, Culture, and Religion integrates the history of the religious interpretation and ritual uses of biblical books into a survey of their rhetoric, composition, and theology in their ancient contexts. Emphasizing insights from comparative studies of different religious scriptures, it combines discussion of the Bible’s origins with its cultural history into a coherent understanding of its past and present function as a scripture. A prominent expert on biblical rhetoric and the ritualization of books, James W. Watts describes how Jews and Christians ritualize the Bible by interpreting it, by expressing it in recitations, music, art, and film, and by venerating the physical scroll and book. The first two sections of the book are organized around the Torah and the Gospels—which have been the focus of Jewish and Christian ritualization of scriptures from ancient to modern times—and treat the history of other biblical books in relation to these two central blocks of the Hebrew Bible and New Testament. In addition to analyzing the semantic contents of all the Bible’s books as persuasive rhetoric, Watts describes their ritualization in the iconic and expressive dimensions in the centuries since they began to function as a scripture, as well as in their origins in ancient Judaism and Christianity. The third section on the cultural history and scriptural function of modern bibles concludes by discussing their influence today and the controversies they have fueled about history, science, race, and gender. Innovative and insightful, Understanding the Bible as a Scripture in History, Culture, and Religion is a groundbreaking introduction to the study of the Bible as a scripture, and an ideal textbook for courses in biblical studies and comparative scripture studies.",Religion,388,N/A,0,en
NRSV Standard Bible w/ Apoc--Old Testament & Apocrypha,Harper Bibles,Harper Collins,2009-11-10,"The New Revised Standard Version is the ""standard"" translation used by mainline Protestant churches, Orthodox churches, and by many Catholics.

"Is The ""World's Oldest Bible"" A Fake?",David W. Daniels,Chick Publications,2018-01-09,"Modern research techniques have revealed a hidden scheme aimed at God's Holy Words... Modern Bibles have changed many verses because of the discovery of an ""ancient"" manuscript in a monastery on the Sinai Peninsula. The manuscript, called Sinaiticus, is claimed to be the earliest complete copy of the New Testament. Its discoverer, who was a world leading Bible scholar in his time, told the world Sinaiticus was from the 4th century and that it was the ""oldest and best"" Bible available. Publishers rushed to make new Bibles with many changes to match it. But not everyone agreed. When this famed 19th century Bible scholar, Constantine Von Tischendorf, claimed the ancient date, a well-known Greek calligrapher said, ""No! I made that document!"" But why did no one believe him? Maybe it's because pages of the manuscript were stored where no one could view them, archived in exclusive collections across several continents. Now, an international group has carefully photographed each page of Sinaiticus and is displaying it on the internet as high-quality digital images. For the first time, Bible scholars and students can see the entire manuscript together, as was never possible before. And what they are seeing with their own eyes is shocking. Some of the pages are white and look quite new, while others have been darkened to make them look very old. If they are all from the same ""old"" Bible, how can this be? Researcher David W. Daniels proves with easy-to-understand evidence that the Sinaiticus is not the oldest manuscript and certainly not the best, either. He is also convincing in showing it's not old after all and that the Greek calligrapher did make it, in the 19th century. The textual (and doctrinal) changes in modern Bibles are based upon a fake —a shadowy scheme worthy of Satan's hatred for the preserved words of God.",Religion,352,N/A,0,en

Latina/o/x Studies and Biblical Studies,Jacqueline M. Hidalgo,BRILL,2020-03-09,"In Latina/o/x Studies and Biblical Studies Jacqueline M. Hidalgo introduces Latina/o/x studies for a biblical studies audience. She examines crucial themes that bridge the two fields, themes such as identity and difference with special attention to ethnicity and race; migration with attention to homing, diaspora, transnationalism, and citizenship. She discusses the place of Latina/o/x studies in relevant Hebrew Bible and New Testament scholarship on these topics. Ultimately this essay argues that Latina/o/x studies’ epistemological commitments to complexity, relationality, particularity, and collaborative knowledge-making can help ground critical interpretive approaches in biblical studies. She also imagines a way in which biblical studies—capaciously encompassing the study of Jewish and Christian literature in the ancient world as well as Jewish and Christian biblical reception and rejection histories, and the very category of scriptures more broadly—could deepen Latina/o/x studies' own thinking about canon formation and history.",Religion,104,N/A,0,en
Bible Missals and the Medieval Dominican Liturgy,Innocent Smith,Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG,2023-11-06,"Bible Missals are manuscripts that integrate liturgical prayers for the Mass with the scriptural texts of the Latin Vulgate. Long overlooked by scholars, Bible Missals offer important evidence for the development of the medieval liturgy and the liturgical use of scripture by medieval Christians. This monograph is the first comprehensive analysis of the codicology and contents of Bible Missals. Mostly produced in the first half of the 13th century by professional book makers in centers like Paris and Oxford, these hybrid manuscripts were customized for secular, monastic, and mendicant patrons. This monograph focuses on Dominican Bible Missals, the largest group within the repertoire, providing detailed codicological descriptions of each manuscript and analyzing their texts for the Order of Mass and selected liturgical formularies, including prayers for the feast of St. Dominic. For medieval Christians, the words and events of scripture were continually called to mind and reenacted in the sacramental rites of the Mass. Bible Missals provide important material evidence for this interplay between word and sacrament.",Religion,1076,N/A,0,en

The Bible in American Life,"Philip Goff, Arthur Emery Farnsley, Peter Johannes Thuesen",Oxford University Press,2017,"There is a paradox in American Christianity. According to Gallup, nearly eight in ten Americans regard the Bible as either the literal word of God or inspired by God. At the same time, surveys have revealed gaps in these same Americans' biblical literacy. These discrepancies reveal the complex relationship between American Christians and Holy Writ, a subject that is widely acknowledged but rarely investigated. The Bible in American Life is a sustained, collaborative reflection on the ways Americans use the Bible in their personal lives. It also considers how other influences, including religious communities and the Internet, shape individuals' comprehension of scripture. Employing both quantitative methods (the General Social Survey and the National Congregations Study) and qualitative research (historical studies for context), The Bible in American Life provides an unprecedented perspective on the Bible's role outside of worship, in the lived religion of a broad cross-section of Americans both now and in the past. The Bible has been central to Christian practice, and has functioned as a cultural touchstone From the broadest scale imaginable, national survey data about all Americans, down to the smallest details, such as the portrayal of Noah and his ark in children's Bibles, this book offers insight and illumination from scholars across the intellectual spectrum.

The Gen-X Bible,Gen-X Redactor: DL Lyle,Outskirts Press,2023-09-15,"Society’s foundational stories, key to uniting us, are under attack because they are judged as unhistorical biblical myths. What if that judgment is wrong? In that case, debunking these attacks would be important. Which is why this book is important! The history of the universe from the beginning to the creation of man on earth is a real history, just slightly different than as described in the bible. The cognitive revolution is a real event, just slightly different than as described in the bible. The Garden of Eden is a real place and can be pointed to on a map today. But what about the heroes? The key to identifying biblical heroes in secular sources is to synchronize the chronologies. By answering a simple question with a simple answer, this narrative is based on an alternative chronology that unmasks identities of many heroes…and they are REAL! Noah’s flood was a real event and can be linked to the most catastrophic volcanic eruption of the Bronze Age. Abram was a real person, and a mayor of Jerusalem wrote and complained about him to an Egyptian Pharoah. Joseph was a real person, and his story has been known for centuries in Egypt but misidentified due to poor chronology. Moses is in the Egyptian records once you look in the right time period! And the histories of these hero’s matter. They matter because the record of their history in the Bible records the maturation of an explanation for the fundamental question everyone wants to know the answer to: why? Experience the thrill of quickly and easily learning the Bible and discovering how accurate it really is while staying true to the latest modern science. The majority of the Old Testament is thoroughly explored in less than 250 pages, and they are explored as they occurred, within the larger history of man! History, alternative history, biblical history, Ancient Near East geography, military analysis, mathematics, metallurgy, the Bronze Age Collapse, archeology, linguistics, even climate change, all these topics make their appearance in these pages to help explain what the latest scholarship believes to be true about the Bible. Although this book is clearly written by a modern scientist and mathematician, it is truly hoped that it is seen for what is intended to be: a modern-day apologetic. To serve that role, it was written in a way that is hopefully easy to read and not filled with dense notes. It hopefully includes enough information to get the curious started on their own investigations. And it is hopefully clear that the author respects and is in awe of the biblical authors.",Religion,416,N/A,0,en

Responding Faithfully to Generation X,Rev. Dr. Christopher Doyle,WestBow Press,2022-07-12,"The research, writing and analysis in the pages of this work show the story of how Generation X grew-up during one of the greatest periods of technological, social, political, economic and educational change in US history. Included in that story is how the greater percentage of them grew-up in the church, but then walked away en masse. Today, Generation X is the smallest percentage of Main Line and Catholic Church membership, while the overwhelming majority of church membership is made up of an aging population of Baby Boomers and Silent Generation folk. In ten year's time, what will be the state of the church when many of the current membership has passed on to eternal life, or are no longer able to do what it is that they're doing today? Generation X could well be the answer to much of the solution. Generation X is generally at a more comfortable place in their lives and are asking the questions about the meaning of their lives while considering issues of mortality. Yet at the same time, they're having now to care for parents, grandchildren, and for many Gen Xers, their own children still. They're busy and committed, but they're also spiritually hungry. Having had a relationship at one point in their lives, they're not completely foreign to what the church can be, but the ball is really in the church's court. How the church chooses to respond to Generation X could mean life, or church closure. It's a conversation that needs to take place, and that conversation begins here.",Religion,219,N/A,0,en

How the Bible Works,Bill Foster,New Leaf Publishing Group,2017-08-18,"Were you ever taught in church how to see the big picture of the Bible? Almost no one is. We spend a lot of time learning how we should apply it to our lives but are almost never shown how things fit together in the book. Many see it as a bunch of unconnected stories – a random collection of disjointed information. Consequently, we remain ignorant about the Bible’s divinely inspired connectedness – how it fits together theologically, historically, and literarily. How motivated would you be to put together a puzzle if you were only given certain pieces but never shown the complete picture on the box top? How The Bible Works uses groups and icons to help you remember pivotal elements in the Bible, lead you through its content and theological concepts, and show you how things are connected.",Religion,13,N/A,0,en

"Barbershops, Bibles, and BET",Melissa Harris-Perry,Princeton University Press,2010-06-14,"What is the best way to understand black political ideology? Just listen to the everyday talk that emerges in public spaces, suggests Melissa Harris-Lacewell. And listen this author has--to black college students talking about the Million Man March and welfare, to Southern, black Baptists discussing homosexuality in the church, to black men in a barbershop early on a Saturday morning, to the voices of hip-hop music and Black Entertainment Television. Using statistical, experimental, and ethnographic methods Barbershops, Bibles, and B.E.T offers a new perspective on the way public opinion and ideologies are formed at the grassroots level. The book makes an important contribution to our understanding of black politics by shifting the focus from the influence of national elites in opinion formation to the influence of local elites and people in daily interaction with each other. Arguing that African Americans use community dialogue to jointly develop understandings of their collective political interests, Harris-Lacewell identifies four political ideologies that constitute the framework of contemporary black political thought: Black Nationalism, Black Feminism, Black Conservatism and Liberal Integrationism. These ideologies, the book posits, help African Americans to understand persistent social and economic inequality, to identify the significance of race in that inequality, and to devise strategies for overcoming it.",Social Science,366,3,2,en
