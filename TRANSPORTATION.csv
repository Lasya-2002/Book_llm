Bicycle Transportation,John Forester,MIT Press,1994,"This new edition of John Forester's handbook for transportation policy makers and bicycling advocates has been completely rewritten to reflect changes of the last decade. It includes new chapters on European bikeway engineering, city planning, integration with mass transit and long-distance carriers, ""traffic calming,"" and the art of encouraging private-sector support for bicycle commuting. A professional engineer and an avid bicyclist, John Forester combined those interests in founding the discipline of cycling transportation engineering, which regards bicycling as a form of vehicular transportation equal to any other form of transportation. Forester, who believes that riding a bicycle along streets with traffic is safer than pedaling on restricted bike paths and bike lanes, argues the case for cyclists' rights with zeal and with statistics based on experience, traffic studies, and roadway design standards. Over the nearly two decades since Bicycle Transportation was first published, he has brought about many changes in the national standards for highways, bikeways, bicycles, and traffic laws. His Effective Cycling Program continues to grow.",Sports & Recreation,364,4,1,en

Encyclopedia of Transportation,Mark Garrett,SAGE Publications,2014-08-13,"Viewing transportation through the lens of current social, economic, and policy aspects, this four-volume reference work explores the topic of transportation across multiple disciplines within the social sciences and related areas, including geography, public policy, business, and economics. The book’s articles, all written by experts in the field, seek to answer such questions as: What has been the legacy, not just economically but politically and socially as well, of President Eisenhower’s modern interstate highway system in America? With that system and the infrastructure that supports it now in a state of decline and decay, what’s the best path for the future at a time of enormous fiscal constraints? Should California politicians plunge ahead with plans for a high-speed rail that every expert says—despite the allure—will go largely unused and will never pay back the massive investment while at this very moment potholes go unfilled all across the state? What path is best for emerging countries to keep pace with dramatic economic growth for their part? What are the social and financial costs of gridlock in our cities? Features: Approximately 675 signed articles authored by prominent scholars are arranged in A-to-Z fashion and conclude with Further Readings and cross references. A Chronology helps readers put individual events into historical context; a Reader’s Guide organizes entries by broad topical or thematic areas; a detailed index helps users quickly locate entries of most immediate interest; and a Resource Guide provides a list of journals, books, and associations and their websites. While articles were written to avoid jargon as much as possible, a Glossary provides quick definitions of technical terms. To ensure full, well-rounded coverage of the field, the General Editor with expertise in urban planning, public policy, and the environment worked alongside a Consulting Editor with a background in Civil Engineering. The index, Reader’s Guide, and cross references combine for thorough search-and-browse capabilities in the electronic edition. Available in both print and electronic formats, Encyclopedia of Transportation is an ideal reference for libraries and those who want to explore the issues that surround transportation in the United States and around the world.",Social Science,2000,N/A,0,en
Human Transit,Jarrett Walker,Island Press,2012-07-29,"Public transit is a powerful tool for addressing a huge range of urban problems, including traffic congestion and economic development as well as climate change. But while many people support transit in the abstract, it's often hard to channel that support into good transit investments. Part of the problem is that transit debates attract many kinds of experts, who often talk past each other. Ordinary people listen to a little of this and decide that transit is impossible to figure out. Jarrett Walker believes that transit can be simple, if we focus first on the underlying geometry that all transit technologies share. In Human Transit, Walker supplies the basic tools, the critical questions, and the means to make smarter decisions about designing and implementing transit services. Human Transit explains the fundamental geometry of transit that shapes successful systems; the process for fitting technology to a particular community; and the local choices that lead to transit-friendly development. Whether you are in the field or simply a concerned citizen, here is an accessible guide to achieving successful public transit that will enrich any community.",Transportation,256,5,1,en
Boston in Transit,Steven Beaucher,MIT Press,2023-03-07,"A richly illustrated story of public transit in one of America’s most historic cities, from public ferry and horse-drawn carriage to the MBTA. A lively tour of public transportation in Boston over the years, Boston in Transit maps the complete history of the modes of transportation that have kept the city moving and expanding since its founding in 1630—from the simple ferry serving an English settlement to the expansive network of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, or MBTA. The story of public transit in Boston—once dubbed the Hub of the Universe—is a journey through the history of the American metropolis. With a remarkable collection of maps and architectural and engineering drawings at hand, Steven Beaucher launches his account from the landing where English colonists established that first ferry, carrying passengers between what is now Boston’s North End and Charlestown—and sparing them what had been a two-day walk around Boston Harbor. In the 1700s, horse-drawn coaches appeared on the scene, connecting Boston and Cambridge, with the bigger, better Omnibus soon to follow. From horse-drawn coaches, horse-drawn railways evolved, making way for the electric streetcar networks that allowed the city’s early suburbs to sprout—culminating in the multimodal, regional public transportation network in place in Boston today. With photographs, brochures, pamphlets, guidebooks, timetables, and tickets, Boston in Transit creates a complete picture of the everyday experience of public transportation through the centuries. At once a practical reference, local history, and travelogue, this book will be cherished by armchair tourists, day-trippers, and serious travelers alike.",History,586,N/A,0,en
From Mobility to Accessibility,"Jonathan Levine, Joe Grengs, Louis A. Merlin",Cornell University Press,2019-11-15,"Levine, Grengs, and Merlin marshal a compelling case to shift to accessibility-oriented planning, providing much needed conceptual clarity as to what accessibility is and is not. But their book also represents a major step toward transforming accessibility from a vaguely defined aspiration into concrete measures that can guide planning decisions. ― Journal of the American Planning Association In From Mobility to Accessibility, an expert team of researchers flips the tables on the standard models for evaluating regional transportation performance. Jonathan Levine, Joe Grengs, and Louis A. Merlin argue for an ""accessibility shift"" whereby transportation planning, and the transportation dimensions of land-use planning, would be based on people's ability to reach destinations, rather than on their ability to travel fast. Existing models for planning and evaluating transportation, which have taken vehicle speeds as the most important measure, would make sense if movement were the purpose of transportation. But it is the ability to reach destinations, not movement per se, that people seek from their transportation systems. While the concept of accessibility has been around for the better part of a century, From Mobility to Accessibility shows that the accessibility shift is compelled by the fundamental purpose of transportation. The book argues that the shift would be transformative to the practice of both transportation and land-use planning but is impeded by many conceptual obstacles regarding the nature of accessibility and its potential for guiding development of the built environment. By redefining success in transportation, the book provides city planners, decisionmakers, and scholars a path to reforming the practice of transportation and land-use planning in modern cities and metropolitan areas.",Architecture,285,N/A,0,en

Inclusive Transport,Hans Jeekel,Elsevier,2018-10-29,"Inclusive Transport: Fighting Involuntary Transport Disadvantages offers readers profound and multifaceted insights into transportation and social equity, guiding transportation and urban studies researchers, planners, and policy makers in evaluating potential solutions to this complex issue. It considers discrimination and its societal consequences, providing a needed perspective on who is left out of transportation planning, and why. The book is systematically divided into 2 parts, Part A is problem oriented and explores the main problems to the transportation disadvantaged; accessibility and affordability. It looks at the consequences of non-accessibility, the problems non-car owners face, and the interplay between housing and transportation; Part B is policy oriented and analyses how current policies tend to forget transport disadvantages. It looks at pragmatic solutions for transport disadvantaged and ends with a design for inclusive transport, being a more radical approach combining sustainability challenges, people's behaviours and emotions, creating more just and equitable mobility. - Synthesizes academic research and narratives on transport disadvantage and the transport disadvantaged, linking the research with current mobility policies and practices - Connects the fight on transport disadvantages with sustainable and smart mobility strategies and looks into car sharing, ride sharing and individualising public transport while de- individualizing car use - Has an extensive usage of data, figures, and examples from around the world, and inspiring mobility plans and policies",Transportation,239,N/A,0,en
Distribution,David Frederick Ross,Springer Science & Business Media,1995-11-30,"It has been said that every generation of historians seeks to rewrite what a previous generation had established as the standard interpretations of the motives and circumstances shaping the fabric of historical events. It is not that the facts of history have changed. No one will dispute that the battle of Waterloo occurred on June 11, 1815 or that the allied invasion of Europe began on June 6, 1944. What each new age of historians are attempting to do is to reinterpret the motives of men and the force of circumstance impacting the direction of past events based on the factual, social, intellectual, and cultural milieu of their own generation. By examining the facts of history from a new perspective, today's historians hope to reveal some new truth that will not only illuminate the course of history but also validate contempo rary values and societal ideals. Although it is true that tackling the task of developing a new text on logistics and distribution channel management focuses less on schools of philosophical and social analysis and more on the calculus of managing sales campaigns, inventory replenishment, and income statements, the goal of the management scientist, like the historian, is to merge the facts and figures of the discipline with today's organizational, cultural, and economic realities. Hopefully, the result will be a new synthesis, where a whole new perspective will break forth, exposing new directions and opportunities.",Technology & Engineering,808,4,3,en

This new book ""The Future of Public Transportation"" is written by transit industry leader Paul Comfort and over forty top public transport leaders, CEOs, futurists and associations. The book examines the transformations coming this decade for cities and the public transportation systems that serve them allowing readers to become more informed and ready for these changes. In the next few years technology enhancements will produce and expand game changing new mobility options such as autonomous vehicles on regular bus routes and Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) smart phone apps allowing passengers to plan, pay for and subscribe to a full menu of traditional public transit and private microtransit options for their travel. Cities will further regulate and optimize the rampant expansion of e-bikes and e-scooters. Mobile public transit fare paying options will expand including allowing the use of not only cell phone and tap and go credit cards but even wearable fare payment jewelry and watches. Traditional transit systems are rebooting their bus networks, adding in high frequency routes & reducing the friction that slows their buses by adding bus only lanes, transit signal priority (TSP) and electronic fare payment systems. TNCs have now entered the public mobility marketplace and are supplementing or replacing public transit services for many. Transit fleets are becoming greener shifting to zero emission fuels like electric or hydrogen, large multi-national firms are transforming how we build and operate new rail and other capital projects through Public Private Partnerships (P3). Hyperloop and air taxis are looking more like science than fiction. Cities are becoming ""smart"" and eliminating traffic in the public square or charging for its usage in peak times. Most transit software is moving to the cloud and privately-owned electric automobiles could be the autonomous taxicabs of tomorrow.All these trends & innovations in technology and business models are explored in depth in this book with the collaboration of thought leaders, industry associations, CEOs and the major companies that are creating and utilizing them. In the end, bold leaders will take us to new horizons as they always have, but they will do so using modern technology to move us in ways we never thought possible, and in the process, eliminate barriers that have too long stood in the way of true mobility for all.

Buses can and should be the cornerstone of urban transportation. They offer affordable mobility and can connect citizens with every aspect of their lives. But in the US, they have long been an afterthought in budgeting and planning. With a compelling narrative and actionable steps, Better Buses, Better Cities inspires us to fix the bus. Transit expert Steven Higashide shows us what a successful bus system looks like with real-world stories of reform—such as Houston redrawing its bus network overnight, Boston making room on its streets to put buses first, and Indianapolis winning better bus service on Election Day. Higashide shows how to marshal the public in support of better buses and how new technologies can keep buses on time and make complex transit systems understandable. Higashide argues that better bus systems will create better cities for all citizens. The consequences of subpar transit service fall most heavily on vulnerable members of society. Transit systems should be planned to be inclusive and provide better service for all. These are difficult tasks that require institutional culture shifts; doing all of them requires resilient organizations and transformational leadership. Better bus service is key to making our cities better for all citizens. Better Buses, Better Cities describes how decision-makers, philanthropists, activists, and public agency leaders can work together to make the bus a win in any city.",Transportation,186,N/A,0,en

Transport Justice,Karel Martens,Routledge,2016-07-01,"Transport Justice develops a new paradigm for transportation planning based on principles of justice. Author Karel Martens starts from the observation that for the last fifty years the focus of transportation planning and policy has been on the performance of the transport system and ways to improve it, without much attention being paid to the persons actually using – or failing to use – that transport system. There are far-reaching consequences of this approach, with some enjoying the fruits of the improvements in the transport system, while others have experienced a substantial deterioration in their situation. The growing body of academic evidence on the resulting disparities in mobility and accessibility, have been paralleled by increasingly vocal calls for policy changes to address the inequities that have developed over time. Drawing on philosophies of social justice, Transport Justice argues that governments have the fundamental duty of providing virtually every person with adequate transportation and thus of mitigating the social disparities that have been created over the past decades. Critical reading for transport planners and students of transportation planning, this book develops a new approach to transportation planning that takes people as its starting point, and justice as its end.",Architecture,240,N/A,0,en
Matatu,Kenda Mutongi,University of Chicago Press,2017-06-26,"Drive the streets of Nairobi and you are sure to see many matatus colorful minibuses that transport huge numbers of people around the city. Once ramshackle affairs held together with duct tape and wire, matatus today are name-brand vehicles maxed out with aftermarket detailing. They can be stately black or come in extravagant colors, sporting names, slogans, or entire tableaus, with airbrushed portraits of everyone from Kanye West to Barack Obama, of athletes, movie stars, or the most famous face of all: Jesus Christ. In this richly interdisciplinary book, Kenda Mutongi explores the history of the matatu from the 1960s to the present. As Mutongi shows, matatus offer a window onto many socioeconomic and political facets of late-twentieth-century Africa. In their diversity of idiosyncratic designs they express multiple and divergent aspects of Kenyan life including rapid urbanization, organized crime, entrepreneurship, social insecurity, the transition to democracy, chaos and congestion, popular culture, and many others at once embodying both Kenya's staggering social problems and the bright promises of its future. Offering a shining model of interdisciplinary analysis, Mutongi mixes historical, ethnographic, literary, linguistic, and economic approaches to tell the story of the matatu as a powerful expression of the entrepreneurial aesthetics of the postcolonial world.",History,361,3,1,en

Right of Way,Angie Schmitt,Island Press,2020-08-27,"The face of the pedestrian safety crisis looks a lot like Ignacio Duarte-Rodriguez. The 77-year old grandfather was struck in a hit-and-run crash while trying to cross a high-speed, six-lane road without crosswalks near his son’s home in Phoenix, Arizona. He was one of the more than 6,000 people killed while walking in America in 2018. In the last ten years, there has been a 50 percent increase in pedestrian deaths. The tragedy of traffic violence has barely registered with the media and wider culture. Disproportionately the victims are like Duarte-Rodriguez—immigrants, the poor, and people of color. They have largely been blamed and forgotten. In Right of Way, journalist Angie Schmitt shows us that deaths like Duarte-Rodriguez’s are not unavoidable “accidents.” They don’t happen because of jaywalking or distracted walking. They are predictable, occurring in stark geographic patterns that tell a story about systemic inequality. These deaths are the forgotten faces of an increasingly urgent public-health crisis that we have the tools, but not the will, to solve. Schmitt examines the possible causes of the increase in pedestrian deaths as well as programs and movements that are beginning to respond to the epidemic. Her investigation unveils why pedestrians are dying—and she demands action. Right of Way is a call to reframe the problem, acknowledge the role of racism and classism in the public response to these deaths, and energize advocacy around road safety. Ultimately, Schmitt argues that we need improvements in infrastructure and changes to policy to save lives. Right of Way unveils a crisis that is rooted in both inequality and the undeterred reign of the automobile in our cities. It challenges us to imagine and demand safer and more equitable cities, where no one is expendable.",Architecture,247,5,1,en

Road to Nowhere,Paris Marx,Verso Books,2022-07-05,"How to build a transportation system to provide mobility for all Road to Nowhere exposes the flaws in Silicon Valley’s vision of the future: ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft to take us anywhere; electric cars to make them ‘green’; and automation to ensure transport is cheap and ubiquitous. Such promises are implausible and potentially dangerous. As Paris Marx shows, these technological visions are a threat to our ideas of what a society should be. Electric cars are not a silver bullet for sustainability, and autonomous vehicles won’t guarantee road safety. There will not be underground tunnels to eliminate traffic congestion, and micromobility services will not replace car travel any sooner than we will see the arrival of the long-awaited flying car. In response, Marx offers a vision for a more collective way of organizing transportation systems that considers the needs of poor, marginalized, and vulnerable people. The book argues that rethinking mobility can be the first step in a broader reimagining of how we design and live in our future cities. We must create streets that allow for social interaction and conviviality. We need reasons to get out of our cars and to use public means of transit determined by community needs rather than algorithmic control. Such decisions should be guided by the search for quality of life rather than for profit.",Social Science,273,N/A,0,en

Public Private Partnerships Renegotiations in Transportation,"Carlos Oliveira Cruz, Joaquim Miranda Sarmento",Springer Nature,2022-05-13,"There is a growing interest in Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), particularly in infrastructure and public services. Under the scope of PPPs, renegotiations are becoming more relevant, as empirical evidence suggests that most PPP projects are inevitably renegotiated, i.e., the original contract needs to be adapted to new and unforeseen circumstances. Renegotiations have a substantial impact on the contract and performance of a PPP and usually represent significant costs for users and taxpayers. However, very little is known about the management and, mainly, the process of renegotiating that will, very likely, occur. This book provides a set of case-studies of PPP renegotiations in the transport sector. The authors illustrate the Portuguese experience, a country that has been using PPP extensively, particularly in transport. The case studies provide an extensive and detailed analysis on each aspect of the project and the renegotiation. What drives renegotiations? Why are some projects more renegotiated than others? What are the results? How can the performance of renegotiation processes be improved? These and other questions provide the basis for the discussions in this book. The novelty and value of the book come mainly from the extent of information available. Each case-study deals with these questions in much more detail than what is common in the case-studies approach.",Law,200,N/A,0,en

Air Transport Labor Relations,Robert W. Kaps,SIU Press,1997,"Robert W. Kaps examines air transport labor law in the United States as well as the underlying legislative and policy directives established by the federal government. The body of legislation governing labor relations in the private sector of the U.S. economy consists of two separate and distinct acts: the Railway Labor Act (RLA), which governs labor relations in the railroad and airline industries, and the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), which governs labor relations in all other industrial sectors. Although the NLRA closely follows the pattern established by the RLA, Kaps notes that the two laws are distinguishable in several important areas. Labor contracts negotiated under the RLA continue in perpetuity, for example, whereas all other labor contracts expire at a specified date. Other important areas of difference relate to the collective bargaining process itself, the procedures for the arbitration of disputes and grievances, and the spheres of authority and jurisdiction to consider such matters as unfair labor practices. Congress established a special labor law for railroad and airline workers for several reasons. Because of transportation’s critical importance to the economy, an essential goal of public policy has been to ensure that both passenger and freight transportation services continue without interruption. Production can cease—at least temporarily—in most other industries without causing significant harm to the economy. When transportation stops, however, production stops. Thus Congress saw fit to enact a statute that contained provisions to ensure that labor strife would not halt rail services. Primarily because of the importance of air mail transportation, the Railway Labor Act of 1926 was extended to the airline industry in 1936. The first section of this book introduces labor policy and presents a history of the labor movement in the United States. Discussing early labor legislation, Kaps focuses on unfair labor practices and subsequent major labor statutes. The second section provides readers with a comparison of labor provisions that apply to the railroad and airline industries as well as to the remainder of the economy. The final section centers on the evolution of labor in the airline industry. The author pays particular attention to recent events affecting labor in commercial aviation, particularly the effect of airline deregulation on airline labor.",Law,320,N/A,0,en

Over ten chapters, this informative book elucidates all the concepts fundamental to the management of air transport, illuminating the factors key to operational, infrastructural and public policy in the development of air transport.","Aeronautics, Commercial",260,N/A,0,en
Strategic Planning for Urban Transportation,Guido Noto,Springer Nature,2020-03-12,"This book focuses on the adoption of a Dynamic Performance Management (DPM) approach to support the planning and management of urban transportation systems. DPM allows one to embrace a dynamic and systemic perspective and, as a result, to frame the contribution of different stakeholders, in terms of outcome-based performance, at an inter-institutional level. The discussed DPM approach allows one to focus on the causal relationships and feedback processes that characterize urban transportation systems’ governance. Particularly, through the adoption of such an approach, it is possible to identify outcome-based performance measures that help to monitor and drive the governance network toward the creation of public value for the reference communities.Strategic Planning for Urban Transportation: A Dynamic Performance Management Approach begins with an examination of urban transportation, highlighting the main criticalities and future challenges of managing it. Next, the book examines the governance of urban transportation including how to identify and engage stakeholders. Finally, the book introduces the main application of DPM and system dynamics to urban areas, with specific regards to transportation. The framework is outlined, and a case study is provided as a practical example of how to apply the model. This book should be useful to urban transportation decision-makers at both the managerial and political level.",Business & Economics,137,N/A,0,en

Transport and Energy Research,Junyi Zhang,Elsevier,2019-09-17,"Transport and Energy Research: A Behavioral Perspective deals with the transport issues associated with energy from a behavioral perspective in an interdisciplinary and systematic way. Existing transport and energy research has focused on technologies and energy efficiency; however, more efficient technologies do not necessarily lead to energy reduction. Unfortunately, very limited behavioral research can be found in the literature. This book covers major transport modes in major countries. It emphasizes the importance of researching the behaviors of not only transport and energy service users, but also transport and energy service providers, policy makers, organizations, company managers, and other stakeholders who are involved in and/or affected by transport and energy policies. It not only overviews the history of relevant research and presents new developments but also extensively discusses the future research issues. Various findings are summarized for reducing energy consumption from a behavioral perspective. This book provides readers with behavioral insights into more effective policymaking. Behavioral interventions are recommended as a key policy instrument for reducing energy consumption in a sustainable way. It provides policy makers with comprehensive insights into making more effective policies over the whole process of policymaking. The book can serve as a handbook for researchers and a textbook for graduate students in the fields of transport, energy, environment, planning, public policy, behavioral studies, and so on. - Examines transport and domestics issues associated with energy from a behavioral perspective in both an interdisciplinary and comprehensive way - Offers an overview of current relevant research and the most recent developments - Provides rich information about future research trends and innovative insights into effective policymaking",Business & Economics,452,N/A,0,en

Urban Street Design Guide,National Association of City Transportation Officials,Island Press,2013-10-01,"The NACTO Urban Street Design Guide shows how streets of every size can be reimagined and reoriented to prioritize safe driving and transit, biking, walking, and public activity. Unlike older, more conservative engineering manuals, this design guide emphasizes the core principle that urban streets are public places and have a larger role to play in communities than solely being conduits for traffic. The well-illustrated guide offers blueprints of street design from multiple perspectives, from the bird’s eye view to granular details. Case studies from around the country clearly show how to implement best practices, as well as provide guidance for customizing design applications to a city’s unique needs. Urban Street Design Guide outlines five goals and tenets of world-class street design: • Streets are public spaces. Streets play a much larger role in the public life of cities and communities than just thoroughfares for traffic. • Great streets are great for business. Well-designed streets generate higher revenues for businesses and higher values for homeowners. • Design for safety. Traffic engineers can and should design streets where people walking, parking, shopping, bicycling, working, and driving can cross paths safely. • Streets can be changed. Transportation engineers can work flexibly within the building envelope of a street. Many city streets were created in a different era and need to be reconfigured to meet new needs. • Act now! Implement projects quickly using temporary materials to help inform public decision making. Elaborating on these fundamental principles, the guide offers substantive direction for cities seeking to improve street design to create more inclusive, multi-modal urban environments. It is an exceptional resource for redesigning streets to serve the needs of 21st century cities, whose residents and visitors demand a variety of transportation options, safer streets, and vibrant community life.",Architecture,0,N/A,0,en

Schedule-Based Modeling of Transportation Networks,"Nigel H. M.

Conceived for the simulation of transit systems, in the last few years the schedule-based approach has been expanded and applied to operational planning of other transportation schedule services besides mass transit, e.g. freight transport. This innovative approach allows forecasting the evolution over time of the on-board loads on the services and their time-varying performance, using credible user behavioral hypotheses. It opens new frontiers in transportation modeling to support network design, timetable setting, and investigation of congestion effects, as well as the assessment of such new technologies, such as users system information (ITS technologies).",Technology & Engineering,319,N/A,0,en

Lean Transportation Management,Mohamed Achahchah,CRC Press,2018-09-17,"This book provides an overview of the key transportation management processes from a shipper’s perspective. It enables managers to gain quick insight in the added value of transportation as a strategic differentiator, its key drivers, and guidelines on how to use them in an effective and efficient decision-making process. It explains how to identify and eliminate waste using basic Lean tools and proven concepts. The reader is guided on how to start implementing the Lean methodology and best practices in the industry to realize significant savings. Companies such as Adidas and Amazon are using transportation to increase sales by delivering purchased products faster than the competition. These companies do not treat transportation as a cost center. They are not focusing on reducing transportation spending. They allow customers to buy any product that is available in any store or warehouse and have it delivered to their homes. By delivering faster than the competition, they increase sales. At the same time, they lower their total supply chain costs as faster deliveries lead to fewer returns. Reduction of returns means higher sales and lower transportation costs for returns. The result is higher profits while creating more value for the customer. Transportation is moving from a cost center towards a profit center. The traditional logistics service providers are perceived to not innovate fast enough. Top management must understand the transportation management basics and use it in their strategic decision-making. They should be involved in discussions on how to organize the transport management function in the best way and how to use it as a service differentiator. Transportation is more than the efficient movement of supplies, sub-assemblies and final products. In addition, it is more than the key performance indicators on the business-balanced scorecard. Transportation management professionals fail to catch top management’s attention due to the use of technical language. It is more difficult to understand transportation key performance indicators such as loading degree, net and gross pick-up and delivery reliability. It is easier to get top management attention when talking about lost sales due to stock-outs, lost tenders due to long delivery times, high inventory holding and scrap costs.",Business & Economics,183,N/A,0,en

Transport Models in Urban Planning Practices,"Marco te Brömmelstroet, Luca Bertolini",Routledge,2016-04-08,"This book explores how transportation models can play a role in a changing transport planning and policy making context. Most models are rooted in decades of development work and are geared to offer value-free, academic and explicit knowledge to transport planning experts. However, planning practice has changed dramatically over the years, resulting in a less technical rational view on the use of such knowledge – especially so in early, strategy making phases. More and more complex policy goals, integration of a wide area of other policy domains, a wider, ever-changing and much more mixed group of planning participants and much more focus on ‘wicked problems’. The book maps how this influences the effectiveness of transport modelling exercises and explores several state-of-the-art implementations. This book was published as a special issue of Transport Reviews.",Architecture,169,N/A,0,en

Transportation for Livable Cities,Vukan R. Vuchic,Routledge,1999,"The twenty-first century finds civilization heavily based in cities that have grown into large metropolitan areas. Many of these focal points of human activity face problems of economic inefficiency, environmental deterioration, and an unsatisfactory quality of life--problems that go far in determining whether a city is ""livable."" A large share of these problems stems from the inefficiencies and other impacts of urban transportation systems. The era of projects aimed at maximizing vehicular travel is being replaced by the broader goal of achieving livable cities: economically efficient, socially sound, and environmentally friendly. This book explores the complex relationship between transportation and the character of cities and metropolitan regions. Vukan Vuchic applies his experience in urban transportation systems and policies to present a systematic review of transportation modes and their characteristics. Transportation for Livable Cities dispels the myths and emotional advocacies for or against freeways, rail transit, bicycles,and other modes of transportation. The author discusses the consequences of excessive automobile dependence and shows that the most livable cities worldwide have intermodal systems that balance highway and public transit modes while providing for pedestrians, bicyclists, and paratransit. Vuchic defines the policies necessary for achieving livable cities: the effective implementation of integrated intermodal transportation systems.",Architecture,422,N/A,0,en

Green Transportation Logistics,Harilaos N. Psaraftis,Springer,2016-10-15,"This book examines the state of the art in green transportation logistics from the perspective of balancing environmental performance in the transportation supply chain while also satisfying traditional economic performance criteria. Part of the book is drawn from the recently completed European Union project Super Green, a three-year project intended to promote the development of European freight corridors in an environmentally friendly manner. Additional chapters cover both the methodological base and the application context of green transportation logistics. Individual chapters look at the policy context; the basics of transportation emissions; Green Corridors basics; the concept of TEN-T (Trans-European Network); Benchmarking of green corridors; the potential role of ICT (Information and Communication Technologies); Green vehicle routing; Reducing maritime CO2 emissions via market based measures and speed and route optimization; Sulphur emissions; Lifecycle emissions; Green rail transportation; Green air transportation; Green inland navigation and possible areas for further research. Throughout, the book pursues the goal of “win-win” solutions and analyzes the phenomenon of “push-down, pop-up”, wherein a change in one aspect of a problem can cause another troubling aspect to arise. For example, speed reduction in maritime transportation can reduce emissions and fuel costs, but could require additional ships and could raise in-transit inventory costs. Or, regulations to reduce sulphur emissions may ultimately increase CO2 elsewhere in the supply chain. The book takes stock at the various tradeoffs that are at stake in the goal of greening the supply chain and looks at where balances can be struck.",Business & Economics,0,N/A,0,en

A Streetcar to Subduction and Other Plate Tectonic Trips by Public Transport in San Francisco,Clyde Wahrhaftig,American Geophysical Union,1991-01-08,"Published by the American Geophysical Union as part of the Special Publications Series. It is hard to be unaware of the earth in San Francisco. Built on rocky hills, the city is surrounded on three sides by bay and ocean that can be seen from nearly everywhere within it. Precipitous cliffs face the city from across the Golden Gate, and the skyline to the north, east, and south is dominated by mountains. Occasional tremors from the San Andreas and related faults nearby remind us that the earth here is active. Until recently the rocks so abundantly exposed in San Francisco baffled geologists. Jumbled together without apparent order and lacking visible fossils, they defied explanation. The theory of plate tectonics has changed all that. We now have an explanation for the origin of the rocks of San Francisco, although it is anything but simple.",Science,0,N/A,0,en

Ethnographic vignettes introduce the feel and form of the Metro and let readers experience the city, scene by scene, stop by stop, as if they, too, have come along for the ride. Laying bare the radical possibilities and concretized inequalities of the Metro, and how people live with and through its built environment, this is a story of women and men on the move, the nature of Indian aspiration, and what it takes morally and materially to sustain urban life. Through exquisite prose, Rashmi Sadana transports the reader to a city shaped by both its Metro and those who depend on it, revealing a perspective on Delhi unlike any other.",History,262,N/A,0,en

An Introduction to Transportation Geography,Julie Cidell,Rowman & Littlefield,2021-09-22,"This clear text provides a broad introduction to transportation geography. With an emphasis on the social and political aspects of transport, Julie Cidell takes a multi-scalar approach across multiple modes and places. She covers waterborne transport, starting with logistics systems; aviation and air travel; railroads; roads (including bicycles and pedestrians as well as cars); and public transit. Each mode covers global systems of transportation, how national identities or landscapes are shaped by transport, the impact of regional governance, the local scale and how it integrates with each of these systems, and how individuals and bodies are part of these systems as well. Throughout, Cidell considers the concepts of equity and sustainability in terms of past, present, and possible future transportation systems. She provides historical and current perspectives to help us think about our present situation and how we might work toward more sustainable transport futures.",Social Science,263,N/A,0,en

Airline Marketing and Management,Mr Stephen Shaw,"Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.",2012-10-01,"Through six previous editions, Airline Marketing and Management has established itself as the leading textbook for students of marketing and its application to today's airline industry, as well as a reference work for those with a professional interest in the area. Carefully revised, the seventh edition of this internationally successful book examines an exceptionally turbulent period for the industry. It features new material on: ∗Changes in customer needs, particularly regarding more business travellers choosing - or being forced - to travel economy, and analysis of the bankruptcy of 'All Business Class' airlines. ∗ An explanation of the US/EU 'Open Skies' agreement and analysis of its impact. ∗The increase in alliance activity and completion of several recent mergers, and the marketing advantages and disadvantages that have resulted. ∗ Product adjustments that airlines must make to adapt to changes in the marketing environment, such as schedule re-adjustments and the reconfiguration of aircraft cabins. ∗Changes in pricing philosophies, with, for example, airlines moving to 'A La Carte' pricing, whereby baggage, catering and priority boarding are paid for as extras. ∗Airline websites and their role as both a selling and distributing tool. ∗The future of airline marketing. A review of the structure of the air transport market and the marketing environment is followed by detailed chapters examining business and marketing strategies, product design and management, pricing and revenue management, current and future distribution channels, and selling, advertising and promotional policies. The reader will benefit from greater understanding of both marketing and airline industry jargon and from knowledge obtained regarding the extraordinary strategic challenges now facing aviation. Written in a straightforward, easy-to-read style and combining up-to-date and relevant examples drawn from the worldwide aviation industry, this new edition will further enhance the book's reputation for providing the ideal introduction to the subject.",Business & Economics,379,5,1,en

The Geography of Transport Systems,"Jean-Paul Rodrigue, Claude Comtois, Brian Slack",Routledge,2013-07-18,"Mobility is fundamental to economic and social activities such as commuting, manufacturing, or supplying energy. Each movement has an origin, a potential set of intermediate locations, a destination, and a nature which is linked with geographical attributes. Transport systems composed of infrastructures, modes and terminals are so embedded in the socio-economic life of individuals, institutions and corporations that they are often invisible to the consumer. This is paradoxical as the perceived invisibility of transportation is derived from its efficiency. Understanding how mobility is linked with geography is main the purpose of this book. The third edition of The Geography of Transport Systems has been revised and updated to provide an overview of the spatial aspects of transportation. This text provides greater discussion of security, energy, green logistics, as well as new and updated case studies, a revised content structure, and new figures. Each chapter covers a specific conceptual dimension including networks, modes, terminals, freight transportation, urban transportation and environmental impacts. A final chapter contains core methodologies linked with transport geography such as accessibility, spatial interactions, graph theory and Geographic Information Systems for transportation (GIS-T). This book provides a comprehensive and accessible introduction to the field, with a broad overview of its concepts, methods, and areas of application. The accompanying website for this text contains a useful additional material, including digital maps, PowerPoint slides, databases, and links to further reading and websites. The website can be accessed at: http://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans This text is an essential resource for undergraduates studying transport geography, as well as those interest in economic and urban geography, transport planning and engineering.",Science,432,N/A,0,en

Transportation and Behavior,Irwin Altman,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-06-29,"The present volume in our series, Human Behavior and Environment, is devoted to a specific topic, continuing the pattern established in the last two volumes. The current theme is behavioral science aspects of trans portation. This topic was chosen to exemplify a problem area of practical import to which psychologists, sociologists, and other behavioral and social scientists can make and have been making notable contributions. Our volume includes papers from a variety of psychological perspec tives, including human factors, environmental psychology, and be havior modification, along with other contributions from a sociologist and a transportation engineer interested in behavioral science contribu tions to transportation. Joining us as guest editor for this volume is Peter Everett, an environmental psychologist whose area of specialty is the study of behavioral components of transportation systems. Volume 6 of our series, currently in preparation, will be devoted to behavior and the natural environment. A provisional table of contents for that volume appears on page v. Irwin Altman Joachim F.

Geocomputation with R,"Robin Lovelace, Jakub Nowosad, Jannes Muenchow",CRC Press,2019-03-22,"Geocomputation with R is for people who want to analyze, visualize and model geographic data with open source software. It is based on R, a statistical programming language that has powerful data processing, visualization, and geospatial capabilities. The book equips you with the knowledge and skills to tackle a wide range of issues manifested in geographic data, including those with scientific, societal, and environmental implications. This book will interest people from many backgrounds, especially Geographic Information Systems (GIS) users interested in applying their domain-specific knowledge in a powerful open source language for data science, and R users interested in extending their skills to handle spatial data. The book is divided into three parts: (I) Foundations, aimed at getting you up-to-speed with geographic data in R, (II) extensions, which covers advanced techniques, and (III) applications to real-world problems. The chapters cover progressively more advanced topics, with early chapters providing strong foundations on which the later chapters build. Part I describes the nature of spatial datasets in R and methods for manipulating them. It also covers geographic data import/export and transforming coordinate reference systems. Part II represents methods that build on these foundations. It covers advanced map making (including web mapping), ""bridges"" to GIS, sharing reproducible code, and how to do cross-validation in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. Part III applies the knowledge gained to tackle real-world problems, including representing and modeling transport systems, finding optimal locations for stores or services, and ecological modeling. Exercises at the end of each chapter give you the skills needed to tackle a range of geospatial problems. Solutions for each chapter and supplementary materials providing extended examples are available at https://geocompr.github.io/geocompkg/articles/.",Mathematics,354,N/A,0,en

B State,Mark Samuel,Greenleaf Book Group,2018-10-16,"Transforming Business, Organizational Culture, and Self In business and life, there are often moments when one simply can't seem to find a way forward. Searching in the past for solutions to persistent problems results in frustration and confusion. Issues in corporate teamwork and individual relationships can feel overwhelming and even insurmountable. There’s a lack of control and a sense of being stuck. B State provides a clear roadmap from point A to point B to rapidly achieve measurable, breakthrough results. It’s about a true transformation that removes old mindsets and silos, while replacing inefficient behaviors with desired habits to quickly create the highest performing culture for groundbreaking business outcomes. Equipped with over 30 years of professional and academic expertise, author, speaker, and change agent Mark Samuel helps companies (and the individuals that comprise them) achieve their B State, enabling them to make the necessary changes they didn’t think were possible. His strategies for finding and enacting solutions to complex challenges use real life examples to help readers embrace accountability and envision their success in order to achieve the transformation they need. This book focuses readers on where they want to go, and it helps them get there fast. ​Written for business executives, managers, supervisors, and leaders at all levels, this is a book about how to not just do business but also live life. It brings about the dynamic forward launch readers are looking for, creating results that are both unprecedented and sustainable.",Business & Economics,260,N/A,0,en

Optimal Transport,Cédric Villani,Springer Science & Business Media,2008-10-26,"At the close of the 1980s, the independent contributions of Yann Brenier, Mike Cullen and John Mather launched a revolution in the venerable field of optimal transport founded by G. Monge in the 18th century, which has made breathtaking forays into various other domains of mathematics ever since. The author presents a broad overview of this area, supplying complete and self-contained proofs of all the fundamental results of the theory of optimal transport at the appropriate level of generality. Thus, the book encompasses the broad spectrum ranging from basic theory to the most recent research results. PhD students or researchers can read the entire book without any prior knowledge of the field. A comprehensive bibliography with notes that extensively discuss the existing literature underlines the book’s value as a most welcome reference text on this subject.",Mathematics,970,N/A,0,en

The Dog Who Could Fly,Damien Lewis,Simon and Schuster,2015-07-21,"""A thoroughly enjoyable story of heroism and true friendship"" (Publishers Weekly, starred review), this Sunday Times top ten bestseller is the true account of a German shepherd who was adopted by the Royal Air Force during World War II, flying countless combat missions and surviving everything from crash-landings to parachute bailouts--ultimately saving the life of his owner and dearest friend. In the winter of 1939 in the cold snow of no-man's-land, two loners met and began an extraordinary journey that would turn them into lifelong friends. One was an orphaned puppy, abandoned by his owners as they fled Nazi forces. The other was a different kind of lost soul--a Czech airman bound for the Royal Air Force and the country that he would come to call home. Airman Robert Bozdech stumbled across the tiny German shepherd--whom he named Ant--after being shot down on a daring mission over enemy lines. Unable to desert the puppy, Robert hid Ant inside his jacket as he escaped. In the months that followed, the pair would save each other's lives countless times as they flew together with RAF Bomber Command. Finally grounded after being injured on a flight mission, Ant refused to abandon his duty, waiting patiently beside the runway for his master's return from every sortie, and refusing food and sleep until they were reunited. By the end of the war, Robert and Ant had become true war heroes, and Ant was justly awarded the Dickin Medal, the ""Animal VC."" With beautiful vintage black-and-white photos of Robert and Ant, The Dog Who Could Fly is a deeply moving story of loyalty in the face of adversity and the unshakable bond between a man and his best friend.",Biography & Autobiography,304,N/A,0,en

It is imperative that accurate information describing the amount, location, and quality of the coal resources and reserves be available to fulfill energy needs. It is also important that the United States extract its coal resources efficiently, safely, and in an environmentally responsible manner. A renewed focus on federal support for coal-related research, coordinated across agencies and with the active participation of the states and industrial sector, is a critical element for each of these requirements.

"Regulation of Tissue Oxygenation, Second Edition",Roland N. Pittman,Biota Publishing,2016-08-18,"This presentation describes various aspects of the regulation of tissue oxygenation, including the roles of the circulatory system, respiratory system, and blood, the carrier of oxygen within these components of the cardiorespiratory system. The respiratory system takes oxygen from the atmosphere and transports it by diffusion from the air in the alveoli to the blood flowing through the pulmonary capillaries. The cardiovascular system then moves the oxygenated blood from the heart to the microcirculation of the various organs by convection, where oxygen is released from hemoglobin in the red blood cells and moves to the parenchymal cells of each tissue by diffusion. Oxygen that has diffused into cells is then utilized in the mitochondria to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy currency of all cells. The mitochondria are able to produce ATP until the oxygen tension or PO2 on the cell surface falls to a critical level of about 4–5 mm Hg. Thus, in order to meet the energetic needs of cells, it is important to maintain a continuous supply of oxygen to the mitochondria at or above the critical PO2 . In order to accomplish this desired outcome, the cardiorespiratory system, including the blood, must be capable of regulation to ensure survival of all tissues under a wide range of circumstances. The purpose of this presentation is to provide basic information about the operation and regulation of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, as well as the properties of the blood and parenchymal cells, so that a fundamental understanding of the regulation of tissue oxygenation is achieved.",Medical,117,N/A,0,en

Rapidly growing transportation network companies (TNCs), such as Uber and Lyft, however, are disrupting conventional taxi and limousine services and are raising policy challenges related to personal security and public safety, insurance requirements, employment and labor issues, and accessibility and equity. The committee's report offers guidance to state and local officials responsible for policy setting and regulation of for-hire transportation services in each of these areas.

Tomcat Rio,Dave Baranek,Simon and Schuster,2020-09-29,"From Topgun to Squadron Command You’re in the cockpit of the legendary F-14 Tomcat fighter, blazing along at twice the speed of sound seven miles above the ocean and the carrier that hurled you off its deck. You’re practicing dogfighting with “aggressors,” guys on your side flying F-16s. You’re patrolling the tense skies above Iraq, and with the push of a button you can launch the 100-mile Phoenix missile that can blow a foe to scrap before you even see him. You are an expert in fighter tactics and aircraft carrier operations, and it all leads to your command of an F-14 fighter squadron of more than three hundred people. Sounds like a week’s worth of daydreams, but it’s all real-life in the career of Dave “Bio” Baranek, and he shares it with you in the exciting, superbly crafted new book, Tomcat Rio. Dave – callsign “Bio” – pulled his readers into the exciting world of the F-14 and the Navy’s TOPGUN program with his popular books Topgun Days and Before Topgun Days. Now he’s back with the rest of the story, as he reaches the top level of expertise and proves it, not just in graded competitions but also where it counts, where you shoot at them and they shoot at you. Dave also shares the challenges he faced. A deadly foe called complacency. Learning a whole new mission late in his career. The unexpected trials that come with leading a squadron in the dynamic environment of Naval Aviation. This third volume is full of adventures, lessons, and inspiration. If you are a casual reader, you’ll turn the last page as a dedicated Tomcat fan. To make it all even more real, Tomcat Rio includes dozens of Bio’s best and most acclaimed photos. Photographer George Hall hailed one shot as “one of the best Tomcat photos ever taken.” In words and pictures, Bio immerses you in rich detail. He pipes you aboard as a member of an F-14 squadron. You share the camaraderie of Type A personalities. You plan risky missions, going toe-to-toe against America’s most volatile foes. You can almost smell the pungent jet exhaust, almost feel the gut-wrenching G’s of a dogfight, as Tomcat Rio pitches you into the thick of it as only Bio can tell it. Strap in! You’re going for one fantastic ride.",History,380,N/A,0,en

American Environmental History,Dan Allosso,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2017-12-14,"An expanded, new and improved American Environmental History textbook for everyone! After years of teaching Environmental History at a major East Coast University without a textbook, Dr. Dan Allosso decided to take matters into his own hands. The result, American Environmental History, is a concise, comprehensive survey covering the material from Dan's undergraduate course. What do people say about the class and the text? ""This was my first semester and this course has created an incredible first impression. If all of the courses are this good, I am going to really enjoy my time here. The course has completely changed the way I look at the world."" (Student in 2014 class) ""One of the few classes I'm really sad is ending, the subject matter is fascinating and Dan is a great guide to it. His approach should be required of all students as it teaches an appreciation for a newer and better way of living."" (Student in 2014 class) ""Allosso's lectures are fantastic. The best I have ever had. So impressed. The material is always extremely interesting and well-presented."" (Student in 2015 class) ""It is just a perfect course that I think should be mandatory if we want to save our planet and live responsibly."" (Student in 2015 class) ""A rare gem for an IB ESS teacher or any social studies teacher looking for an 11th or 12th grade supplementary text that aims to provide an historical context for the environmental reality in America today. Highly recommended."" (District Curriculum Coordinator, 2016) ""I was so impressed with this material that I am using it as a supplement for a course I teach at my college."" (History and Environmental Studies Professor, 2017) Beginning in prehistory and concluding in the present, American Environmental History explores the ways the environment has affected the choices that became our history, and how our choices have affected the environment. The dynamic relationship between people and the world around them is missing from mainstream history. Putting the environment back into history helps us make sense of the past and the present, which will help guide us toward a better future.

Rise of the Rocket Girls,Nathalia Holt,"Little, Brown",2016-04-05,"The riveting true story of the women who launched America into space. In the 1940s and 50s, when the newly minted Jet Propulsion Laboratory needed quick-thinking mathematicians to calculate velocities and plot trajectories, they didn't turn to male graduates. Rather, they recruited an elite group of young women who, with only pencil, paper, and mathematical prowess, transformed rocket design, helped bring about the first American satellites, and made the exploration of the solar system possible. For the first time, Rise of the Rocket Girls tells the stories of these women -- known as ""human computers"" -- who broke the boundaries of both gender and science. Based on extensive research and interviews with all the living members of the team, Rise of the Rocket Girls offers a unique perspective on the role of women in science: both where we've been, and the far reaches of space to which we're heading.

The Great Society Subway,Zachary M. Schrag,JHU Press,2014-08,"As Metro stretches to Tysons Corner and beyond, this paperback edition features a new preface from the author. Drivers in the nation's capital face a host of hazards: high-speed traffic circles, presidential motorcades, jaywalking tourists, and bewildering signs that send unsuspecting motorists from the Lincoln Memorial into suburban Virginia in less than two minutes. And parking? Don't bet on it unless you're in the fast lane of the Capital Beltway during rush hour. Little wonder, then, that so many residents and visitors rely on the Washington Metro, the 106-mile rapid transit system that serves the District of Columbia and its inner suburbs. In the first comprehensive history of the Metro, Zachary M. Schrag tells the story of the Great Society Subway from its earliest rumblings to the present day, from Arlington to College Park, Eisenhower to Marion Barry. Unlike the pre–World War II rail systems of New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia, the Metro was built at a time when most American families already owned cars, and when most American cities had dedicated themselves to freeways, not subways. Why did the nation's capital take a different path? What were the consequences of that decision? Using extensive archival research as well as oral history, Schrag argues that the Metro can be understood only in the political context from which it was born: the Great Society liberalism of the Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon administrations. The Metro emerged from a period when Americans believed in public investments suited to the grandeur and dignity of the world's richest nation. The Metro was built not merely to move commuters, but in the words of Lyndon Johnson, to create ""a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community."" Schrag scrutinizes the project from its earliest days, including general planning, routes, station architecture, funding decisions, land-use impacts, and the behavior of Metro riders. The story of the Great Society Subway sheds light on the development of metropolitan Washington, postwar urban policy, and the promises and limits of rail transit in American cities.",Architecture,380,N/A,0,en

The Forgotten 500,Gregory A. Freeman,Penguin,2008-09-02,"The astonishing, never-before-told story of the greatest rescue mission of World War II—when the OSS set out to recover more than 500 airmen trapped behind enemy lines in Yugoslavia. “An amazing, riveting tale of unsung heroes who went above and beyond.”—James Bradley, New York Times bestselling author of Flags of Our Fathers During a bombing campaign over Romanian oil fields, hundreds of American airmen were shot down in Nazi-occupied Yugoslavia. Local Serbian farmers and peasants risked their own lives to give refuge to the soldiers while they waited for rescue, and in 1944, Operation Halyard was born. The risks were incredible. The starving Americans in Yugoslavia had to construct a landing strip large enough for C-47 cargo planes—without tools, without alerting the Germans, and without endangering the villagers. And the cargo planes had to make it through enemy airspace and back—without getting shot down themselves. Classified for over half a century for political reasons, the full account of this unforgettable story of loyalty, self-sacrifice, and bravery is now being told for the first time ever.

"Trains, Buses, People",Christof Spieler,Island Press,2018-10-23,"What are the best transit cities in the US? The best Bus Rapid Transit lines? The most useless rail transit lines? The missed opportunities? In the US, the 25 largest metropolitan areas and many smaller cities have fixed guideway transit—rail or bus rapid transit. Nearly all of them are talking about expanding. Yet discussions about transit are still remarkably unsophisticated. To build good transit, the discussion needs to focus on what matters—quality of service (not the technology that delivers it), all kinds of transit riders, the role of buildings, streets and sidewalks, and, above all, getting transit in the right places. Christof Spieler has spent over a decade advocating for transit as a writer, community leader, urban planner, transit board member, and enthusiast. He strongly believes that just about anyone—regardless of training or experience—can identify what makes good transit with the right information. In the fun and accessible Trains, Buses, People: An Opinionated Atlas of US Transit, Spieler shows how cities can build successful transit. He profiles the 47 metropolitan areas in the US that have rail transit or BRT, using data, photos, and maps for easy comparison. The best and worst systems are ranked and Spieler offers analysis of how geography, politics, and history complicate transit planning. He shows how the unique circumstances of every city have resulted in very different transit systems. Using appealing visuals, Trains, Buses, People is intended for non-experts—it will help any citizen, professional, or policymaker with a vested interest evaluate a transit proposal and understand what makes transit effective. While the book is built on data, it has a strong point of view. Spieler takes an honest look at what makes good and bad transit and is not afraid to look at what went wrong. He explains broad concepts, but recognizes all of the technical, geographical, and political difficulties of building transit in the real world. In the end,Trains, Buses, People shows that it is possible with the right tools to build good transit.",Transportation,266,N/A,0,en

Hell's Angels,Jay A. Stout,Penguin,2015-01-06,"The true story of World War 2’s legendary Hell’s Angels—the 8th Air Force’s 303rd Bomb Group. Although the United States declared war against Germany in December 1941, a successful assault on Nazi-occupied Europe could not happen until Germany’s industrial and military might were crippled. The first target was the Luftwaffe—the most powerful and battle-hardened air force in the world. The United States Army Air Forces joined with Great Britain’s already-engaged Royal Air Force to launch a strategic air campaign that ultimately brought the Luftwaffe to its knees. One of the standout units of this campaign was the legendary 303rd Bomb Group—Hell’s Angels. This is the 303rd’s story, as told by the men who made it what it was. Taking their name from their B-17 of the same name, they became one of the most distinguished and important air combat units in history. The dramatic and terrible air battles they fought against Germany ultimately changed the course of the war. INCLUDES PHOTOS",History,468,5,2,en

The Fleet at Flood Tide,James D. Hornfischer,Bantam,2017-11-14,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • The extraordinary story of the World War II air, land, and sea campaign that brought the U.S. Navy to the apex of its strength and marked the rise of the United States as a global superpower Winner, Commodore John Barry Book Award, Navy League of the United States • Winner, John Lehman Distinguished Naval Historian Award, Naval Order of the United States With its thunderous assault on the Mariana Islands in June 1944, the United States crossed the threshold of total war. In this tour de force of dramatic storytelling, distilled from extensive research in newly discovered primary sources, James D. Hornfischer brings to life the campaign that was the fulcrum of the drive to compel Tokyo to surrender—and that forever changed the art of modern war. With a close focus on high commanders, front-line combatants, and ordinary people, American and Japanese alike, Hornfischer tells the story of the climactic end of the Pacific War as has never been done before. Here are the epic seaborne invasions of Saipan, Tinian, and Guam, the stunning aerial battles of the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot, the first large-scale use of Navy underwater demolition teams, the largest banzai attack of the war, and the daring combat operations large and small that made possible the strategic bombing offensive culminating in the atomic strikes on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. From the seas of the Central Pacific to the shores of Japan itself, The Fleet at Flood Tide is a stirring, authoritative, and cinematic portrayal of World War II’s world-changing finale.

Transportation After Deregulation,B Starr McMullen,Elsevier,2001-09-12,"Several of the papers in this volume are concerned with assessing both the timing and the impacts of deregulation and regulatory reform in the US transportation sector. Of increasing interest is the importance of productivity growth and the role played by new technologies in a more competitive market environment. Four of the papers in this volume deal directly with these issues in the context of motor carriers and railroads, two sectors which have been operating under substantially reduced regulatory constraints for the past twenty years in the US. Although the financial condition of US railroads has improved since 1980, there is still some concern regarding their long run viability as private enterprises. Accordingly, one of the papers considers the potential for further reductions in railroad costs through transcontinental mergers, a controversial issue due to the small number of railroads that remain in the industry.",Transportation,161,N/A,0,en
The Wright Brothers,David McCullough,Simon and Schuster,2015-05-05,"The #1 New York Times bestseller from David McCullough, two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize—the dramatic story-behind-the-story about the courageous brothers who taught the world how to fly—Wilbur and Orville Wright. On a winter day in 1903, in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, two brothers—bicycle mechanics from Dayton, Ohio—changed history. But it would take the world some time to believe that the age of flight had begun, with the first powered machine carrying a pilot. Orville and Wilbur Wright were men of exceptional courage and determination, and of far-ranging intellectual interests and ceaseless curiosity. When they worked together, no problem seemed to be insurmountable. Wilbur was unquestionably a genius. Orville had such mechanical ingenuity as few had ever seen. That they had no more than a public high school education and little money never stopped them in their mission to take to the air. Nothing did, not even the self-evident reality that every time they took off, they risked being killed. In this “enjoyable, fast-paced tale” (The Economist), master historian David McCullough “shows as never before how two Ohio boys from a remarkable family taught the world to fly” (The Washington Post) and “captures the marvel of what the Wrights accomplished” (The Wall Street Journal). He draws on the extensive Wright family papers to profile not only the brothers but their sister, Katharine, without whom things might well have gone differently for them. Essential reading, this is “a story of timeless importance, told with uncommon empathy and fluency…about what might be the most astonishing feat mankind has ever accomplished…The Wright Brothers soars” (The New York Times Book Review).",Biography & Autobiography,336,4,1,en
Topics in Optimal Transportation,Cédric Villani,American Mathematical Soc.,2021-08-25,"This is the first comprehensive introduction to the theory of mass transportation with its many—and sometimes unexpected—applications. In a novel approach to the subject, the book both surveys the topic and includes a chapter of problems, making it a particularly useful graduate textbook. In 1781, Gaspard Monge defined the problem of “optimal transportation” (or the transferring of mass with the least possible amount of work), with applications to engineering in mind. In 1942, Leonid Kantorovich applied the newborn machinery of linear programming to Monge's problem, with applications to economics in mind. In 1987, Yann Brenier used optimal transportation to prove a new projection theorem on the set of measure preserving maps, with applications to fluid mechanics in mind. Each of these contributions marked the beginning of a whole mathematical theory, with many unexpected ramifications. Nowadays, the Monge-Kantorovich problem is used and studied by researchers from extremely diverse horizons, including probability theory, functional analysis, isoperimetry, partial differential equations, and even meteorology. Originating from a graduate course, the present volume is intended for graduate students and researchers, covering both theory and applications. Readers are only assumed to be familiar with the basics of measure theory and functional analysis.",Education,402,N/A,0,en

Curb Rights,"Daniel B. Klein, Adrian Moore, Binyam Reja",Brookings Inst Press,1997,"The authors of this book say it's time to rethink the fundamental structure of transit policy. The book focuses on street-based transit - buses, shuttles, and jitneys. The authors propose that urban transit be brought into the fold of market activity by establishing property rights not only in vehicles, but also in curb zones and transit stops. Market competition and entrepreneurship would depend on a foundation of what they call ""curb rights"". By creating exclusive and transferable curb rights (to bus stops and other pickup points) leased by auction, the authors contend that American cities can have the best of both kinds of markets - scheduled (and unsubsidized) bus service and unscheduled but faster and more flexible jitneys. They maintain that a carefully planned transit system based on property rights would rid the transit market of inefficient government production and overregulation. It would also avoid the problems of a lawless market - cutthroat competition, schedule jockeying, and even curbside conflict among rival operators. Entrepreneurs would be free, able, and driven to introduce ever better service, revise schedules and route structures, establish connections among transit providers, facilitate passenger interchange, introduce new vehicles, and use new pricing strategies. And travelers would find public transit more attractive than they do now.",Business & Economics,148,N/A,0,en
Freedom's Main Line,Derek Charles Catsam,University Press of Kentucky,2009-01-23,"“A compelling, spellbinding examination of a pivotal event in civil rights history . . . a highly readable and dramatic account of a major turning point.” —Journal of African-American History Black Americans in the Jim Crow South could not escape the grim reality of racial segregation, whether enforced by law or by custom. In Freedom’s Main Line: The Journey of Reconciliation and the Freedom Rides, author Derek Charles Catsam shows that courtrooms, classrooms, and cemeteries were not the only front lines in African Americans’ prolonged struggle for basic civil rights. Buses, trains, and other modes of public transportation provided the perfect means for civil rights activists to protest the second-class citizenship of African Americans, bringing the reality of the violence of segregation into the consciousness of America and the world. Freedom’s Main Line argues that the Freedom Rides, a turning point in the Civil Rights Movement, were a logical, natural evolution of such earlier efforts as the Journey of Reconciliation, relying on the principles of nonviolence so common in the larger movement. The impact of the Freedom Rides, however, was unprecedented, fixing the issue of civil rights in the national consciousness. Later activists were often dubbed Freedom Riders even if they never set foot on a bus. With challenges to segregated transportation as his point of departure, Catsam chronicles black Americans’ long journey toward increased civil rights. Freedom’s Main Line tells the story of bold incursions into the heart of institutional discrimination, journeys undertaken by heroic individuals who forced racial injustice into the national and international spotlight and helped pave the way for the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964.",History,373,5,1,en

Street Smart,Samuel I Schwartz,PublicAffairs,2015-08-18,"On a Saturday morning in December 1973, a section of New York's West Side Highway collapsed under the weight of a truck full of asphalt. The road was closed, seemingly for good, and the 80,000 cars that traveled it each day had to find a new way to their destinations. It ought to have produced traffic chaos, but it didn't. The cars simply vanished. It was a moment of revelation: the highway had induced the demand for car travel. It was a classic case of ""build it and they will come,"" but for the first time the opposite had been shown to be true: knock it down and they will go away. Samuel I. Schwartz was inspired by the lesson. He started to reimagine cities, most of all his beloved New York, freed from their obligation to cars. Eventually, he found, he was not alone. Since the turn of the twenty-first century, a surreptitious revolution has taken place: every year Americans are driving fewer miles. And the generation named for this new century -- the Millennials -- are driving least of all. Not because they can't afford to; they don't want to. They have better ideas for how to use their streets. An urban transformation is underway, and smart streets are at the heart of it. They will boost property prices and personal fitness, roll back years of congestion and smog, and offer a transformative experience of American urban life. From San Francisco to Salt Lake, Charleston to Houston, the American city is becoming a better and better place to be. Schwartz's Street Smart is a dazzling and affectionate history of the struggle for control of American cities, and an inspiring off-road map to a more vibrant, active, and vigorous urban future.",Political Science,313,N/A,0,en

The 9/11 attacks—and other attacks on surface transportation assets, including the bombings in Madrid, London, Moscow, and Mumbai—demonstrate the vulnerability of the open systems to disruption and the consequences of the attacks on people, property, and the economy. Now more than ever, it has become imperative for businesses operating in the transportation and transit sectors to develop comprehensive security programs accounting for both natural and man-made hazards and safeguarding people, places, and equipment—while at the same time ensuring operations continuity. Providing transportation managers with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to effectively manage the security of transportation assets, Introduction to Transportation Security examines: Basic theories of security and emergency management The integrated nature of the nation’s critical infrastructure and the threats to transportation in each surface mode Federal agencies working in emergency management and transportation security and their intelligence and response requirements and capabilities The types of disasters that have occurred in the U.S. and selected nations, and their significant economic impacts Cost-beneficial security strategies aimed at preventing catastrophic failures in each transportation mode Effective methods for organizing, testing, and evaluating transportation security across modes and professions The book covers all transportation modes and their interconnectivity—including highway, air cargo, freight and passenger rail, transit, and maritime. It presents learning objectives and discussion questions to test assimilation of the material and case studies to facilitate a practical understanding of the concepts.

Paratransit is a type of service which relies on small vehicles which are frequently privately owned and operated, and which may not work on a schedule. The various options concerning service types, market niches, and effectiveness are discussed, along with the future of paratransit.

Introductory chapters on ""tools"" cover topics such as graphical methods, optimization, probability, stochastic processes, statistics and simulation; these are complemented by application chapters on traffic dynamics, control, observation, and scheduled modes, where the fundamental ideas are presented in depth. A key element of the author's approach is that only that material is presented which is definitely known and correct. At the same time, an effort has been made to point out various pitfalls and common errors so that they can be avoided. The result is an invaluable source of reliable, well grounded and clearly explained ideas, tools and techniques for the transportation professional.",Business & Economics,364,3,1,en
Implementation and Outcomes of Fare-free Transit Systems,"Joel Volinski, Transit Cooperative Research Program",Transportation Research Board,2012,"The purpose of this synthesis was to document the past and current experiences of public transit agencies that have planned, implemented, and operated fare-free transit systems. The report concentrates on public transit agencies that are either direct recipients or sub-recipients of federal transit grants and provide fare-free service to everyone in their service area on every mode they provide. The report will be of interest to transit managers and staffs, small urban and rural areas, university, and resort communities, as well as stakeholders and policy makers at all levels who would be interested in knowing the social benefits and macro impacts of providing affordable mobility through fare-free public transit. A review of the relevant literature was conducted for this effort. Reports provide statistics on changes in levels of ridership associated with fare-free service. White papers or agency reports identified by the topic panel or discovered through interviews with fare-free transit managers were also reviewed. Through topic panel input, Internet searches, listserv communications, and APTA and TRB sources, the first comprehensive listing of public transit agencies that provide fare-free service in the United States was identified. A selected survey of these identified public transit agencies yielded an 82% response rate (32/39). The report offers a look at policy and administrative issues through survey responses. Five case studies, achieved through interviews, represent the three types of communities that were found to be most likely to adopt a fare-free policy: rural and small urban, university dominated, and resort communities.",Transportation,105,N/A,0,en

Rights in Transit,Kafui Ablode Attoh,University of Georgia Press,2019-02-01,"Is public transportation a right? Should it be? For those reliant on public transit, the answer is invariably “yes” to both. Indeed, when city officials propose slashing service or raising fares, it is these riders who are often the first to appear at that officials’ door demanding their “right” to more service. Rights in Transit starts from the presumption that such riders are justified. For those who lack other means of mobility, transit is a lifeline. It offers access to many of the entitlements we take as essential: food, employment, and democratic public life itself. While accepting transit as a right, this book also suggests that there remains a desperate need to think critically, both about what is meant by a right and about the types of rights at issue when public transportation is threatened. Drawing on a detailed case study of the various struggles that have come to define public transportation in California’s East Bay, Rights in Transit offers a direct challenge to contemporary scholarship on transportation equity. Rather than focusing on civil rights alone, Rights in Transit argues for engaging the more radical notion of the right to the city.",Political Science,178,N/A,0,en

Back to Work,Bill Clinton,Knopf,2011-11-08,"“I wrote this book because I love my country and I'm concerned about our future,” writes Bill Clinton. “As I often said when I first ran for President in 1992, America at its core is an idea—the idea that no matter who you are or where you're from, if you work hard and play by the rules, you'll have the freedom and opportunity to pursue your own dreams and leave your kids a country where they can chase theirs.” In Back to Work, Clinton details how we can get out of the current economic crisis and lay a foundation for long-term prosperity. He offers specific recommendations on how we can put people back to work and create new businesses, increase bank lending and corporate investment, double our exports, and restore our manufacturing base. He supports President Obama’s emphasis on green technology, saying that change in the way we produce and consume energy is the strategy most likely to spark a fast-growing economy and enhance our national security. Clinton also says that we need both a strong economy and a smart government working together to restore prosperity and progress. He demonstrates that whenever we’ve given in to the temptation to blame government for our problems, we’ve lost our commitment to shared prosperity, balanced growth, financial responsibility, and investment in the future. That has led our nation into trouble because there are some things we have to do together. For example, he says, “Our ability to compete in the twenty-first century is dependent on our willingness to invest in infrastructure: we need faster broadband, a state-of-the-art national electrical grid, modernized water and sewer systems, and the best airports, trains, roads, and bridges. “There is no evidence that we can succeed in the twenty-first century with an antigovernment strategy,” writes Clinton, “with a philosophy grounded in ‘You’re on your own’ rather than ‘We’re all in this together.’” Clinton believes that conflict between government and the private sector has proved to be remarkably good politics, but it has produced bad policies, giving us a weak economy with few jobs, growing income inequality and poverty, and a decline in our competitive position. In the real world, cooperation works much better than conflict, and “we need victories in the real world.”",Political Science,210,3,755,en

Topics in Optimal Transportation,Cédric Villani,American Mathematical Soc.,2003,"Cedric Villani's book is a lucid and very readable documentation of the tremendous recent analytic progress in ``optimal mass transportation'' theory and of its diverse and unexpected applications in optimization, nonlinear PDE, geometry, and mathematical physics. --Lawrence C. Evans, University of California at Berkeley In 1781, Gaspard Monge defined the problem of ``optimal transportation'', or the transferring of mass with the least possible amount of work, with applications to engineering in mind. In 1942, Leonid Kantorovich applied the newborn machinery of linear programming to Monge's problem, with applications to economics in mind. In 1987, Yann Brenier used optimal transportation to prove a new projection theorem on the set of measure preserving maps, with applications to fluid mechanics in mind. Each of these contributions marked the beginning of a whole mathematical theory, with many unexpected ramifications. Nowadays, the Monge-Kantorovich problem is used and studied by researchers from extremely diverse horizons, including probability theory, functional analysis, isoperimetry, partial differential equations, and even meteorology. Originating from a graduate course, the present volume is at once an introduction to the field of optimal transportation and a survey of the research on the topic over the last 15 years. The book is intended for graduate students and researchers, and it covers both theory and applications. Readers are only assumed to be familiar with the basics of measure theory and functional analysis.",Monge-Ampère equations,402,N/A,0,en

The Quartermaster Department coordinated transportation support for the Army until World War I revealed the need for a dedicated corps of specialists. The newly established Transportation Corps, however, lasted for only a few years. Its significant utility for coordinating military transportation became again transparent during World War II, and it was resurrected in mid-1942 to meet the unparalleled logistical demands of fighting in distant theaters. Finally becoming a permanent branch in 1950, the Transportation Corps continued to demonstrate its capability of rapidly supporting U.S. Army operations in global theaters over the next fifty years. With useful lessons of high-quality support that validate the necessity of adequate transportation in a viable national defense posture, it is an important resource for those now involved in military transportation and movement for ongoing expeditionary operations. This text should be useful to both officers and noncommissioned officers who can take examples from the past and apply the successful principles to future operations, thus ensuring a continuing legacy of Transportation excellence within Army operations.

Petri Net Synthesis,"Eric Badouel, Luca Bernardinello, Philippe Darondeau",Springer,2015-11-02,"This book is a comprehensive, systematic survey of the synthesis problem, and of region theory which underlies its solution, covering the related theory, algorithms, and applications. The authors focus on safe Petri nets and place/transition nets (P/T-nets), treating synthesis as an automated process which, given behavioural specifications or partial specifications of a system to be realized, decides whether the specifications are feasible, and then produces a Petri net realizing them exactly, or if this is not possible produces a Petri net realizing an optimal approximation of the specifications. In Part I the authors introduce elementary net synthesis. In Part II they explain variations of elementary net synthesis and the unified theory of net synthesis. The first three chapters of Part III address the linear algebraic structure of regions, synthesis of P/T-nets from finite initialized transition systems, and the synthesis of unbounded P/T-nets. Finally, the last chapter in Part III and the chapters in Part IV cover more advanced topics and applications: P/T-net with the step firing rule, extracting concurrency from transition systems, process discovery, supervisory control, and the design of speed-independent circuits. Most chapters conclude with exercises, and the book is a valuable reference for both graduate students of computer science and electrical engineering and researchers and engineers in this domain.",Computers,340,N/A,0,en
Incomplete Streets,"Stephen Zavestoski, Julian Agyeman",Routledge,2014-08-27,"The ‘Complete Streets' concept and movement in urban planning and policy has been hailed by many as a revolution that aims to challenge the auto-normative paradigm by reversing the broader effects of an urban form shaped by the logic of keeping automobiles moving. By enabling safe access for all users, Complete Streets promise to make cities more walkable and livable and at the same time more sustainable. This book problematizes the Complete Streets concept by suggesting that streets should not be thought of as merely physical spaces, but as symbolic and social spaces. When important social and symbolic narratives are missing from the discourse and practice of Complete Streets, what actually results are incomplete streets. The volume questions whether the ways in which complete streets narratives, policies, plans and efforts are envisioned and implemented might be systematically reproducing many of the urban spatial and social inequalities and injustices that have characterized cities for the last century or more. From critiques of a ""mobility bias"" rooted in the neoliberal foundations of the Complete Streets concept, to concerns about resulting environmental gentrification, the chapters in Incomplete Streets variously call for planning processes that give voice to the historically marginalized and, more broadly, that approach streets as dynamic, fluid and public social places. This interdisciplinary book is aimed at students, researchers and professionals in the fields of urban geography, environmental studies, urban planning and policy, transportation planning, and urban sociology.",Business & Economics,369,N/A,0,en

International Encyclopedia of Transportation,,Elsevier,2021-05-13,"In an increasingly globalised world, despite reductions in costs and time, transportation has become even more important as a facilitator of economic and human interaction; this is reflected in technical advances in transportation systems, increasing interest in how transportation interacts with society and the need to provide novel approaches to understanding its impacts. This has become particularly acute with the impact that Covid-19 has had on transportation across the world, at local, national and international levels. Encyclopedia of Transportation, Seven Volume Set - containing almost 600 articles - brings a cross-cutting and integrated approach to all aspects of transportation from a variety of interdisciplinary fields including engineering, operations research, economics, geography and sociology in order to understand the changes taking place. Emphasising the interaction between these different aspects of research, it offers new solutions to modern-day problems related to transportation. Each of its nine sections is based around familiar themes, but brings together the views of experts from different disciplinary perspectives. Each section is edited by a subject expert who has commissioned articles from a range of authors representing different disciplines, different parts of the world and different social perspectives. The nine sections are structured around the following themes: Transport Modes; Freight Transport and Logistics; Transport Safety and Security; Transport Economics; Traffic Management; Transport Modelling and Data Management; Transport Policy and Planning; Transport Psychology; Sustainability and Health Issues in Transportation. Some articles provide a technical introduction to a topic whilst others provide a bridge between topics or a more future-oriented view of new research areas or challenges. The end result is a reference work that offers researchers and practitioners new approaches, new ways of thinking and novel solutions to problems. All-encompassing and expertly authored, this outstanding reference work will be essential reading for all students and researchers interested in transportation and its global impact in what is a very uncertain world.

Diffusion Models of Environmental Transport,"Bruce Choy, Danny D. Reible",CRC Press,2017-12-14,"Fate and transport models are critical components in the determination of the exposure to and risk from hazardous contaminants. Analytical models are preferable because they are generally more accessible, more reliable, and require fewer computational resources. Surprisingly, until today, only a limited number of analytical models have been accessible in the literature. Now, there is Diffusion Models of Environmental Transport, which provides more than 40 analytical models of diffusion and advective-diffusion in one, two, and three layer systems, subject to a wide range of boundary and initial conditions. This text illustrates applications to contaminant transport in sediments and soils, including porewater and vapor transport, and also provides Mathcad spreadsheets to aid in the use of these models. The authors supply complete details of the solutions to the models for those who wish for a deeper understanding. For others, who do not have the time or the need, the solutions themselves are ready to be picked up and used. Reible and Choy use their 20-plus years of cumulative experience to create a thorough exploration of fate and transport models. This comprehensive text furnishes an invaluable reference for students and environmental professionals.",Science,202,N/A,0,en

Experiencing Narrative Worlds,Richard Gerrig,Routledge,2018-02-23,"What does it mean to be transported by a narrative?to create a world inside one's head? How do experiences of narrative worlds alter our experience of the real world? In this book Richard Gerrig integrates insights from cognitive psychology and from research linguistics, philosophy, and literary criticism to provide a cohesive account of what we have most often treated as isolated aspects of narrative experience.Drawing on examples from Tolstoy to Toni Morrison, Gerrig offers new analysis of some classic problems in the study of narrative. He discusses the ways in which we are cognitively equipped to tackle fictional and nonfictional narratives; how thought and emotion interact when we experience narrative; how narrative information influences judgments in the real world; and the reasons we can feel the same excitement and suspense when we reread a book as when we read it for the first time. Gerrig also explores the ways we enhance the experience of narratives, through finding solutions to textual dilemmas, enjoying irony at the expense of characters in the narrative, and applying a wide range of interpretive techniques to discover meanings concealed by and from authors.",Social Science,278,N/A,0,en

Structural Analysis of Discrete Data with Econometric Applications,"Charles F. Manski, Daniel McFadden",MIT Press (MA),1981,"The thirteen papers in ""Structural Analysis of Discrete Data"" are previously unpublished major research contributions solicited by the editors. They have been specifically prepared to fulfill the two-fold purpose of the volume, first to provide the econometrics student with an overview of the present extent of the subject and to delineate the boundaries of current research, both in terms of methodology and applications. ""Coordinated publication of important findings"" should, as the editors state, ""lower the cost of entry into the field and speed dissemination of recent research into the graduate econometrics classroom.""A second purpose of the volume is to communicate results largely reported in the econometrics literature to a wider community of researchers to whom they are directly relevant, including applied econometricians, statisticians in the area of discrete multivariate analysis, specialists in biometrics, psychometrics, and sociometrics, and analysts in various applied fields such as finance, marketing, and transportation.The papers are grouped into four sections: ""Statistical Analysis of Discrete Probability Models, "" with papers by the editors and by Steven Cosslett; ""Dynamic Discrete Probability Models, "" consisting of two contributions by James Heckman; ""Structural Discrete Probability Models Derived from Theories of Choice, "" with papers by Daniel McFadden, Gregory Fischer and Daniel Nagin, Steven Lerman and Charles Manski, and Moshe Ben-Akiva and Thawat Watanatada; and ""Simultaneous Systems Models with Discrete Endogenous Variables, "" with contributions by Lung-Fei Lee, Jerry Hausman and David Wise, Dale Poirier, Peter Schmidt, and Robert Avery.Among the applications treated are income maintenance experiments, physician behavior, consumer credit, and intra-urban location and transportation.",Business & Economics,512,N/A,0,en

Completing Our Streets,Barbara McCann,Island Press,2013-10-14,"Across the country, communities are embracing a new and safer way to build streets for everyone—even as they struggle to change decades of rules, practice, and politics that prioritize cars. They have discovered that changing the design of a single street is not enough: they must upend the way transportation agencies operate. Completing Our Streets begins with the story of how the complete streets movement united bicycle riders, transportation practitioners and agencies, public health leaders, older Americans, and smart growth advocates to dramatically re-frame the discussion of transportation safety. Next, it explores why the transportation field has been so resistant to change—and how the movement has broken through to create a new multi-modal approach. In Completing Our Streets, Barbara McCann, founder of the National Complete Streets Coalition, explains that the movement is not about street design. Instead, practitioners and activists have changed the way projects are built by focusing on three strategies: reframe the conversation; build a broad base of political support; and provide a clear path to a multi-modal process. McCann shares stories of practitioners in cities and towns from Charlotte, North Carolina to Colorado Springs, Colorado who have embraced these strategies to fundamentally change the way transportation projects are chosen, planned, and built. The complete streets movement is based around a simple idea: streets should be safe for people of all ages and abilities, whether they are walking, driving, bicycling, or taking the bus. Completing Our Streets gives practitioners and activists the strategies, tools, and inspiration needed to translate this idea into real and lasting change in their communities.",Transportation,0,N/A,0,en

Management and Use of Data for Transportation Performance Management,,N/A,2019,"TRB's National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) has released a pre-publication version of NCHRP Research Report 920: Management and Use of Data for Transportation Performance Management: Guide for Practitioners that provides practical guidance to transportation agencies to help improve their use of data for performance management. Recent federal legislation has established requirements for agencies to set performance targets and report on safety, pavement and bridge conditions, transit asset state of good repair, system performance, freight, and mobile source emissions. These requirements have resulted in increased visibility and attention to Transportation Performance Management (TPM) and increased awareness of the importance of data within that process. Transportation agencies are recognizing that the value of performance management goes far beyond meeting federal requirements; NCHRP Report 920 will assist agencies to make visible progress in meeting their objectives. The guidance is organized around six data life-cycle stages and includes a discussion of what is involved in implementing each step and some of the critical choices to be made; a synthesis of key points in the form of ""Dos and Don'ts"" checklists that can be used to assess agency capabilities and identify opportunities for improvement; and illustrative examples. While this guide draws on many examples related to the federally defined TPM areas (safety, pavement, bridge, and system performance), it does not provide official guidance for MAP-21/FAST Act target setting or reporting. It provides a framework for assessing current data management practices and a source of ideas for practice improvement. Its purpose is to promote practices that will enable agencies to go beyond meeting reporting requirements, to get valuable insights from data that can be used to boost agency results.",Management information systems,140,N/A,0,en

The report concludes that there are no fundamental technical barriers to the safe transport of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive and the radiological risks of transport are well understood and generally low. However, there are a number of challenges that must be addressed before large-quantity shipping programs can be implemented successfully. Among these are managing ""social"" risks.

The Transportation Experience,"William L. Garrison, David M. Levinson",N/A,2014-03,"The Transportation Experience explores the historical evolution of transportation modes and technologies. The book traces how systems are innovated, planned and adapted, deployed and expanded, and reach maturity, where they may either be maintained in a polished obsolesce often propped up by subsidies, be displaced by competitors, or be reorganized and renewed. An array of examples supports the idea that modern policies are built from past experiences. William Garrison and David Levinson assert that the planning (and control) of nonlinear, unstable processes is today's central transportation problem, and that this is universal and true of all modes. Modes are similar, in that they all have a triad structure of network, vehicles, and operations; but this framework counters conventional wisdom. Most think of each mode as having a unique history and status, and each is regarded as the private playground of experts and agencies holding unique knowledge, operating in isolated silos. However, this book argues that while modes have an appearance of uniqueness, the same patterns repeat: systems policies, structures, and behaviors are a generic design on varying modal cloth. In the end, the illusion of uniqueness proves to be myopic. While it is true that knowledge has accumulated from past experiences, the heavy hand of these experiences places boundaries on current knowledge; especially on the ways professionals define problems and think about processes. The Transportation Experience provides perspective for the collections of models and techniques that are the essence of transportation science, and also expands the boundaries of current knowledge of the field.",Political Science,634,5,1,en

America's Suburban Centers,Robert Cervero,Routledge,2018-05-23,"Originally published in 1989, America’s Suburban Centers looks at how America’s suburban workplaces are being increasingly designed for automobiles rather than people. The emergence of sprawling office complexes devoid of housing, shops and other facilities is giving rise to regional congestion problems because of the ever-greater dependence on automobiles. This book argues that the low-density, single-use, and non-integrated character of America’s suburban centers is a root cause of declining levels of mobility and worsening traffic congestion.",Science,244,N/A,0,en

High Cost of Free Parking,Donald Shoup,Routledge,2021-02-25,"Off-street parking requirements are devastating American cities. So says the author in this no-holds-barred treatise on the way parking should be. Free parking, the author argues, has contributed to auto dependence, rapid urban sprawl, extravagant energy use, and a host of other problems. Planners mandate free parking to alleviate congestion, but end up distorting transportation choices, debasing urban design, damaging the economy, and degrading the environment. Ubiquitous free parking helps explain why our cities sprawl on a scale fit more for cars than for people, and why American motor vehicles now consume one-eighth of the world's total oil production. But it doesn't have to be this way. The author proposes new ways for cities to regulate parking, namely, charge fair market prices for curb parking, use the resulting revenue to pay for services in the neighborhoods that generate it, and remove zoning requirements for off-street parking.",Architecture,752,N/A,0,en

Bill Bryson How Bad Are Bananas? was a groundbreaking book when first published in 2009, when most of us were hearing the phrase 'carbon footprint' for the first time. Mike Berners-Lee set out to inform us what was important (aviation, heating, swimming pools) and what made very little difference (bananas, naturally packaged, are good!). This new edition updates all the figures (from data centres to hosting a World Cup) and introduces many areas that have become a regular part of modern life - Twitter, the Cloud, Bitcoin, electric bikes and cars, even space tourism. Berners-Lee runs a considered eye over each area and gives us the figures to manage and reduce our own carbon footprint, as well as to lobby our companies, businesses and government.

Renewable Fuel Standard,"National Research Council, Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences, Board on Energy and Environmental Systems, Division on Earth and Life Studies, Board on Agriculture and Natural Resources, Committee on Economic and Environmental Impacts of Increasing Biofuels Production",National Academies Press,2012-01-29,"In the United States, we have come to depend on plentiful and inexpensive energy to support our economy and lifestyles. In recent years, many questions have been raised regarding the sustainability of our current pattern of high consumption of nonrenewable energy and its environmental consequences. Further, because the United States imports about 55 percent of the nation's consumption of crude oil, there are additional concerns about the security of supply. Hence, efforts are being made to find alternatives to our current pathway, including greater energy efficiency and use of energy sources that could lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions such as nuclear and renewable sources, including solar, wind, geothermal, and biofuels. The United States has a long history with biofuels and the nation is on a course charted to achieve a substantial increase in biofuels. Renewable Fuel Standard evaluates the economic and environmental consequences of increasing biofuels production as a result of Renewable Fuels Standard, as amended by EISA (RFS2). The report describes biofuels produced in 2010 and those projected to be produced and consumed by 2022, reviews model projections and other estimates of the relative impact on the prices of land, and discusses the potential environmental harm and benefits of biofuels production and the barriers to achieving the RFS2 consumption mandate.

Electronic Transport in Mesoscopic Systems,Supriyo Datta,Cambridge University Press,1997-05-15,"Advances in semiconductor technology have made possible the fabrication of structures whose dimensions are much smaller than the mean free path of an electron. This book gives a thorough account of the theory of electronic transport in such mesoscopic systems. After an initial chapter covering fundamental concepts, the transmission function formalism is presented, and used to describe three key topics in mesoscopic physics: the quantum Hall effect; localisation; and double-barrier tunnelling. Other sections include a discussion of optical analogies to mesoscopic phenomena, and the book concludes with a description of the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism and its relation to the transmission formalism. Complete with problems and solutions, the book will be of great interest to graduate students of mesoscopic physics and nanoelectronic device engineering, as well as to established researchers in these fields.",Science,398,N/A,0,en
Aerodynamic Design of Transport Aircraft,E. Obert,IOS Press,2009-04-16,"The origin of Aerodynamic Design of Transport Aircraft stems from the time when the author was appointed part-time professor in the Aerospace Faculty of Delft University of Technology. At the time his main activities were those of leading the departments of Aerodynamics, Performance and Preliminary Design at Fokker Aircraft Company. The groundwork for this book started in 1987 as a series of lecture notes consisting mainly of pictorial material with a minimum of English explanatory text. After the demise of Fokker in 1996 one feared that interest in aeronautical engineering would strongly diminish. As a result of this, the course was discontinued and the relationship between the author and the faculty came to an end. Two years later the situation was reappraised, and the interest in aeronautical engineering remained, so the course was reinstated with a former Fokker colleague Ronald Slingerland as lecturer. The lecture notes from these courses form the foundation of this publication.",Science,656,N/A,0,en

Transport And Diffusion Across Cell Membranes,Wilfred Stein,Elsevier,2012-12-02,"Transport and Diffusion across Cell Membranes is a comprehensive treatment of the transport and diffusion of molecules and ions across cell membranes. This book shows that the same kinetic equations (with appropriate modification) can describe all the specialized membrane transport systems: the pores, the carriers, and the two classes of pumps. The kinetic formalism is developed step by step and the features that make a system effective in carrying out its biological role are highlighted. This book is organized into six chapters and begins with an introduction to the structure and dynamics of cell membranes, followed by a discussion on how the membrane acts as a barrier to the transmembrane diffusion of molecules and ions. The following chapters focus on the role of the membrane's protein components in facilitating transmembrane diffusion of specific molecules and ions, measurements of diffusion through pores and the kinetics of diffusion, and the structure of such pores and their biological regulation. This book methodically introduces the reader to the carriers of cell membranes, the kinetics of facilitated diffusion, and cotransport systems. The primary active transport systems are considered, emphasizing the pumping of an ion (sodium, potassium, calcium, or proton) against its electrochemical gradient during the coupled progress of a chemical reaction while a conformational change of the pump enzyme takes place.

Transforming Urban Transport,"Diane E. Davis, Alan A. Altshuler",N/A,2019,"Transforming Urban Transport brings into focus the origins and implementation pathways of significant urban transport innovations that have recently been adopted in major, democratically governed world cities that are seeking to advance sustainability aims. It documents how proponents of new transportation initiatives confronted a range of administrative, environmental, fiscal, and political obstacles by using a range of leadership skills, technical resources, and negotiation capacities to move a good idea from the drawing board to implementation. The book's eight case studies focus on cities of great interest across the globe--Los Angeles, Mexico City, New York, Paris, San Francisco, Seoul, Stockholm, and Vienna--many of which are known for significant mayor leadership and efforts to rescale power from the nation to the city. The cases highlight innovations likely to be of interest to transport policy makers from all corners, such as strengthening public transportation services, vehicle and traffic management measures, repurposing roads and other urban spaces away from their initial function as vehicle travel corridors, and turning sidewalks and city streets into more pedestrian-friendly places for walking, cycling, and leisure. Aside from their transformative impacts in transportation terms, many of the policy innovations examined here have altered planning institutions, public-private sector relations, civil society commitments, and governance mandates in the course of implementation. In bringing these cases to the fore, Transforming Urban Transport advances understanding of the conditions under which policy interventions can expand institutional capacities and governance mandates, particularly linked to urban sustainability. As such, it is an essential contribution to larger debates about what it takes to make cities more environmentally sustainable and the types of strategies and tactics that best advance progress on these fronts in both the short- and the long-term.",Business & Economics,337,N/A,0,en

The contributions to this volume assess transportation interactions with employment and income, examine some of the policies that have been deployed to maximize the economic and social impacts of transportation provision at the local and regional levels and analyze how advances in transportation technologies have, and will, impact future development. Due in part to the general liberalization of markets, there have been major changes in the institutional environment in which transportation is supplied; these changes inevitably affect wider economic systems and development, although in turn these changes feed back upon transportation networks. The contributors to this work develop these and other themes, from a variety of perspectives, implementing a wide range of academic approaches into their analyses.

Population Loss: The Role of Transportation and Other Issues,,Academic Press,2018-10-31,"At heart, transportation policy and research are about people: connecting individuals and the places they live, ensuring sufficient and equitable access, and facilitating movement. Whether at the regional, city, or neighborhood scale, the loss of population presents unique challenges where transport is concerned. It is not only about preservation of existing access, but possibly even a question of increased need for connectivity and mobility. Demographic changes that accompany depopulation--aging for example-- also impact existing systems, preferences, and needs. - High quality and focused contributions on a complex and urgent topic - A clear focus on qualitative analyses and mixed method approaches",Law,218,N/A,0,en

In one of the greatest engineering feats of the time, Claudius Crozet led the completion of Virginia’s Blue Ridge Tunnel in 1858. More than a century and a half later, the tunnel stands as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark, but the stories and lives of those who built it are the true lasting triumph. Irish immigrants fleeing the Great Hunger poured into America resolved to find something to call their own. They would persevere through life in overcrowded shanties and years of blasting through rock to see the tunnel to completion. In this intriguing history, Mary E. Lyons follows three Irish families in their struggle to build Crozet’s famed tunnel—and their American dream. Includes photos and illustrations",Transportation,247,N/A,0,en

Quality Indicators for Transport Systems,,N/A,1998,"El principal objetivo del proyecto QUITS ha sido la mejora de la toma de decisión en el sector transportes, mediante la comparación de la calidad de las diferentes alternativas modales de los itinerarios interurbanos. Se basa en la idea de que la calidad de un sistema de transporte depende de variables internas (costes directos, tiempo de transporte) y externas (costes medioambientales, sociales y externos). QUITS cubre todos los modos de transporte tanto de viajeros como de mercancías. El libro consta de 5 capítulos. El primero describe los aspectos generales de la medida de la calidad, y define las principales variables a considerar y su valor en el proceso de cuantificación. El capítulo segundo estudia la metodología para la evaluación de la calidad interna de los sistemas de transporte interurbano. Se muestra la importancia del tiempo de transporte y se analizan los costes internos. El capítulo tercero se centra en la evaluación de la calidad externa: externalidades del transporte y su incidencia en la política de precios. Se identifican y analizan los costes externos (contaminación, emisiones, ruido, accidentes, impacto medioambiental...) mediante el uso de nuevos modelos, y se cuantifican los costes externos en términos monetarios. El capítulo cuarto se dedica a la presentación de los resultados obtenidos de la aplicación de la metodología QUITS a tres itinerarios interurbanos europeos: Milán-Frankfurt, Londres-Lille y Munich-Patras. Se miden todos los indicadores físicos y monetarios para cada uno de esos corredores y para todos los modos de transporte disponibles en ellos, de forma que se pueda valorar cada una de las alternativas. Se publican los resultados obtenidos en una serie de tablas y gráficos, mostrando que los costes externos del transporte de mercancías por carretera son nueve veces mayores que los del transporte ferroviario (11 veces para las mercancías) y aproximadamente el doble que los del transporte aéreo. Finalmente, el capítulo cinco ofrece las principales conclusiones y recomendaciones.",Transportation,114,N/A,0,en

Computational Optimal Transport,"Gabriel Peyre, Marco Cuturi",Foundations and Trends(r) in M,2019-02-12,"The goal of Optimal Transport (OT) is to define geometric tools that are useful to compare probability distributions. Their use dates back to 1781. Recent years have witnessed a new revolution in the spread of OT, thanks to the emergence of approximate solvers that can scale to sizes and dimensions that are relevant to data sciences. Thanks to this newfound scalability, OT is being increasingly used to unlock various problems in imaging sciences (such as color or texture processing), computer vision and graphics (for shape manipulation) or machine learning (for regression, classification and density fitting). This monograph reviews OT with a bias toward numerical methods and their applications in data sciences, and sheds lights on the theoretical properties of OT that make it particularly useful for some of these applications. Computational Optimal Transport presents an overview of the main theoretical insights that support the practical effectiveness of OT before explaining how to turn these insights into fast computational schemes. Written for readers at all levels, the authors provide descriptions of foundational theory at two-levels. Generally accessible to all readers, more advanced readers can read the specially identified more general mathematical expositions of optimal transport tailored for discrete measures. Furthermore, several chapters deal with the interplay between continuous and discrete measures, and are thus targeting a more mathematically-inclined audience. This monograph will be a valuable reference for researchers and students wishing to get a thorough understanding of Computational Optimal Transport, a mathematical gem at the interface of probability, analysis and optimization.",Computers,272,N/A,0,en

Concepts of Transportation Economics,"Barry E. Prentice, Darren Prokop",World Scientific Publishing Company Incorporated,2015-11-16,"Transportation is the world's largest invisible industry. Modern society is completely dependent on transportation to sustain its way of life, and it is all around us constantly. Yet the economics of transportation is a mystery to most people. Why do air fares rise and fall? Why do urban transit systems struggle to survive and require such large public subsidies? Why does freight transport cost more to move in one direction than an equal distance in another? Why is the government so heavily involved in transportation? Concepts of Transportation Economics provides explanations to these queries and many more, as well-renowned experts in the field, Barry E Prentice and Darren Prokop interpret the unique dynamics underlying transportation through the lens of applied economics, and demonstrate that the operations of transportation are completely logical and obvious once the concepts that underlie business decisions and consumer reactions are explained.",Business & Economics,275,N/A,0,en

Adverse Effects of Vaccines,"Institute of Medicine, Board on Population Health and Public Health Practice, Committee to Review Adverse Effects of Vaccines",National Academies Press,2012-04-26,"In 1900, for every 1,000 babies born in the United States, 100 would die before their first birthday, often due to infectious diseases. Today, vaccines exist for many viral and bacterial diseases. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, passed in 1986, was intended to bolster vaccine research and development through the federal coordination of vaccine initiatives and to provide relief to vaccine manufacturers facing financial burdens. The legislation also intended to address concerns about the safety of vaccines by instituting a compensation program, setting up a passive surveillance system for vaccine adverse events, and by providing information to consumers. A key component of the legislation required the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to collaborate with the Institute of Medicine to assess concerns about the safety of vaccines and potential adverse events, especially in children. Adverse Effects of Vaccines reviews the epidemiological, clinical, and biological evidence regarding adverse health events associated with specific vaccines covered by the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), including the varicella zoster vaccine, influenza vaccines, the hepatitis B vaccine, and the human papillomavirus vaccine, among others. For each possible adverse event, the report reviews peer-reviewed primary studies, summarizes their findings, and evaluates the epidemiological, clinical, and biological evidence. It finds that while no vaccine is 100 percent safe, very few adverse events are shown to be caused by vaccines. In addition, the evidence shows that vaccines do not cause several conditions. For example, the MMR vaccine is not associated with autism or childhood diabetes. Also, the DTaP vaccine is not associated with diabetes and the influenza vaccine given as a shot does not exacerbate asthma. Adverse Effects of Vaccines will be of special interest to the National Vaccine Program Office, the VICP, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, vaccine safety researchers and manufacturers, parents, caregivers, and health professionals in the private and public sectors.",Medical,894,N/A,0,en

Economic Impacts of Intelligent Transportation Systems,"E Bekiaris, Y J Nakanishi",Elsevier,2004-07-24,"There are unique complexities associated with the economic valuation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and telematics. Traditional methods of quantitative analysis may not be appropriate in accurately and reliably assessing the economic impacts of these technologies. Although advanced transportation and related technologies are being planned and deployed at an increasingly rapid pace, many of the technologies are still relatively new, and their use may not be widespread. Much of the initial information and statistics gathered have been anecdotal and have focused more on benefits rather than costs. Therefore, difficulties arise due to the lack of historical data and 'lessons learned' from which to draw upon. In addition, compared with traditional transportation infrastructure, ITS technologies have different life cycles, cost structures, and a number of interrelated elements. This book addresses these concerns and proposes new economic assessment techniques as well as modifications to existing ones. Included are case studies from a multitude of North American, European, and Asian nations and major metropolitan areas covering a wide range of ITS technologies including freeway management, electronic toll collection, advanced driver assistance systems, and traveller information systems.",Transportation,664,N/A,0,en

Handbook of Transportation Policy and Administration,Jeremy Plant,CRC Press,2007-02-22,"In the past few decades, the field of transportation has changed dramatically. Deregulation and greater reliance on markets and the private sector has helped to reconfigure the transport industries, while the rise of intermodal goods and global commerce has produced efficiencies of operation and a greater interdependence among transport modes. In addition, security issues have moved to the forefront as officials struggle with the challenge of protecting the vast transportation system while maintaining its operational efficiencies and effectiveness. Taking a multidisciplinary approach, the Handbook of Transportation Policy and Administration addresses the changes facing the field of transportation. Organized into five sections, it describes and analyzes major modes of transportation and components of the contemporary transportation system. Later chapters consider policy and administration and focus on managing transportation systems and assets. The final section covers security and protection of transportation systems. The handbook explores continuing development in the US and other nations, with an emphasis on the challenges created by technological change, globalization of the world economy, and the threat of terrorism. It examines the current state of major modes of transportation (air, rail, highways, waterways, ports, urban mass transit) and presents public policies and management approaches to make transportation systems efficient, innovative, and responsive. Drawing from scholars in a wide range of disciplines, including public policy, public administration, geography, economics, business logistics, engineering, and management, the Handbook of Transportation Policy and Administration serves as a comprehensive, single-volume reference for scholars, students, public officials, business and civic leaders, and transportation practitioners.",Political Science,656,N/A,0,en

A focus is set on Electronic Transportation Marketplaces (ETMs) which offer main functionalities for the procurement of transportation services on the spot and contract market as well as additional functionalities to improve further processes (e.g., time-slot management). Even though such marketplaces are important from an economic and ecological perspective, previous research provides only little knowledge about the status quo of their use, the determinants of marketplace use and the link between this use and business value. To close these research gaps, Philipp Sylla builds a comprehensive conceptual research framework and conducts an empirical analysis based on a web survey of shippers in Germany. The empirical results build the foundation for the development of an evaluation concept that provides practical support for shippers in the assessment of marketplace use and the evaluation of potential business value impacts.",Business & Economics,331,N/A,0,en

The Semantic Web: Research and Applications,"Asuncion Gómez-Pérez, Jerome Euzenat",Springer,2005-05-18,"This volume contains the papers presented at the 2nd European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC 2005) held in Heraklion, Crete, Greece, from 29th May to 1st June, 2005. The vision of the Semantic Web is to enhance today’s Web via the exploi- tion of machine-processable metadata. The explicit representation of the sem- tics of data, accompanied with domain theories (ontologies), will enable a web that provides a qualitatively new level of service. It will weave together an - crediblylargenetworkofhumanknowledgeandwillcomplementitwithmachine processability. Various automated services will help the user to achieve goals by accessing and providing information in a machine-understandable form. This process may ultimately create extremely knowledgeable systems with various specialized reasoning services systems. Many technologies and methodologies are being developed within arti?cial intelligence, human language technology, machine learning, databases, software engineering and information systems that can contribute to the realization of this vision. The 2nd Annual European Semantic Web Conference presented the latest results in research and applications of Semantic Web technologies. Following the success of the ?rst edition, ESWC showed a signi?cant increase in participation. With148submissions,thenumberofpapersdoubledthatofthepreviousedition. Each submission was evaluated by at least three reviewers. The selection process resulted in the acceptance of 48 papers for publication and presentation at the conference (an acceptance rate of 32%).

Optimal Transport for Applied Mathematicians,Filippo Santambrogio,Birkhäuser,2015-10-17,"This monograph presents a rigorous mathematical introduction to optimal transport as a variational problem, its use in modeling various phenomena, and its connections with partial differential equations. Its main goal is to provide the reader with the techniques necessary to understand the current research in optimal transport and the tools which are most useful for its applications. Full proofs are used to illustrate mathematical concepts and each chapter includes a section that discusses applications of optimal transport to various areas, such as economics, finance, potential games, image processing and fluid dynamics. Several topics are covered that have never been previously in books on this subject, such as the Knothe transport, the properties of functionals on measures, the Dacorogna-Moser flow, the formulation through minimal flows with prescribed divergence formulation, the case of the supremal cost, and the most classical numerical methods. Graduate students and researchers in both pure and applied mathematics interested in the problems and applications of optimal transport will find this to be an invaluable resource.",Mathematics,376,N/A,0,en

Making Starships and Stargates,James F. Woodward,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-15,"To create the exotic materials and technologies needed to make stargates and warp drives is the holy grail of advanced propulsion. A less ambitious, but nonetheless revolutionary, goal is finding a way to accelerate a spaceship without having to lug along a gargantuan reservoir of fuel that you blow out a tailpipe. Tethers and solar sails are conventional realizations of the basic idea. There may now be a way to achieve these lofty objectives. “Making Starships and Stargates” will have three parts. The first will deal with information about the theories of relativity needed to understand the predictions of the effects that make possible the “propulsion” techniques, and an explanation of those techniques. The second will deal with experimental investigations into the feasibility of the predicted effects; that is, do the effects exist and can they be applied to propulsion? The third part of the book – the most speculative – will examine the question: what physics is needed if we are to make wormholes and warp drives? Is such physics plausible? And how might we go about actually building such devices? This book pulls all of that material together from various sources, updates and revises it, and presents it in a coherent form so that those interested will be able to find everything of relevance all in one place.",Technology & Engineering,297,N/A,0,en

Transportation for the Future,"David F. Batten, Roland Thord",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"During the seventies and eighties, the industries associated with the transportation of goods and people have been exposed to some profound changes. The quickening pace of technological change - with its growing emphasis on telecommunications, knowledge-handling capacity, and air transportation - is increasing the discrete character of the world economy. Thus the network structure of global development patterns is becoming more important, with metropolitan centres as key nodes and rapid transportation routes as key links. In this evolutionary situation, changes in the preferred mix of transport modes are inevitable. The faster and more direct modes will be favoured, individually and in combination, and there will be an increasing interest in transportation policies and the provision of infrastructure. This volume contains a collection of innovative papers presented at the First International Conference on Transportation for the Future, held in Södertälje, Sweden in July 1988. Twenty industry leaders and prominent scientists from Europe, USA and Japan present their views about the ongoing transformation of production and distribution systems among firms striving for Just-In-Time methods, economies of scope, and a fully integrated approach to their economic activities. The future of passenger travel and infrastructure are also discussed. The resulting book presents a surprisingly consistent picture of how the transportation industries of the industrialized nations may be expected to grow and change in a long-term perspective.",Science,267,N/A,0,en

The Bureau of Transportation Statistics,"National Research Council, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Commission on Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Panel on Statistical Programs and Practices of the Bureau of Transportation Statistics",National Academies Press,1997-09-20,"How can the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), the nation's newest federal statistical agency, contribute to the work of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)? What is the appropriate role for such an agency as a part of a major department? BTS was authorized in 1991 by the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) in recognition of the need for more and better data for transportation officials at local, state, and federal levels. While the USDOT has many long-standing data collection programs for particular transportation modes (highways, rail, air, etc.), it has never had a statistical agency with a mandate to improve the quality and relevance of transportation data for important system-wide, cross-modal analyses of the nation's transportation system. This book examines how BTS can provide statistical leadership for USDOT, define and maintain quality standards for transportation data, and improve data documentation. It considers BTS's role in developing national transportation indicators, coordinating data collection throughout USDOT, filling gaps, identifying user needs, and developing analysis programs for transportation data. Anyone concerned with having high-quality, relevant transportation indicators and other data available for policy planning, evaluation, and research will be interested in this book, as will students of effective government.",Transportation,161,N/A,0,en

The Longevity Economy,Joseph F.

Over the past two decades, Joseph F. Coughlin has been busting myths about aging with groundbreaking multidisciplinary research into what older people actually want -- not what conventional wisdom suggests they need. In The Longevity Economy, Coughlin provides the framing and insight business leaders need to serve the growing older market: a vast, diverse group of consumers representing every possible level of health and wealth, worth about $8 trillion in the United States alone and climbing. Coughlin provides deep insight into a population that consistently defies expectations: people who, through their continued personal and professional ambition, desire for experience, and quest for self-actualization, are building a striking, unheralded vision of longer life that very few in business fully understand. His focus on women -- they outnumber men, control household spending and finances, and are leading the charge toward tomorrow's creative new narrative of later life -- is especially illuminating. Coughlin pinpoints the gap between myth and reality and then shows businesses how to bridge it. As the demographics of global aging transform and accelerate, it is now critical to build a new understanding of the shifting physiological, cognitive, social, family, and psychological realities of the longevity economy.",Business & Economics,330,N/A,0,en

Several different concepts have been introduced, particularly in regard to wood-moisture relation ships. The role of water potential in the equilibria between wood and its humid and moist environments is considered. Two theories are introduced to explain the nonisothermal transport of bound water in the steady and unsteady states. As in the former text, the wood-. structure relationship is emphasized . .

The Accelerating Transport Innovation Revolution,"George Giannopoulos, John F. Munro",Elsevier,2019-04-17,"The Accelerating Transport Innovation Revolution: A Global, Case Study-based Assessment of Current Experience, Cross-sectorial Effects and Socioeconomic Transformations, offers a comprehensive view of current state-of-the-art and practices around the world to create innovation on a revolutionary scale and connect research to commercial exploitation of its results. It offers a fascinating new model of the innovation process based on theories of biological ecosystems, general systems theory and basins of attraction (represented through space-time graphs well known in mathematics). Furthermore, it considers - through a number of dedicated chapters - key issues and elements of innovation ecosystems, such as: Causal Factors and system constraints affecting the development and sustainability of innovation ecosystems (Chapter 4); Review of innovation organization and governance in key countries and regions (Chapter 5); the role of technological ""Spillovers"" (Chapter 6); Collection and use of data for innovation monitoring and benchmarking (Chapter 7); Intellectual Property protection between competing ecosystems (Chapter 8); Economics of innovation (Chapter 9); Public and private sector involvement in Transport innovation creation (Chapter 10); the role of the individual entrepreneur - innovator in energizing change (Chapter 11). Finally, in Chapter 12, there is a thorough summary of key findings. This book uses a paradigmatic approach to augment the innovation ecosystem model of innovation that integrates beliefs and learning into the innovation ecosystems model. It therefore includes ten case studies from the U.S., Europe and Asia, detailing how innovation is created across continents and different ecosystems and what are the critical lessons to be learned. It does this, effectively, at five different levels of analysis i.e. the individual innovator / entrepreneur level, the organization level (government agency or company), the regional ecosystem level, the nation-state level and the global - systemic or international level. Each level of analysis, reveals unique features of the innovation landscape and the ten case studies allow the reader to assess when and where specific ""enablers"" are facilitating innovation especially on a revolutionary scale. The need for the book came from the realization that despite the billions of dollars spent on various research programs over the past 20 years (especially in the public sector), there have been few clear and tangible efforts directed at exploring how innovation production increasingly occurs and the critical factors necessary to sustain large-scale, revolutionary change as the future unfolds. Thus, a primary theme of the book is that understanding how research results translate into market innovation and implementation, especially understanding the nature of revolutionary innovation, is as important as the creation of innovations themselves. While the focus of the book is on Transportation, the concepts and recommendations presented apply to other fields too.",Social Science,386,N/A,0,en

Critical Infrastructures: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment in Transportation of Dangerous Goods,"Bogdan I. Vamanu, Adrian V. Gheorghe, Polinpapilinho F. Katina",Springer,2016-04-02,"This book addresses a key issue in today’s society: the safer transport of dangerous goods, taking into account people, the environment and economics. In particular, it offers a potential approach to identifying the issues, developing the models, providing the methods and recommending the tools to address the risks and vulnerabilities involved. We believe this can only be achieved by assessing those risks in a comprehensive, quantifiable and integrated manner. Examining both rail and road transportation, the book is divided into three sections, covering: the mature and accepted (by both academia and practitioners) methodology of risk assessment; the vulnerability assessment – a novel approach proposed as a vital complement to risk; guidance and support to build the tools that make methods and equations to yield: the Decision Support Systems. Throughout the book, the authors do not endeavor to provide THE solution. Instead, the book offers insightful food for thought for students, researchers, practitioners and policymakers alike.",Science,224,N/A,0,en

Held in Strasbourg, France, for three lively days at the end of May 2000, the Symposium brought together representatives of the developers, providers and operators of space transportation systems, of regulatory bodies, and of users of the space transportation infrastructure in many fields, as well as experts in policy and market analysis. From the papers published here, it is clear that today's answer to the question tends more towards evolution than to revolution. The space launch industry is still not a fully mature one, and is still reliant on at least partial funding by governments. Better cooperation is essential between governments, launch providers, satellite builders and satellite operators in order to reduce the problems which the space transportation market faces today.",Technology & Engineering,315,N/A,0,en

This book aims at assisting the analyst to provide decision makers with a range of solutions by illustrating how service policies regarding quality of service, fares, investment levels, and environmental impacts affect and are affected by each other. This book, therefore, concentrates on the process of planning and design. It addresses the major elements of urban transportation planning, design, and impact estimation, and offers practice in undertaking typical projects. It focuses on the linkages and interaction with public policy regarding user service levels, and the resulting design and impacts. The process is illustrated by (1) outlining the individual transportation analysis and design techniques and their linkages, (2) describing the planning and design process, from population changes affect ing demand and mobility needs to estimation of air pollution and energy use impacts that are instrumental in shaping public policy and strategic planning, (3) presenting examples of transportation design projects showing how service policy may affect the physical and operational design of multimodal, urban trans portation systems, (4) enabling the readers to obtain practice in basic, applied transportation analysis, design, and impact estimation by defining the key service policy variables of projects for solution, and (5) familiarizing the reader with",Technology & Engineering,205,N/A,0,en

Aerodynamics Principles for Air Transport Pilots,Rose G Davies,CRC Press,2020-04-13,"Equipping readers with the ability to analyze the aerodynamic forces on an aircraft, the book provides comprehensive knowledge of the characteristics of subsonic and supersonic airflow. This book begins with the fundamental physics principles of aerodynamics, then introduces the Continuity Equation, Energy Equations, and Bernoulli’s Equation, which form the basic aerodynamic principles for subsonic airflow. It provides a thorough understanding of the forces acting on an aircraft across a range of speeds and their effects on the aircraft's performance, including a discussion on the difference in aerofoil and aircraft shapes. Aircraft stability issues are analyzed, along with the development of a boundary layer over an aerofoil, the changes of air speed and air pressure, and boundary layer separation. Readers will gain a clear understanding of the nature of airflow over aircraft during subsonic, transonic, and supersonic flight. The book emphasizes the connection between operating actions in flight and aerodynamic requirements. The content will be of interest to senior undergraduates studying to obtain their Airline Transport Pilot License (ATPL)/Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) certificate, general aviation and air transport pilots, and aircraft maintenance engineers.",Technology & Engineering,267,N/A,0,en

Flow and Transport in Porous Formations,Gedeon Dagan,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"In the mid-seventies, a new area of research has emerged in subsurface hydrology, namely sto chastic modeling of flow and transport. This development has been motivated by the recognition of the ubiquitous presence of heterogeneities in natural formations and of their effect upon transport and flow, on the one hand, and by the vast expansion of computational capability provided by elec tronic machines, on the other. Apart from this, one of the areas in which spatial variability of for mation properties plays a cardinal role is of contaminant transport, a subject of growing interest and concern. I have been quite fortunate to be engaged in research in this area from its inception and to wit ness the rapid growth of the community and of the literature on spatial variability and its impact upon subsurface hydrology. In view of this increasing interest, I decided a few years ago that it would be useful to present the subject in a systematic and comprehensive manner in order to help those who wish to engage themselves in research or application of this new field. I viewed as my primary task to analyze the large scale heterogeneity of aquifers and its effect, presuming that the reader already possesses a background in traditional hydrology. This is achieved in Parts 3, 4 and 5 of the text which incorporate the pertinent material.",Science,472,N/A,0,en

Transport Prices and Costs in Africa,"Supee Teravaninthorn, Gaël Raballand",World Bank Publications,2009,"Transport prices for most African landlocked countries range from 15 to 20 percent of import costs. This is approximately two to three times more than in most developed countries. It is well known that weak infrastructure can account for low trade performance. Thus, it becomes necessary to understand what types of regional transport services operate in landlocked African nations and it is critical to identify the regulation disparities and provision anomalies that hurt infrastructure efficiency, even when the physical infrastructure, such as a road transport corridor, exists. Transport Prices and Costs in Africa analyzes the various reasons for poor transport performance seen widely throughout Africa and provides a compelling case for a number of national and regional reforms that are vital to the effort to address the underlying causes of high transport prices and costs and service unpredictability seen in Africa. The book will greatly help supervisory authorities throughout the region develop and implement a comprehensive transport policy that will facilitate long-term growth.",Transportation,166,N/A,0,en

"Wood, Concrete, Stone, and Steel",Denis Gardner,U of Minnesota Press,2008,"Like never before we are aware of the crucial place of bridges in our lives. The spans that warranted little notice are now at the forefront of public and political debate and we are reminded of the rich history-and the uncertain future-of bridging in Minnesota. Historian Denis P. Gardner documents and celebrates a wide range of the state’s rural and urban spans, telling the remarkable stories of their construction and impact on Minnesota life and culture. From Pratt trusses to bowstring arches, Wood, Concrete, Stone, and Steel describes nearly every bridge type found in Minnesota, including railroad spans, and features more than 225 illustrations of historical and extant bridges. Gardner details the development of engineering and construction innovations (complete with a guide to trusses) and traces the fascinating politics and personalities behind the task of creating and maintaining safe, and often beautiful, crossings. Through arresting photographs and lively narrative, Gardner makes a compelling argument for the value of preserving our bridges and the cultural heritage they carry and brings to life their importance in Minnesota’s past, present, and future. Denis P. Gardner is an award-winning historian who has documented properties for the National Register of Historic Places and the Historic American Engineering Record.

Advancing the Science of Climate Change,"National Research Council, Division on Earth and Life Studies, Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate, America's Climate Choices: Panel on Advancing the Science of Climate Change",National Academies Press,2011-01-10,"Climate change is occurring, is caused largely by human activities, and poses significant risks for-and in many cases is already affecting-a broad range of human and natural systems. The compelling case for these conclusions is provided in Advancing the Science of Climate Change, part of a congressionally requested suite of studies known as America's Climate Choices. While noting that there is always more to learn and that the scientific process is never closed, the book shows that hypotheses about climate change are supported by multiple lines of evidence and have stood firm in the face of serious debate and careful evaluation of alternative explanations. As decision makers respond to these risks, the nation's scientific enterprise can contribute through research that improves understanding of the causes and consequences of climate change and also is useful to decision makers at the local, regional, national, and international levels. The book identifies decisions being made in 12 sectors, ranging from agriculture to transportation, to identify decisions being made in response to climate change. Advancing the Science of Climate Change calls for a single federal entity or program to coordinate a national, multidisciplinary research effort aimed at improving both understanding and responses to climate change. Seven cross-cutting research themes are identified to support this scientific enterprise. In addition, leaders of federal climate research should redouble efforts to deploy a comprehensive climate observing system, improve climate models and other analytical tools, invest in human capital, and improve linkages between research and decisions by forming partnerships with action-oriented programs.",Science,526,N/A,0,en

Transportation Systems Planning,Konstadinos G. Goulias,CRC Press,2002-12-26,"Transportation engineering and transportation planning are two sides of the same coin aiming at the design of an efficient infrastructure and service to meet the growing needs for accessibility and mobility. Many well-designed transport systems that meet these needs are based on a solid understanding of human behavior. Since transportation systems are the backbone connecting the vital parts of a city, in-depth understanding of human nature is essential to the planning, design, and operational analysis of transportation systems. With contributions by transportation experts from around the world, Transportation Systems Planning: Methods and Applications compiles engineering data and methods for solving problems in the planning, design, construction, and operation of various transportation modes into one source. It is the first methodological transportation planning reference that illustrates analytical simulation methods that depict human behavior in a realistic way, and many of its chapters emphasize newly developed and previously unpublished simulation methods. The handbook demonstrates how urban and regional planning, geography, demography, economics, sociology, ecology, psychology, business, operations management, and engineering come together to help us plan for better futures that are human-centered. The text reviews projects from an initial problem statement to final policy action and associated decision-making and examines policies at all levels of government, from the city to the national levels. Unlike many other handbooks which are encyclopedic reviews, Transportation Systems Planning extends far beyond modeling in engineering and economics to present a truly transdisciplinary approach to transportation systems planning.",Technology & Engineering,456,N/A,0,en

Transport Across Single Biological Membranes,D.C. Tosteson,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This second Volume in the series on Membrane Transport in Biology contains a group of essays on transport across single biological membranes separating the inside and outside of cells or organelles. We have not attempted to include material on all types of plasma and intracellular membranes, but rather have emphasized structures which have been studied relatively thoroughly. Four chapters describe transport of different types of molecules and ions across the plasma membranes of mammalian red cells. Two essays concern the excitable membranes of nerve and muscle cells while the remaining four chapters treat transport across several types of intracellular membranes. Water makes up more than two-thirds of the mass of most living cells. The transport of water between the inside and outside of cells and organelles is important for the function of these structures. As a result of investigations in many laboratories over the past four decades, our picture of the water permea bility of the red cell membranes is rather detailed when compared to the water permeability of other biological membranes. In Chapter 1, R. I. Macey describes this picture and also considers the permeability of red cell membranes to non electrolytes, including metabolic substrates such as sugars, amino acids, purines and nucleosides.",Medical,459,N/A,0,en

Mechanics and Energetics of Biological Transport,E. Heinz,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This book deals with energetics of transport processes, largely expressed in terms of the thermodynamics of irreversible pro cesses. Since at the present time too little is known about the molecular mechanism of transport, the present treatment is based largely on hypothetical models. Care has been taken, however, to define the crucial features of these models as generally as pos sible, so that the equations do not depend too much on hypotheti cal details. Accordingly, most equations, though developed on the basis of a mobile carrier (ferryboat) model, should apply equally to a conformational model, with an appropriate reinterpretation of the symbols. To better elucidate the essentials, the models are greatly simplified by special assumptions. Maximally, only two flows are assumed to be present in each model at one time: e. g. , two solute flows, the flow of solvent and of one solute, the flow of solvent and of heat. The simplifying assumptions may often be unreal. Hence the equations should not be applied un critically to actual mechanisms. They may at best serve as a ba sis on which the more appropriate equations may be developed. The book is not designed to give a complete kinetic analysis of the transport processes described. The kinetic equations are kept to the minimum required to describe the model concerned and to relate it to the corresponding thermodynamic equations. The in tention is to stress the close relationship between bioosmotic (transport) and biochemical processes in metabolism.",Science,173,N/A,0,en

Introduction to Transportation Engineering,James H. Banks,"McGraw-Hill Science, Engineering & Mathematics",2002,"The second edition of Introduction to Transportation Engineering has been developed to provide a concise yet thorough introduction to intermodal transportation. One of its underlying concepts is that the basic techniques and principles of transportation engineering are of wide application. For practical reasons, the major emphasis is often on highways, but care is taken to show how basic concepts and techniques apply to different modes. The book strives to provide a background in transportation planning, analysis, and design while emphasizing the social, economic, and political context of transportation engineering. It places major emphasis on important practical topics such as geometric design, Highway Capacity Manual methods, and traffic signal timing, and also emphasizes important theoretical topics such as the fundamental techniques of traffic analysis and the economic theory underlying transportation demand modeling. The text has been revised and updated to reflect the 2000 revision of the Highway Capacity Manual.The numbers of flow charts, diagrams, and photos have been increased from the previous edition. The text also offers new open-ended design exercises pertaining to common design problems in transportation such as horizontal and vertical alignment of roads, railways, or runways; traffic design for highways; planning and design of traffic control; and design of bus routes and schedules. These exercises respond to ABET-2000 accreditation requirements, particularly to civil engineering program criteria that require ""design experiences integrated throughout the professional component of the curriculum.""",Technology & Engineering,520,N/A,0,en

In an increasingly global economy, then, logistics has become a very important matter in the success or failure of an organization. It is an integral part of supply chain management that involves not just operations management considerations, but production engineering and regional science issues as well. As Director of the prestigious Waterloo Management of Integrated Manufacturing Systems Research Group (WATMIMS), which specializes in logistics and manufacturing, Jim Bookbinder is uniquely qualified to edit a handbook on global logistics. He has aligned a set of prominent contributors for this volume. The chapters in the Handbook are organized into discrete sections that examine modes; logistics in particular countries; operations within a free-trade zone; innovative features impacting international logistics; case studies of specific companies; and a look toward the future. Contributors are from the Americas, Europe, and Asia, and they push the state of the art in areas such as trade vs. security; border issues; cabotage within NAFTA; Green logistics corridors within the EU; inland ports; direct-to-store considerations; and all the questions that need to be confronted in any given region. This will certainly appeal to researchers and practitioners alike, and could serve as required or supplementary reading in graduate-level logistics courses as well.",Business & Economics,554,N/A,0,en

J.P. Morgan and the Transportation Kings,Steven H. Gittelman,University Press of America,2012-03-23,"The concept was simple, to link American railroads and global dominance of the seas with a railroad line through China and Russia, enter the back door of Europe, and create new royalty: the Transportation Kings. Vanderbilt, Hill, Morgan, and Harriman all pursued the grand dream. They were America’s industrial princes, poised for their greatest accomplishments, only to find that they had not considered the gauntlet awaiting them in the courts of kings and Kaisers, parliaments and congress. They awoke John Bull and helped precipitate revolution in China. They brought about the building of Lusitania and, in reaction, they owned and built the Titanic. We all know how the disaster story ends; this is how the story came about.",Transportation,385,N/A,0,en

Electrokinetic and Colloid Transport Phenomena,"Jacob H. Masliyah, Subir Bhattacharjee",John Wiley & Sons,2006-05-26,"A new, definitive perspective of electrokinetic and colloid transport processes Responding to renewed interest in the subject of electrokinetics, Electrokinetic and Colloid Transport Phenomena is a timely overview of the latest research and applications in this field for both the beginner and the professional. An outgrowth of an earlier text (by coauthor Jacob Masliyah), this self-contained reference provides an up-to-date summary of the literature on electrokinetic and colloid transport phenomena as well as direct pedagogical insight into the development of the subject over the past several decades. A distinct departure from standard colloid science monographs, Electrokinetic and Colloid Transport Phenomena presents the most salient features of the theory in a simple and direct manner, allowing the book to serve as a stepping-stone for further learning and study. In addition, the book uniquely discusses numerical simulation of electrokinetic problems and demonstrates the use of commercial finite element software for solving these multiphysics problems. Among the topics covered are: * Mathematical preliminaries * Colloidal systems * Electrostatics and application of electrostatics * Electric double layer * Electroosmosis and streaming potential * Electrophoresis and sedimentation potential * London-Van der Waals forces and the DLVO theory * Coagulation and colloid deposition * Numerical simulation of electrokinetic phenomena * Applications of electrokinetic phenomena Because this thorough reference does not require advanced mathematical knowledge, it enables a graduate or a senior undergraduate student approaching the subject for the first time to easily interpret the theories. On the other hand, the application of relevant mathematical principles and the worked examples are extremely useful to established researchers and professionals involved in a wide range of areas, including electroosmosis, streaming potential, electrophoretic separations, industrial practices involving colloids and complex fluids, environmental remediation, suspensions, and microfluidic systems.",Science,733,N/A,0,en

Transportation and the American People,H. Roger Grant,Indiana University Press,2019-10-01,"This “outstanding contribution to transportation history” chronicles the evolution of American mobility from stagecoaches to buses and airplanes (Choice). Transportation is the unsung hero of American history. Stagecoaches, waterways, canals, railways, busses, and airplanes revolutionized much more than just the way people got around; they transformed the economic, political, and social aspects of everyday life. In Transportation and the American People, renowned historian H. Roger Grant tells the story of American transportation from its slow, uncomfortable, and often dangerous beginnings to the speed and comfort of travel today. Early advances like stagecoaches and canals allowed traders, businesses, and industries to expand across the nation, setting the stage for modern developments like transcontinental railways and busses that would forever reshape the continent. Grant provides a compelling and thoroughly researched narrative of the social history of travel, shining a light on the role transportation played in shaping the country as well as the people who helped build it.",History,314,N/A,0,en

Transportation Policy and Economic Regulation,"John Bitzan, James H Peoples",Academic Press,2018-04-14,"Transportation Policy and Economic Regulation: Essays in Honor of Theodore Keeler addresses a number of today's important transportation policy issues, exploring a variety of transportation modes, and examining the policy implications of a number of alternatives. Theodore Keeler had a distinguished career in transportation economics, helping to shape regulatory policies concerning the transportation industries and assessing the appropriateness of various policies. A distinguishing feature of his work is that it always had policy implications. As a tribute to Theodore Keeler, this book examines transportation policy issues across a variety of transportation industries, including aviation, railroads, highways, motor carrier transport, automobiles, urban transit, and ocean shipping. The book evaluates the economic impact and effectiveness of various policies, employing empirical analyses and new estimation techniques, such as Bayesian analysis. The book is designed for transportation professionals and researchers, as well as transportation economics students, providing an in-depth analysis of some of today's important transportation policy issues. Policy changes established in the last 35-40 years have introduced profound changes in the business environment of the transportation industry. Past policy changes promoted the free market's role in setting prices and determining service availability. While 21st century policy has focused on a variety of other issues, such as safety, road and air congestion, productivity growth, labor relations and exhaust emission, many still promote the role of competition. In addition to examining various transportation policy issues in the U.S., the book explores some approaches to dealing with transportation issues in different parts of the world. Contemporary transportation policy debates have broadened from their initial focus of primarily examining the merits of reforming economic regulations at national levels, to now examining a variety of issues such as alternative methods of social regulation (such as safety regulation and emission controls), new approaches to changing economic regulations, the potential for reforming international regulations, and the appropriate role for government in transportation. - Examines transportation policy developments across a variety of modes, including some international analysis - Shows how new policy changes, such as changes in regulation, affect overall transportation system performance - Features chapters that use innovative methodologies, such as Bayesian techniques, qualitative analysis, and an attribute-incorporated Malmquist productivity index - Examines the ways that policy impacts depend on a variety of factors, and shows how economic tools can be used to gain greater insights into the likely impacts of policy and the desirability of various policies - Analyzes transport prices, quality of service, safety, the use of information technology and operating issues, highlighting how transportation enhances quality of life",Social Science,380,N/A,0,en

"Amtrak, America's Railroad","Geoffrey H. Doughty, Jeffrey T. Darbee, Eugene E. Harmon",Indiana University Press,2021-09-07,"Discover the story of Amtrak, America's Railroad, 50 years in the making. In 1971, in an effort to rescue essential freight railroads, the US government founded Amtrak. In the post–World War II era, aviation and highway development had become the focus of government policy in America. As rail passenger services declined in number and in quality, they were simultaneously driving many railroads toward bankruptcy. Amtrak was intended to be the solution. In Amtrak, America's Railroad: Transportation's Orphan and Its Struggle for Survival, Geoffrey H. Doughty, Jeffrey T. Darbee, and Eugene E. Harmon explore the fascinating history of this popular institution and tell a tale of a company hindered by its flawed origin and uneven quality of leadership, subjected to political gamesmanship and favoritism, and mired in a perpetual philosophical debate about whether it is a business or a public service. Featuring interviews with former Amtrak presidents, the authors examine the current problems and issues facing Amtrak and their proposed solutions. Created in the absence of a comprehensive national transportation policy, Amtrak manages to survive despite inherent flaws due to the public's persistent loyalty. Amtrak, America's Railroad is essential reading for those who hope to see another fifty years of America's railroad passenger service, whether they be patrons, commuters, legislators, regulators, and anyone interested in railroads and transportation history.",Transportation,244,N/A,0,en

Transport & Fate of Chemicals in Soils,H. Magdi Selim,CRC Press,2014-09-17,"During the last four decades, tremendous advances have been made towards the understanding of transport characteristics of contaminants in soils, solutes, and tracers in geological media. Transport & Fate of Chemicals in Soils: Principles & Applications offers a comprehensive treatment of the subject complete with supporting examples of mathematical models that describe contaminants reactivity and transport in soils and aquifers. This approach makes it a practical guide for designing experiments and collecting data that focus on characterizing retention as well as release kinetic reactions in soils and contaminant transport experiments in the laboratory, greenhouse), and in the field. The book provides the basic framework of the principals governing the sorption and transport of chemicalsin soils. It focuses on physical processes such as fractured media, multiregion, multiple porosities, and heterogeneity and effect of scale as well as chemical processes such as nonlinear kinetics, release and desorption hysteresis, multisite and multireaction reactions, and competitive-type reactions. The coverage also includes details of sorption behavior of chemicals with soil matrix surfaces as well the integration of sorption characteristics with mechanisms that govern solute transport in soils. The discussions of applications of the principles of sorption and transport are not restricted to contaminants, but also include nitrogen, phosphorus, and trace elements including essential micronutrients, heavy metals, military explosives, pesticides, and radionuclides. Written in a very clear and easy-to-follow language by a pioneer in soil science, this book details the basic framework of the physical and chemical processes governing the transport of contaminants, trace elements, and heavy metals in soils. Highly practical, it includes laboratory methods, examples, and empirical formulations. The approach taken by the author gives you not only the fundamentals of understanding of reactive chemicals retention and their transport in soils and aquifers, but practical guidance you can put to immediate use in designing experiments and collecting data.",Science,356,N/A,0,en

"Amtrak, America's Railroad","Geoffrey H. Doughty, Jeffrey T. Darbee, Eugene E. Harmon",Indiana University Press,2021-09-07,"Discover the story of Amtrak, America's Railroad, 50 years in the making. In 1971, in an effort to rescue essential freight railroads, the US government founded Amtrak. In the post–World War II era, aviation and highway development had become the focus of government policy in America. As rail passenger services declined in number and in quality, they were simultaneously driving many railroads toward bankruptcy. Amtrak was intended to be the solution. In Amtrak, America's Railroad: Transportation's Orphan and Its Struggle for Survival, Geoffrey H. Doughty, Jeffrey T. Darbee, and Eugene E. Harmon explore the fascinating history of this popular institution and tell a tale of a company hindered by its flawed origin and uneven quality of leadership, subjected to political gamesmanship and favoritism, and mired in a perpetual philosophical debate about whether it is a business or a public service. Featuring interviews with former Amtrak presidents, the authors examine the current problems and issues facing Amtrak and their proposed solutions. Created in the absence of a comprehensive national transportation policy, Amtrak manages to survive despite inherent flaws due to the public's persistent loyalty. Amtrak, America's Railroad is essential reading for those who hope to see another fifty years of America's railroad passenger service, whether they be patrons, commuters, legislators, regulators, and anyone interested in railroads and transportation history.",History,256,N/A,0,en

Transportation Labor Issues and Regulatory Reform,"James H Peoples, Wayne K Talley",Elsevier,2004-08-24,"Regulatory reform in the late 1970s and early 1980s vastly transformed the labor market for transportation workers. Most research in this area focuses on the effect of deregulation on the earnings of nonmanagement company workers in airline, trucking and rail. Deregulation of transportation industries, though, has had a broader effect on workers. For instance, deregulation also influences workers' hours worked per week, working conditions, worker safety, and a host of other labor issues. Deregulation might also influence the earnings of managers and self-employed workers in transportation industries. Examining these issues is valuable because such analysis provides a more complete assessment of labor market changes following the shift to a more market oriented business environment. Transportation Labor Issues and Regulatory Reform adds to the debate on deregulation's influence on transportation labor markets by presenting empirical evidence on an array of labor market outcomes in transportation industries. Contributions to this volume are categorized by their analysis on worker safety, working conditions and employment opportunities, and by their analysis on managerial and self-employed earnings",Law,233,N/A,0,en

The Greatest Railroad Story Ever Told,Seth H. Bramson,Arcadia Publishing,2011-11-01,"All aboard for the history of one of the most audacious and innovative railroad engineering feats in history from the celebrated Floridian author. Although several people had considered constructing a railroad to Key West beginning in the early 1800s, it took a bold industrialist with unparalleled vision to make it happen. In 1902, Henry Flagler made the decision to extend the Florida East Coast Railway to “the nearest deepwater American port.” In this book, renowned Florida historian Seth H. Bramson reveals how the Key West Extension of the Flagler-owned FEC became the greatest railroad engineering and construction feat in United States, and possibly world, history, an accomplishment that would cement Flagler’s fame and legend for all time. Join Bramson as he recounts the years of operation of this great railroad, what it did for the Florida Keys and what it meant to the resident conchs. Includes photos",Transportation,193,N/A,0,en

Network Design with Applications to Transportation and Logistics,"Teodor Gabriel Crainic, Michel Gendreau, Bernard Gendron",Springer Nature,2021-07-16,"This book explores the methodological and application developments of network design in transportation and logistics. It identifies trends, challenges and research perspectives in network design for these areas. Network design is a major class of problems in operations research where network flow, combinatorial and mixed integer optimization meet. The analysis and planning of transportation and logistics systems continues to be one of the most important application areas of operations research. Networks provide the natural way of depicting such systems, so the optimal design and operation of networks is the main methodological area of operations research that is used for the analysis and planning of these systems. This book defines the current state of the art in the general area of network design, and then turns to its applications to transportation and logistics. New research challenges are addressed. Network Design with Applications to Transportation and Logistics is divided into three parts. Part I examines basic design problems including fixed-cost network design and parallel algorithms. After addressing the basics, Part II focuses on more advanced models. Chapters cover topics such as multi-facility network design, flow-constrained network design, and robust network design. Finally Part III is dedicated entirely to the potential application areas for network design. These areas range from rail networks, to city logistics, to energy transport. All of the chapters are written by leading researchers in the field, which should appeal to analysts and planners.",Business & Economics,661,N/A,0,en

Germany and the Ottoman Railways,Peter H. Christensen,Yale University Press,2017-10-24,"The complex political and cultural relationship between the German state and the Ottoman Empire is explored through the lens of the Ottoman Railway network, its architecture, and material culture With lines extending from Bosnia to Baghdad to Medina, the Ottoman Railway Network (1868–1919) was the pride of the empire and its ultimate emblem of modernization—yet it was largely designed and bankrolled by German corporations. This exemplifies a uniquely ambiguous colonial condition in which the interests of Germany and the Ottoman Empire were in constant flux. German capitalists and cultural figures sought influence in the Near East, including access to archaeological sites such as Tell Halaf and Mshatta. At the same time, Ottoman leaders and laborers urgently pursued imperial consolidation. Germany and the Ottoman Railways explores the impact of these political agendas as well as the railways’ impact on the built environment. Relying on a trove of previously unpublished archival materials, including maps, plans, watercolors, and photographs, author Peter H. Christensen also reveals the significance of this major infrastructure project for the budding disciplines of geography, topography, art history, and archaeology.",Transportation,205,N/A,0,en

Transportation & Land Use Innovations,Reid H. Ewing,Routledge,1997,"As our overstressed highways become increasingly snarled, America's love affair with the automobile continues to exact a frightening toll on our roadways, environment, and quality of life. This handbook, written especially for nontechnical readers, shows that you don't have to be a transportation engineer to effectively combat traffic congestion and automobile dependence. General planners and decision makers can set a new course by adopting broader transportation performance standards that incorporate mobility, livability, accessibility, and sustainability. Ewing demonstrates how manageable, affordable, and incremental changes in traffic patterns, road and intersection design, transit schedules, walkways and bikeways, and other factors can shrink vehicle miles and vehicle hours traveled. He uses examples from Florida and elsewhere to show how to implement complementary short- and long-term strategies tailored to your community's travel environments that will signifigantly reduce auto travel and its associated ills. Ewing emphasizes five tools: land planning, travel demand management, transportation system management, enhanced transit service, and pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly design. He demonstrates how proactive land planning, with an eye to mitigating the demand for auto travel, is the key element in a successful long-term approach. The book is extensively illustrated with easy-to-understand graphs, charts, drawings, and other visual aids. Generous endnotes will assist transportation professionals who may want to dig deeper.",Architecture,118,N/A,0,en

Hurtful Happenings Become Blessings,Alex Rogers,"Christian Faith Publishing, Inc.",2019-11-04,"As you read through the Bible, you will notice that God is telling the stories of how He dealt with people through the ages. One common theme runs through all of history. That theme includes three events that seem to happen to everyone who chooses to follow Him. First, they are sinners. Without God's help, they cannot obey Him and receive His blessing. Second, they all seem to go through some form of trial, persecution, or suffering. Third, they turn to God, put their lives in His hands, and God blesses them. You see that in the life of Joseph from the of book of Genesis. You see it in the life of David. You see it in the life of Job. You see it in the life of Mary, the mother of Jesus. You see it in the life of Peter. You see it in the life of Paul. Most importantly, you see it in the life of Jesus. I believe that the reason God wrote the Bible in the way He did is to show us how He wants to work in the lives of every person, even today. This book tells the story of one person who has and still is experiencing these things in his life today. The purpose of this book is to encourage you no matter where you are in your relationship with God. God loves you and is working in your life just as He did in the lives of the people whose stories are told in the Bible. You may not be a Christian yet, you may be a new Christian, you may have been walking with Jesus for years. Whatever point you are at in your relationship with God, I pray that this book will strengthen you to continue to seek after God as He has been seeking after you all your life.",Religion,83,N/A,0,en

The Road to Inequality,Clayton Nall,Cambridge University Press,2018-03-22,"The Road to Inequality shows how policies that shape geographic space change our politics, focusing on the effects of the largest public works project in American history: the federal highway system. For decades, federally subsidized highways have selectively facilitated migration into fast-growing suburbs, producing an increasingly non-urban Republican electorate. This book examines the highway programs' policy origins at the national level and traces how these intersected with local politics and interests to facilitate complex, mutually-reinforcing processes that have shaped America's growing urban-suburban divide and, with it, the politics of metropolitan public investment. As Americans have become more polarized on urban-suburban lines, attitudes towards transportation policy - a once quintessentially 'local' and non-partisan policy area - are now themselves driven by partisanship, endangering investments in metropolitan programs that provide access to opportunity for millions of Americans.",Political Science,189,N/A,0,en

But we may experience downsides such as jobs lost in construction and trucking, abandoned gas stations, fewer organ donations, and more difficult hurricane evacuations.

Evolving Transportation Networks,"Feng Xie, David Levinson",Springer Science & Business Media,2011-04-15,"Over the last two centuries, the development of modern transportation has significantly transformed human life. The main theme of this book is to understand the complexity of transportation development and model the process of network growth including its determining factors, which may be topological, morphological, temporal, technological, economic, managerial, social or political. Using multidimensional concepts and methods, the authors develop a holistic framework to represent network growth as an open and complex process with models that demonstrate in a scientific way how numerous independent decisions made by entities such as travelers, property owners, developers, and public jurisdictions could result in a coherent network of facilities on the ground. Models are proposed from innovative perspectives including self-organization, degeneration, and sequential connection to interpret the evolutionary growth of transportation networks in explicit consideration of independent economic and regulatory initiatives. Employing these models, the authors survey a series of topics ranging from network hierarchy and topology to first mover advantage. The authors demonstrate, with a wide spectrum of empirical and theoretical evidence, that network growth follows a path that is not only logical in retrospect, but also predictable and manageable from a planning perspective. In the larger scheme of innovative transportation planning, this book provides a re-consideration of conventional planning practice and sets the stage for further development on the theory and practice of the next-generation, evolutionary planning approach in transportation, making it of interest to scholars and practitioners alike in the field of transportation .",Political Science,282,N/A,0,en

Optimal Transportation Networks,"Marc Bernot, Vicent Caselles, Jean-Michel Morel",Springer Science & Business Media,2009,"The transportation problem can be formalized as the problem of finding the optimal way to transport a given measure into another with the same mass. In contrast to the Monge-Kantorovitch problem, recent approaches model the branched structure of such supply networks as minima of an energy functional whose essential feature is to favour wide roads. Such a branched structure is observable in ground transportation networks, in draining and irrigation systems, in electrical power supply systems and in natural counterparts such as blood vessels or the branches of trees. These lectures provide mathematical proof of several existence, structure and regularity properties empirically observed in transportation networks. The link with previous discrete physical models of irrigation and erosion models in geomorphology and with discrete telecommunication and transportation models is discussed. It will be mathematically proven that the majority fit in the simple model sketched in this volume.",Business & Economics,204,N/A,0,en

The Handbook of Transportation Science outlines the field of transportation as a scientific discipline that transcends transportation technology and methods. Whether by car, truck, airplane - or by a mode of transportation that has not yet been conceived - transportation obeys fundamental properties. The science of transportation defines these properties, and demonstrates how our knowledge of one mode of transportation can be used to explain the behavior of another. Transportation scientists are motivated by the desire to explain spatial interactions that result in movement of people or objects from place to place. Its methodologies draw from physics, operations research, probability and control theory.",Business & Economics,737,N/A,0,en

Modeling Dynamic Transportation Networks,"Bin Ran, David Boyce",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This book seeks to summarize our recent progress in dynamic trans portation network modeling. It concentrates on ideal dynamic network models based on actual travel times and their corresponding solution algorithms. In contrast, our first book DynamIc Urban Transportation Network Models - The ory and Implications for Intelligent Vehicle-Hzghway Systems (Springer-Verlag, 1994) focused on instantaneous dynamic network models. Comparing the two books, the major differences can be summarized as follows: 1. This book uses the variational inequality problem as the basic formulation approach and considers the optimal control problem as a subproblem for solution purposes. The former book used optimal control theory as the basic formulation approach, which caused critical problems in some circumstances. 2. This book focuses on ideal dynamic network models based on actual travel times. The former book focused on instantaneous dynamic network models based on currently prevailing travel times. 3. This book formulates a stochastic dynamic route choice model which can utilize any possible route choice distribution function instead of only the logit function. 4. This book reformulates the bilevel problem of combined departure time/ route choice as a one-level variational inequality. 5. Finally, a set of problems is provided for classroom use. In addition, this book offers comprehensive insights into the complexity and challenge of applying these dynamic network models to Intelligent Trans portation Systems (ITS). Nevertheless, the models in this text are not yet fully evaluated and are subject to revision based on future research.",Business & Economics,365,N/A,0,en

Transportation Policy and Economic Regulation,"John Bitzan, James H Peoples",Elsevier,2018-04-14,"Transportation Policy and Economic Regulation: Essays in Honor of Theodore Keeler addresses a number of today's important transportation policy issues, exploring a variety of transportation modes, and examining the policy implications of a number of alternatives. Theodore Keeler had a distinguished career in transportation economics, helping to shape regulatory policies concerning the transportation industries and assessing the appropriateness of various policies. A distinguishing feature of his work is that it always had policy implications. As a tribute to Theodore Keeler, this book examines transportation policy issues across a variety of transportation industries, including aviation, railroads, highways, motor carrier transport, automobiles, urban transit, and ocean shipping. The book evaluates the economic impact and effectiveness of various policies, employing empirical analyses and new estimation techniques, such as Bayesian analysis. The book is designed for transportation professionals and researchers, as well as transportation economics students, providing an in-depth analysis of some of today's important transportation policy issues. Policy changes established in the last 35-40 years have introduced profound changes in the business environment of the transportation industry. Past policy changes promoted the free market's role in setting prices and determining service availability. While 21st century policy has focused on a variety of other issues, such as safety, road and air congestion, productivity growth, labor relations and exhaust emission, many still promote the role of competition. In addition to examining various transportation policy issues in the U.S., the book explores some approaches to dealing with transportation issues in different parts of the world. Contemporary transportation policy debates have broadened from their initial focus of primarily examining the merits of reforming economic regulations at national levels, to now examining a variety of issues such as alternative methods of social regulation (such as safety regulation and emission controls), new approaches to changing economic regulations, the potential for reforming international regulations, and the appropriate role for government in transportation.",Social Science,0,N/A,0,en

The Future of Transportation and Communication,Roland Thord,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"We all know that networks are fundamental prerequisites for prosperity and production. Transportation and communication are indispensible to society, they are the elements which bind all economic systems together. Without networks and communica tion all social and economic life will be reduced to isolated phenomena. Therefore, transportation can't be assessed in the same way as other services. A smoothly functioning system of communications is also a prerequistite for social and economic integration between separate geographical regions. The modernization of the infrastructure is therefore an urgent task and a precondition for carrying out the whole of Europe's ambitious political, economic and social agenda. Since the need for communication and transportation does not know any national borders, the functioning of the networks needs to be adopted to this new economic and political geography. Congestions of cities, highways, railroads, airways and tele communications must be tackled, if precious working, commuting and leisure time is not to be wasted and heavy burdens on the environment avoided. European traffic, is for example, expected to double within the next twenty years. In certain transport modes the growth is expected to be even faster - air passenger transport doubled in 10 years and goods transport on roads doubled in 15 years.",Science,262,N/A,0,en

Breakdown in Traffic Networks,Boris S. Kerner,Springer,2017-05-26,"This book offers a detailed investigation of breakdowns in traffic and transportation networks. It shows empirically that transitions from free flow to so-called synchronized flow, initiated by local disturbances at network bottlenecks, display a nucleation-type behavior: while small disturbances in free flow decay, larger ones grow further and lead to breakdowns at the bottlenecks. Further, it discusses in detail the significance of this nucleation effect for traffic and transportation theories, and the consequences this has for future automatic driving, traffic control, dynamic traffic assignment, and optimization in traffic and transportation networks. Starting from a large volume of field traffic data collected from various sources obtained solely through measurements in real world traffic, the author develops his insights, with an emphasis less on reviewing existing methodologies, models and theories, and more on providing a detailed analysis of empirical traffic data and drawing consequences regarding the minimum requirements for any traffic and transportation theories to be valid. The book - proves the empirical nucleation nature of traffic breakdown in networks - discusses the origin of the failure of classical traffic and transportation theories - shows that the three-phase theory is incommensurable with the classical traffic theories, and - explains why current state-of-the art dynamic traffic assignments tend to provoke heavy traffic congestion, making it a valuable reference resource for a wide audience of scientists and postgraduate students interested in the fundamental understanding of empirical traffic phenomena and related data-driven phenomenology, as well as for practitioners working in the fields of traffic and transportation engineering.",Technology & Engineering,673,N/A,0,en

Urban Informatics,"Wenzhong Shi, Michael F.

It introduces new models and tools being developed to understand and implement these technologies that enable cities to function more efficiently – to become ‘smart’ and ‘sustainable’. The smart city has quickly emerged as computers have become ever smaller to the point where they can be embedded into the very fabric of the city, as well as being central to new ways in which the population can communicate and act. When cities are wired in this way, they have the potential to become sentient and responsive, generating massive streams of ‘big’ data in real time as well as providing immense opportunities for extracting new forms of urban data through crowdsourcing. This book offers a comprehensive review of the methods that form the core of urban informatics from various kinds of urban remote sensing to new approaches to machine learning and statistical modelling. It provides a detailed technical introduction to the wide array of tools information scientists need to develop the key urban analytics that are fundamental to learning about the smart city, and it outlines ways in which these tools can be used to inform design and policy so that cities can become more efficient with a greater concern for environment and equity.",Social Science,928,N/A,0,en

From the early nineteenth century, when the first train stations - ""cathedrals of technology,"" buildings without precedent in the history of architecture - were constructed, these focal points of transportation have enjoyed a unique status in public life. They have come a long way from the simple wooden shed erected in Liverpool, England, in 1830."" ""In the wake of the rail renaissance of the 1980s and 1990s, new train stations, from the U.S. to Japan, must respond to increasingly complex challenges, as high-speed trains become more and more common and the next generation of magnetically levitated trains approaches. The state-of-the-art examples featured in Modern Trains and Splendid Stations are analyzed from several perspectives: as generators of urban renewal; as new architectural icons; and as connecting points from different means of transportation.

Locomotive to Aeromotive,Simine Short,University of Illinois Press,2014-07-02,"French-born and self-trained civil engineer Octave Chanute designed America's two largest stockyards, created innovative and influential structures such as the Kansas City Bridge over the previously ""unbridgeable"" Missouri River, and was a passionate aviation pioneer whose collaborative approach to aeronautical engineering problems encouraged other experimenters, including the Wright brothers. Drawing on rich archival material and exclusive family sources, Locomotive to Aeromotive is the first detailed examination of Chanute's life and his immeasurable contributions to engineering and transportation, from the ground transportation revolution of the mid-nineteenth century to the early days of aviation. Aviation researcher and historian Simine Short brings to light in colorful detail many previously overlooked facets of Chanute's professional and personal life. In the late nineteenth century, few considered engineering as a profession on par with law or medicine, but Chanute devoted much time and energy to the newly established professional societies that were created to set standards and serve the needs of civil engineers. Though best known for his aviation work, he became a key figure in the opening of the American continent by laying railroad tracks and building bridges, experiences that later gave him the engineering knowledge to build the first stable aircraft structure. Chanute also introduced a procedure to treat wooden railroad ties with an antiseptic that increased the wood’s lifespan in the tracks. Establishing the first commercial plants, he convinced railroad men that it was commercially feasible to make money by spending money on treating ties to conserve natural resources. He next introduced the date nail to help track the age and longevity of railroad ties. A versatile engineer, Chanute was known as a kind and generous colleague during his career. Using correspondence and other materials not previously available to scholars and biographers, Short covers Chanute's formative years in antebellum America as well as his experiences traveling from New Orleans to New York, his apprenticeship on the Hudson River Railroad, and his early engineering successes. His multiple contributions to railway expansion, bridge building, and wood preservation established his reputation as one of the nation's most successful and distinguished civil engineers. Instead of retiring, he utilized his experiences and knowledge as a bridge builder in the development of motorless flight. Through the reflections of other engineers, scientists, and pioneers in various fields who knew him, Short characterizes Chanute as a man who believed in fostering and supporting people who were willing to learn. This well-researched biography cements Chanute's place as a preeminent engineer and mentor in the history of transportation in the United States and the development of the airplane.",Biography & Autobiography,0,N/A,0,en

There Are No Accidents,Jessie Singer,Simon and Schuster,2023-02-28,"A journalist recounts the surprising history of accidents and reveals how they’ve come to define all that’s wrong with America. We hear it all the time: “Sorry, it was just an accident.” And we’ve been deeply conditioned to just accept that explanation and move on. But as Jessie Singer argues convincingly: There are no such things as accidents. The vast majority of mishaps are not random but predictable and preventable. Singer uncovers just how the term “accident” itself protects those in power and leaves the most vulnerable in harm’s way, preventing investigations, pushing off debts, blaming the victims, diluting anger, and even sparking empathy for the perpetrators. As the rate of accidental death skyrockets in America, the poor and people of color end up bearing the brunt of the violence and blame, while the powerful use the excuse of the “accident” to avoid consequences for their actions. Born of the death of her best friend, and the killer who insisted it was an accident, this book is a moving investigation of the sort of tragedies that are all too common, and all too commonly ignored. In this revelatory book, Singer tracks accidental death in America from turn of the century factories and coal mines to today’s urban highways, rural hospitals, and Superfund sites. Drawing connections between traffic accidents, accidental opioid overdoses, and accidental oil spills, Singer proves that what we call accidents are hardly random. Rather, who lives and dies by an accident in America is defined by money and power. She also presents a variety of actions we can take as individuals and as a society to stem the tide of “accidents”—saving lives and holding the guilty to account.",Medical,352,N/A,0,en

"Location, Transport and Land-Use",Yupo Chan,Springer Science & Business Media,2004-10-11,"1. Theme and focus Few books are available to integrate the models for facilities siting, transportation, and land-use. Employing state-of-the-art quantitative-models and case-studies, this book would guide the siting of such facilities as transportation terminals, warehouses, nuclear power plants, military bases, landfills, emergency shelters, state parks, and industrial plants. The book also shows the use of statistical tools for forecasting and analyzing implications of land-use decisions. The idea is that la- use on a map is necessarily a consequence of individual, and often conflicting, siting decisions over time. Since facilities often develop to form a community, these decisions are interrelated spatially—i. e. , they need to be accessible to one another via the transportation system. It is our thesis that a common methodological procedure exists to analyze all these spatial-temporal constructs. While there are several monographs and texts on subjects related to this book's, this volume is unique in that it integrates existing practical and theoretical works on facility-location, transportation, and land-use. Instead of dealing with individual facility-location, transportation, or the resulting land-use pattern individually, it provides the underlying principles that are behind these types of models. Particularly of interest is the emphasis on counter-intuitive decisions that often escape our minds unless deliberate steps of analysis are taken. Oriented toward the fundamental principles of infrastructure management, the book transcends the traditional engineering and planning disciplines, where the main concerns are often exclusively either physical design, fiscal, socioeconomic or political considerations.",Technology & Engineering,968,3,2,en

Modelling and Analysis of Fine Sediment Transport in Wave-Current Bottom Boundary Layer,Liqin Zuo,CRC Press,2018-06-19,"The evolution and utilization of estuarine and coastal regions are greatly restricted by sediment problems. This thesis aims to better understand fine sediment transport under combined action of waves and currents, especially in the wave-current bottom boundary layer (BBL). Field observations, experimental data analysis, theoretical analysis and numerical models are employed. Silt-dominated sediments are sensitive to flow dynamics and the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) increase rapidly under strong flow dynamics. This research unveils several fundamental aspects of silty sediment, i.e., the criterion of the incipient motion, the SSC profiles and their phase-averaged parameterization in wave-dominated conditions. An expression for sediment incipient motion is proposed for silt-sand sediment under combined wave and current conditions. A process based intra-wave 1DV model for flow-sediment dynamics near the bed is developed in combined wave-current conditions. The high concentration layer (HCL) was simulated and sensitivity analysis was carried out by the 1DV model on factors that impact the SSC in the HCL. Finally, based on the 1DV model, the formulations of the mean SSC profile of silt-sand sediments in wave conditions were proposed. The developed approaches are expected to be applied in engineering practice and further simulation.",Science,193,N/A,0,en
Energy-Related Material Flow Simulation in Production and Logistics,"Sigrid Wenzel, Markus Rabe, Steffen Strassburger, Christoph von Viebahn",Springer Nature,2024-01-15,"This book provides for the first time an overview on the current approaches and applications of energy aspects in production and logistics by the use of simulation techniques. During the last decade, the importance of energy in the material flow processes has become more and more important. The pressure to reduce the environmental footprint of production and logistics systems will even intensify in future. Therefore, enterprises have started to integrate the use of energy into their planning processes much more than before, even designing feedback loops, e.g., from energy control to production control. This receives additional attention with the increasing use of renewable, but less reliable, energy sources. Care must be taken to establish processes that aim to use energy when it is available. As an example, many industrial processes like melting or coating have significant energy demands, but could vary the point of time of its consumption within specific limits, leading to a very high complexity. ​ It discusses the construction and application of energy-specific performance indicators and analyzes the input information that needs to be acquired before implementing suitable models. On this basis, concrete technical solutions are introduced.",Technology & Engineering,208,N/A,0,en

Overland Flow Dynamics and Solute Transport,Vyacheslav G. Rumynin,Springer,2015-10-29,"This book provides essential background knowledge on a wide range of hydrological processes governing contaminant transport from soil to surface water across a range of scales, from hillslope to watershed. The mathematical description of these processes is based on both well-known and unique analytical solutions of different initial and boundary problems (primarily using methods from the kinematic wave theory and the reservoir/lumped-parameter concept), supported by numerical modelling studies. Some research topics, in particular several case studies, are illustrated by monitoring and experimental data analysis to show the importance of the research’s applications in environmental practice and environmental education. Specific results concern the recognition of: (a) the effect of transient rainfall–runoff–infiltration partitioning on the chemical response of drainage areas to excess precipitation under certain field conditions related to the soil, hillslope characteristics, and contaminant properties; (b) soil erosion as a key factor that enhances the potential of adsorbed chemical transport in runoff; and (c) common tendencies in radionuclide behaviour in the near-surface environment contaminated by radioactive fallout from the Chernobyl (1986), Fukushima (2011) and the less known Kyshtym (1957) accidents, as well as from nuclear weapon tests in the atmosphere since 1952. The book’s goal is to provide a conceptual foundation enabling readers to apply scientific knowledge to solve practical problems in environmental hydrology and radiology. More specifically, the book presents the state-of-the-art approaches that scientists and natural resources experts need in order to significantly improve the prediction of changes in the soil–water system chemistry due to human activities.",Science,296,N/A,0,en

Handbook on Decision Making,Chee Peng Lim,Springer Science & Business Media,2010-09-07,"Decision making arises when we wish to select the best possible course of action from a set of alternatives. With advancements of the digital technologies, it is easy, and almost instantaneous, to gather a large volume of information and/or data pertaining to a problem that we want to solve. For instance, the world-wi- web is perhaps the primary source of information and/or data that we often turn to when we face a decision making problem. However, the information and/or data that we obtain from the real world often are complex, and comprise various kinds of noise. Besides, real-world information and/or data often are incomplete and ambiguous, owing to uncertainties of the environments. All these make decision making a challenging task. To cope with the challenges of decision making, - searchers have designed and developed a variety of decision support systems to provide assistance in human decision making processes. The main aim of this book is to provide a small collection of techniques stemmed from artificial intelligence, as well as other complementary methodo- gies, that are useful for the design and development of intelligent decision support systems.

While these models are well-established tools for economic analysis, their underlying mathematical structure is also applicable to the analysis and optimization of a wide range of systems that are characterized by linear interdependencies among their components. This means that input–output models can be used for diverse networks, such as processes within industrial plants, industrial plants in a supply chain, or departmental units within an organization. The models can also be readily extended to interactions between man-made systems and the environment, e.g. flows of natural resources and/or pollutants. Furthermore, model variants with excess degrees of freedom can be formulated to allow optimization and decision-making to be integrated within the framework.

Civil War Logistics,Earl J. Hess,LSU Press,2017-09-18,"Winner of the Eugene Feit Award in Civil War Studies by the New York Military Affairs Symposium During the Civil War, neither the Union nor the Confederate army could have operated without effective transportation systems. Moving men, supplies, and equipment required coordination on a massive scale, and Earl J. Hess’s Civil War Logistics offers the first comprehensive analysis of this vital process. Utilizing an enormous array of reports, dispatches, and personal accounts by quartermasters involved in transporting war materials, Hess reveals how each conveyance system operated as well as the degree to which both armies accomplished their logistical goals. In a society just realizing the benefits of modern travel technology, both sides of the conflict faced challenges in maintaining national and regional lines of transportation. Union and Confederate quartermasters used riverboats, steamers, coastal shipping, railroads, wagon trains, pack trains, cattle herds, and their soldiers in the long and complicated chain that supported the military operations of their forces. Soldiers in blue and gray alike tried to destroy the transportation facilities of their enemy, firing on river boats and dismantling rails to disrupt opposing supply lines while defending their own means of transport. According to Hess, Union logistical efforts proved far more successful than Confederate attempts to move and supply its fighting forces, due mainly to the North’s superior administrative management and willingness to seize transportation resources when needed. As the war went on, the Union’s protean system grew in complexity, size, and efficiency, while that of the Confederates steadily declined in size and effectiveness until it hardly met the needs of its army. Indeed, Hess concludes that in its use of all types of military transportation, the Federal government far surpassed its opponent and thus laid the foundation for Union victory in the Civil War.",History,454,N/A,0,en

Transport in Plants II,"U. Lüttge, M.G. Pitman",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"As plant physiology increased steadily in the latter half of the 19th century, problems of absorption and transport of water and of mineral nutrients and problems of the passage of metabolites from one cell to another were investigated, especially in Germany. JUSTUS VON LIEBIG, who was born in Darmstadt in 1803, founded agricultural chemistry and developed the techniques of mineral nutrition in agricul ture during the 70 years of his life. The discovery of plasmolysis by NAGEL! (1851), the investigation of permeability problems of artificial membranes by TRAUBE (1867) and the classical work on osmosis by PFEFFER (1877) laid the foundations for our understanding of soluble substances and osmosis in cell growth and cell mechanisms. Since living membranes were responsible for controlling both water movement and the substances in solution, ""permeability"" became a major topic for investigation and speculation. The problems then discussed under that heading included passive permeation by diffusion, Donnan equilibrium adjustments, active transport processes and antagonism between ions. In that era, when organelle isolation by differential centrifugation was unknown and the electron microscope had not been invented, the number of cell membranes, their thickness and their composition, were matters for conjecture. The nature of cell surface membranes was deduced with remarkable accuracy from the reactions of cells to substances in solution. In 1895, OVERTON, in U. S. A. , published the hypothesis that membranes were probably lipid in nature because of the greater penetration by substances with higher fat solubility.",Science,434,N/A,0,en

Spatial Modelling of Flood Risk and Flood Hazards,"Biswajeet Pradhan, Pravat Kumar Shit, Gouri Sankar Bhunia, Partha Pratim Adhikary, Hamid Reza Pourghasemi",Springer Nature,2022-04-06,"Floods and flash floods with hydro-meteorological and tropical cyclones are the some of the most devastating natural disasters causing massive damages to natural and man-made features. Flood hazards are a major threat to human life, properties (agricultural area, yield production, building and homes) and infrastructures (bridges, roads, railways, urban infrastructures, etc). Flood hazards susceptibility mapping (risk assessment) and modelling is an essential step for early warning systems, emergency services, prevention and mitigation of future environmental and social hazards and implementation of risk management strategies. Due to the lack of proper information, technology-based policies and strategies, mapping and modelling can often not be implemented to the best possible level. Geo-spatial techniques have enjoyed rising interest in recent decades among the earth environmental and social sciences research communities for their powerful ability to solve and understand various complex problems and develop novel approaches toward sustainable earth and human society. By linking geo-spatial computational intelligence techniques with societal and environmental-oriented problems, this book demonstrates geospatial technology approaches to data mining techniques, data analysis, modelling, risk assessment and visualization and management strategies in different aspects of flood hazards. We believe that a diverse group of academics, scientists, geographers, hydrologist, remote sensing and GIS expertise, environmentalists, meteorologists and computing experts with a common interest in geospatial sciences within the earth environmental sciences and humanistic and social sciences will find this book to be of great value.",Computers,248,N/A,0,en

"Traveler Response to Transportation System Changes Handbook, Third Edition: Chapter 19, Employer and Institutional TDM Strategies","Transportation Research Board, Transit Cooperative Research Program",Transportation Research Board,2010-07-19,"""The third edition Traveler Response to Transportation System Changes Handbook provides comprehensive information on travel demand effects of alternative urban transportation policies, operating approaches and systems, and built environment options, by building upon, expanding, and selectively replacing the earlier editions to provide a contemporary assessment of the experience and insights gained from the application and analysis of various system changes and alternatives. The focus is on aiding transportation, transit, and land use planners in their conduct of travel demand and related analyses, and to inform elected officials, administrators, operators, designers, and the general public as well. The Traveler Response to Transportation System Changes Handbook consists of the Chapter 1 introductory materials and 15 stand-alone published topic area chapters. Each topic area chapter provides traveler response findings including supportive information and interpretation, and also includes case studies and a bibliography consisting of the references utilized as sources. Please note that Chapters 4, 7, and 8 have been deferred for a future TCRP project effort. The Handbook findings derive primarily from reported results and analyses of real-world transportation system and policy applications and trials. Experimental or quasi-experimental empirical data have been the information source of choice. Other empirical data derivations and simple accounts of outcomes have been employed as necessary. Forecasts and other estimates derived from travel demand model applications and similar techniques have been used, but on a very selective basis; mostly for augmenting the empirical data where gaps exist, and for providing additional insights and context. TCRP Report 95: Traveler Response to Transportation System Changes Handbook will be of interest to transit, transportation, and land use planning practitioners; transportation engineers; land developers, employers, and school administrators; researchers and educators; and professionals across a broad spectrum of transportation and planning; metropolitan planning organizations; and local, state, and federal government agencies.""--taken from publisher web site.",Business & Economics,185,N/A,0,en

The Evaluation of Transportation Investment Projects,Joseph Berechman,Routledge,2010-05-26,"Throughout the world, the use of some kind of a formal transportation project evaluation procedure is a requirement. Yet, by and large, these are partial; in fact, much weight is often placed on the initial -pre-engineering -phases of the planning process, when vital information, such as accurate costs and demand projections, is largely missing. Moreover, many of these procedures neglect to consider key issues such as project’s risks, capital costs financing, latent demand, market imperfections, labor force availability and various incompatibilities between trip rates, travel times and activity location. As a result, projects, which are judged as viable under such deficient evaluation schemes, may have had a significantly different projection of capital costs and demand should a well-founded, thorough, and efficient evaluation process be used. Against this background, this book’s main objective is to construct a comprehensive and methodical economic, planning and decision-making framework for the evaluation of proposed transportation infrastructure investment projects. Such a framework is founded on four key principles. It is based on well-established economic, transportation and policy-analysis theoretical principles; it is comprehensive enough to encompass all relevant evaluation issues; it is applicable to a wide range of transportation investment projects; and it is amenable to empirical application including a sensitivity analysis and alternative scenarios regarding urban, regional and national developments.",Business & Economics,514,N/A,0,en

The Multi-Agent Transport Simulation MATSim,"Andreas Horni, Kai Nagel, Kay W. Axhausen",Ubiquity Press,2016-08-10,"The MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation) software project was started around 2006 with the goal of generating traffic and congestion patterns by following individual synthetic travelers through their daily or weekly activity programme. It has since then evolved from a collection of stand-alone C++ programs to an integrated Java-based framework which is publicly hosted, open-source available, automatically regression tested. It is currently used by about 40 groups throughout the world. This book takes stock of the current status. The first part of the book gives an introduction to the most important concepts, with the intention of enabling a potential user to set up and run basic simulations. The second part of the book describes how the basic functionality can be extended, for example by adding schedule-based public transit, electric or autonomous cars, paratransit, or within-day replanning. For each extension, the text provides pointers to the additional documentation and to the code base. It is also discussed how people with appropriate Java programming skills can write their own extensions, and plug them into the MATSim core. The project has started from the basic idea that traffic is a consequence of human behavior, and thus humans and their behavior should be the starting point of all modelling, and with the intuition that when simulations with 100 million particles are possible in computational physics, then behavior-oriented simulations with 10 million travelers should be possible in travel behavior research. The initial implementations thus combined concepts from computational physics and complex adaptive systems with concepts from travel behavior research. The third part of the book looks at theoretical concepts that are able to describe important aspects of the simulation system; for example, under certain conditions the code becomes a Monte Carlo engine sampling from a discrete choice model. Another important aspect is the interpretation of the MATSim score as utility in the microeconomic sense, opening up a connection to benefit cost analysis. Finally, the book collects use cases as they have been undertaken with MATSim. All current users of MATSim were invited to submit their work, and many followed with sometimes crisp and short and sometimes longer contributions, always with pointers to additional references. We hope that the book will become an invitation to explore, to build and to extend agent-based modeling of travel behavior from the stable and well tested core of MATSim documented here.",Technology & Engineering,620,N/A,0,en

Transportation Operations Management,Darren J. Prokop,Elsevier,2022-03-09,"Transportation Operations Management provides the analytical tools and industry-wide context necessary to understand and address the critical real-world problems in transportation operations and planning that shippers, carriers, and third-party logistics providers face every day.The book examines operational problems from all transportation modes—air, motor carrier, water vessel, pipeline, and rail—to show how these interact in the real world of today's carriers and shippers. The book also outlines and analyzes key issues such as designing efficient domestic and international transportation networks; choosing optimal locations within market spaces; designing infrastructure to manage network congestion; leveraging intermodalism for operational flexibility; leveraging techniques for costing, pricing, and revenue management; using tracking technology for decisionmaking; maintaining regulatory compliance in operations; and managing environmental stewardship.Paying particular attention to the influence of the logistical constraints of time, physical space, and location, the book reveals the key role of transportation in strategic and tactical decision-making. The book uses mathematical techniques such as the theory of capacity management, the microeconomics of costing and pricing, risk management, linear optimization, productivity measurement, queueing theory, and complex scheduling. The book also uses real-world problems with their actual marketplace constraints in technology, geography, and government regulations to provide an applied context to the techniques examined. - Applies the latest analytical techniques to address real-world situations domestically and internationally, from industry and government, demonstrating the interplay between business and government, and planning vs day-to-day operations - Includes case studies that demonstrate the opportunities and constraints regarding how workable solutions to an operations management problem can be structured - Includes learning aids such as chapter objectives, in-depth discussion of techniques, and keypoints made in prose, mathematically, and diagrammatically",Law,242,N/A,0,en

Box Boats,Brian J. Cudahy,Fordham Univ Press,2007-12-17,"Fifty years ago--on April 26, 1956--the freighter Ideal X steamed from Berth 26 in Port Newark, New Jersey. Flying the flag of the Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company, she set out for Houston with an unusual cargo: 58 trailer trucks lashed to her top deck. But they weren't trucks--they were steel containers removed from their running gear, waiting to be lifted onto empty truck beds when Ideal X reached Texas. She docked safely, and a revolution was launched--not only in shipping, but in the way the world trades. Today, the more than 200 million containers shipped every year are the lifeblood of the new global economy. They sit stacked on thousands of ""box boats"" that grow more massive every year. In this fascinating book, transportation expert Brian Cudahy provides a vivid, fast-paced account of the container-ship revolution--from the maiden voyage of the Ideal X to the entrepreneurial vision and technological breakthroughs that make it possible to ship more goods more cheaply than every before. Cudahy tells this complex story easily, starting with Malcom McLean, Pan-Atlantic's owner who first thought about loading his trucks on board. His line grew into the container giant Sea-Land Services, and Cudahy charts its dramatic evolution into Maersk Sealand, the largest container line in the world. Along the way, he provides a concise, colorful history of world shipping--from freighter types to the fortunes of steamship lines--and explores the spectacular growth of global trade fueled by the mammoth ships and new seaborne lifelines connecting Asia, Europe, and the Americas. Masterful maritime history, Box Boats shows how fleets of these ungainly ships make the modern world possible--with both positive and negative effects. It's also a tale of an historic home port, New York, where old piers lie silent while 40-foot steel boxes of toys and televisions come ashore by the thousands, across the bay in New Jersey.",Transportation,338,N/A,0,en

The database was structured to address pavement management and engineering design issues. The extent and scope of information contained within the LTPP database and Information Management System (IMS) also provides the resources not only to evaluate or revise existing design equations but to develop new ones. During the first 5 years of the SHRP-LTPP program, most issues have been addressed in various data analysis studies. Data analysis studies concerning load equivalency factors, materials and construction variability, rutting initiation studies, and the results of the specific SHRP-LTPP data analysis contracts are presented in subsequent sections of this report. These studies represent initial efforts in pursuit of LTPP goals and operatives and are based primarily on early General Pavement Studies data.",Pavements,120,N/A,0,en

The End of Automobile Dependence,"Peter Newman, Jeffrey Kenworthy",Island Press,2015-08-11,"Cities will continue to accommodate the automobile, but when cities are built around them, the quality of human and natural life declines. Current trends show great promise for future urban mobility systems that enable freedom and connection, but not dependence. We are experiencing the phenomenon of peak car use in many global cities at the same time that urban rail is thriving, central cities are revitalizing, and suburban sprawl is reversing. Walking and cycling are growing in many cities, along with ubiquitous bike sharing schemes, which have contributed to new investment and vitality in central cities including Melbourne, Seattle, Chicago, and New York. We are thus in a new era that has come much faster than global transportation experts Peter Newman and Jeffrey Kenworthy had predicted: the end of automobile dependence. In The End of Automobile Dependence, Newman and Kenworthy look at how we can accelerate a planning approach to designing urban environments that can function reliably and conveniently on alternative modes, with a refined and more civilized automobile playing a very much reduced and manageable role in urban transportation. The authors examine the rise and fall of automobile dependence using updated data on 44 global cities to better understand how to facilitate and guide cities to the most productive and sustainable outcomes. This is the final volume in a trilogy by Newman and Kenworthy on automobile dependence (Cities and Automobile Dependence in 1989 and Sustainability and Cities: Overcoming Automobile Dependence in 1999). Like all good trilogies this one shows the rise of an empire, in this case that of the automobile, the peak of its power, and the decline of that empire.",Architecture,326,N/A,0,en

From a Nickel to a Token,Andrew J. Sparberg,Fordham Univ Press,2014-11-03,"Streetcars “are as dead as sailing ships,” said Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia in a radio speech, two days before Madison Avenue’s streetcars yielded to buses. LaGuardia was determined to eliminate streetcars, demolish pre-1900 elevated lines, and unify the subway system, a goal that became reality in 1940 when the separate IRT, BMT, and IND became one giant system under full public control. In this fascinating micro-history of New York’s transit system, Andrew Sparberg examines twenty specific events between 1940 and 1968, book ended by subway unification and the MTA’s creation. From a Nickel to a Token depicts a potpourri of well-remembered, partially forgotten, and totally obscure happenings drawn from the historical tapestry of New York mass transit. Sparberg deftly captures five boroughs of grit, chaos, and emotion grappling with a massive and unwieldy transit system. During these decades, the system morphed into today’s familiar network. The public sector absorbed most private surface lines operating within the five boroughs, and buses completely replaced streetcars. Elevated lines were demolished, replaced by subways or, along Manhattan’s Third Avenue, not at all. Beyond the unification of the IND, IRT, and BMT, strategic track connections were built between lines to allow a more flexible and unified operation. The oldest subway routes received much needed rehabilitation. Thousands of new subway cars and buses were purchased. The sacred nickel fare barrier was broken, and by 1968 a ride cost twenty cents. From LaGuardia to Lindsay, mayors devoted much energy to solving transit problems, keeping fares low, and appeasing voters, fellow elected officials, transit management, and labor leaders. Simultaneously, American society was experiencing tumultuous times, manifested by labor disputes, economic pressures, and civil rights protests. Featuring many photos never before published, From a Nickel to a Token is a historical trip back in time to a multitude of important events.",History,193,N/A,0,en
Salt and Hypertension,"Rainer Rettig, Detlev Ganten, Friedrich C. Luft",Springer,1988-12-20,"Controversy regarding the wisdom of a high salt intake has been with us for 5000 years. In the Nei Ching, the oldest of the extant medical writings, the Yellow Emperor observed, ""Hence, if too much salt is in the food, the pulse hardens, tears make their appearance, and the complexion changes"". At about the same period in history, Job asked the question, ""Can that which is unsavory be eaten without salt?"" It is not apparent whether or not the Almighty provided a clear answer. The connection between dietary salt intake and hypertension was appreciated following the observations of AMBARD, BEAUJARD, VOLLHARD, ALLEN, and others. However, DAHL emphasized this relationship, as demonstrated by his epidemiological observations, his studies in human subjects, and his development of a genetically mediated form of salt-sensitive hypertension in rats. DAHL and his followers argued that hypertension was a disease of acculturation, or even of self-abuse. Undaunted by skeptics such as PICKERING, they suggested that if Western man would merely curtail his intake of the granular condiment, hypertension would not develop and blood pressure would not increase with age. Bucolic native societies were given as examples where such cardiovascular bliss was readily attained.",Medical,396,N/A,0,en

Integrated Design for Space Transportation System,"B.N. Suresh, K. Sivan",Springer,2015-11-20,"The book addresses the overall integrated design aspects of a space transportation system involving several disciplines like propulsion, vehicle structures, aerodynamics, flight mechanics, navigation, guidance and control systems, stage auxiliary systems, thermal systems etc. and discusses the system approach for design, trade off analysis, system life cycle considerations, important aspects in mission management, the risk assessment, etc. There are several books authored to describe the design aspects of various areas, viz., propulsion, aerodynamics, structures, control, etc., but there is no book which presents space transportation system (STS) design in an integrated manner. This book attempts to fill this gap by addressing systems approach for STS design, highlighting the integrated design aspects, interactions between various subsystems and interdependencies. The main focus is towards the complex integrated design to arrive at an optimum, robust and cost effective space transportation system. The orbital mechanics of satellites including different coordinate frames, orbital perturbations and orbital transfers are explained. For launching the satellites to meet specific mission requirements, viz., payload/orbit, design considerations, giving step by step procedure are briefed. The selection methodology for launch vehicle configuration, its optimum staging and the factors which influence the vehicle performance are summarized. The influence of external, internal and dynamic operating environments experienced by the vehicle subsystems and the remedial measures needed are highlighted. The mission design strategies and their influence on the vehicle design process are elaborated. The various critical aspects of STS subsystems like flight mechanics, propulsion, structures and materials, thermal systems, stage auxiliary systems, navigation, guidance and control and the interdependencies and interactions between them are covered. The design guidelines, complexity of the flight environment and the reentry dynamics for the reentry missions are included. The book is not targeted as a design tool for any particular discipline or subsystem. Some of the design related equations or expressions are not attempted to derive from the first principle as this is beyond the scope of this book. However, the important analytical expressions, graphs and sketches which are essential to provide in-depth understanding for the design process as well as to understand the interactions between different subsystems are appropriately included.",Technology & Engineering,792,5,1,en

Drawing on literary and archaeological material for the distribution of cities, villages, roads and other features of trade and marketing, and making use of the central-place theory, the author attempts to reconstruct models of the regional economy of northern Palestine, and to examine the degree of economic integration in the region. As a contribution to the historiography of Jews and Palestine in antiquity, Hayim Lapin argues that the economic, social and cultural landscape inhabited by residents of fourth-century Palestine was in many ways shaped by its Roman provincial administrative setting and political economy. Thus key aspects of the history of later Roman Palestine, and particularly of Jews, need to be reexamined.",Business & Economics,252,N/A,0,en
Transport in Nanostructures,"David K. Ferry, Stephen M.

Gas Transport in Porous Media,"Clifford K. Ho, Stephen W. Webb",Springer,2010-11-23,"CLIFFORD K. HOAND STEPHEN W. WEBB Sandia National Laboratories, P. O. Box 5800, Albuquerque, NM 87185, USA Gas and vapor transport in porous media occur in a number of important applications includingdryingofindustrialandfoodproducts,oilandgasexploration,environm- tal remediation of contaminated sites, and carbon sequestration. Understanding the fundamental mechanisms and processes of gas and vapor transport in porous media allows models to be used to evaluate and optimize the performance and design of these systems. In this book, gas and vapor are distinguished by their available states at stan- ? dard temperature and pressure (20 C, 101 kPa). If the gas-phase constituent can also exist as a liquid phase at standard temperature and pressure (e. g. , water, ethanol, toluene, trichlorothylene), it is considered a vapor. If the gas-phase constituent is non-condensable at standard temperature and pressure (e. g. , oxygen, carbon di- ide, helium, hydrogen, propane), it is considered a gas. The distinction is important because different processes affect the transport and behavior of gases and vapors in porous media. For example, mechanisms specific to vapors include vapor-pressure lowering and enhanced vapor diffusion, which are caused by the presence of a g- phase constituent interacting with its liquid phase in an unsaturated porous media. In addition, the “heat-pipe” exploits isothermal latent heat exchange during evaporation and condensation to effectively transfer heat in designed and natural systems.",Science,0,N/A,0,en

Ferry,CRC Press,2017-12-14,"Throughout their college career, most engineering students have done problems and studies that are basically situated in the classical world. Some may have taken quantum mechanics as their chosen field of study. This book moves beyond the basics to highlight the full quantum mechanical nature of the transport of carriers through nanoelectronic structures. The book is unique in that addresses quantum transport only in the materials that are of interest to microelectronics—semiconductors, with their variable densities and effective masses. The author develops Green’s functions starting from equilibrium Green’s functions and going through modern time-dependent approaches to non-equilibrium Green’s functions, introduces relativistic bands for graphene and topological insulators and discusses the quantum transport changes that these bands induce, and discusses applications such as weak localization and phase breaking processes, resonant tunneling diodes, single-electron tunneling, and entanglement. Furthermore, he also explains modern ensemble Monte Carlo approaches to simulation of various approaches to quantum transport and the hydrodynamic approaches to quantum transport. All in all, the book describes all approaches to quantum transport in semiconductors, thus becoming an essential textbook for advanced graduate students in electrical engineering or physics.",Science,323,N/A,0,en

Modeling Transport Phenomena in Porous Media with Applications,"Malay K. Das, Partha P. Mukherjee, K. Muralidhar",Springer,2017-11-21,"This book is an ensemble of six major chapters, an introduction, and a closure on modeling transport phenomena in porous media with applications. Two of the six chapters explain the underlying theories, whereas the rest focus on new applications. Porous media transport is essentially a multi-scale process. Accordingly, the related theory described in the second and third chapters covers both continuum‐ and meso‐scale phenomena. Examining the continuum formulation imparts rigor to the empirical porous media models, while the mesoscopic model focuses on the physical processes within the pores. Porous media models are discussed in the context of a few important engineering applications. These include biomedical problems, gas hydrate reservoirs, regenerators, and fuel cells. The discussion reveals the strengths and weaknesses of existing models as well as future research directions.",Technology & Engineering,250,N/A,0,en

"So Many, So Much, So Far, So Fast","James K. Matthews, Cora J. Holt",CreateSpace,2013-04-03,"Strategic mobility, the capability to transport military forces rapidly across intercontinental distances into an operational theater, lies at the heart of US military strategy. Nowhere has the importance of strategic mobility been more evident than in Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, the military response to the Iraqi seizure of Kuwait that began in August 1990 and ended in March 1991. This study presents a detailed analysis of how the Defense Transportation System (DTS)--the United States Transportation Command, its service components, and the civilian transportation industry--provided the strategic mobility that enabled the United States and its allies to assemble an overwhelming military force to defeat Iraq and free Kuwait. It is also a tribute to the hard work and dedication of the military and civilian personnel who ran the DTS during the operation.",History,344,N/A,0,en

A Framework for K-12 Science Education,"National Research Council, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Board on Science Education, Committee on a Conceptual Framework for New K-12 Science Education Standards",National Academies Press,2012-02-28,"Science, engineering, and technology permeate nearly every facet of modern life and hold the key to solving many of humanity's most pressing current and future challenges. The United States' position in the global economy is declining, in part because U.S. workers lack fundamental knowledge in these fields. To address the critical issues of U.S. competitiveness and to better prepare the workforce, A Framework for K-12 Science Education proposes a new approach to K-12 science education that will capture students' interest and provide them with the necessary foundational knowledge in the field. A Framework for K-12 Science Education outlines a broad set of expectations for students in science and engineering in grades K-12. These expectations will inform the development of new standards for K-12 science education and, subsequently, revisions to curriculum, instruction, assessment, and professional development for educators. This book identifies three dimensions that convey the core ideas and practices around which science and engineering education in these grades should be built. These three dimensions are: crosscutting concepts that unify the study of science through their common application across science and engineering; scientific and engineering practices; and disciplinary core ideas in the physical sciences, life sciences, and earth and space sciences and for engineering, technology, and the applications of science. The overarching goal is for all high school graduates to have sufficient knowledge of science and engineering to engage in public discussions on science-related issues, be careful consumers of scientific and technical information, and enter the careers of their choice. A Framework for K-12 Science Education is the first step in a process that can inform state-level decisions and achieve a research-grounded basis for improving science instruction and learning across the country. The book will guide standards developers, teachers, curriculum designers, assessment developers, state and district science administrators, and educators who teach science in informal environments.",Education,400,N/A,0,en

Transportation Labor Issues and Regulatory Reform,"James Peoples, Wayne K Talley",Elsevier,2004-11-08,"Regulatory reform in the late 1970s and early 1980s vastly transformed the labor market for transportation workers. Most research in this area focuses on the effect of deregulation on the earnings of nonmanagement company workers in airline, trucking and rail. Deregulation of transportation industries, though, has had a broader effect on workers. For instance, deregulation also influences workers' hours worked per week, working conditions, worker safety, and a host of other labor issues. Deregulation might also influence the earnings of managers and self-employed workers in transportation industries. Examining these issues is valuable because such analysis provides a more complete assessment of labor market changes following the shift to a more market oriented business environment. Transportation Labor Issues and Regulatory Reform adds to the debate on deregulation's influence on transportation labor markets by presenting empirical evidence on an array of labor market outcomes in transportation industries.

Taking Science to School,"National Research Council, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Center for Education, Board on Science Education, Committee on Science Learning, Kindergarten Through Eighth Grade",National Academies Press,2007-04-16,"What is science for a child? How do children learn about science and how to do science? Drawing on a vast array of work from neuroscience to classroom observation, Taking Science to School provides a comprehensive picture of what we know about teaching and learning science from kindergarten through eighth grade. By looking at a broad range of questions, this book provides a basic foundation for guiding science teaching and supporting students in their learning. Taking Science to School answers such questions as: When do children begin to learn about science?

"Transport and Structural Formation in Plasmas,","Kimitaka Itoh, Sanae I Itoh, Atsushi Fukuyama",CRC Press,1999-01-01,"This monograph, the latest in the IOP Plasma Physics Series, written by three of the most senior and internationally respected Japanese fusion scientists, presents a self-consistent picture of turbulent transport, structural formation and transitions-processes that are typical of the physics of many far from equilibrium systems such as exist in magnetically confined and inhomogeneous plasmas. The Author's view is that the plasma structure, fluctuations and turbulent transport are continually regulating each other and, in addition, that the structural formation and structural transition of plasmas are typical of the physics of far from equilibrium systems. The book presents and explains why the plasma inhomogeneity is the ordering parameter governing transport and how self-sustained fluctuations can be driven through subcritical excitation even beyond linear stability. In addition, the authors derive the non-linear gradient-flux relation with the result that asymmetry arising from the fluctuations allows mixing of the various kinds of fluxes. This emphasises the ever important role that electromagnetic fields play in inducing long range interactions, couplings and bifurcations in plasmas. To illustrate, a transport simulation of a high temperature current fusion experiment like JET-the Joint European Torus-helps us to understand various structural formations such as the H-mode. With the insight that structural formation in high temperature plasmas is fundamental to an accurate description of the basic phenomena that occur in our present cosmos, the authors provide a comprehensive account of the subject to help fusion researchers, fluid dynamicists and astrophysicists alike. The book addresses a key to understanding the age old question of what has occurred in the early stage of the our universe and what is likely to occur in the final stage of our universe.",Plasma dynamics,0,N/A,0,en

Successful K-12 STEM Education,"National Research Council, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Board on Testing and Assessment, Board on Science Education, Committee on Highly Successful Schools or Programs for K-12 STEM Education",National Academies Press,2011-06-22,"Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are cultural achievements that reflect our humanity, power our economy, and constitute fundamental aspects of our lives as citizens, consumers, parents, and members of the workforce. Providing all students with access to quality education in the STEM disciplines is important to our nation's competitiveness. However, it is challenging to identify the most successful schools and approaches in the STEM disciplines because success is defined in many ways and can occur in many different types of schools and settings. In addition, it is difficult to determine whether the success of a school's students is caused by actions the school takes or simply related to the population of students in the school. Successful K-12 STEM Education defines a framework for understanding ""success"" in K-12 STEM education. The book focuses its analysis on the science and mathematics parts of STEM and outlines criteria for identifying effective STEM schools and programs. Because a school's success should be defined by and measured relative to its goals, the book identifies three important goals that share certain elements, including learning STEM content and practices, developing positive dispositions toward STEM, and preparing students to be lifelong learners. A successful STEM program would increase the number of students who ultimately pursue advanced degrees and careers in STEM fields, enhance the STEM-capable workforce, and boost STEM literacy for all students. It is also critical to broaden the participation of women and minorities in STEM fields. Successful K-12 STEM Education examines the vast landscape of K-12 STEM education by considering different school models, highlighting research on effective STEM education practices, and identifying some conditions that promote and limit school- and student-level success in STEM. The book also looks at where further work is needed to develop appropriate data sources. The book will serve as a guide to policy makers; decision makers at the school and district levels; local, state, and federal government agencies; curriculum developers; educators; and parent and education advocacy groups.",Education,44,N/A,0,en

Surpassing the coverage available in existing gerontology textbooks, it enables the reader to understand and appreciate the challenges faced by older adults as they make the transition from driving to using transportation options (many of which were not designed to meet their particular needs). It considers the physical and cognitive limitations of older adult passengers, the family of transportation services, the challenges providers face in meeting the assistance and support needs of senior passengers, and the transportation methods that do and do not currently meet the needs and wants of senior passengers. This textbook addresses the educational and professional development needs of faculty, students, and practitioners working in the fields of aging, aging services, and transportation. The book has been class-tested and features innovative, practical learning tools that appeal to students and practitioners.

Institutional Architectures to Improve Systems Operations and Management,,Transportation Research Board,2012,"""The objective of this research was to undertake a comprehensive and systematic examination of the way agencies should be organized to successfully execute operations programs that improve travel time reliability. The following types of questions were examined at the outset of this research: How does operations fit into a transportation agency's overall program? What changes can be made in agency culture and training to promote operations? Which local and regional public agencies and private-sector organizations are essential to the various aspects of operations? Are there emerging technologies, systems, or organizational structures that can be used to advance intra-agency and interagency communications and therefore operations? The research addressed a large number of topics concerning organizational and institutional approaches that could enhance highway operations and travel time reliability. The most fruitful investigation was identification of the Capability Maturity Model, used extensively in the information technology field for organizational self-assessment and continuous improvement of quality and reliability. The researchers recognized that a version of the Capability Maturity Model could be developed and applied to highway operations and in turn travel time reliability. Elements defining different levels of maturity include culture/leadership, organization and staffing, resource allocation, and partnerships.""--Publisher's description.",Organizational effectiveness,98,N/A,0,en

Granville T. Woods,David L. Head,Rosedog Press,2013,"It began one quiet autumn evening during November of 1996. At home, David Head was viewing the PBS documentary Transportation in America and he noticed the film made no mention of African American contributions. But as chairman of the Black History Committee for Transport Workers Union Local 100, he knew there was much to share. At that moment Head determined his new purpose in life would be to share the extraordinary life and legacy of Granville T. Woods. After twelve years in pursuit of this goal, David Head has accomplished a great deal for his cause: - Metropolitan Transportation Authority Sponsorship of 2004 Subway Centennial Granville T. Woods Commemorative Exhibit - 4 million Granville T. Woods Commemorative Metro Cards (2 million in Spanish) - 2009: Brooklyn Street renamed ""Granville T. Woods Way"" - 2009: Figure 8, the world's first electric roller coaster created by Woods was inducted into the Coney Island Hall of Fame - 2010: Transit News Telly Award for GTW documentary - 2012: Granville T. Woods: African American Communication and Transportation Pioneer, an illustrated book for young readers, highlighting Woods' struggles and achievements, was published With his many successes, and realizing the impact he could have on others, Head decided to pursue his goals within an educational framework as well by: - Showcasing Woods' inspirational life and amazing innovative abilities - Revealing the purpose behind teaching the life and accomplishments of Woods, and his significant contributions to our American Society - Encouraging youth to cultivate their own talents, to stay in school and seek higher education, to discern their abilities and pursue them as Woods did In the spirit of Granville T. Woods and his life of invention, Head is now spearheading a major effort to increase the participation of urban youth in the fields of science and technology. By integrating field trips and practical experience with his S.T.E.M. program classroom curriculum, youth will be motivated and guided in an innovative approach to comtemporary challenges. With this goal in mind, careers in science and technology will be encouraged and given direction.",Biography & Autobiography,142,N/A,0,en

Transport Phenomena Fundamentals,Joel L. Plawsky,CRC Press,2020-02-27,"The fourth edition of Transport Phenomena Fundamentals continues with its streamlined approach to the subject, based on a unified treatment of heat, mass, and momentum transport using a balance equation approach. The new edition includes more worked examples within each chapter and adds confidence-building problems at the end of each chapter. Some numerical solutions are included in an appendix for students to check their comprehension of key concepts. Additional resources online include exercises that can be practiced using a wide range of software programs available for simulating engineering problems, such as, COMSOL®, Maple®, Fluent, Aspen, Mathematica, Python and MATLAB®, lecture notes, and past exams. This edition incorporates a wider range of problems to expand the utility of the text beyond chemical engineering. The text is divided into two parts, which can be used for teaching a two-term course. Part I covers the balance equation in the context of diffusive transport—momentum, energy, mass, and charge. Each chapter adds a term to the balance equation, highlighting that term's effects on the physical behavior of the system and the underlying mathematical description. Chapters familiarize students with modeling and developing mathematical expressions based on the analysis of a control volume, the derivation of the governing differential equations, and the solution to those equations with appropriate boundary conditions. Part II builds on the diffusive transport balance equation by introducing convective transport terms, focusing on partial, rather than ordinary, differential equations. The text describes paring down the full, microscopic equations governing the phenomena to simplify the models and develop engineering solutions, and it introduces macroscopic versions of the balance equations for use where the microscopic approach is either too difficult to solve or would yield much more information that is actually required. The text discusses the momentum, Bernoulli, energy, and species continuity equations, including a brief description of how these equations are applied to heat exchangers, continuous contactors, and chemical reactors. The book introduces the three fundamental transport coefficients: the friction factor, the heat transfer coefficient, and the mass transfer coefficient in the context of boundary layer theory. Laminar flow situations are treated first followed by a discussion of turbulence. The final chapter covers the basics of radiative heat transfer, including concepts such as blackbodies, graybodies, radiation shields, and enclosures.",Science,863,N/A,0,en

It contains a detailed discussion of modern analytic methods for the solution of fluid mechanics and heat and mass transfer problems, focusing on approximations based on scaling and asymptotic methods, beginning with the derivation of basic equations and boundary conditions and concluding with linear stability theory. Also covered are unidirectional flows, lubrication and thin-film theory, creeping flows, boundary layer theory, and convective heat and mass transport at high and low Reynolds numbers. The emphasis is on basic physics, scaling and nondimensionalization, and approximations that can be used to obtain solutions that are due either to geometric simplifications, or large or small values of dimensionless parameters. The author emphasizes setting up problems and extracting as much information as possible short of obtaining detailed solutions of differential equations.

Some point to near-term macro-economic benefits and job creation, others focus on long-term effects on productivity and economic growth. This volume explores the links between infrastructure spending and economic outcomes, as well as key economic issues in the funding and management of infrastructure projects. It draws together research studies that describe the short-run stimulus effects of infrastructure spending, develop new estimates of the stock of U.S. infrastructure capital, and explore the incentive aspects of public-private partnerships (PPPs). A salient issue is the treatment of risk in evaluating publicly-funded infrastructure projects and in connection with PPPs.

This tJ:llrd edition contains over three hundred additional entries as well as major ai~erations to over fifty of them. Transportation continues to change into a market driven industry. The user side reflects market- and management-driven emphases that would have been labeled as pure fiction just a decade ago. Some of these changes are: • Deregulation • Purchasing evolving closer to logistics and having greater roles in with traffic • Logistics having close association with production, scheduling, and related areas • Computers and electronic links becoming major parts of the traffic/ transportation/purchasing landscape • Greater international corporate orientations • Need for logistics flexibility regarding pro-action in the face of energy, interest cost, inflation, international competition, and other major environmental forces • Increased roles of non-economic regulations and policies In addition to the changes in the transport-traffic management interface, the shipper side of the world has extended to be linked with such titles and functions as materials, distribution, warehousing, inventory, customer service, order entry, planning, production scheduling, and in many cases purchasing.

Fundamentals of Transportation Systems Analysis,Marvin L. Manheim,Mit Press,1979-06,"Transportation systems analysis is a multidisciplinary field which draws on engineering, economics, operations research, political science, psychology, management, and other disciplines. The major text synthesizes from these fields an approach that is intellectually coherent and comprehensive. Numerous details are provided to indicate how major concepts can be applied in practice to particular modes and problems. But the major objective of this book is to provide the reader with a basic framework onto which many different areas of specialization can be added by later coursework and practical experience. Fundamentals of Transportation Systems Analysis identifies concepts that are truly fundamental to serious work in the planning, design, or management of transportation systems. It also emphasizes, through more detailed treatment, certain topics, such as transportation demand and performance and the processes of evaluation and choice, that are inadequately treated in the available literature. A unique feature of the book is its emphasis on multimodal solutions to transportation problems. The student is taught to view the transportation system as a unified whole and to evaluate it within the context of the overall social, economic, and political system of a given region. According to Professor Manheim, ""The challenge of transportation systems analysis is to intervene, delicately and deliberately, in the complex fabric of a society to use transport effectively, in coordination with other public and private actions, to achieve the goals of that society.""",Architecture,658,N/A,0,en

The King's Best Highway,Eric Jaffe,Simon and Schuster,2010-06-22,"A VIVID AND FASCINATING LOOK AT AMERICAN HISTORY THROUGH THE PRISM OF THE COUNTRY’S MOST STORIED HIGHWAY, THE BOSTON POST ROAD During its evolution from Indian trails to modern interstates, the Boston Post Road, a system of over-land routes between New York City and Boston, has carried not just travelers and mail but the march of American history itself. Eric Jaffe captures the progress of people and culture along the road through four centuries, from its earliest days as the king of England’s “best highway” to the current era. Centuries before the telephone, radio, or Internet, the Boston Post Road was the primary conduit of America’s prosperity and growth. News, rumor, political intrigue, financial transactions, and personal missives traveled with increasing rapidity, as did people from every walk of life. From post riders bearing the alarms of revolution, to coaches carrying George Washington on his first presidential tour, to railroads transporting soldiers to the Civil War, the Boston Post Road has been essential to the political, economic, and social development of the United States. Continuously raised, improved, rerouted, and widened for faster and heavier traffic, the road played a key role in the advent of newspapers, stagecoach travel, textiles, mass-produced bicycles and guns, commuter railroads, automobiles—even Manhattan’s modern grid. Many famous Americans traveled the highway, and it drew the keen attention of such diverse personages as Benjamin Franklin, Franklin D. Roosevelt, P. T. Barnum, J. P. Morgan, and Robert Moses. Eric Jaffe weaves this entertaining narrative with a historian’s eye for detail and a journalist’s flair for storytelling. A cast of historical figures, celebrated and unknown alike, tells the lost tale of this road. Revolutionary printer William Goddard created a postal network that united the colonies against the throne. General Washington struggled to hold the highway during the battle for Manhattan. Levi Pease convinced Americans to travel by stagecoach until, half a century later, Nathan Hale convinced them to go by train. Abe Lincoln, still a dark-horse candidate in early 1860, embarked on a railroad speaking tour along the route that clinched the presidency. Bomb builder Lester Barlow, inspired by the Post Road’s notorious traffic, nearly sold Congress on a national system of expressways twenty-five years before the Interstate Highway Act of 1956. Based on extensive travels of the highway, interviews with people living up and down the road, and primary sources unearthed from the great libraries between New York City and Boston—including letters, maps, contemporaneous newspapers, and long-forgotten government documents—The King’s Best Highway is a delightful read for American history buffs and lovers of narrative everywhere.",History,434,N/A,0,en

Substeading,"Kyle M. Kirschling, Raymond C. Niles",Kirschling & Niles,N/A,"Imagine if getting to the airport were as easy as riding an elevator, if trains were as clean and comfortable as a limousine, if it took half as long to get anywhere in the city. In this paper, we show how Substeading (underground homesteading) can achieve this within a generation. In addition to proposing a new legal technology, we present specific projects that would be profitable today, despite high tunneling costs. Radically improved urban transportation would greatly improve our quality of life and standard of living, and substeading would achieve this. Substeading is homesteading underground; it is a legal process that would allow new privately owned corridors to be brought into productive use from the unused subsurface. Substeading is economically powerful, based on proven technology, and could transform big cities in a generation. It would create brand-new and conveniently-located rights-of-way, ideal for new urban transportation networks and other infrastructure. This would pave the way for bigger and better cities by nurturing new construction and infrastructure technologies and by eroding regulatory obstacles to new development. Substeading is also politically practical because it has minimal environmental impacts, requires no government funding, and doesn’t use eminent domain.",Business & Economics,34,5,2,en

That means that the national oil addiction and all its consequences, from climate change to disastrous spills to dependence on foreign markets, can be greatly reduced by changing the way we move. In Transport Beyond Oil, leading experts in transportation, planning, development, and policy show how to achieve this fundamental shift. The authors demonstrate that smarter development and land-use decisions, paired with better transportation systems, can slash energy consumption. John Renne calculates how oil can be saved through a future with more transit-oriented development. Petra Todorovitch examines the promise of high-speed rail. Peter Newman imagines a future without oil for car-dependent cities and regions. Additional topics include funding transit, freight transport, and nonmotorized transportation systems. Each chapter provides policy prescriptions and their measurable results. Transport Beyond Oil delivers practical solutions, based on quantitative data.

The photography also includes the Jamestown Settlement re-creation of the Discovery, one of the three ships that brought America's first permanent English colonists to Virginia in 1607, and a few other water transports. The text describes how early American transportation began with an almost an exclusive reliance on water, how horses became indispensable once they arrived, and how trails were eventually widened into roads to accommodate the carts, wagons, and carriages that became a critical part of social and economic growth in early America""--Provided by publisher.",Inland water transportation,0,N/A,0,en

Analysis of Transport Phenomena,William Murray Deen,"Oxford University Press, USA",2012,"Analysis of Transport Phenomena, Second Edition, provides a unified treatment of momentum, heat, and mass transfer, emphasizing the concepts and analytical techniques that apply to these transport processes. The second edition has been revised to reinforce the progression from simple to complex topics and to better introduce the applied mathematics that is needed both to understand classical results and to model novel systems. A common set of formulation, simplification, and solution methods is applied first to heat or mass transfer in stationary media and then to fluid mechanics, convective heat or mass transfer, and systems involving various kinds of coupled fluxes. FEATURES: * Explains classical methods and results, preparing students for engineering practice and more advanced study or research * Covers everything from heat and mass transfer in stationary media to fluid mechanics, free convection, and turbulence * Improved organization, including the establishment of a more integrative approach * Emphasizes concepts and analytical techniques that apply to all transport processes * Mathematical techniques are introduced more gradually to provide students with a better foundation for more complicated topics discussed in later chapters",Chemical engineering,0,N/A,0,en

The Transportation Experience,"William L. Garrison, David M. Levinson",Oxford University Press,2014-02-07,"The Transportation Experience explores the historical evolution of transportation modes and technologies. The book traces how systems are innovated, planned and adapted, deployed and expanded, and reach maturity, where they may either be maintained in a polished obsolesce often propped up by subsidies, be displaced by competitors, or be reorganized and renewed. An array of examples supports the idea that modern policies are built from past experiences. William Garrison and David Levinson assert that the planning (and control) of nonlinear, unstable processes is today's central transportation problem, and that this is universal and true of all modes. Modes are similar, in that they all have a triad structure of network, vehicles, and operations; but this framework counters conventional wisdom. Most think of each mode as having a unique history and status, and each is regarded as the private playground of experts and agencies holding unique knowledge, operating in isolated silos. However, this book argues that while modes have an appearance of uniqueness, the same patterns repeat: systems policies, structures, and behaviors are a generic design on varying modal cloth. In the end, the illusion of uniqueness proves to be myopic. While it is true that knowledge has accumulated from past experiences, the heavy hand of these experiences places boundaries on current knowledge; especially on the ways professionals define problems and think about processes. The Transportation Experience provides perspective for the collections of models and techniques that are the essence of transportation science, and also expands the boundaries of current knowledge of the field.",Technology & Engineering,634,N/A,0,en

What's the Use of Walking If There's a Freight Train Going Your Way?,"Paul Garon, Gene Tomko",Charles Kerr,2006,"Another wonderful slice of history, political, cultural, and social history. Better yet, it comes 'illustrated' with a CD, with 25 original recordings. Plus, of course, the work is full of the lyrics, art, and photographs of people, and their times. The music and poetry of black workers in motion - hoboing, hitchhiking, timbering, mining, railroading, loving, leaving, fighting back and searcing for a new job, a new life and even a new world are brilliantly recorded and explained in this arresting collection. [David Roediger] Paul Garon has produced yet another masterpiece of cultural history. The stories and songs he gathers together in this remarkable book disrupt common notions of what we mean by 'freedom' when it comes to black folk. Hoboes represented a significant segment of the black working class, and their constant movements were both evidence of constraints and acts of freedom. And as he so eloquently demonstrates, the men and women who took to the road and their bards have much to teach us about America's 'bottom rail.' [Robin D G Kelley]",History,312,N/A,0,en
Mass-transport Deposits in Deepwater Settings,"R. Craig Shipp, Paul Weimer, Henry W. Posamentier",SEPM Soc for Sed Geology,2011,"Historically, submarine-mass failures or mass-transport deposits have been a focus of increasingly intense investigation by academic institutions particularly during the last decade, though they received much less attention by geoscientists in the energy industry. With recent interest in expanding petroleum exploration and production into deeper water-depths globally and more widespread availability of high-quality data sets, mass-transport deposits are now recognized as a major component of most deep-water settings. This recognition has lead to the realization that many aspects of these deposits are still unknown or poorly understood. This volume contains twenty-three papers that address a number of topics critical to further understanding mass-transport deposits. These topics include general overviews of these deposits, depositional settings on the seafloor and in the near-subsurface interval, geohazard concerns, descriptive outcrops, integrated outcrop and seismic data/seismic forward modeling, petroleum reservoirs, and case studies on several associated topics. This volume will appeal to a broad cross section of geoscientists and geotechnical engineers, who are interested in this rapidly expanding field. The selection of papers in this volume reflects a growing trend towards a more diverse blend of disciplines and topics, covered in the study of mass-transport deposits.",Science,532,N/A,0,en

Electrical Transport in Nanoscale Systems,Massimiliano Di Ventra,Cambridge University Press,2008-08-07,"In recent years there has been a huge increase in the research and development of nanoscale science and technology. Central to the understanding of the properties of nanoscale structures is the modeling of electronic conduction through these systems. This graduate textbook provides an in-depth description of the transport phenomena relevant to systems of nanoscale dimensions. In this textbook the different theoretical approaches are critically discussed, with emphasis on their basic assumptions and approximations. The book also covers information content in the measurement of currents, the role of initial conditions in establishing a steady state, and the modern use of density-functional theory. Topics are introduced by simple physical arguments, with particular attention to the non-equilibrium statistical nature of electrical conduction, and followed by a detailed formal derivation. This textbook is ideal for graduate students in physics, chemistry, and electrical engineering.",Science,477,5,1,en

The Love Hypothesis,Ali Hazelwood,Penguin,2021-09-14,"The Instant New York Times Bestseller and TikTok Sensation! As seen on THE VIEW! A BuzzFeed Best Summer Read of 2021 When a fake relationship between scientists meets the irresistible force of attraction, it throws one woman's carefully calculated theories on love into chaos. As a third-year Ph.D. candidate, Olive Smith doesn't believe in lasting romantic relationships—but her best friend does, and that's what got her into this situation. Convincing Anh that Olive is dating and well on her way to a happily ever after was always going to take more than hand-wavy Jedi mind tricks: Scientists require proof. So, like any self-respecting biologist, Olive panics and kisses the first man she sees. That man is none other than Adam Carlsen, a young hotshot professor—and well-known ass. Which is why Olive is positively floored when Stanford's reigning lab tyrant agrees to keep her charade a secret and be her fake boyfriend. But when a big science conference goes haywire, putting Olive's career on the Bunsen burner, Adam surprises her again with his unyielding support and even more unyielding...six-pack abs. Suddenly their little experiment feels dangerously close to combustion. And Olive discovers that the only thing more complicated than a hypothesis on love is putting her own heart under the microscope.",Fiction,401,4.5,2,en

Clean Disruption of Energy and Transportation,Tony Seba,Tony Seba,2014-06-27,"The industrial age of energy and transportation will be over by 2030. Maybe before. Exponentially improving technologies such as solar, electric vehicles, and autonomous (self-driving) cars will disrupt and sweep away the energy and transportation industries as we know it. The same Silicon Valley ecosystem that created bit-based technologies that have disrupted atom-based industries is now creating bit- and electron-based technologies that will disrupt atom-based energy industries. Clean Disruption projections (based on technology cost curves, business model innovation as well as product innovation) show that by 2030: - All new energy will be provided by solar or wind. - All new mass-market vehicles will be electric. - All of these vehicles will be autonomous (self-driving) or semi-autonomous. - The new car market will shrink by 80%. - Even assuming that EVs don't kill the gasoline car by 2030, the self-driving car will shrink the new car market by 80%. - Gasoline will be obsolete. Nuclear is already obsolete. - Up to 80% of highways will be redundant. - Up to 80% of parking spaces will be redundant. - The concept of individual car ownership will be obsolete. - The Car Insurance industry will be disrupted. The Stone Age did not end because we ran out of rocks. It ended because a disruptive technology ushered in the Bronze Age. The era of centralized, command-and-control, extraction-resource-based energy sources (oil, gas, coal and nuclear) will not end because we run out of petroleum, natural gas, coal, or uranium. It will end because these energy sources, the business models they employ, and the products that sustain them will be disrupted by superior technologies, product architectures, and business models. This is a technology-based disruption reminiscent of how the cell phone, Internet, and personal computer swept away industries such as landline telephony, publishing, and mainframe computers. Just like those technology disruptions flipped the architecture of information and brought abundant, cheap and participatory information, the clean disruption will flip the architecture of energy and bring abundant, cheap and participatory energy. Just like those previous technology disruptions, the Clean Disruption is inevitable and it will be swift.",Business & Economics,379,N/A,0,en

The Future of Transportation,Henry Grabar,N/A,2019-11-19,"With the promise of delivery drones, personal helicopters and groceries delivered right to your refrigerator, one might think we are living in the best of transportation times. However, most city commuters would be quick to tell you otherwise. Of all the technological interventions continuously inserted into our daily travels, which ones will last? Is ride-sharing here to stay? In ten years will we all be taking autonomous vehicles to work? Will traffic as we know it cease to exist? While this volume makes no promises or predictions, it does take a step back from the hype of the new to explore more of the options from what might seem like yesterday?s solutions: busses, bikes and even trains. Perhaps remedies to our transportation woes are not all in the future but are hiding in plain and present site. 00'The Future of Transportation' is the third volume in the 'SOM Thinkers' series, conceived by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. 'SOM Thinkers' originated from a desire to start a public conversation about the built environment. Rather than frame the subject in the expected ?professional? language, the series poses today?s most pressing questions about design and architecture in a bold and accessible way.",Architecture,124,N/A,0,en
Railway Transportation in South Asia,"Saptarshi Mitra, Sumana Bandyopadhyay, Stabak Roy, Tomaz Ponce Dentinho",Springer Nature,2021-08-20,"This book discusses policy instruments for sustainable infrastructure developments. Railways are one of the most important developmental instruments of a region, province, or country. They play a crucial role in economic development, urban growth, urban mobility, regional susceptibility, market integration, and world trade. Railways are an integral part of regional and urban development, both in terms of freight and passenger transport. By offering case studies from various regions and cities in South Asia, this book examines the evolution of railway transportation and the impact of these infrastructure projects on regional and urban development. It examines the interactions between evolving infrastructures and competing demands and considers the negative and positive externalities of railway transportation for people, places, and locations. The contributions analyze issues such as network infrastructure planning and technological development, passenger mobility and satisfaction, vulnerability to environmental impacts, and cross-border trade.",Business & Economics,344,N/A,0,en

Byron Bird, Warren E. Stewart, Edwin N. Lightfoot, and Daniel Klingenberg is a new introductory textbook based on the classic Bird, Stewart, Lightfoot text, Transport Phenomena. The authors’ goal in writing this book reflects topics covered in an undergraduate course. Some of the rigorous topics suitable for the advanced students have been retained. The text covers topics such as: the transport of momentum; the transport of energy and the transport of chemical species. The organization of the material is similar to Bird/Stewart/Lightfoot, but presentation has been thoughtfully revised specifically for undergraduate students encountering these concepts for the first time.

The Fleet at Flood Tide,James D. Hornfischer,Bantam,2016-10-25,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • The extraordinary story of the World War II air, land, and sea campaign that brought the U.S. Navy to the apex of its strength and marked the rise of the United States as a global superpower Winner, Commodore John Barry Book Award, Navy League of the United States • Winner, John Lehman Distinguished Naval Historian Award, Naval Order of the United States With its thunderous assault on the Mariana Islands in June 1944, the United States crossed the threshold of total war. In this tour de force of dramatic storytelling, distilled from extensive research in newly discovered primary sources, James D. Hornfischer brings to life the campaign that was the fulcrum of the drive to compel Tokyo to surrender—and that forever changed the art of modern war. With a close focus on high commanders, front-line combatants, and ordinary people, American and Japanese alike, Hornfischer tells the story of the climactic end of the Pacific War as has never been done before. Here are the epic seaborne invasions of Saipan, Tinian, and Guam, the stunning aerial battles of the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot, the first large-scale use of Navy underwater demolition teams, the largest banzai attack of the war, and the daring combat operations large and small that made possible the strategic bombing offensive culminating in the atomic strikes on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. From the seas of the Central Pacific to the shores of Japan itself, The Fleet at Flood Tide is a stirring, authoritative, and cinematic portrayal of World War II’s world-changing finale. Illustrated with original maps and more than 120 dramatic photographs “Quite simply, popular and scholarly military history at its best.”—Victor Davis Hanson, author of Carnage and Culture “The dean of World War II naval history . . . In his capable hands, the story races along like an intense thriller. . . . Narrative nonfiction at its finest—a book simply not to be missed.”—James M. Scott, Charleston Post and Courier “An impressively lucid account . . . admirable, fascinating.”—The Wall Street Journal “An extraordinary memorial to the courageous—and a cautionary note to a world that remains unstable and turbulent today.”—Admiral James Stavridis, former Supreme Allied Commander, NATO, author of Sea Power “A masterful, fresh account . . . ably expands on the prior offerings of such classic naval historians as Samuel Eliot Morison.”—The Dallas Morning News",History,689,N/A,0,en

Automated Fare Collection System & Urban Public Transportation,Clifford N. Opurum,Trafford Publishing,2012-03-06,"With its unique features (presented in nine chapters grouped into five major parts), Automated Fare Collection System And Urban Public Transit: An Economic & Management Approach To Urban Transit Systems provides a wealth of resourceful information to everyone with interest in mass transit: Part I: Public Transportation, Urban Economy And Automation in Fare Collection Part II: Models of Transportation Pricing Part III: Transportation Research Methods And Models Part IV: Approaches And Trends in Urban Transit Ridership Part V: Epilogue In these parts of the book, Clifford N. Opurum reveals the impact of the automated fare collection system on mass transit and particularly, on the New York City rail rapid transit system. Various effective urban public transportation pricing techniques are presented. Transportation research methods and models including the alogit model and different approaches to transportation research analysis are featured. Alternative scenarios of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) are used extensively along with other feasibility studies strategies to determine the economic and social benefits of the automated fare collection system. The author concludes that as in the case of other industrial sectors, the financial health of the transit industry is very much dependent upon the level of transit patronage, and that automation in fare collection has further encouraged the later. Furthermore, he added that automated fare collection (AFC) is preferred over the mechanical system of fare collection and will make positive impact on both transit ridership and revenue, if efficiently operated. Finally, he stressed that society would be better off financially if the benefits of automation in transit fare collection are fully utilized, and that automation in fare collection has indeed influenced the travel pattern of most mass transit patrons.",Business & Economics,409,N/A,0,en

Transportation of Hazardous Materials,"Leon N. Moses, Dan Lindstrom",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Leon N. Moses In June 1991, the Transportation Center at Northwestern University sponsored Hazmat Transport '91: A National Conference on the Transportation of Hazardous Materials and Wastes. The faculty associated with the center were aware that there had been many professional, industrial and government conferences and meetings on the subject. However, they believed that the unique capacity of the Transportation Center to bring together leaders from industry and government, as well as leading scholars from economics, law, engineering, psychology and sociology who have done research on the problems associated with the transportation of hazardous materials and wastes (hazmats), could produce a set of integrated insights and understandings that would go well beyond those of previous conferences. The papers that make up this volume were all delivered at Hazmat Transport '91. From a legislative point of view, they tend to deal with issues associated with the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975 (HMTA), the original act passed to regulate the transportation of hazardous materials, and the Hazardous Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act of 1990 (HMTVSA). There were talks and papers presented at the conference that focused on other recent legislation and transportation issues with which HMTUSA does not deal. The conference proceedings volume also had discussions and papers on significant managerial and regulatory issues that could not be included in this volume because of constraints on its size. Therefore, this essay is made up of three parts.",Business & Economics,354,N/A,0,en

BASICS OF DISTRIBUTION MANAGEMENT,"SATISH K. KAPOOR, PURVA KANSAL",PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.,2003-01-01,"Physical Distribution is a distinct but integral part of business logistics, involving all those activities relating to the physical movement of goods from the factory to the consumer. Recently, the concept has been expanded to supply chain management which enables better customer relationship with smooth supply of goods. This introductory text is focused on the essential concepts, tools and strategies that comprise Distribution Management. It emphasizes the idea that distribution management is an effective marketing strategy and a potent competitive tool. Defining the concept of physical distribution in the initial chapter, the book then describes in detail the objectives, functions and components of all the activity centres of physical distribution in the Indian context, from a systems approach. An exclusive chapter is devoted to transportation functions, highlighting the features of interstate movement of goods and the legal procedures related to them. Sufficient coverage is also given to related topics such as distribution control, performance evaluation and organization of physical distribution, besides the 'trade-off' concept.

Cities and Mobility & Transportation,"Pascual Berrone, Joan Enric Ricart Costa, Ana Duch T-Figueras",Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2016-07-13,"Mobility is a key dimension of cities. As urbanization accelerates, the demand for mobility and transportation escalates. This booming demand stresses the existing urban transportation systems and infrastructures, intensifies widespread congestion and traffic gridlock, increases road accidents, and augments CO2 emissions and air and noise pollution, which is starting to cause serious health concerns.How will our current transport systems cope with this rising demand for mobility in cities? How can city planners and mayors around the world come up with strategies and solutions that enhance sustainable and integrated urban transportation systems? What is the future of urban mobility?This volume is part of a book series called ""IESE Cities in Motion: International urban best practices.""Cities and Mobility & Transportation focuses on how to address the mobility challenge in cities. It aims to be: - an insightful analysis of the main urban mobility and transportation trends and challenges- a collection of international best practices on sustainable urban mobility- an instrument to help city managers and policymakers solve the urban mobility challenge and improve accessibility in cities for the benefit of all.",Residential mobility,0,N/A,0,en

The Wheels That Drove New York,"Roger P. Roess, Gene Sansone",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-08-23,"The Wheels That Drove New York tells the fascinating story of how a public transportation system helped transform a small trading community on the southern tip of Manhattan island to a world financial capital that is home to more than 8,000,000 people. From the earliest days of horse-drawn conveyances to the wonders of one of the world's largest and most efficient subways, the story links the developing history of the City itself to the growth and development of its public transit system. Along the way, the key role of played by the inventors, builders, financiers, and managers of the system are highlighted. New York began as a fur trading outpost run by the Dutch West India Company, established after the discovery and exploration of New York Harbor and its great river by Henry Hudson. It was eventually taken over by the British, and the magnificent harbor provided for a growing center of trade. Trade spurred industry, initially those needed to support the shipping industry, later spreading to various products for export. When DeWitt Clinton built the Erie Canal, which linked New York Harbor to the Great Lakes, New York became the center of trade for all products moving into and out of the mid-west. As industry grew, New York became a magnate for immigrants seeking refuge in a new land of opportunity. The City's population continued to expand. Both water and land barriers, however, forced virtually the entire population to live south of what is now 14th Street. Densities grew dangerously, and brought both disease and conflict to the poorer quarters of the Five Towns. To expand, the City needed to conquer land and water barriers, primarily with a public transportation system. By the time of the Civil War, the City was at a breaking point. The horse-drawn public conveyances that had provided all of the public transportation services since the 1820's needed to be replaced with something more effective and efficient. First came the elevated railroads, initially powered by steam engines. With the invention of electricity and the electric traction motor, the elevated's were electrified, and a trolley system emerged. Finally, in 1904, the City opened its first subway. From there, the City's growth to northern Manhattan and to the ""outer boroughs"" of Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx exploded. The Wheels That Drove New York takes us through the present day, and discusses the many challenges that the transit system has had to face over the years. It also traces the conversion of the system from fully private operations (through the elevated railways) to the fully public system that exists today, and the problems that this transformation has created along the way.",Technology & Engineering,441,N/A,0,en

From a Nickel to a Token,Andrew J. Sparberg,Fordham Univ Press,2014-11-03,"A fascinating micro-history of NYC’s subway system from LaGuardia’s public works achievements in 1940 to the creation of the MTA in 1968. In 1940, New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia realized an ambitious plan to modernize the city’s public transit. He eliminated streetcars, demolished old elevated lines, and unified the subway systems. From then on, the IRT, BMT, and IND became one system under public control. And by 1968, that system had transformed again, into the Metropolitan Transit Authority. From LaGuardia to Lindsay, mayors were desperate to appease voters, elected officials, transit management, and labor leaders. Meanwhile, the tumult of a changing America manifested in labor disputes, economic pressures, and civil rights protests. Though great efforts were made to keep prices down, the sacred nickel fare barrier was eventually broken. By 1968, a ride cost twenty cents. Featuring many photos never before published, From a Nickel to a Token deftly captures four decades and five boroughs of grit, chaos, egos, and emotions in the unending saga of New York’s subway system.",Political Science,316,N/A,0,en

International Developments Towards Improved Car-sharing Services,Bodo Schwieger,Writersworld Limited,2004,"The main topic of this book is the introduction of a new mobility service: One-Way and Open-End car-sharing. Dr. Bodo Schwieger describes a process starting from the anticipation and measurement of customer's needs to the introduction of innovative services. The described field test is second to none, as it offers gasoline vehicles in a One-Way rental scheme within an urban environment: 25 Smart vehicles were based at 8 stations and available to 4,000 car-sharing customers. This service is being analyzed for efficiency and customer reactions. In a second step, other car-sharing companies in Hamburg (Germany), Seattle (Washington), Kyoto and Tokyo (Japan) are analyzed for their approaches to improving their services. combines technological competence, marketing know-how and customer analysis. Car-sharing has recently become a highly relevant topic with the fast expansion of the American providers and the market entry of Deutsche Bahn AG and Shell AG in Germany. The method respects the large amount of interdependence with other services and also the multiplicity of different customer groups. Thus it can be transferred to other (transportation) services - and used as a beginner's guide to service analysis. The book is based on the author's dissertation, which was accepted at the Technical University of Berlin in 2003. It delivers, on 150 pages, densely accumulated information. It is worth reading for anyone who is involved in introducing and developing new services, either within transportation or in related branches.",Business & Economics,164,N/A,0,en

Gridlock,Randal O'Toole,Cato Institute,2010-01-18,"America is the most mobile society in history, but our transportation system is on the verge of collapse. Traffic congestion is today five times greater than it was 25 years ago, yet many transportation plans and projects are making it worse. As Randal O’Toole reveals in Gridlock, the prime causes of our ailing system are a government transportation planning philosophy whose primary goal is to diminish auto use—hence, personal mobility—in combination with federal budget incentives that perversely encourage transportation planners to increase congestion. As a result, the automobile which is accessible to almost every family in the nation and provides unparalleled access to better housing, low-cost consumer goods, a choice-driven affordable life, and freedom—is being deliberately forced off the transportation grid by the expensive “solution” of little-used high-speed trains and urban transit lines. Gridlock presents a wide range of innovative ideas and policy recommendations for creating an effective transportation system—improvements that will increase our mobility and pay for themselves, whether it’s cars, buses, planes, or trains. At the center of O’Toole’s solutions are three core principles: those who use transportation facilities should pay for them; negative effects should be dealt with in a cost-efficient manner; and new technologies that will increase mobility at a low cost must be embraced. In Gridlock, Randal O’Toole brings energetic and unconventional thinking to transportation strategies that have, until now, only driven us into the breakdown lane.",Political Science,292,N/A,0,en

Planning as if People Matter,"Marc Brenman, Thomas W. Sanchez",Island Press,2012-08-16,"American communities are changing fast: ethnic minority populations are growing, home ownership is falling, the number of people per household is going up, and salaries are going down. According to Marc Brenman and Thomas W. Sanchez, the planning field is largely unprepared for these fundamental shifts. If planners are going to adequately serve residents of diverse ages, races, and income levels, they need to address basic issues of equity. Planning as if People Matter offers practical solutions to make our communities more livable and more equitable for all residents. While there are many books on environmental justice, relatively few go beyond theory to give real-world examples of how better planning can level inequities. In contrast, Planning as if People Matter is written expressly for planning practitioners, public administrators, policy-makers, activists, and students who must directly confront these challenges. It provides new insights about familiar topics such as stakeholder participation and civil rights. And it addresses emerging issues, including disaster response, new technologies, and equity metrics. Far from an academic treatment, Planning as if People Matter is rooted in hard data, on-the-ground experience, and current policy analysis. In this tumultuous period of economic change, there has never been a better time to reform the planning process. Brenman and Sanchez point the way toward a more just social landscape.",Architecture,220,N/A,0,en

Triumphs such as the Vincent Thomas Bridge and Mac Barnes's Ground Link buspool have existed alongside such flops as the Santa Monica Freeway Diamond Lane and the Oxnard-Los Angeles Caltrain commuter rail. The City of Angels lacks a propeller-driven monorail and a freeway in the paved bed of the Los Angeles River, but not for a lack of public promoters. Horace Dobbins built the elevated California Cycleway in Pasadena, and Mike Kadletz deployed the Pink Buses for Orange County kids hitchhiking to the beach. Join Charles P.

The Right to Transportation,Thomas Sanchez,Routledge,2018-05-04,"Does transportation affect the lives of minority, low-income, elderly, and physically disabled citizens? The answer is yes, and those effects can be profound, according to The Right to Transportation. The authors argue that transportation policies can limit access to education, jobs, and services for some individuals while undermining the economy and social cohesion of entire communities. Policies that have nurtured the U.S. highway system and let public transportation wither have also led to ghettos and social isolation. More and more communities are recognizing the problem. This book explains the strategies and policies that can address inequities in the nation's transportation and transportation planning systems so that the benefits and burdens of those systems can be shared equally across all communities. With a close examination of how transportation policies affect individuals and communities, the book is a guide to transportation fairness. It explains the demographic trends, historical events, and current policies that have shaped transportation in the U.S. and offers recommendations for moving to equity.",Architecture,280,5,1,en

The text also explores how we can create sustainable cities for the future. In contrast to the ""compact city"", which has been proposed as an environmentally friendly urban model, recent years have seen an acceleration in the introduction of ICT-based ""smart city"". As people’s lives are drastically changed by COVID-19, a new form of city is being explored. The new concept of a ""smart sharing city"" is introduced as an urban model that wisely integrates physical and cyber space, and presents a way to solve future urban issues with new technologies.",Technology & Engineering,174,N/A,0,en
Transport,Phillip Peterson,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2016-09-24,"""Transport? Transport to where, Sir?"" ""Possibly straight to hell."" Who will live? Who will die? An alien object is discovered off the coast of California; a sphere that transports people to other solar systems. Death-row inmate Russell Harris and nine other convicts are given the chance to save their own lives by agreeing to travel as test subjects on the transporter. But when the first volunteer dies a gruesome death, it becomes clear to Russell and his comrades that the venture is little more than a merciless death mission on which they will all perish. Their only chance of survival is to uncover the secret of the mysterious object, but that too seems hopeless - because no trace of the transporter's constructors can be found.",,266,N/A,0,en
Public Transport Planning with Smart Card Data,"Fumitaka Kurauchi, Jan-Dirk Schmöcker",CRC Press,2017-02-17,"Collecting fares through ""smart cards"" is becoming standard in most advanced public transport networks of major cities around the world. Travellers value their convenience and operators the reduced money handling fees. Electronic tickets also make it easier to integrate fare systems, to create complex time and space differentiated fare systems, and to provide incentives to specific target groups. A less-utilised benefit is the data collected through smart cards. Records, even if anonymous, provide for a much better understanding of passengers’ travel behaviour as current literature shows. This information can also be used for better service planning. Public Transport Planning with Smart Card Data handles three major topics: how passenger behaviour can be estimated using smart card data, how smart card data can be combined with other trip databases, and how the public transport service level can be better evaluated if smart card data is available. The book discusses theory as well as applications from cities around the world and will be of interest to researchers and practitioners alike who are interested in the state-of-the-art as well as future perspectives that smart card data will bring.",Political Science,275,N/A,0,en
Transportation and the Environment,Gabriela Ionescu,CRC Press,2017-03-03,"This title includes a number of Open Access chapters. This new book takes a nuanced look at building a sustainable transportation infrastructure and provides an overview of the harmful effect of various modes of transportation on the environment. The environmental impact of transportation is significant. Transportation is a major user of energy, it burns most of the world's petroleum, and is the fastest-growing contributor to carbon dioxide emissions. Although environmental regulations in many countries have reduced the individual vehicle's emissions, this has been offset by an increase in vehicles on the road and airways.",Nature,269,N/A,0,en

Means of Transportation and Registration of Nationality,Vincent P. Cogliati-Bantz,Routledge,2015-05-22,"This book examines the concept of nationality of means of transportation in terms of jurisdiction in international law. It reassesses the definition of nationality and explores how it is conferred. The book first places nationality in the broader perspective of jurisdiction in international law, and examines the historical development and necessity of the nationality of means of transportation. It goes on to investigate whether and under which conditions international organizations may confer a ‘nationality’ on means of transportation, examining the law of the sea conventions and air and space treaties. The book finally explores several questions relating to international registration of means of transportation, building a regime of international registration. Vincent Cogliati-Bantz introduces a necessary distinction between transport internationally registered and transport registered in a State but fulfilling a mission for an international organization. As a work that proposes the ability for international organisations to access international spaces without reliance on State-registered means of transport, this book will be of great use and interest to scholars and students of public international law, international organisations, and maritime, space, and aviation law.",Law,304,N/A,0,en
Autonomous and Integrated Parking and Transportation Services,Amalendu Chatterjee,CRC Press,2019-11-08,"In this book, the author outlines a Robust Web Parking, Truck and Transportation Portal (RWPTTP) for integrating parking and transportation services – a revolutionary approach in contrast to incremental change for managing traffic congestion. Autonomous vehicle technology, artificial intelligence, internet of things (IOT), and other interconnected hardware and software tools will assist autonomous parking and transportation services and provide next-century infrastructure for consolidated transportation customer services. The book highlights currently available autonomous parking and transportation technologies, and the development of an integrated and intelligent transportation service/system (IITS) platform, with specific use of technologies to reconfigure the transportation industry. The author also suggests many regulatory and policy changes to simplify data collection, traffic operation, introduction of a duplicate transportation system using light rail (LRs) and high speed rail (SPRs), and redistribution of parking spaces along such routes, using renewable energy.",Business & Economics,277,N/A,0,en
Intelligent Transportation Systems,Paolo Pagano,CRC Press,2016-12-01,"Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) are the way forward for sustainable growth of mobility at all levels (local, regional, national, transnational).

It includes connected (and autonomous) cars and buses, real-world large-scale field trials, data analysis and assessment of technological solutions. Standards and normative aspects in the domain of Electronic Fee Collection and Cooperative Systems oriented to probe data collection, safety and non-safety critical applications in vehicular networks, are studied. The book provides the rational, perspectives, and technical issues for the implementation of ITS solutions in a genuine inter-modal scenario, taking the example of a Mediterranean seaport, actively involved in testing and validation of ITS standards. The novelty of this book is that it covers R&D, standards, and pilots, all under one cover. Rather than stressing the novelty in ICT, the authors have presented the need for system-level integration, assessment of existing (standard) solutions, and piloting experiments in real-world industrial scenarios.",Science,156,N/A,0,en

Making Connections,Margaret Walsh,Routledge,2017-05-15,"This book argues that legal persuasion results from making and breaking mental connections. To support this argument, it follows a cognitive science roadmap while the authors road test the directions through rhetorical analysis. By taking a rhetorical approach to persuasion, the authors are able to integrate research from cognitive science with classical and contemporary rhetorical theory, and then to apply both to the taking apart and the putting together of effective legal arguments. The combination of rhetorical analysis and cognitive science yields a new way of seeing and understanding legal persuasion, one that promises theoretical and practical gains. The work has three main functions. First, it brings together the leading models of persuasion from cognitive science and rhetorical theory, blurring boundaries and leverage connections between the often-separate spheres of science and rhetoric. Second, it illustrates this persuasive synthesis by working through concrete examples of persuasion from real-life legal contexts. In this way, the book demonstrates the advantages of a deeper and more nuanced understanding of persuasion. Third, the volume assesses and explains why, how, and when certain persuasive methods and techniques are more effective than others. The book is designed to appeal to scholars in law, rhetoric, persuasion science, and psychology; to students learning the practice of law; and to judges and practicing lawyers who engage in persuasion.",Law,224,N/A,0,en

Communicating Mobility and Technology,Ehren Helmut Pflugfelder,Routledge,2016-07-07,"Winner of the 2018 CCCC Technical and Scientific Communication Award in the category of Best Book in Technical or Scientific Communication Responding to the effects of human mobility and crises such as depleting oil supplies, Ehren Helmut Pflugfelder turns specifically to automobility, a term used to describe the kinds of mobility afforded by autonomous, automobile-based movement technologies and their ramifications. Thus far, few studies in technical communication have explored the development of mobility technologies, the immense power that highly structured, environmentally significant systems have in the world, or the human-machine interactions that take place in such activities. Applying kinaesthetic rhetoric, a rhetoric that is sensitive to and developed from the mobile, material context of these technologies, Pflugfelder looks at transportation projects such as electric taxi cabs from the turn of the century to modern day, open-source vehicle projects, and a large case study of an autonomous, electric pod car network that ultimately failed. Kinaesthetic rhetoric illuminates how mobility technologies have always been persuasive wherever and whenever linguistic symbol systems and material interactions enroll us, often unconsciously, into regimes of movement and ways of experiencing the world. As Pflugfelder shows, mobility technologies involve networks of sustained arguments that are as durable as the bonds between the actors in their networks.",Language Arts & Disciplines,281,N/A,0,en

Creating Sustainable Community Programs,Mark R. Daniels,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2001-02-28,"Public opinion polls consistently reveal the lack of confidence, disillusionment, and mistrust that citizens feel toward government. Daniels and his contributors believe that the relationship between citizens and their governments can be changed by facilitating greater citizen collaboration with government, particularly through local sustainable programs. As the case studies show, often sustainable community programs are created through grassroots movements that are initiated and managed by citizens themselves, bringing them in contact with their local elected and appointed officials. Unlike traditional programs that are administered by local officials on behalf of their citizens, once sustainable community programs are created, citizens administer their own programs in collaboration with local officials. The case studies look at a variety of sustainable programs, primarily in the United States, that help to deal with issues such as recycling, transportation, microcredit, site redevelopment, pollution, health care, and hunger. Creating Sustainable Community Programs is the first book on sustainable programs that is intended for an audience of public administration scholars, researchers, and students as well as practitioners who are searching for ways to change the relationship between citizens and their governments.",Political Science,316,N/A,0,en

Public Transport Planning and Management in Developing Countries,"Ashish Verma, T.V. Ramanayya",CRC Press,2014-12-17,"Developing Countries Have Different Transportation Issues and Requirements Than Developed Countries An efficient transportation system is critical for a country’s development. Yet cities in developing countries are typically characterized by high-density urban areas and poor public transport, as well as lack of proper roads, parking facilities, road user discipline, and control of land use, resulting in pollution, congestion, accidents, and a host of other transportation problems. Public Transport Planning and Management in Developing Countries examines the status of urban transport in India and other developing countries. It explains the principles of public transport planning and management that are relevant and suitable for developing countries, addresses current transportation system inefficiencies, explores the relationship between mobility and accessibility, and analyzes the results for future use. Considers Socioeconomic and Demographic Characteristics It’s projected that by 2030, developing nations will have more vehicles than developed nations, and automated guided transit (AGT) and other transport systems will soon be available in India. This text compares five cities using specific indicators—urbanization, population growth, vehicle ownership, and usage. It determines demographic and economic changes in India, and examines how these changes have impacted transportation demand and supply, transport policy and regulations, and aspects of economics and finance related to public transport. The authors emphasize preserving and improving existing modes, efficient use of the public transport management infrastructure, implementing proper planning measures, and encouraging a shift towards sustainable modes. They also discuss sustainability in terms of environment, energy, economic, and land use perspectives and consider the trends of motorization, vehicle growth, modal share, effects on mobility and environment, and transport energy consumption and emissions.

Banishment in the Early Atlantic World,"Peter Rushton, Gwenda Morgan",A&amp;C Black,2013-06-20,"Banishing troublesome and deviant people from society was common in the early modern period. Many European countries removed their paupers, convicted criminals, rebels and religious dissidents to remote communities or to their colonies where they could be simultaneously punished and, perhaps, contained and reformed. Under British rule, poor Irish, Scottish Jacobites, English criminals, Quakers, gypsies, Native Americans, the Acadian French in Canada, rebellious African slaves, or vulnerable minorities like the Jews of St. Eustatius, were among those expelled and banished to another place. This book explores the legal and political development of this forced migration, focusing on the British Atlantic world between 1600 and 1800. The territories under British rule were not uniform in their policies, and not all practices were driven by instructions from London, or based on a clear legal framework. Using case studies of legal and political strategies from the Atlantic world, and drawing on accounts of collective experiences and individual narratives, the authors explore why victims were chosen for banishment, how they were transported and the impact on their lives. The different contexts of such banishment – internal colonialism ethnic and religious prejudice, suppression of religious or political dissent, or the savageries of war in Europe or the colonies – are examined to establish to what extent displacement, exile and removal were fundamental to the early British Empire.",History,319,N/A,0,en

Metropolitan Transportation Planning,"Reid Ewing, Keith Bartholomew",Routledge,2018,"Planning at a metropolitan scale is important for effective management of urban growth, transportation systems, air quality, and watershed and green-spaces. It is fundamental to efforts to promote social justice and equity. Best Practices in Metropolitan Transportation Planning shows how the most innovative metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) in the United States are addressing these issues using their mandates to improve transportation networks while pursuing emerging sustainability goals at the same time. As both a policy analysis and a practical how-to guide, this book presents cutting-edge original research on the role accessibility plays - and should play - in transportation planning, tracks how existing plans have sought to balance competing priorities using scenario planning and other strategies, assesses the results of various efforts to reduce automobile dependence in cities, and explains how to make planning documents more powerful and effective. In highlighting the most innovative practices implemented by MPOs, regional planning councils, city and county planning departments and state departments of transportation, this book aims to influence other planning organizations, as well as influence federal and state policy discussions and legislation.",Architecture,260,N/A,0,en
The Great Neighborhood Book,"Jay Walljasper, Project for Public Spaces (PPS)",New Society Publishers,2007-06-01,"Abandoned lots and litter-strewn pathways, or rows of green beans and pockets of wildflowers? Graffiti-marked walls and desolate bus stops, or shady refuges and comfortable seating? What transforms a dingy, inhospitable area into a dynamic gathering place? How do individuals take back their neighborhood? Neighborhoods decline when the people who live there lose their connection and no longer feel part of their community. Recapturing that sense of belonging and pride of place can be as simple as planting a civic garden or placing some benches in a park. The Great Neighborhood Book explains how most struggling communities can be revived, not by vast infusions of cash, not by government, but by the people who live there. The author addresses such challenges as traffic control, crime, comfort and safety, and developing economic vitality. Using a technique called ""placemaking""-- the process of transforming public space -- this exciting guide offers inspiring real-life examples that show the magic that happens when individuals take small steps, and motivate others to make change. This book will motivate not only neighborhood activists and concerned citizens but also urban planners, developers and policy-makers.",Social Science,191,N/A,0,en

The salesmanship behind the ""driverless future"" is distracting us from better ways to get around that we can implement now. Unlike autonomous vehicles, these alternatives are inexpensive, safe, sustainable, and inclusive. Norton takes the reader on an engaging ride--from the GM Futurama exhibit to ""smart"" highways and vehicles--to show how we are once again being sold car dependency in the guise of mobility.

Bike Lanes Are White Lanes,Melody L Hoffmann,U of Nebraska Press,2016-07-01,"The number of bicyclists is increasing in the United States, especially among the working class and people of color. In contrast to the demographics of bicyclists in the United States, advocacy for bicycling has focused mainly on the interests of white upwardly mobile bicyclists, leading to neighborhood conflicts and accusations of racist planning. In Bike Lanes Are White Lanes, scholar Melody L. Hoffmann argues that the bicycle has varied cultural meaning as a “rolling signifier.” That is, the bicycle’s meaning changes in different spaces, with different people, and in different cultures. The rolling signification of the bicycle contributes to building community, influences gentrifying urban planning, and upholds systemic race and class barriers. In this study of three prominent U.S. cities—Milwaukee, Portland, and Minneapolis—Hoffmann examines how the burgeoning popularity of urban bicycling is trailed by systemic issues of racism, classism, and displacement. From a pro-cycling perspective, Bike Lanes Are White Lanes highlights many problematic aspects of urban bicycling culture and its advocacy as well as positive examples of people trying earnestly to bring their community together through bicycling.",Social Science,208,N/A,0,en

The Just City,Susan S. Fainstein,Cornell University Press,2011-05-16,"For much of the twentieth century improvement in the situation of disadvantaged communities was a focus for urban planning and policy. Yet over the past three decades the ideological triumph of neoliberalism has caused the allocation of spatial, political, economic, and financial resources to favor economic growth at the expense of wider social benefits. Susan Fainstein's concept of the ""just city"" encourages planners and policymakers to embrace a different approach to urban development. Her objective is to combine progressive city planners' earlier focus on equity and material well-being with considerations of diversity and participation so as to foster a better quality of urban life within the context of a global capitalist political economy. Fainstein applies theoretical concepts about justice developed by contemporary philosophers to the concrete problems faced by urban planners and policymakers and argues that, despite structural obstacles, meaningful reform can be achieved at the local level. In the first half of The Just City, Fainstein draws on the work of John Rawls, Martha Nussbaum, Iris Marion Young, Nancy Fraser, and others to develop an approach to justice relevant to twenty-first-century cities, one that incorporates three central concepts: diversity, democracy, and equity. In the book's second half, Fainstein tests her ideas through case studies of New York, London, and Amsterdam by evaluating their postwar programs for housing and development in relation to the three norms. She concludes by identifying a set of specific criteria for urban planners and policymakers to consider when developing programs to assure greater justice in both the process of their formulation and their effects.",Social Science,225,N/A,0,en

Bicycle Justice and Urban Transformation,"Aaron Golub, Melody L. Hoffmann, Adonia E. Lugo, Gerardo F. Sandoval",Routledge,2016-07-15,"As bicycle commuting grows in the United States, the profile of the white, middle-class cyclist has emerged. This stereotype evolves just as investments in cycling play an increasingly important role in neighborhood transformations. However, despite stereotypes, the cycling public is actually quite diverse, with the greatest share falling into the lowest income categories. Bicycle Justice and Urban Transformation demonstrates that for those with privilege, bicycling can be liberatory, a lifestyle choice, whereas for those surviving at the margins, cycling is not a choice, but an often oppressive necessity. Ignoring these ""invisible"" cyclists skews bicycle improvements towards those with choices. This book argues that it is vital to contextualize bicycling within a broader social justice framework if investments are to serve all street users equitably. ""Bicycle justice"" is an inclusionary social movement based on furthering material equity and the recognition that qualitative differences matter. This book illustrates equitable bicycle advocacy, policy and planning. In synthesizing the projects of critical cultural studies, transportation justice and planning, the book reveals the relevance of social justice to public and community-driven investments in cycling. This book will interest professionals, advocates, academics and students in the fields of transportation planning, urban planning, community development, urban geography, sociology and policy.",Business & Economics,294,N/A,0,en

Langum Sr. Prize in American Legal History Winner of the Berkshire Conference of Women Historians Book Prize “From traffic stops to parking tickets, Seo traces the history of cars alongside the history of crime and discovers that the two are inextricably linked.” —Smithsonian When Americans think of freedom, they often picture the open road. Yet nowhere are we more likely to encounter the long arm of the law than in our cars. Sarah Seo reveals how the rise of the automobile led us to accept—and expect—pervasive police power, a radical transformation with far-reaching consequences. Before the twentieth century, most Americans rarely came into contact with police officers. But in a society dependent on cars, everyone—law-breaking and law-abiding alike—is subject to discretionary policing. Seo challenges prevailing interpretations of the Warren Court’s due process revolution and argues that the Supreme Court’s efforts to protect Americans did more to accommodate than limit police intervention. Policing the Open Road shows how the new procedures sanctioned discrimination by officers, and ultimately undermined the nation’s commitment to equal protection before the law. “With insights ranging from the joy of the open road to the indignities—and worse—of ‘driving while black,’ Sarah Seo makes the case that the ‘law of the car’ has eroded our rights to privacy and equal justice...Absorbing and so essential.” —Paul Butler, author of Chokehold “A fascinating examination of how the automobile reconfigured American life, not just in terms of suburbanization and infrastructure but with regard to deeply ingrained notions of freedom and personal identity.” —Hua Hsu, New Yorker",History,353,N/A,0,en

The Court-Martial of Mother Jones,Edward M. Steel,University Press of Kentucky,2021-11-21,"In March 1913, labor agitator Mary Harris ""Mother"" Jones and forty-seven other civilians were tried by a military court on charges of murder and conspiracy to murder—charges stemming from violence that erupted during the long coal miners' strike in the Paint Creek and Cabin Creek areas of Kanawha County, West Virginia. Immediately after the trial, some of the convicted defendants received conditional pardons, but Mother Jones and eleven others remained in custody until early May. This arrest and conviction came in the latter years of Mother Jones's long career as a labor agitator. Eighty-one and feisty as ever, she was able to focus national attention on the miners' cause and on the governor's tactics for handling the dispute. Over the course of seven months, more than two hundred civilians were tried by courts-martial. Only during the Civil War and Reconstruction had the courts been used so extensively against private citizens, and the trial raised a number of civil rights issues. The national outcry over Mother Jones's imprisonment led the United States Senate to appoint a subcommittee to examine mining conditions in West Virginia—the first Senate subcommittee ever appointed to investigate a labor controversy. Public sentiment eventually forced a release of the prisoners and brought about a settlement of the strike. In the face of this overwhelmingly adverse publicity, the governor suppressed publication of the trial transcript, and it was long thought to have been destroyed. Edward M. Steel Jr., an authority on Mother Jones, uncovered the trial proceedings while searching for Jones's manuscripts amid private papers at the West Virginia and Regional Collection. This volume makes available for the first time the transcript of this landmark case in labor and legal history, including an introduction that provides background on the issues involved.",Law,478,N/A,0,en

His mother long gone, his father recently deceased, and the family farm foreclosed upon by the bank, Emmett's intention is to pick up his eight-year-old brother, Billy, and head to California where they can start their lives anew. But when the warden drives away, Emmett discovers that two friends from the work farm have hidden themselves in the trunk of the warden's car. Together, they have hatched an altogether different plan for Emmett's future, one that will take them all on a fateful journey in the opposite direction—to the City of New York. Spanning just ten days and told from multiple points of view, Towles's third novel will satisfy fans of his multi-layered literary styling while providing them an array of new and richly imagined settings, characters, and themes. “Once again, I was wowed by Towles’s writing—especially because The Lincoln Highway is so different from A Gentleman in Moscow in terms of setting, plot, and themes. Towles is not a one-trick pony. Like all the best storytellers, he has range. He takes inspiration from famous hero’s journeys, including The Iliad, The Odyssey, Hamlet, Huckleberry Finn, and Of Mice and Men. He seems to be saying that our personal journeys are never as linear or predictable as an interstate highway. But, he suggests, when something (or someone) tries to steer us off course, it is possible to take the wheel.” – Bill Gates",Fiction,593,N/A,0,en

The Structure and Transport of the Brazil Current Between 27[degrees] and 36[degrees] South,Jan Campbell Zemba,N/A,1991,"A set of four hydrographic sections through the Brazil Current are analyzed to identify downstream changes in the Brazil Current. The data, from the Thomas Washington Marathon Cruise, Leg 9, are at 27, 31, 34 and 36°S. The region they span details the change of the current from a relatively small near surface feature to a large, deep current. While the Brazil Current does not appear to develop transports as large as those found in the Gulf Stream, the calculated transports greatly exceed previous estimates. At 27°S the current extends down to approximately 700 m and transports 12 Sv southward; this value is consistent with previous estimates farther north. Downstream, surface layer transport increases, the current deepens, and the transport reaches a maximum of 80 Sv at 36°S. Part of the growth comes from the tight recirculation found just offshore of the Brazil Current. The recirculation strengthens and deepens to the south, with a minimum transport of 4 Sv north at 27°S and a maximum of 33 Sv at 36°S. The change in the current is also reflected in its shear profiles. At 27°S Brazil Current shear is found only in the upper portion of the water column, over the continental slope. Downstream, the current moves off the slope into deeper water and develops top-to-bottom, monotonic shear. To obtain velocity from the shear profiles, zero velocity surfaces are chosen based on conservative use of tracer information. A simple basin-wide model is used at 31°S to tie limits on the size of the Brazil Current and recirculation to various limits on layer-to-layer exchanges south of the section. The multi-layer model - based on changes in depth of several isotherms is used to extend the interpretation of the current beyond that of an isolated ocean feature. The model is required to conserve mass in each layer, either by applying barotropic transports or by allowing layer-to-layer exchanges south of the section. Solutions are deemed acceptable if the sense, or direction, of the various layer-to-layer conversions are consistent with accepted ideas of water mass formation. Initially, a two layer model is employed. Governed by the conservation of mass in each layer, the two layer model has only one constraint on the resulting solutions: a conversion of cold-to-warm water in the south (or the surface layer flowing north and the deep layer flowing south). Such a meridional flow pattern is consistent with the equatorward heat flux in the South Atlantic. The single constraint, however, is not strong enough to limit the solution region in any significant way. The final model presented has four layers, and acceptable solutions have the net transports of the surface layer and the bottom water northward and form intermediate water from North Atlantic Deep Water in the south. The resulting solution set has a fairly small range of transports for the Brazil Current, with surface layer transports between 20 and 35 Sv; this range is consistent with the value calculated from hydrographic data at 31°S. Given the complex interleavings of the South Atlantic water masses, the four layer model performs remarkably well. Finally, total potential vorticity is calculated from the hydrographic sections. Contrary to what one might expect, the reference level choice is not a significant problem: where currents are large, most of the signal in relative potential vorticity comes from the measured shear, and where currents are small, the relative potential vorticity is not significant compared to the planetary vorticity. Unfortunately, the process of taking two horizontal derivatives of the density field results in a jittery relative potential vorticity signal. As a result, a clear potential vorticity profile could not be constructed for the current. This variablitiy may be real -the ocean is frequently much noisier than one imagines. It may also be possible, though, to smooth the data sufficiently so that a cleaner picture emerges. Despite the problems involved in obtaining a quantitative profile of the potential vorticity, qualitative changes are useful in detecting different flow regimes. By comparing the downstream changes in total and planetary potential vorticity, one can deduce frictional and inertial regimes in the different layers. The presence of a frictional regime at the inshore edge suggests that care should be taken in assuming that potential vorticity is conserved in western boundary currents. In addition the potential vorticity sections trace a pattern of the recirculation feeding into the Brazil Current in the upper layers; other tracers did not provide a clear image. The final picture which emerges is not of a small, surface-trapped Brazil Current; rather, it is that of a classic western boundary current, increasing in strength and depth before turning east into the interior ocean.",Brazil Current,556,N/A,0,en

A Piece of the World,Christina Baker Kline,HarperCollins,2017-02-21,"INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER ""A must-read for anyone who loves history and art.” --Kristin Hannah From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of the smash bestseller Orphan Train, a stunning and atmospheric novel of friendship, passion, and art, inspired by Andrew Wyeth’s mysterious and iconic painting Christina’s World. ""Later he told me that he’d been afraid to show me the painting. He thought I wouldn’t like the way he portrayed me: dragging myself across the field, fingers clutching dirt, my legs twisted behind. The arid moonscape of wheatgrass and timothy. That dilapidated house in the distance, looming up like a secret that won’t stay hidden."" To Christina Olson, the entire world was her family’s remote farm in the small coastal town of Cushing, Maine. Born in the home her family had lived in for generations, and increasingly incapacitated by illness, Christina seemed destined for a small life. Instead, for more than twenty years, she was host and inspiration for the artist Andrew Wyeth, and became the subject of one of the best known American paintings of the twentieth century. As she did in her beloved smash bestseller Orphan Train, Christina Baker Kline interweaves fact and fiction in a powerful novel that illuminates a little-known part of America’s history. Bringing into focus the flesh-and-blood woman behind the portrait, she vividly imagines the life of a woman with a complicated relationship to her family and her past, and a special bond with one of our greatest modern artists. Told in evocative and lucid prose, A Piece of the World is a story about the burdens and blessings of family history, and how artist and muse can come together to forge a new and timeless legacy.",Fiction,223,N/A,0,en

The Nine Hundred,"Heather Dune Macadam, Caroline Moorehead",Hachette UK,2020-01-23,"'Books such as this are essential: they remind modern readers of events that should never be forgotten' - Caroline Moorehead On March 25, 1942, nearly a thousand young, unmarried Jewish women boarded a train in Poprad, Slovakia. Filled with a sense of adventure and national pride, they left their parents' homes wearing their best clothes and confidently waving good-bye. Believing they were going to work in a factory for a few months, they were eager to report for government service. Instead, the young women-many of them teenagers-were sent to Auschwitz. Their government paid 500 Reichsmarks (about £160) apiece for the Nazis to take them as slave labour. Of those 999 innocent deportees, only a few would survive. The facts of the first official Jewish transport to Auschwitz are little known, yet profoundly relevant today. These were not resistance fighters or prisoners of war. There were no men among them. Sent to almost certain death, the young women were powerless and insignificant not only because they were Jewish-but also because they were female. Now, acclaimed author Heather Dune Macadam reveals their poignant stories, drawing on extensive interviews with survivors, and consulting with historians, witnesses, and relatives of those first deportees to create an important addition to Holocaust literature and women's history.",History,343,N/A,0,en

Mega-Projects,"Alan A. Altshuler, David E. Luberoff",Rowman & Littlefield,2004-05-13,"A Brookings Institution Press and Lincoln Institute of Land Policy publication Since the demise of urban renewal in the early 1970s, the politics of large-scale public investment in and around major American cities has received little scholarly attention. In Mega-Projects, Alan Altshuler and David Luberoff analyze the unprecedented wave of large-scale (mega-) public investments that occurred in American cities during the 1950s and 1960s; the social upheavals they triggered, which derailed large numbers of projects during the late 1960s and early 1970s; and the political impulses that have shaped a new generation of urban mega-projects in the decades since. They also appraise the most important consequences of policy shifts over this half-century and draw out common themes from the rich variety of programmatic and project developments that they chronicle. The authors integrate narratives of national as well as state and local policymaking, and of mobilization by (mainly local) project advocates, with a profound examination of how well leading theories of urban politics explain the observed realities. The specific cases they analyze include a wide mix of transportation and downtown revitalization projects, drawn from numerous regions—most notably Boston, Denver, Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, Portland, and Seattle. While their original research focuses on highway, airport, and rail transit programs and projects, they draw as well on the work of others to analyze the politics of public investment in urban renewal, downtown retailing, convention centers, and professional sports facilities. In comparing their findings with leading theories of urban and American politics, Altshuler and Luberoff arrive at some surprising findings about which perform best and also reveal some important gaps in the literature as a whole. In a concluding chapter, they examine the potential effects of new fiscal pressures, business mobilization to relax environmental constraints, and security concerns in the wake of September 11. And they make clear their own views about how best to achieve a balance between developmental, environmental, and democratic values in public investment decisionmaking. Integrating fifty years of urban development history with leading theories of urban and American politics, Mega-Projects provides significant new insights into urban and intergovernmental politics.",Business & Economics,356,2,1,en

Megacity Mobility,"Zongzhi Li, Adrian T. Moore, Samuel R. Staley",CRC Press,2021-12-14,"World population growth and economic prosperity have given rise to ever-increasing demands on cities, transportation planning, and goods movement. This growth, coupled with a slower pace of transportation capacity expansion and deteriorated facility restoration, has led to rapid changes in the transportation planning and policy environment. These stresses are particularly acute for megacities where degradation of mobility and facility performance have reached alarming rates. Addressing these transportation challenges requires innovative solutions. Megacity Mobility grapples with these challenges by addressing transportation policy, planning, and facilities in a multimodal context. It discusses innovative short- and long-term solutions for meeting current and future mobility needs for the world’s most dynamic cities by addressing the influence of urban land use on mobility, 3D spiderweb transportation planning, travel demand management, multimodal transportation with flexible capacity, efficient capacity utilization driven by new technologies, innovative transportation funding and financing, and performance-based budget allocation using asset management principles. It discusses emerging issues, highlights potential challenges affecting proposed solutions, and provides policymakers, planners, and transportation professionals a road map to achieving sustainable mobility in the 21st century.

Cadmium in Soils and Plants,"M.J. McLaughlin, B.R. Singh",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Over forty years ago, concern was first focussed on cadmium contamination of soils, fertilisers and the food chain. Adverse effects on human health were first highlighted nearly 30 years ago in Japan with the outbreak of Itai-itai disease. Since then, substantial research data have accumulated for cadmium on chemistry in soils, additions to soils, uptake by plants, adverse effects on the soil biota and transfer through the food chain. However, this information has never been compiled into a single volume. This was the stimulus for the Kevin G. Tiller Memorial Symposium ""Cadmium in Soils, Plants and the Food Chain"", held at the University of California, Berkeley, in June 1997 as part of the Fourth International Conference on the Biogeochemistry of Trace Elements. This symposium brought together leading scientists in the field of cadmium behaviour in soils and plants, to review the scientific data in the literature and highlight gaps in our current knowledge of the subject. This series of review papers are presented here and deal with the chemistry of cadmium in soils, the potential for transfer through the food chain and management to minimise this problem.

Manufacturing Morals,Michel Anteby,University of Chicago Press,2013-08-28,"Corporate accountability is never far from the front page, and as one of the world’s most elite business schools, Harvard Business School trains many of the future leaders of Fortune 500 companies. But how does HBS formally and informally ensure faculty and students embrace proper business standards? Relying on his first-hand experience as a Harvard Business School faculty member, Michel Anteby takes readers inside HBS in order to draw vivid parallels between the socialization of faculty and of students. In an era when many organizations are focused on principles of responsibility, Harvard Business School has long tried to promote better business standards. Anteby’s rich account reveals the surprising role of silence and ambiguity in HBS’s process of codifying morals and business values. As Anteby describes, at HBS specifics are often left unspoken; for example, teaching notes given to faculty provide much guidance on how to teach but are largely silent on what to teach. Manufacturing Morals demonstrates how faculty and students are exposed to a system that operates on open-ended directives that require significant decision-making on the part of those involved, with little overt guidance from the hierarchy. Anteby suggests that this model—which tolerates moral complexity—is perhaps one of the few that can adapt and endure over time. Manufacturing Morals is a perceptive must-read for anyone looking for insight into the moral decision-making of today’s business leaders and those influenced by and working for them.",Business & Economics,244,N/A,0,en

Transport for Suburbia,Paul Mees,Earthscan,2009-12,"""The need for effective public transport is greater than ever in the 21st century. With countries like China and India moving towards mass-automobility, we face the prospects of an environmental and urban health disaster unless alternatives are found. It is time to move beyond the automobile age. But while public transport has worked well in the dense cores of some big cities, the problem is that most residents of developed countries now live in dispersed suburbs and smaller cities and towns. These places usually have little or no public transport, and most transport commentators have given up on the task of changing this: it all seems too hard. This book argues that the secret of 'European-style' public transport lies in a generalizable model of network planning that has worked in places as diverse as rural Switzerland, the Brazilian city of Curitiba and the Canadian cities of Toronto and Vancouver. It shows how this model can be adapted to suburban, exurban and even rural areas to provide a genuine alternative to the car, and outlines the governance, funding and service planning policies that underpin the success of the world's best public transport systems.""--Back cover.",Business & Economics,241,5,1,en

It proposes responses to ensure effective, secure movement of people and goods in ways that make the best use of renewable sources of energy while minimizing environmental impacts.Transport Revolutions synthesizes engineering, economics, environment, organization, policy and technology, and draws extensively on current data to present important conclusions. The authors argue that land transport in the first half of the 21st century will feature at least two revolutions. One will involve the use of electric drives rather than internal combustion engines. Another will involve powering many of these drives directly from the electric grid - as trains and trolley buses are powered today - rather than from on-board fuel. They go on to discuss marine transport, whose future is less clear, and aviation, which could see the most dramatic breaks from current practice.With its expert analysis of the politics and business of transport, Transport Revolutions is essential reading for professionals and students in transport, energy, town planning and public policy.",Nature,374,1,1,en

Racing Toward Zero,"Kelly Senecal, Felix Leach",SAE International,2021-06-01,"In Racing Toward Zero, the authors explore the issues inherent in developing sustainable transportation. They review the types of propulsion systems and vehicle options, discuss low-carbon fuels and alternative energy sources, and examine the role of regulation in curbing emissions. All technologies have an impact on the environment, from internal combustion engine vehicles to battery electric vehicles, fuel cell electric vehicles, and hybrids-there is no silver bullet. The battery electric vehicle may seem the obvious path to a sustainable, carbon-free transportation future, but it's not the only, nor necessarily the best, path forward. The vast majority of vehicles today use the internal combustion engine (ICE), and this is unlikely to change anytime soon. Improving the ICE and its fuels-entering a new ICE age-must be a main route on the road to zero emissions. How do we go green? The future requires a balanced approach to transportation. It's not a matter of choosing between combustion or electrification; it's combustion and electrification. As the authors say, ""The future is eclectic.""

Railtown,Ethan N. Elkind,University of California Press,2014-01-22,"The familiar image of Los Angeles as a metropolis built for the automobile is crumbling. Traffic, air pollution, and sprawl motivated citizens to support urban rail as an alternative to driving, and the city has started to reinvent itself by developing compact neighborhoods adjacent to transit. As a result of pressure from local leaders, particularly with the election of Tom Bradley as mayor in 1973, the Los Angeles Metro Rail gradually took shape in the consummate car city. Railtown presents the history of this system by drawing on archival documents, contemporary news accounts, and interviews with many of the key players to provide critical behind-the-scenes accounts of the people and forces that shaped the system. Ethan Elkind brings this important story to life by showing how ambitious local leaders zealously advocated for rail transit and ultimately persuaded an ambivalent electorate and federal leaders to support their vision. Although Metro Rail is growing in ridership and political importance, with expansions in the pipeline, Elkind argues that local leaders will need to reform the rail planning and implementation process to avoid repeating past mistakes and to ensure that Metro Rail supports a burgeoning demand for transit-oriented neighborhoods in Los Angeles. This engaging history of Metro Rail provides lessons for how the American car-dominated cities of today can reinvent themselves as thriving railtowns of tomorrow.",History,314,N/A,0,en

Mechanics of Coastal Sediment Transport,"J?rgen Freds?e, Rolf Deigaard",World Scientific,1992,"This book treats the subject of sediment transport in the marine environment, covering transport of non-cohesive sediment by waves and current in- and outside the surf zone. It can be read independently, but a background in hydraulics and basic wave mechanics is required. It is intended for M.Sc. and Ph.D. students. The primary aim of the book is to describe the physical processes of sediment transport and how to represent them in mathematical models. It does not present a large number of different formulae for the sediment transport rates under various conditions. The book can be divided in two main parts; in the first, the relevant hydrodynamic theory is described; in the second, sediment transport and morphological development are treated. The hydrodynamic part contains a review of elementary theory for water waves, chapters on the turbulent wave boundary layer and the turbulent interaction between waves and currents, and finally, surf zone hydrodynamics and wave driven currents. The part on sediment transport introduces the basic concepts (critical bed shear stress, bed load, suspended load and sheet layer, near-bed concentration, effect of sloping bed); it treats suspended sediment in waves and current and in the surf zone, and current and wave-generated bed forms. Finally, the modelling of cross-shore and long-shore sediment transport is described together with the development, of coastal profiles and coastlines.",Science,406,5,1,en

The Geographies of Air Transport,"Dr Lucy Budd, Professor Andrew R Goetz","Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.",2014-07-28,"Making a detailed contribution to geographies of air transport and aeromobility, this book examines the practices and processes that produce particular patterns of air transport provision both regionally and globally. In so doing, it updates the seminal contributions of Eva Taylor (1945), Kenneth Sealy (1957), Brian Graham (1995) and others to the study of air transport geography. Leading scholars in the field offer a unique insight into the key developments that have occurred in the field and the implications that these developments have had for geography, geographers, and global patterns of past, present and future air transport. Although globalization and liberalization processes have greatly expanded the demand for air transport over the last two decades, the industry has experienced several major setbacks due to economic, security, and environmental concerns. Many of these impacts have been much more pronounced in some regions, such as North America and Europe while others, such as Asia-Pacific have not been as adversely affected. Accordingly, there is a clear need to examine these recent economic and geopolitical changes from a geographical perspective given the differentiated pattern of effects from global processes. Addressing this need, this volume opens with thematic chapters covering key topics such as the historical geographies, socio-cultural mobilities, environmental externalities, urban geographies, and sustainability of the global air transport industry, followed by regional analysis of the industry in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Greater Middle East and Africa as well as North America and Europe.",Political Science,301,N/A,0,en

Transportation for Livable Cities,Vukan R. Vuchic,Routledge,1999,"The twenty-first century finds civilization heavily based in cities that have grown into large metropolitan areas. Many of these focal points of human activity face problems of economic inefficiency, environmental deterioration, and an unsatisfactory quality of life--problems that go far in determining whether a city is ""livable."" A large share of these problems stems from the inefficiencies and other impacts of urban transportation systems. The era of projects aimed at maximizing vehicular travel is being replaced by the broader goal of achieving livable cities: economically efficient, socially sound, and environmentally friendly. This book explores the complex relationship between transportation and the character of cities and metropolitan regions. Vukan Vuchic applies his experience in urban transportation systems and policies to present a systematic review of transportation modes and their characteristics. Transportation for Livable Cities dispels the myths and emotional advocacies for or against freeways, rail transit, bicycles,and other modes of transportation. The author discusses the consequences of excessive automobile dependence and shows that the most livable cities worldwide have intermodal systems that balance highway and public transit modes while providing for pedestrians, bicyclists, and paratransit. Vuchic defines the policies necessary for achieving livable cities: the effective implementation of integrated intermodal transportation systems.",Architecture,392,N/A,0,en

The Getty Villa,"Marion True, Jorge Silvetti",Getty Publications,2005,"The original Getty Museum, housed in a replica of a Roman Villa on a site overlooking the Pacific Ocean, is one of Los Angeles's most treasured landmarks. Closed for almost ten years while renovations were made to the building and the site itself was transformed into a center for the study of antiquities and conservation, the Getty Villa is now set to open late in 2005. The Getty Villa is a lively history of the Getty Museum, its renowned antiquities collections, and its growth from a small museum in a ranch house in Malibu to its first home in a building designed to replicate what we know of the Villa dei Papiri, an ancient Roman villa partially uncovered in Herculaneum. Most engagingly, this book records the ten-year adventure in reconfiguring a beautiful, but topographically challenging, site into one that could continue to accommodate the splendid Museum building and also provide for an outdoor theater, laboratories for conservation work and research, offices for staff and visiting scholars, and an education program for adults and children. This is a story of architectural imagination, geographical challenges, and legal hurdles, all of which have resulted in a truly unique and beautiful site. The story is an enlightening and rewarding one for anyone interested in architecture and in the difficulties posed by building on a grand scale in the twenty-first century. Beautifully illustrated throughout, the book includes 250 reproductions of works of art, photographs of both the old and the new Getty Museum, site plans, and architectural elevations.",Architecture,262,N/A,0,en
Bourgeois Nightmares,Robert M. Fogelson,Yale University Press,2005-10-10,"The quintessential American suburbs, with their gracious single-family homes, large green lawns, and leaf-shaded streets, reflected not only residents’ dreams but nightmares, not only hopes but fears: fear of others, of racial minorities and lowincome groups, fear of themselves, fear of the market, and, above all, fear of change. These fears, and the restrictive covenants that embodied them, are the subject of Robert M. Fogelson’s fascinating new book. As Fogelson reveals, suburban subdividers attempted to cope with the deep-seated fears of unwanted change, especially the encroachment of “undesirable” people and activities, by imposing a wide range of restrictions on the lots. These restrictions ranged from mandating minimum costs and architectural styles for the houses to forbidding the owners to sell or lease their property to any member of a host of racial, ethnic, and religious groups. These restrictions, many of which are still commonly employed, tell us as much about the complexities of American society today as about its complexities a century ago.",History,272,N/A,0,en

City Cycling,"John Pucher, Ralph Buehler",MIT Press,2012-10-19,"A guide to today's urban cycling renaissance, with information on cycling's health benefits, safety, bikes and bike equipment, bike lanes, bike sharing, and other topics. Bicycling in cities is booming, for many reasons: health and environmental benefits, time and cost savings, more and better bike lanes and paths, innovative bike sharing programs, and the sheer fun of riding. City Cycling offers a guide to this urban cycling renaissance, with the goal of promoting cycling as sustainable urban transportation available to everyone. It reports on cycling trends and policies in cities in North America, Europe, and Australia, and offers information on such topics as cycling safety, cycling infrastructure provisions including bikeways and bike parking, the wide range of bike designs and bike equipment, integration of cycling with public transportation, and promoting cycling for women and children. City Cycling emphasizes that bicycling should not be limited to those who are highly trained, extremely fit, and daring enough to battle traffic on busy roads. The chapters describe ways to make city cycling feasible, convenient, and safe for commutes to work and school, shopping trips, visits, and other daily transportation needs. The book also offers detailed examinations and illustrations of cycling conditions in different urban environments: small cities (including Davis, California, and Delft, the Netherlands), large cities (including Sydney, Chicago, Toronto and Berlin), and “megacities” (London, New York, Paris, and Tokyo). These chapters offer a closer look at how cities both with and without historical cycling cultures have developed cycling programs over time. The book makes clear that successful promotion of city cycling depends on coordinating infrastructure, programs, and government policies.",Sports & Recreation,413,N/A,0,en

Mass Transfer Concepts,K. Asokan,Universities Press,2011-05-26,"Mass transfer involves the use of various operations to separate a mixture into its individual components—a frequent requirement in chemical industries. The differences in the physical properties of the components to be separated, such as the vapour pressure, solubility or diffusivity, are utilized to transfer material from one homogenous phase to another. Techniques such as gas absorption, distillation, leaching, extraction, crystallization, humidification, drying, adsorption and membrane based separation processes involve mass transfer and can be carried out due to the existence of a concentration gradient within the system. Mass Transfer Concepts supplies engineers with the required knowledge of all these operations.

This paper provides updated evidence on the impact of the EPA on these countries. A dynamic multicountry, multisector computable general equilibrium trade model with modeling of the dual-dual economy and with a consistent tariff aggregator is used to simulate a series of new scenarios that include updated information on the agreement. We also go beyond estimating macrolevel economic effects to analyze the impacts on poverty. The policy simulation results show that the implementation of the EPA between the EU and WA countries would have marginal but positive impacts on Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire and negative impacts on Benin, Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, and Togo. The impact on poverty indicators in Ghana and Nigeria would be marginal. From the perspective of WA countries, this study supports the view that recent EU concessions are not sufficient and that domestic fiscal reforms are needed in WA countries themselves.",Political Science,80,N/A,0,en

Estimating the transport and fate of chemicals released into the environment is an interesting and challenging task. The global environment is large, on the chemical transport and fate scale. This text applies the mathematics of diffusion, turbulent diffusion and dispersion to the atmosphere, lakes, rivers, groundwater and the ocean, as well as transport between these media. The required theory is explained as a solution technique to solve the case studies and example problems. A large portion of the book is dedicated to examples and case studies, from which the important principles are derived.",Technology & Engineering,0,N/A,0,en

In Volume I, the authors systematically develop the theory with emphasis on the Monge-Kantorovich mass transportation and the Kantorovich-Rubinstein mass transshipment problems. They then discuss a variety of different approaches towards solving these problems and exploit the rich interrelations to several mathematical sciences - from functional analysis to probability theory and mathematical economics. The second volume is devoted to applications of the above problems to topics in applied probability, theory of moments and distributions with given marginals, queuing theory, risk theory of probability metrics and its applications to various fields, among them general limit theorems for Gaussian and non-Gaussian limiting laws, stochastic differential equations and algorithms, and rounding problems. Useful to graduates and researchers in theoretical and applied probability, operations research, computer science, and mathematical economics, the prerequisites for this book are graduate level probability theory and real and functional analysis.",Mathematics,450,N/A,0,en

Handbook of Mathematical Models and Algorithms in Computer Vision and Imaging,"Ke Chen, Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb, Xue-Cheng Tai, Laurent Younes",Springer Nature,2023-02-24,"This handbook gathers together the state of the art on mathematical models and algorithms for imaging and vision. Its emphasis lies on rigorous mathematical methods, which represent the optimal solutions to a class of imaging and vision problems, and on effective algorithms, which are necessary for the methods to be translated to practical use in various applications. Viewing discrete images as data sampled from functional surfaces enables the use of advanced tools from calculus, functions and calculus of variations, and nonlinear optimization, and provides the basis of high-resolution imaging through geometry and variational models. Besides, optimization naturally connects traditional model-driven approaches to the emerging data-driven approaches of machine and deep learning. No other framework can provide comparable accuracy and precision to imaging and vision. Written by leading researchers in imaging and vision, the chapters in this handbook all start with gentle introductions, which make this work accessible to graduate students. For newcomers to the field, the book provides a comprehensive and fast-track introduction to the content, to save time and get on with tackling new and emerging challenges. For researchers, exposure to the state of the art of research works leads to an overall view of the entire field so as to guide new research directions and avoid pitfalls in moving the field forward and looking into the next decades of imaging and information services. This work can greatly benefit graduate students, researchers, and practitioners in imaging and vision; applied mathematicians; medical imagers; engineers; and computer scientists.",Mathematics,1981,N/A,0,en

Congressional Budget Office,N/A,2007,"""A centerpiece of the Department of Defense's (DoD's) transformation efforts in recent years has been the move toward making ground forces less reliant on access to foreign-controlled facilities such as harbors, airports, or logistics bases on the ground in their area of operations."" ""The United States Marine Corps and Army have long maintained expeditionary forces organized and equipped to be rapidly moved and inserted into combat with little reliance on access to local bases or infrastructure. Recognizing the vulnerability of forces that are dependent on local access (as U.S. forces have been in Afghanistan and Iraq), the Department of Defense (DoD) is improving its expeditionary capabilities across all of the military services. Prominent among those efforts is the Navy's plan to field a 14-ship squadro--the Maritime Prepositioning Force (Future), or MPF(F--that would be capable of deploying, employing, and sustaining a Marine expeditionary brigade with little or no need for access to local bases or other infrastructure.

Expert Advice for Policy Choice,"Duncan MacRaeJr., Dale Whittington",Georgetown University Press,1997-04-01,"Economic reasoning has thus far dominated the field of public policy analysis. This new introduction to the field posits that policy analysis should have both a broader interdisciplinary base—including criteria from such fields as political science, sociology, law, and philosophy, as well as economics—and also a broader audience in order to foster democratic debate. To achieve these goals, MacRae and Whittington have organized their textbook around the construction of decision matrices using multiple criteria, exploring the uses of the decision matrix formulation more fully than other texts. They describe how to set up the matrix, fill in cells and combine criteria, and use it as an aid for decision making. They show how ethical assessment of the affects that alternatives have on various parties differs from political analysis, and then they extend the use of the decision matrix to consider alternatives by affected parties, periods of time, or combined factors. The authors also thoughtfully address the role of expert advice in the policy process, widening the scope of the field to describe a complex system for the creation and use of knowledge in a democracy. An extended case study of HIV/AIDS policy follows each chapter (in installments), immediately illustrating the application of the material. The book also contains a glossary. Expert Advice for Policy Choice provides a new basis for graduate education in public policy analysis and can also serve as a text in planning, evaluation research, or public administration. In addition, it will be of interest to students and professionals wishing to aid policy choice who work in such fields as sociology, political science, psychology, public health, and social work.",Political Science,452,N/A,0,en

Remaking the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge,Karen Trapenberg Frick,Routledge,2015-08-14,"Winner of TransportiCA’s September Book Club Award 2018 On 17 October 1989 one the largest earthquakes to occur in California since the San Francisco earthquake of April 1906 struck Northern California. Damage was extensive, none more so than the partial collapse of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge’s eastern span, a vital link used by hundreds of thousands of Californians every day. The bridge was closed for a month for repairs and then reopened to traffic. But what ensued over the next 25 years is the extraordinary story that Karen Trapenberg Frick tells here. It is a cautionary tale to which any governing authority embarking on a megaproject should pay heed. She describes the process by which the bridge was eventually replaced as an exercise in shadowboxing which pitted the combined talents and shortcomings, partnerships and jealousies, ingenuity and obtuseness, generosity and parsimony of the State’s and the region’s leading elected officials, engineers, architects and other members of the governing elites against a collectively imagined future catastrophe of unknown proportions. In so doing she highlights three key questions: If safety was the reason to replace the bridge, why did it take almost 25 years to do so? How did an original estimate of $250 million in 1995 soar to $6.5 billion by 2014? And why was such a complex design chosen? Her final chapter – part epilogue, part reflection – provides recommendations to improve megaproject delivery and design.",Architecture,240,N/A,0,en

The Total Incomes System of Accounts,Robert Eisner,University of Chicago Press,1989-12-29,"Conventional measures of national income and product and its components have proved enormously useful as indexes of economic activity and as the empirical foundations of much of macroeconomic analysis. Robert Eisner's The Total Incomes System of Accounts (TISA) brings critical new dimensions to those measures. It offers systematic extensions and expansions in an effort to count all of the output that goes into economic well-being, now and in the future. Eisner counts nonmarket as well as market production, including vast amounts of services produced by housewives and others in the home, capital formation by government and households as well as business, human and intangible capital invested in education, R&D, and health care, as well as tangible capital. He offers measures of net revaluations of tangible assets, redefines the critical boundaries between final and intermediate outputs, and presents separate sector accounts for business, nonprofit institutions, government, government enterprises and households, which make clear the major contributions of nonbusiness sectors to our total national income. For these and other extensions, Eisner's TISA offers detailed and comprehensive income and product accounts in current dollars and product accounts in constant dollars for all of the years from 1946 to 1981, along with measures of capital stocks. Estimates of consumption, investment, and production functions with the new data sets, a review of other sets of extended accounts, and a detailed description of sources and methods are also provided.",Business & Economics,436,N/A,0,en

The individual chapters contain original case-study evidence and analytical insights. . . it is one that should be consulted by any scholar working in the area if industrial agglomerations and new technology. Simona Iammarino, Economic Geography This book, a collaborative effort by researchers from Japan, Italy and the USA, seeks to explore the reasons for industrial clustering in certain regions of Asia, Europe and North America. The studies presented illustrate real examples of industrial clusters, adding anecdotal evidence to the emerging theory of economic geography by exemplifying the centripetal and centrifugal forces that regulate the clustering process. The authors examine clusters in a diverse set of countries including China, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, the USA and Vietnam. Significantly, the book provides an interesting split between studies of IT and software-related industries, and more traditional sectors, such as steel and vehicle manufacturing. Industrial Agglomeration and New Technologies pays attention to a varied array of factors that influence clustering, such as knowledge spillovers, tacit knowledge, communication and transport costs, and the effects of various government policies. The case studies provide useful examples for government and industry leaders, as well as a starting point for researchers seeking an ultimate answer to the question: Why do firms form clusters?",Business & Economics,395,N/A,0,en

Animal Welfare in Animal Agriculture,"Wilson G. Pond, Fuller W. Bazer, Bernard E. Rollin",CRC Press,2011-11-23,"What constitutes animal welfare? With animals being used for companionship, service, research, food, fiber, and by-products, animal welfare is a topic of great interest and importance to society. As the world’s population continues to increase, a major challenge for society is the maintenance of a strong and viable food system, which is linked to the well-being and comfort of food animals. Animal Welfare in Animal Agriculture: Husbandry, Stewardship, and Sustainability in Animal Production explores the pressing issue of farm animal welfare in animal production systems in the United States and globally. A framework for open discussion on animal welfare, this multidisciplinary book brings together the perspectives of 40 highly qualified and recognized experts in their respective fields. Fourteen chapters address a range of topics that includes ethics, sociology, food safety, ecology, feed resources, biotechnology, government regulations, and sustainability, as well as animal comfort, health, and contributions to society. The book also offers a historical perspective on the growth of animal agriculture from family farms to industrial animal agriculture—and the impact this has had on society. Illustrating the diversity of viewpoints, the concept of animal welfare is defined from the perspectives of an ethicist and philosopher, a research scientist, a veterinarian, an industrialist, and an activist, as well as from the perspective of sustainability and product quality. Written primarily for students, but also highly relevant for professionals in varying fields of academia and industry, this timely book reveals important insights into animal welfare and animal agriculture. Unique in its depth, breadth, and balance, it underscores the need for dialogue on wide-ranging and often contentious issues related to animal production systems.",Medical,1140,N/A,0,en

"Secwépemc People, Land, and Laws","Marianne Ignace, Ronald E. Ignace",McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP,2017-10-31,"Secwépemc People, Land, and Laws is a journey through the 10,000-year history of the Interior Plateau nation in British Columbia. Told through the lens of past and present Indigenous storytellers, this volume detail how a homeland has shaped Secwépemc existence while the Secwépemc have in turn shaped their homeland. Marianne Ignace and Ronald Ignace, with contributions from ethnobotanist Nancy Turner, archaeologist Mike Rousseau, and geographer Ken Favrholdt, compellingly weave together Secwépemc narratives about ancestors’ deeds. They demonstrate how these stories are the manifestation of Indigenous laws (stsq'ey') for social and moral conduct among humans and all sentient beings on the land, and for social and political relations within the nation and with outsiders. Breathing new life into stories about past transformations, the authors place these narratives in dialogue with written historical sources and knowledge from archaeology, ethnography, linguistics, earth science, and ethnobiology. In addition to a wealth of detail about Secwépemc land stewardship, the social and political order, and spiritual concepts and relations embedded in the Indigenous language, the book shows how between the mid-1800s and 1920s the Secwépemc people resisted devastating oppression and the theft of their land, and fought to retain political autonomy while tenaciously maintaining a connection with their homeland, ancestors, and laws. An exemplary work in collaboration, Secwépemc People, Land, and Laws points to the ways in which Indigenous laws and traditions can guide present and future social and political process among the Secwépemc and with settler society.",Social Science,641,N/A,0,en

Transit Life,David Bissell,MIT Press,2018-03-23,"An exploration of the ways that everyday life in the city is defined by commuting. We spend much of our lives in transit to and from work. Although we might dismiss our daily commute as a wearying slog, we rarely stop to think about the significance of these daily journeys. In Transit Life, David Bissell explores how everyday life in cities is increasingly defined by commuting. Examining the overlooked events and encounters of the commute, Bissell shows that the material experiences of our daily journeys are transforming life in our cities. The commute is a time where some of the most pressing tensions of contemporary life play out, striking at the heart of such issues as our work-life balance; our relationships with others; our sense of place; and our understanding of who we are. Drawing on in-depth fieldwork with commuters, journalists, transit advocates, policymakers, and others in Sydney, Australia, Transit Life takes a holistic perspective to change how we think about commuting. Rather than arguing that transport infrastructure investment alone can solve our commuting problems, Bissell explores the more subtle but powerful forms of social change that commuting creates. He examines the complex politics of urban mobility through multiple dimensions, including the competencies that commuters develop over time; commuting dispositions and the social life of the commute; the multiple temporalities of commuting; the experience of commuting spaces, from footpath to on-ramp, both physical and digital; the voices of commuting, from private rants to drive-time radio; and the interplay of materialities, ideas, advocates, and organizations in commuting infrastructures.",Transportation,267,N/A,0,en

Stochastic Optimal Transportation,Toshio Mikami,Springer Nature,2021-06-15,"In this book, the optimal transportation problem (OT) is described as a variational problem for absolutely continuous stochastic processes with fixed initial and terminal distributions. Also described is Schrödinger’s problem, which is originally a variational problem for one-step random walks with fixed initial and terminal distributions. The stochastic optimal transportation problem (SOT) is then introduced as a generalization of the OT, i.e., as a variational problem for semimartingales with fixed initial and terminal distributions. An interpretation of the SOT is also stated as a generalization of Schrödinger’s problem. After the brief introduction above, the fundamental results on the SOT are described: duality theorem, a sufficient condition for the problem to be finite, forward–backward stochastic differential equations (SDE) for the minimizer, and so on. The recent development of the superposition principle plays a crucial role in the SOT. A systematic method is introduced to consider two problems: one with fixed initial and terminal distributions and one with fixed marginal distributions for all times. By the zero-noise limit of the SOT, the probabilistic proofs to Monge’s problem with a quadratic cost and the duality theorem for the OT are described. Also described are the Lipschitz continuity and the semiconcavity of Schrödinger’s problem in marginal distributions and random variables with given marginals, respectively. As well, there is an explanation of the regularity result for the solution to Schrödinger’s functional equation when the space of Borel probability measures is endowed with a strong or a weak topology, and it is shown that Schrödinger’s problem can be considered a class of mean field games. The construction of stochastic processes with given marginals, called the marginal problem for stochastic processes, is discussed as an application of the SOT and the OT.",Mathematics,129,N/A,0,en

Towards Sustainable Road Transport,"Ronald M. Dell, Patrick T. Moseley, David A. J. Rand",Academic Press,2014-06-11,"Increasing pressure on global reserves of petroleum at a time of growing demand for personal transport in developing countries, together with concerns over atmospheric pollution and carbon dioxide emissions, are leading to a requirement for more sustainable forms of road transport. Major improvements in the efficiency of all types of road vehicles are called for, along with the use of fuels derived from alternative sources, or entirely new fuels. Towards Sustainable Road Transport first describes the evolution of vehicle designs and propulsion technologies over the past two centuries, before looking forward to possible new forms of energy to substitute for petroleum. The book also discusses the political and socio-economic drivers for change, investigates barriers to their broad implementation, and outlines the state-of-the-art of candidate power sources, advanced vehicle design, and associated infrastructure. The comprehensive technical informationsupplied by an expert author team ensures that Towards Sustainable Road Transport will provide readers with a clear understanding of the ongoing progress in this field and the challenges still to be faced. - Drivers of technological change in road transport and the infrastructure requirements - Discussion of alternative fuels for internal combustion engines and fuel conversion technologies - Detailed exploration of current and emerging options for vehicle propulsion, with emphasis on hybrid/battery electric traction, hydrogen, and fuel cells - Comparative analysis of vehicle design requirements, primary power source efficiency, and energy storagesystems",Technology & Engineering,375,N/A,0,en

Roads Were Not Built for Cars,Carlton Reid,Island Press,2015-04-09,"In Roads Were Not Built for Cars, Carlton Reid reveals the pivotal—and largely unrecognized—role that bicyclists played in the development of modern roadways. Reid introduces readers to cycling personalities, such as Henry Ford, and the cycling advocacy groups that influenced early road improvements, literally paving the way for the motor car. When the bicycle morphed from the vehicle of rich transport progressives in the 1890s to the “poor man’s transport” in the 1920s, some cyclists became ardent motorists and were all too happy to forget their cycling roots. But, Reid explains, many motor pioneers continued cycling, celebrating the shared links between transport modes that are now seen as worlds apart. In this engaging and meticulously researched book, Carlton Reid encourages us all to celebrate those links once again.",Architecture,374,N/A,0,en

Traffic and Transport Psychology,"Talib Rothengatter, Raphael Denis Huguenin",Elsevier Science,2004-07-15,"This volume gives an overview of the trends in Traffic and Transport Psychology. It reflects the considerable development of the most important factors for driving a road vehicle, and the variety of international research approaches. The first part contains basic approaches and integrated models as well as general theories and their implementation into Traffic and Transport Psychology. The second part deals with the driver, especially cognition, performance, social and differential effects and impairment. Important aspects are treated, such as speed perception, reaction times, interaction, risk acceptance, aggression and gender differences. Special chapters refer to performance and fatigue. The third part focuses on safety, driver support, selection and influencing drivers by enforcement, training and programs for the rehabilitation of traffic offenders. Classic ergonomic methods are discussed as well as modern telematic devices, or trends regarding driver-assessment. In the last part, current developments are presented in relation to better mobility and the protection of the environment. Questions are asked, such as whether we could reduce the use of cars, how travel behaviour can be modified or to what extent the use of alternatives to motor vehicles benefits safety as well as the environment.

A European Public Investment Outlook,"Floriana Cerniglia, Francesco Saraceno",Open Book Publishers,2020-06-12,"This outlook provides a focused assessment of the state of public capital in the major European countries and identifies areas where public investment could contribute more to stable and sustainable growth. A European Public Investment Outlook brings together contributions from a range of international authors from diverse intellectual and professional backgrounds, providing a valuable resource for the policy-making community in Europe to feed their discussion on public investment. The volume both offers sector-specific advice and highlights larger areas which should be prioritized in the policy debate (from transport to social capital, R&D and the environment). The Outlook is structured into two parts: the chapters of Part I respectively explore public investment trends in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Europe as a whole, and illuminate how the legacy of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis is one of insufficient public investment. Part II investigates some areas into which resources could be channelled to reverse the recent trend and provide European economies with an adequate public capital stock. The essays in this outlook collectively foster a broad approach to and definition of public investment, that is today more relevant than ever. Offering up a timely and clear case for the elimination of bias against investment in European fiscal rules, this outlook is a welcome contribution to the European debate, aimed both at policy makers and general readers.",Business & Economics,164,N/A,0,en

Black Inventors in the Age of Segregation,Rayvon Fouché,JHU Press,2005-09-09,"According to the stereotype, late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century inventors, quintessential loners and supposed geniuses, worked in splendid isolation and then unveiled their discoveries to a marveling world. Most successful inventors of this era, however, developed their ideas within the framework of industrial organizations that supported them and their experiments. For African American inventors, negotiating these racially stratified professional environments meant not only working on innovative designs but also breaking barriers. In this pathbreaking study, Rayvon Fouché examines the life and work of three African Americans: Granville Woods (1856–1910), an independent inventor; Lewis Latimer (1848–1928), a corporate engineer with General Electric; and Shelby Davidson (1868–1930), who worked in the U.S. Treasury Department. Detailing the difficulties and human frailties that make their achievements all the more impressive, Fouché explains how each man used invention for financial gain, as a claim on entering adversarial environments, and as a means to technical stature in a Jim Crow institutional setting. Describing how Woods, Latimer, and Davidson struggled to balance their complicated racial identities—as both black and white communities perceived them—with their hopes of being judged solely on the content of their inventive work, Fouché provides a nuanced view of African American contributions to—and relationships with—technology during a period of rapid industrialization and mounting national attention to the inequities of a separate-but-equal social order.",Biography & Autobiography,250,N/A,0,en

The sources and uses of energy in the United States have changed dramatically in the last several decades. As a result, in just one generation, we have shifted from a position of domestic energy abundance to a substantial and continually growing reliance on foreign energy sources. Project Independence is a wide-ranging program to evaluate this growing dependence on foreign sources of energy, and to develop positive programs to reduce our vulnerability to future oil cut-offs and price increases.",Energy policy,708,N/A,0,en

River Sedimentation,"Silke Wieprecht, Stefan Haun, Karolin Weber, Markus Noack, Kristina Terheiden",CRC Press,2016-11-30,"Sediment dynamics in fluvial systems is of great ecological, economic and human-health-related significance worldwide. Appropriate management strategies are therefore needed to limit maintenance costs as well as minimize potential hazards to the aquatic and adjacent environments. Human intervention, ranging from nutrient/pollutant release to physical modifications, has a large impact on sediment quantity and quality and thus on river morphology as well as on ecological functioning. Truly understanding sediment dynamics requires as a consequence a multidisciplinary approach.River Sedimentation contains the peer-reviewed scientific contributions presented at the 13th International Symposium on River Sedimentation (ISRS 2016, Stuttgart, Germany, 19-22 September 2016), and includes recent accomplishments in theoretical developments, numerical modelling, experimental laboratory work, field investigations and monitoring as well as management methodologies.",Science,1381,N/A,0,en

Poems from a Soldier,Stephen A. Janke,Xlibris Corporation,2014-02-11,The Vietnam War deeply divided our nation during the 60's and early 70's. Our returning soldiers during America's longest war were treated shamefully in parts of the country. In time the public has learned to separate the war and the warrior. As a result many veterans did not speak of their year away from home for a long time if ever. It took me 20 years to slowly tell people by way of poems what it was like. At first they trickled out and then the trickle turned into a flood through the years. This book is also about the wonderful War Dogs of Vietnam. My sentry dog's name was Kobuc. Our Air Base was the largest in Vietnam. The Security Policemen were the first line of defense to protect the many bases in Vietnam. I served at Cam Ranh Air Base with a great bunch of guys that made that long year almost tolerable. Most of the several thousand dogs that went to Vietnam never returned.This book tells their story as well.,Poetry,183,N/A,0,en

Seeking Spatial Justice,Edward W. Soja,U of Minnesota Press,2013-11-30,"In 1996, the Los Angeles Bus Riders Union, a grassroots advocacy organization, won a historic legal victory against the city’s Metropolitan Transit Authority. The resulting consent decree forced the MTA for a period of ten years to essentially reorient the mass transit system to better serve the city’s poorest residents. A stunning reversal of conventional governance and planning in urban America, which almost always favors wealthier residents, this decision is also, for renowned urban theorist Edward W. Soja, a concrete example of spatial justice in action. In Seeking Spatial Justice, Soja argues that justice has a geography and that the equitable distribution of resources, services, and access is a basic human right. Building on current concerns in critical geography and the new spatial consciousness, Soja interweaves theory and practice, offering new ways of understanding and changing the unjust geographies in which we live. After tracing the evolution of spatial justice and the closely related notion of the right to the city in the influential work of Henri Lefebvre, David Harvey, and others, he demonstrates how these ideas are now being applied through a series of case studies in Los Angeles, the city at the forefront of this movement. Soja focuses on such innovative labor–community coalitions as Justice for Janitors, the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy, and the Right to the City Alliance; on struggles for rent control and environmental justice; and on the role that faculty and students in the UCLA Department of Urban Planning have played in both developing the theory of spatial justice and putting it into practice. Effectively locating spatial justice as a theoretical concept, a mode of empirical analysis, and a strategy for social and political action, this book makes a significant contribution to the contemporary debates about justice, space, and the city.",Social Science,277,N/A,0,en

In this compact guide, Rick Steves covers the best of Berlin, including tips on arrival, orientation, and transportation.

Rick offers his firsthand advice on the best sights, eating, sleeping, and nightlife, and the maps and self-guided tours will ensure you make the most of your experience. More than just reviews and directions, a Rick Steves Snapshot guide is a tour guide in your pocket. Rick Steves Snapshot guides consist of excerpted chapters from Rick Steves' European country guidebooks.

These slim guides offer all of Rick's up-to-date advice on what sights are worth your time and money. They include good-value hotel and restaurant recommendations, with no introductory information (such as overall trip planning, when to go, and travel practicalities).",Travel,195,N/A,0,en

Attack Transport; The Story Of The U.S.S. Doyen [Illustrated Edition],Lt. Lawrence A. Marsden,Pickle Partners Publishing,2015-11-06,"Includes the Second World War In The Pacific Illustration Pack – 152 maps, plans and photos. “Among the auxiliary classes of the Navy List are two that carry not only an “auxiliary” but also a “combatant” classification letter. These are the attack transports (APA’s) and the attack cargo vessels (AKA’s). Without belittling the importance of LST’s, LSM’s, LCT’s, and other small types used in the maritime transportation of men and freight, it is the APA’s and the AKA’s that carry the bulk of the troops and equipment to the bloody assault beaches of our overseas landings. They are the backbone of the Amphibious Forces. These ships arrive with the initial amphibious attacks and continue their support throughout the fighting. Unarmored and with small fire power, they yet carry a great weapon that is war’s one essential combat element: the troops that fight on the ground. In war, transports seldom rest. Between assaults, on long and dreary voyages they carry out to distant bases replacement and service troops and freight, and carry back to home ports our casualties and essential war materials. They are the unsung, battle-scarred work horses of the Navy. Transport life was mainly on a humdrum level that had occasional peaks of furious battle. Morale was always high. The resourceful crews of these ships made up for lack of experience through native ingenuity, shining courage, and an eager offensive spirit. As modestly portrayed in Attack Transport, these truly combatant naval vessels of the Amphibious Forces did their share in winning the war. God bless them and the splendid Americans who worked and fought them!”-Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner.",History,412,N/A,0,en

Lord of Opium,Nancy Farmer,Simon and Schuster,2013-09-26,"Matt has always been nothing but a clone - an exact replica, grown from a strip of old El Patron's skin. Now, age fourteen, Matt suddenly finds himself thrust into the position of ruling over his own country, Opium, on the one-time border between the US and Mexico, stretching from the ruins of San Diego to the ruins of Matamoros. But while Opium thrives, the rest of the world has been devastated by ecological disaster… and hidden somewhere in Opium is the cure. And that isn't all that's hidden within the depths of Opium. Matt is haunted by the ubiquitous army of eejits, zombie-like workers harnessed to the old El Patron's sinister system of drug growing... people stripped of the very qualities which once made them human. Matt wants to use his newfound power to help stop the suffering, but he can't even find a way to smuggle his childhood love Maria across the border and into Opium. Instead, his every move hits a roadblock - both from the traitors that surround him and from a voice within himself. For who is Matt really but the clone of an evil, murderous dictator?",Juvenile Fiction,395,N/A,0,en

Remaking the American Patient,Nancy Tomes,UNC Press Books,2016-01-06,"In a work that spans the twentieth century, Nancy Tomes questions the popular — and largely unexamined — idea that in order to get good health care, people must learn to shop for it. Remaking the American Patient explores the consequences of the consumer economy and American medicine having come of age at exactly the same time. Tracing the robust development of advertising, marketing, and public relations within the medical profession and the vast realm we now think of as “health care,” Tomes considers what it means to be a “good” patient. As she shows, this history of the coevolution of medicine and consumer culture tells us much about our current predicament over health care in the United States. Understanding where the shopping model came from, why it was so long resisted in medicine, and why it finally triumphed in the late twentieth century helps explain why, despite striking changes that seem to empower patients, so many Americans remain unhappy and confused about their status as patients today.",Medical,560,N/A,0,en

Zoned Out,Jonathan Levine,Routledge,2010-09-30,"Researchers have responded to urban sprawl, congestion, and pollution by assessing alternatives such as smart growth, new urbanism, and transit-oriented development. Underlying this has been the presumption that, for these options to be given serious consideration as part of policy reform, science has to prove that they will reduce auto use and increase transit, walking, and other physical activity. Zoned Out forcefully argues that the debate about transportation and land-use planning in the United States has been distorted by a myth?the myth that urban sprawl is the result of a free market. According to this myth, low-density, auto-dependent development dominates U.S. metropolitan areas because that is what Americans prefer. Jonathan Levine confronts the free market myth by pointing out that land development is already one of the most regulated sectors of the U.S. economy. Noting that local governments use their regulatory powers to lower densities, segregate different types of land uses, and mandate large roadways and parking lots, he argues that the design template for urban sprawl is written into the land-use regulations of thousands of municipalities nationwide. These regulations and the skewed thinking that underlies current debate mean that policy innovation, market forces, and the compact-development alternatives they might produce are often 'zoned out' of metropolitan areas. In debunking the market myth, Levine articulates an important paradigm shift. Where people believe that current land-use development is governed by a free-market, any proposal for policy reform is seen as a market intervention and a limitation on consumer choice, and any proposal carries a high burden of scientific proof that it will be effective. By reorienting the debate, Levine shows that the burden of scientific proof that was the lynchpin of transportation and land-use debates has been misassigned, and that, far from impeding market forces or limiting consumer choice, policy reform that removes regulatory obstacles would enhance both. A groundbreaking work in urban planning, transportation and land-use policy, Zoned Out challenges a policy environment in which scientific uncertainty is used to reinforce the status quo of sprawl and its negative consequences for people and their communities.",Political Science,233,N/A,0,en

Scattering Matrix Approach to Non-stationary Quantum Transport,Michael V. Moskalets,World Scientific,2012,"The aim of this book is to introduce the basic elements of the scattering matrix approach to transport phenomena in dynamical quantum systems of non-interacting electrons. This approach permits a physically clear and transparent description of transport processes in dynamical mesoscopic systems, promising basic elements of solid-state devices for quantum information processing. One of the key effects, the quantum pump effect, is considered in detail. In addition, the theory for the recently implemented new dynamical source ? injecting electrons with time delay much larger than an electron coherence time ? is offered. This theory provides a simple description of quantum circuits with such a single-particle source and shows in an unambiguous way that the tunability inherent to the dynamical systems (in contrast to the stationary ones) leads to a number of unexpected but fundamental effects.",Science,297,N/A,0,en

Behavioural Research for Transport Policy will improve the lines of communication between behavioural researchers and policy makers. The papers presented at the 1985 International Conference on Travel Behaviour cover the wide range of factors which need to be taken into account when gauging the effect behaviour has on transport requirements and usage. Contributions discuss the variety and usefulness of different survey frameworks; the lifestyle factors affecting transport use, and the problems of cost effectiveness in both survey techniques and the implementation of transport policy.",Transportation,512,N/A,0,en

From a series of lectures given by Calabresi as part of The Oliver Wendell Holmes Lectures delivered at Harvard Law School in March 1977. ""In his most recent publication, A Common Law for the Age of Statutes, based on the Oliver Wendell Holmes lectures he delivered at Harvard in March of 1977, Professor Calabresi has brought his ample juristic talents to bear on a foundational problem of the legal and democratic process. He has produced a monograph that in its quality, timeliness and provocativeness is likely to stand alongside the seminal works of Ronald Dworkin and Grant Gilmore."" --Allan C.

Energy and Civilization,Vaclav Smil,MIT Press,2018-11-13,"A comprehensive account of how energy has shaped society throughout history, from pre-agricultural foraging societies through today's fossil fuel–driven civilization. ""I wait for new Smil books the way some people wait for the next 'Star Wars' movie. In his latest book, Energy and Civilization: A History, he goes deep and broad to explain how innovations in humans' ability to turn energy into heat, light, and motion have been a driving force behind our cultural and economic progress over the past 10,000 years. —Bill Gates, Gates Notes, Best Books of the Year Energy is the only universal currency; it is necessary for getting anything done. The conversion of energy on Earth ranges from terra-forming forces of plate tectonics to cumulative erosive effects of raindrops. Life on Earth depends on the photosynthetic conversion of solar energy into plant biomass. Humans have come to rely on many more energy flows—ranging from fossil fuels to photovoltaic generation of electricity—for their civilized existence. In this monumental history, Vaclav Smil provides a comprehensive account of how energy has shaped society, from pre-agricultural foraging societies through today's fossil fuel–driven civilization. Humans are the only species that can systematically harness energies outside their bodies, using the power of their intellect and an enormous variety of artifacts—from the simplest tools to internal combustion engines and nuclear reactors. The epochal transition to fossil fuels affected everything: agriculture, industry, transportation, weapons, communication, economics, urbanization, quality of life, politics, and the environment. Smil describes humanity's energy eras in panoramic and interdisciplinary fashion, offering readers a magisterial overview. This book is an extensively updated and expanded version of Smil's Energy in World History (1994). Smil has incorporated an enormous amount of new material, reflecting the dramatic developments in energy studies over the last two decades and his own research over that time.",Science,564,N/A,0,en

Peanut Butter & Cupcake,Terry Border,Penguin,2014-07-29,"For fans of The Day the Crayons Quit, Little Pea, or How Are You Peeling? What’s a little piece of bread to do when he’s feeling lonely? Find a friend, of course! And that’s exactly what Peanut Butter tries to do. But sometimes friends are hard to come by, especially when Hamburger has to walk his (hot) dogs, Cupcake is too busy building castles in her sprinkle box, and Egg laughs so hard he starts to crack up! Does Peanut Butter have a soulmate? Young readers will know the answer long before Peanut Butter does and laugh along with each mismatched pairing. In a story that pairs silliness with poignancy, and friendship with anthropomorphic food, Terry Border, the photography mastermind behind the Bent Objects project, makes a triumphant entrance into the children's book world. Complete with a rhyming refrain, this is sure to be a favorite family read-aloud--and laugh-aloud.

Transportation Analytics in the Era of Big Data,"Satish V. Ukkusuri, Chao Yang",Springer,2018-07-28,"This book presents papers based on the presentations and discussions at the international workshop on Big Data Smart Transportation Analytics held July 16 and 17, 2016 at Tongji University in Shanghai and chaired by Professors Ukkusuri and Yang. The book is intended to explore a multidisciplinary perspective to big data science in urban transportation, motivated by three critical observations: The rapid advances in the observability of assets, platforms for matching supply and demand, thereby allowing sharing networks previously unimaginable. The nearly universal agreement that data from multiple sources, such as cell phones, social media, taxis and transit systems can allow an understanding of infrastructure systems that is critically important to both quality of life and successful economic competition at the global, national, regional, and local levels. There is presently a lack of unifying principles and methodologies that approach big data urban systems. The workshop brought together varied perspectives from engineering, computational scientists, state and central government, social scientists, physicists, and network science experts to develop a unifying set of research challenges and methodologies that are likely to impact infrastructure systems with a particular focus on transportation issues. The book deals with the emerging topic of data science for cities, a central topic in the last five years that is expected to become critical in academia, industry, and the government in the future. There is currently limited literature for researchers to know the opportunities and state of the art in this emerging area, so this book fills a gap by synthesizing the state of the art from various scholars and help identify new research directions for further study.",Business & Economics,240,N/A,0,en

Transportation and the Belt and Road Initiative,Nicolas de Loisy,N/A,2019-06-15,"We offer 2 editions of this book: a color edition and a black & white edition (B&W). The color edition is much better to appreciate the maps, graphs and photos included in this book, while the B&W edition is cheaper. We do not offer a Kindle edition because our maps, graphs and tables are not supported by Kindle. For digital versions of the book that support our maps and tables, please go to SCMO website. Abstract The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has received considerable critical attention from the infrastructure, political and media worlds. Most reports and articles on the subject are confused at best, when they are not completely misinformed or contradictory. To date there has been little agreement on the number of BRI projects, amounts spent, dates, and geographical distribution. A global information warfare campaign of mis-information, disinformation, and intoxication is currently at play about the BRI, which direct result is to confuse the situation even more... This book critically examines what China's BRI is about, clarifies the confusion, and answers many questions. It includes a first-time-ever-published list and statistical tables of all the BRI projects up to December 31st, 2018. A mixed-methods approach was used in the data analysis, and the theory of constraints underpins this research as a theoretical framework. BRI projects are classified by projects' name, date, status, value, country, region, industry, and transportation mode. Additional never-published-before tables describe seven transportation modes. These tables are instrumental to our understanding of the BRI and are unpacked and analyzed in great detail in one section of this book. This work also demonstrates how instrumental the BRI is to globalization, which in itself is conducive to humanity's evolution. It describes humanity's five key choke points, and apprehends how China and the BRI are addressing them. In conclusion, we share an interview with a special Chinese lady, who benefits from a long China history's oversight. She shows us the Chinese perception of China and of the world. She tells us what China's point of view and ambitions are, especially as far as the BRI is concerned. Praise for Transportation and the Belt and Road Initiative ""It is an excellent, comprehensive and detailed treatment of the Belt and Road Initiative. This book is far more useful than almost anything written on the topic."" - Parag Khanna, Author of Connectography, New York, USA ""This exhaustive study belongs within arm's reach on the desk and/ or nearby reference material shelf of any person or company involved in any manner, shape or form in the arena of ""moving stuff""."" - Joel Laykin, Secretary General of the IPPF, Hong Kong, China ""I trust this book would provide a good road map for policy makers and infrastructure developers in any developing countries amidst complex geo-political circumstances."" - Dr. D.

It is past of a sweeping three-volume description of how management in some forty industries embraced the computer and changed the American economy. Computers have fundamentally changed the nature of work in America. However it is difficult to grasp the full extent of these changes and their implications for the future of business. To begin the long process of understanding the effects of computing in American business, we need to know the history of how computers were first used, by whom and why. In this, the second volume of The Digital Hand, James W. Cortada combines detailed analysis with narrative history to provide a broad overview of computing's and telecomunications' role in over a dozen industries, ranging from Old Economy sectors like finance and publishing to New Economy sectors like digital photography and video games. He also devotes considerable attention to the rapidly changing media and entertainment industries which are now some of the most technologically advanced in the American economy. Beginning in 1950, when commercial applications of digital technology began to appear, Cortada examines the ways different industries adopted new technologies, as well as the ways their innovative applications influenced other industries and the US economy as a whole. He builds on the surveys presented in the first volume of the series, which examined sixteen manufacturing, process, transportation, wholesale and retail industries. In addition to this account, of computers' impact on industries, Cortada also demonstrates how industries themselves influenced the nature of digital technology. Managers, historians and others interested in the history of modern business will appreciate this historical analysis of digital technology's many roles and future possibilities in an wide array of industries. The Digital Hand provides a detailed picture of what the infrastructure of the Information Age really looks like and how we got there.",Computers,646,N/A,0,en

The American Transportation Revolution,Aaron W. Marrs,JHU Press,2024-04-09,"A history of steamboats and railroads in the United States prior to the Civil War. In the first half of the nineteenth century, transportation in the United States underwent an extraordinary transformation. Steamboats and railroads turned long-distance travel from an arduous undertaking into a regularized commodity: travel became something that people could purchase. Historians have long understood the economic and political ramifications of improved travel, but the social and cultural dimensions of early steam transit are less studied. In The American Transportation Revolution, Aaron W. Marrs explores the cultural influence of steamboats and railroads, which fascinated Americans across the country. Demonstrating the wide cultural reach of steam transit, Marrs draws from an eclectic set of sources, including children's books, comic almanacs, musical works, sermons, etiquette guides, cartoons, and employee rulebooks. This rich tapestry of cultural production helped ""naturalize"" steam technology for Americans before they ever encountered steam transit in person. Before ever seeing a railroad, Americans could read a novel that took place on a railroad, see an image of a train on currency, or purchase piano music imitating a train. These cultural artifacts made these new forms of transport feel familiar and natural. Marrs examines how cultural norms about travel emerged through the prescriptions of etiquette authors and the actions of travelers themselves, how enslaved people made innovative use of transportation networks to escape from slavery, and much more. Marrs convincingly demonstrates steam transportation's broad cultural impact on the United States, and how Americans, in turn, imprinted their own meaning on this new technology.",Transportation,220,N/A,0,en

Moving the Masses,Charles W. Cheape,Harvard University Press,1980,"The development of public transit is an integral part of both business and urban history in late nineteenth-century America. The author begins this study in 1880, when public transportation in large American cities was provided by numerous, competing horse-car companies with little or no public control of operation. By 1912, when the study concludes, a monopoly in each city operated a coordinated network of electric-powered streetcars and, in the largest cities, subways, which were regulated by city and state agencies. The history of transit development reflects two dominant themes: the constant pressure of rapid growth in city population and area and the requirements of the technology developed to service that growth. The case studies here include three of the four cites that had rapid transit during this period. Each case study examines, first, the mechanization of surface lines and, second, the implementation of rapid transit. New York requires an additional chapter on steam-powered, elevated railroads, for early population growth there required rapid transit before the invention of electric technology. Urban transit enterprise is viewed within a clear and familiar pattern of evolution--the pattern of the last half of the nineteenth century, when industries with expanding markets and complex, costly processes of production and distribution adopted new strategy and structure, administered by a new class of professional managers.",Business & Economics,316,N/A,0,en
A System at Risk,Harold W. Worrall,N/A,2005-10,"A System at Risk is a comprehensive analysis of the transportation dilemma in the United States that continues to affect the economic competitiveness and quality of life in America. Written for the layman and the professional alike, it describes an impending crisis in the surface transportation system, which is the foundation of economic vitality. Dr. Harold Worrall exposes the underlying relationship between transportation and economics by reviewing public economic theory and choice. Incremental policy making has done little to reduce automobile and truck traffic growth. Further, an analysis of traffic congestion demonstrates a geometric growth pattern for congestion even as traffic grows linearly. Dr. Worrall reviews the European Union and China for the manner in which they have addressed similar challenges. These competing economies are shown to have a strategy for dealing with surface transportation and are in stark contrast to that of the United States. Transportation funding is shown to be inadequate in volume and method of application as traffic volumes continue to grow. Dr. Worrall shows that there is a demonstrated need for transportation policies that consider a relationship between the price and consumption of transportation.",Transportation,196,N/A,0,en

Privatizing Transportation Systems,"Simon Hakim, Paul Seidenstat, Gary W. Bowman",Praeger,1996-11-25,"Privatization began in the 1970s with Carter's deregulation of some business, and increased with the Thatcher administration in the United Kingdom, the Reagan administration in the United States, and many communist and socialist countries. One area of concern in privatization is transportation—airports, water ports, roads, and mass transit. Privatization can be implemented in financing, construction, operation, and maintenance of the transportation system, the main motives being the belief that the private sector can be more efficient than the public sector, and because public funds are becoming less plentiful for a variety of reasons. The focus is on ideas and innovations for expanding the private role in transportation. Specifically covered are ideas and innovations for expanding the role of private sector in U.S. transportation projects, private financing of urban transportation, airport privatization, water port improvement, toll roads, and competitive contracting for transit services. The distinguished list of contributors includes the co-recipient of the 1996 Nobel Prize in Economics, William Vickrey. The audience for the work are scholars dealing with the discussions concerning the economics and politics of privatization, business people who are likely to be interested in potential opportunities, governmental regulators and staff, and policy makers.",Business & Economics,360,N/A,0,en

Creating the Twentieth Century,Vaclav Smil,Oxford University Press,2005-08-25,"The period between 1867 and 1914 remains the greatest watershed in human history since the emergence of settled agricultural societies: the time when an expansive civilization based on synergy of fuels, science, and technical innovation was born. At its beginnings in the 1870s were dynamite, the telephone, photographic film, and the first light bulbs. Its peak decade - the astonishing 1880s - brought electricity - generating plants, electric motors, steam turbines, the gramophone, cars, aluminum production, air-filled rubber tires, and prestressed concrete. And its post-1900 period saw the first airplanes, tractors, radio signals and plastics, neon lights and assembly line production. This book is a systematic interdisciplinary account of the history of this outpouring of European and American intellect and of its truly epochal consequences. It takes a close look at four fundamental classes of these epoch-making innovations: formation, diffusion, and standardization of electric systems; invention and rapid adoption of internal combustion engines; the unprecedented pace of new chemical syntheses and material substitutions; and the birth of a new information age. These chapters are followed by an evaluation of the lasting impact these advances had on the 20th century, that is, the creation of high-energy societies engaged in mass production aimed at improving standards of living.",Business & Economics,361,N/A,0,en
Transit Talk,Robert W. Snyder,Rutgers University Press,1997,"New York City may seem to be a place where everyone is a stranger, yet transit workers provide a human presence on a late-night bus or an empty subway platform. Few of us give any thought to these invisible workers-until something goes wrong. Transit Talk takes readers into the world of MTA New York City transit employees, as they describe their lives and work, from the most visible subway conductor to the seemingly invisible mechanic. There are nearly 44,000 transit workers like those you will meet in Transit Talk , and every day they help five million of us travel to work, to school, to weddings, to funerals, to hospitals, to vacations. These workers labor daily on subway tracks inches from high-voltage powerlines, risking their lives for passengers they'U never know. The city can feel large and fragmented, but the transportation system and its workers create common threads in the lives of all New Yorkers, threads we take for granted. Together, their stories create a human tableau of life and labor in the city within a city that is the MTA New York City Transit. Transit workers find satisfaction in fixing a damaged subway car, gain wisdom from mastering a dangerous workplace, nurse emotional wounds from tending to someone injured in an accident, battle frustration from difficulties with management, and express satisfaction when reflecting on a productive career. They tell of how years spent in the same shop create bonds between workers. They talk of the burden of laboring in a twenty-four-hour system with night shifts and weekend workdays that take them away from families. You'U hear painful tales of informing next-of-kin of a death on the tracks as well as joyous anecdotes of workers delivering a baby in a subway car.",Biography & Autobiography,204,N/A,0,en

Taking into account the way that IoT ecosystems are realized, several challenges can be identified. Among them of definite importance are (this list is, obviously, not exhaustive): (i) How to provide common representation and/or shared understanding of data that will enable analysis across (systematically growing) ecosystems? (ii) How to build ecosystems based on data flows? (iii) How to track data provenance? (iv) How to ensure/manage trust? (v) How to search for things/data within ecosystems? (vi) How to store data and assure its quality? Semantic technologies are often considered among the possible ways of addressing these (and other, related) questions. More precisely, in academic research and in industrial practice, semantic technologies materialize in the following contexts (this list is, also, not exhaustive, but indicates the breadth of scope of semantic technology usability): (i) representation of artefacts in IoT ecosystems and IoT networks, (ii) providing interoperability between heterogeneous IoT artefacts, (ii) representation of provenance information, enabling provenance tracking, trust establishment, and quality assessment, (iv) semantic search, enabling flexible access to data originating in different places across the ecosystem, (v) flexible storage of heterogeneous data. Finally, Semantic Web, Web of Things, and Linked Open Data are architectural paradigms, with which the aforementioned solutions are to be integrated, to provide production-ready deployments.",Technology & Engineering,424,N/A,0,en

Optimal Transport Statistics for Economics and Related Topics,"Nguyen Ngoc Thach, Vladik Kreinovich, Doan Thanh Ha, Nguyen Duc Trung",Springer Nature,2023-12-04,"This volume emphasizes techniques of optimal transport statistics, but it also describes and uses other econometric techniques, ranging from more traditional statistical techniques to more innovative ones such as quantiles (in particular, multidimensional quantiles), maximum entropy approach, and machine learning. Applications range from general analysis of GDP growth, stock market, and consumer prices to analysis of specific sectors of economics (construction, credit and banking, energy, health, labor, textile, tourism, international trade) to specific issues affecting economy such as bankruptcy, effect of Covid-19 pandemic, effect of pollution, effect of gender, cryptocurrencies, and the existence of shadow economy. Papers presented in this volume also cover data processing techniques, with economic and financial application being the unifying theme. This volume shows what has been achieved, but even more important are remaining open problems. We hope that this volume will: ˆ inspire practitioners to learn how to apply state-of-the-art techniques, especially techniques of optimal transport statistics, to economic and financial problems, and ˆ inspire researchers to further improve the existing techniques and to come up with new techniques for studying economic and financial phenomena.",Technology & Engineering,712,N/A,0,en

Designing Mobility and Transport Services,"Mike Tovey, Andree Woodcock, Jane Osmond",Taylor & Francis,2016-11-10,"European cities increasingly face problems caused by transport and traffic. For many people transport provision is unsatisfactory and current arrangements are leading to a deteriorating environment. A fundamental problem is that our currently fragmented approach makes it difficult to understand fully the circumstances and needs of transport users. In any overall approach public transport is a crucial component. Designing Mobility and Transport Services shows how these issues can be addressed and resolved. The development of an inclusive, validated passenger experience measurement instrument is the first step in understanding the situation and thus tackling it. It is needed if we are to create high quality, user centred, integrated, accessible public transport services, which are capable of attracting and retaining public transport users whilst meeting sustainability targets. The METPEX research project was devised to tackle these issues. Coordinated by Coventry University, the METPEX consortium brought together 16 European partners from 12 countries. The project’s underlying rationale was the proposition that if transport operators and authorities were provided with a robust, reliable and tailorable means of measuring the whole multimodal passenger journey, they could improve service provision. The book describes how such an improvement can be achieved, to attract travellers out of their private vehicles, thereby reducing congestion and pollution and increasing health and well-being. It provides a template for a creative approach and a meta-design narrative in designing for transport systems to enhance mobility choices by improving the door to door journey and thus underpin sustainable transport initiatives.",Business & Economics,281,N/A,0,en

This is an analysis of transport and land-use planning using strategic environmental assessment (SEA). It establishes the effectiveness of SEA through comparative studies of practice in three countries: Britain, the Netherlands and Germany. The author shows that use of SEA is widespread but far from systematic.

Hardening by Auditing,Eugene A. Razzetti,AuthorHouse,2015-02-23,"Developing an internal auditing capability within an organization is as important to the continued success of that organization as any other initiative or process. An audit is a systematic, independent, and documented process for obtaining evidence and evaluating it objectively to determine the extent to which audit criteria are fulfilled. Internal audits are audits conducted by on behalf of the organization itself for internal purposes, and can form the basis of the organizations self-declaration of conformity or compliance. A well-planned, effective, internal auditing program should consider the relative importance of the processes and areas to be audited. Dont waste time on the unimportant. The success of an organization is the sum of the effectiveness of Management authority, responsibility, and accountability. They are, in turn, the sum of the manner in which Management deals with the findings of the internal audits. The premise of this book and my reason for creating it is simple: 1. Our organizations (large and small public and private) and, in fact, our lives are in danger from both physical and cyber-attacks, because we remain incredibly uneducated, unstructured, and vulnerable, when it comes to threats to their security. 2. Organizational Security can be upgraded profoundly through a well-developed program of internal and outside audits. 3. Similar or co-located organizations can combine resources synergistically. That is, the whole of the effort will be greater than the sum of its parts. I have kept this work as compact as possible, so as to minimize reading time and maximize productivity. I write for no-nonsense managers with big responsibilities and limited resources. I refer often to four excellent ISO International Standards. They offer guidance for structuring effective management programs rapidly, regardless of whether or not organizations desire certification by accreditation bodies. I invite you to use my approach to Risk Management, as explained in the pages that follow. You will find it an effective and uncomplicated method for developing and monitoring your strategic plans. Developing a security mindset, using the checklists provided, and taking action on your findings will improve your security posture immediately and continuously. Good luck, and now lets get to work.",Business & Economics,114,N/A,0,en

Determination of Complex Reaction Mechanisms,"John Ross, Igor Schreiber, Marcel O. Vlad",Oxford University Press,2005-11-24,"In a chemical system with many chemical species several questions can be asked: what species react with other species: in what temporal order: and with what results? These questions have been asked for over one hundred years about simple and complex chemical systems, and the answers constitute the macroscopic reaction mechanism. In Determination of Complex Reaction Mechanisms authors John Ross, Igor Schreiber, and Marcel Vlad present several systematic approaches for obtaining information on the causal connectivity of chemical species, on correlations of chemical species, on the reaction pathway, and on the reaction mechanism. Basic pulse theory is demonstrated and tested in an experiment on glycolysis. In a second approach, measurements on time series of concentrations are used to construct correlation functions and a theory is developed which shows that from these functions information may be inferred on the reaction pathway, the reaction mechanism, and the centers of control in that mechanism. A third approach is based on application of genetic algorithm methods to the study of the evolutionary development of a reaction mechanism, to the attainment given goals in a mechanism, and to the determination of a reaction mechanism and rate coefficients by comparison with experiment. Responses of non-linear systems to pulses or other perturbations are analyzed, and mechanisms of oscillatory reactions are presented in detail. The concluding chapters give an introduction to bioinformatics and statistical methods for determining reaction mechanisms.",Science,239,5,1,en

Directions of Development of Transport Networks and Traffic Engineering,"Elżbieta Macioszek, Grzegorz Sierpiński",Springer,2018-07-30,"This book offers a collection of valuable guidelines for making decisions concerning the future development of transport networks and traffic engineering. The decision-making support systems described here will certainly attract the interest of those who face the challenge of finding solutions to problems concerning modern transport systems on a daily basis. Consequently, the book is chiefly intended for local authorities involved in planning and preparing development strategies for specific transport-related areas (in both urban and regional contexts), as well as for representatives of business and industry who are directly engaged in the implementation of traffic engineering solutions. The guidelines provided in the respective chapters help to address the given problem soundly, and to simplify the selection of an appropriate strategy. The topics covered include increasing the competitiveness of public transport, the status quo of electric vehicle infrastructures worldwide, methods for calming urban traffic as an element of sustainable transport development, speed traffic zones and electric buses, car-sharing systems in Poland, a method for deconstructing the regional travel demand model, monitoring urban traffic using floating car data, problems of deliveries in urban agglomeration distribution systems, estimating the number of threatened people in case of fire in road tunnels, and road pavement evaluation using advanced tools. Since the book also considers new approaches to theoretical models (including traffic flow surveys and measurements, transport behaviors, human factors in traffic engineering, and road condition modeling), it will also appeal to researchers and scientists studying these problems. The book gathers selected papers presented at the 15th Scientific and Technical Conference “Transport Systems.

Services in Switzerland,Peter Zweifel,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"by RolfM. Jeker, Federal Office for Foreign Economic Affairs Services have only quite recently become an important issue in foreign economic policy and particularly in international trade negotiations. Trade policy was traditionally perceived to deal almost exclusively with exports and imports of goods. The increasing importance of services both nationally and internationally is, mainly, due to the gains in agricultural and industrial productiv ity (freeing resources for services activities), and the progress in communication technology, facilitating trade in invisibles. Notable examples of contractual and legal frameworks for services in international trade relations are the internal market program of the European Community extended by the Agreement on the European Economic Are. a (EEA) to EFTA countries, the multi lateral Uruguay-Round negotiations under the auspices of the GATT on a General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) signed by the United States, Canada and Mexico. This trend is of particular significance to Switzerland, a country where services contribute about 65% to the value added of the economy, a share which will probably still increase somewhat. Ser vices also contribute to an important extent to the traditional surplus in the current account of the Swiss balance of payments. Switzerland clearly has comparative advantages in the field of ser vices, as is well demonstrated by its long and successful tradition in key services sectors like banking, insurance, tourism, consulting and engineering.",Business & Economics,282,N/A,0,en

Unitisation and Freight Transport in Australia,John Charles Arthur Sayers,N/A,1982,"This report provides a concise reference of development in unitisation and related freight transport system in Australia and overseas, 1) It outlines the worldwide evolution of pallett and container systems with particular reference to the problems of incompatibility between nation and international unitisation standards. 2) Unitisation and freight transport development in Australia. Describes the evolution of palletisation and containerisation in Australia and the interaction between development of domestic unitisation and freight transport systems. The impact of overseas developments, and especially the advent of international containerisation is also discussed. 3) Concludes with a brief outline of the compatibiliy dilemma caused by the separate evolution of national and international unitisation systems and suggests likely future direction in unitisation development and standardisation.

Long Distance Transport and Welfare of Farm Animals,Michael C. Appleby,CABI,2008,"Around 60 billion animals are bred for food each year worldwide and more than a billion are transported, often over long distances, every week. However, awareness and understanding of animal welfare, the factors that affect it and the correlation between it and other issues such as food safety and quality are increasing. Long distance transport can cause both physical and mental problems in animals and promoting animal welfare will be beneficial to both the animals and the agricultural and processing industries. In conjunction with a global coalition of NGOs working on animal transport and welfare, this volume brings together studies from well known animal scientists and researchers to review the implications and necessity of long distance animal transport for slaughter. Authoritative reports on regional practices are combined with discussions of the science, economics, legislation and procedures involved in this practice. This review will be essential for researchers and professionals within animal production and welfare as well as veterinary science.",Technology & Engineering,476,N/A,0,en

How to Become a Federal Criminal,Mike Chase,Simon and Schuster,2019-06-04,"In this “excellent book for people who like to start sentences with ‘Did you know that…’” (The New York Times), discover the most bizarre ways you might become a federal criminal in America—from mailing a mongoose to selling Swiss cheese without enough holes—written and illustrated by the creator of the wildly popular @CrimeADay Twitter account. Have you ever clogged a toilet in a national forest? That could get you six months in federal prison. Written a letter to a pirate? You might be looking at three years in the slammer. Leaving the country with too many nickels, drinking a beer on a bicycle in a national park, or importing a pregnant polar bear are all very real crimes, and this riotously funny, ridiculously entertaining, and fully illustrated book shows how just about anyone can become—or may already be—a federal criminal. Whether you’re a criminal defense lawyer or just a self-taught expert in outrageous offenses, How to Become a Federal Criminal is “an entertaining and humorous look at our criminal justice system” (Forbes).",Reference,320,N/A,0,en

Introduction to Modeling of Transport Phenomena in Porous Media,"Jacob Bear, Y. Bachmat",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The main purpose of this book is to provide the theoretical background to engineers and scientists engaged in modeling transport phenomena in porous media, in connection with various engineering projects, and to serve as a text for senior and graduate courses on transport phenomena in porous media. Such courses are taught in various disciplines, e. g. , civil engineering, chemical engineering, reservoir engineering, agricultural engineering and soil science. In these disciplines, problems are encountered in which various extensive quantities, e. g. , mass and heat, are transported through a porous material domain. Often the porous material contains several fluid phases, and the various extensive quantities are transported simultaneously throughout the multiphase system. In all these disciplines, management decisions related to a system's development and its operation have to be made. To do so, the 'manager', or the planner, needs a tool that will enable him to forecast the response of the system to the implementation of proposed management schemes. This forecast takes the form of spatial and temporal distributions of variables that describe the future state of the considered system. Pressure, stress, strain, density, velocity, solute concentration, temperature, etc. , for each phase in the system, and sometime for a component of a phase, may serve as examples of state variables. The tool that enables the required predictions is the model. A model may be defined as a simplified version of the real (porous medium) system that approximately simulates the excitation-response relations of the latter.",Science,575,N/A,0,en

BART,Michael C. Healy,Heyday.ORIM,2013-01-01,"An insider’s “indispensible” behind-the-scenes history of the transit system of San Francisco and surrounding counties (Houston Chronicle). In the first-ever history book about BART, longtime agency spokesman Michael C. Healy gives an insider’s account of the rapid transit system’s inception, hard-won approval, construction, and operations, warts and all. With a master storyteller’s wit and sharp attention to detail, Healy recreates the politically fraught venture to bring a new kind of public transit to the West Coast. What emerges is a sense of the individuals who made (and make) BART happen. From tales of staying up until 3:00 a.m. with BART pioneers Bill Stokes and Jack Everson to hear the election results for the rapid transit vote to stories of weathering scandals, strikes, and growing pains, this look behind the scenes of an iconic, seemingly monolithic structure reveals people at their most human—and determined to change the status quo. “The Metro. The T. The Tube. The world's most famous subway systems are known by simple monikers, and San Francisco's BART belongs in that class. Michael C. Healy delivers a tour-de-force telling of its roots, hard-fought approval, and challenging construction that will delight fans of American urban history.”—Doug Most, author of The Race Underground: Boston, New York, and the Incredible Rivalry That Built America's First Subway",Transportation,426,N/A,0,en

Modernity in Black and White,"Rafael Cardoso, Rafael Cardoso Denis",N/A,2020-09,"""The book provides a deeper understanding of modern art in the Brazilian context, moving the focus away from the self-declared avant-gardes and towards a broad panorama of modernizing tendencies throughout the period, 1890 to 1945. The backdrop of sertão, favelas, carnival and samba - often left out of accounts that restrict readings of modernism to erudite arenas like literature, fine art or architecture - are foregrounded in an attempt to situate artistic discourses within the social and political struggles of the period. Race, class and ideological conflict are given priority as tools for deconstructing complex debates, too often taken at face value or misread as merely reflexive of European phenomena. The anthropophagic movement (Antropofagia) rates special attention in teasing out the meanings of primitivism in the Brazilian context. The book examines a range of visual cultural materials including paintings, periodicals, graphics and photographs, revealing a hidden archive that calls into question the very essence of how modernism is usually perceived in Brazil. The enduring presence of archaism and violence behind an appearance of modernity reveals itself to be not an anomaly, but rather a product of the tensions inherent to the enduring oligarchical structures of Brazilian culture and society""--",Art and race,0,N/A,0,en

Critical Infrastructures Resilience,"Auroop Ratan Ganguly, Udit Bhatia, Stephen E. Flynn",Routledge,2018-02-21,"This text offers comprehensive and principled, yet practical, guidelines to critical infrastructures resilience. Extreme events and stresses, including those that may be unprecedented but are no longer surprising, have disproportionate effects on critical infrastructures and hence on communities, cities, and megaregions. Critical infrastructures include buildings and bridges, dams, levees, and sea walls, as well as power plants and chemical factories, besides lifeline networks such as multimodal transportation, power grids, communication, and water or wastewater. The growing interconnectedness of natural-built-human systems causes cascading infrastructure failures and necessitates simultaneous recovery. This text explores the new paradigm centered on the concept of resilience by approaching the challenges posed by globalization, climate change, and growing urbanization on critical infrastructures and key resources through the combination of policy and engineering perspectives. It identifies solutions that are scientifically credible, data driven, and sound in engineering principles while concurrently informed by and supportive of social and policy imperatives.

Estimating DoD Transportation Spending,Nancy Y. Moore,N/A,2007,"In FY 2003, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) spent nearly $7 billion on transportation, travel, and relocation services from commercial enterprises. Given a continuing need to make the most of existing resources, including those used for transportation, the U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) asked the RAND Corporation to conduct a spend analysis of transportation purchases. This analysis of combined individual contracting action report (DD350) and PowerTrack (PT) data indicates that DoD has additional opportunities to leverage transportation spending, particularly where it uses tenders to purchase transportation services. With such leveraging, TRANSCOM could better manage carriers; reduce rates; and improve quality, delivery, and visibility of services. Such improved management of spending and carriers could reduce DoD's total transportation spending while continuing to meet user requirements. Bringing business currently conducted through tenders under contract could improve incentives and accountability for carriers. Bringing more spending under contracts would also help DoD better meet small business goals.","Transportation, Military",135,N/A,0,en

The Resilient Enterprise,Yossi Sheffi,MIT Press,2007-02-23,"Stories from Nokia, Dell, UPS, Toyota, and other companies show how firms can reduce their vulnerability to high-impact distributions, from earthquakes to strikes, from SARS to terrorism, and use them for competitive advantage. What happens when fire strikes the manufacturing plant of the sole supplier for the brake pressure valve used in every Toyota? When a hurricane shuts down production at a Unilever plant? When Dell and Apple chip manufacturers in Taiwan take weeks to recover from an earthquake? When the U.S. Pacific ports are shut down during the Christmas rush? When terrorists strike? In The Resilient Enterprise, Yossi Sheffi shows that companies' fortunes in the face of such business shocks depend more on choices made before the disruption than they do on actions taken in the midst of it—and that resilience benefits firms every day, disaster or no disaster. He shows how companies can build in flexibility throughout their supply chains, based on proven design principles and the right culture—balancing security, redundancy, and short-term profits. And he shows how investments in resilience and flexibility not only reduce risk but create a competitive advantage in the increasingly volatile marketplace.Sheffi describes the way companies can increase security—reducing the likelihood of a disruption—with layered defenses, the tracking and analysis of “near-misses,” fast detection, and close collaboration with government agencies, trading partners, and even competitors. But the focus of the book is on resilience—the ability to bounce back from disruptions and disasters—by building in redundancy and flexibility. For example, standardization, modular design, and collaborative relationships with suppliers (and other stakeholders) can help create a robust supply chain. And a corporate culture of flexibility—with distributed decision making and communications at all levels—can create a resilient enterprise.Sheffi provides tools for companies to reduce the vulnerability of the supply chain they live in. And along the way he tells the stories of dozens of enterprises, large and small, including Toyota, Nokia, General Motors, Zara, Land Rover, Chiquita, Aisin Seiki, Southwest Airlines, UPS, Johnson and Johnson, Intel, Amazon.com, the U.S. Navy, and others, from across the globe. Their successes, failures, preparations, and methods provide a rich set of lessons in preparing for and managing disruptions.

Narrative Impact,"Melanie C. Green, Jeffrey J. Strange, Timothy C. Brock",Taylor & Francis,2003-01-30,"The impact of public narratives has been so broad (including effects on beliefs and behavior but extending beyond to emotion and personality), that the stakeholders in the process have been located across disciplines, institutions, governments, and, indeed, across epochs. Narrative Impact draws upon scholars in diverse branches of psychology and media research to explore the subjective experience of public narratives, the affordances of the narrative environment, and the roles played by narratives in both personal and collective spheres. The book brings together current theory and research presented primarily from an empirical psychological and communications perspective, as well as contributions from literary theory, sociology, and censorship studies. To be commensurate with the broad scope of influence of public narratives, the book includes the narrative mobilization of major social movements, the formation of self-concepts in young people, banning of texts in schools, the constraining impact of narratives on jurors in the court room, and the wide use of education entertainment to affect social changes. Taken together, the interdisciplinary nature of the book and its stellar list of contributors set it apart from many edited volumes. Narrative Impact will draw readership from various fields, including sociology, literary studies, and curriculum policy. Providing new explanatory concepts, this book: *is the first account on the psychology of narrative persuasion and brings together the relevant conceptualizations from within various sectors of psychology together with the major issues that concern cognate disciplines outside of psychology; *focuses on understanding the mechanisms that underlie the power of public narratives to achieve broad historical and social changes; *offers breakthroughs to the future: the role of ""presence"" in virtual reality narratives; the role of ""zines"" in females' fashioning of their selves; and the central role of imagery in transportation into narrative worlds; *explains varying roles of emotion in narrative immersion; and *addresses the growing blurring of fact and fiction: mechanisms and implications for beliefs and behavior.",History,396,N/A,0,en

Transport in Plants II,"U. Lüttge, M.G. Pitman",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"In the first part (Part A) of this volume on transport, there was an emphasis on the processes occurring at the membranes bounding the cells. It was convenient to distinguish active and passive processes of transport across the membranes, and to recognize that certain transport processes may be regulated by internal factors in the cells such as cytoplasmic pH, concentrations of ions, of malate or of sugar in the vacuoles, or the hydrostatic pressure. Cells in tissues and organs show the same kinds of properties as individual cells, but in addition there can be cell to cell transport related to the organization of the tissue. Firstly cells within a tissue are separated from the external solutions by a diffusion path comprising parts of the cell walls and intercellular spaces; more generally this extra-cytoplasmic part of the tissue has been called the apoplasm. A similar term is ""free space"". Secondly, the anatomy of cells in tissues seems to allow some facilitated, local transport between cells in a symplasm. Entry into the symplast and subsequent transport in a symplasmic continuum seems to be privileged, in that ions may not have to mix with the bulk of the cytoplasm and can pass from cell to cell in particular cytoplasmic structures, plasmodesmata. In Chara plants, this kind of transport is found operating across the multi-cellular nodes as the main means of transport between the long internodal cells.",Science,482,N/A,0,en

College Algebra and Trigonometry,"Richard N. Aufmann, Vernon C. Barker, Richard Nation",N/A,2001-07-11,"The Fourth Edition of College Algebra and Trigonometry continues to promote student success by engaging students in mathematics, thus helping them see the dynamic link between concepts and applications. The authors' hallmark approach, the Aufmann Interactive Method, encourages students to interact with math by presenting an annotated example, then guiding students with a Try Exercise, and finally presenting a worked-out solution for immediate reinforcement of the concept. A wealth of new features designed to enhance learning include more in-text guidance as well as special web-based resources, and an unparalleled Instructor's Annotated Edition facilitates teaching.New! An Instructor's Annotated Edition, unlike any other offered for this course, features reduced student text pages with special instructor resources in the margins: teaching tips, extra examples, ideas for reinforcing concepts, discussion suggestions, highlighted vocabulary and symbols, challenge problems, quizzes, suggested assignments, and references to transparencies that may be found both in the Instructor's Resource Manual and on the web site.New! Side-by-Side Solutions to examples pair an algebraic solution and a graphical representation to accommodate different learning styles.New! Technology-dependent modeling sections introduce the idea of mathematical modeling of data through linear, quadratic, exponential, logarithmic, and logistic regression.New! Integrated web resources include selected Take Note boxes (identified by a special web icon) which direct students to an interactive example or a downloadable file on the web site. These special resources can be used by instructors for presentation purposes orcan be assigned to students to help them 'visualize' a concept.New! Concept Lists now prominently feature all the major topics at the beginning of each section, preparing students for the concepts to follow.A wide range of applications, exercise sets, and supplemental exercises--many involving real data--encourage problem solving, skill building, group work, writing, and manipulation of graphing calculators.Exploring Concepts with Technology, a special end-of-chapter feature, expands on ideas introduced in the text by using technology to investigate extended mathematical applications or topics.Projects at the end of each exercise set are designed to encourage students (or groups of students) to research and write about mathematics and its applications. Additional Projects are included in the Instructor's Resource Manual and on the book's web site.Topics for Discussion, conceptual exercises included at the end of each section, can be used for discussion or writing assignments.Take Note and Math Matters (formerly called Point of Interest) margin notes alert students about interesting aspects of math history, applications, and points that require special attention.",Mathematics,974,N/A,0,en

The papers are grouped into four parts, each part representing an area in which Professor Judge has made a significant contribution. The authors have all benefited in some way, directly or indirectly, through an association with George Judge and his work. The three papers in Part I are concerned with various aspects of pre-test and Stein-rule estimation. Part II contains applications of Bayesian methodology, new developments in Bayesian methodology, and an overview of Bayesian econometrics. The papers in Part III comprise new developments in time-series analysis, improved estimation and Markov chain analysis. The final part on spatial equilibrium modeling contains papers that had their origins from Professor Judge's pioneering work in the 60's.",Business & Economics,400,N/A,0,en

As a young ornithology instructor at the Hog Island Audubon Camp, Dr. Stephen W. Kress learned that puffins had nested on nearby islands until extirpated by hunters in the late 1800s. To right this environmental wrong, he resolved to bring puffins back to one such island--Eastern Egg Rock. Yet bringing the plan to reality meant convincing skeptics, finding resources, and inventing restoration methods at a time when many believed in ""letting nature take its course."" Today, Project Puffin has restored more than 1,000 puffin pairs to three Maine islands. But even more exciting, techniques developed during the project have helped to restore rare and endangered seabirds worldwide. Further, reestablished puffins now serve as a window into the effects of global warming.

Magnetoresistance in Metals,A. B. Pippard,Cambridge University Press,1989-01-26,"First published in 1989, this book contained the first systematic account of magnetoresistance in metals, the study of which has provided solid-state physicists with much valuable information about electron motion in metals. The electrical resistance of a metal is usually changed when a magnetic field is applied to it; at low temperatures the change may be very large indeed and when magnetic breakdown is involved, very complex. Every metal behaves differently, and the effect is highly dependent on the direction of the field relative to the crystal axes. Quite apart from its usefulness for determining the Ferni surfaces of individual metals, the phenomenon presents many interesting problems in its own right; it is the phenomenon, rather than its applications, that Professor Pippard concentrates on in this book. The level of treatment is aimed at readers with a basic knowledge of undergraduate solid-state physics, and makes no great demand on mathematical ability. The text is copiously illustrated with real experimental results.",Science,270,N/A,0,en

Z,Therese Anne Fowler,Macmillan,2013-03-26,"THE INSPIRATION FOR THE TELEVISION DRAMA Z: THE BEGINNING OF EVERYTHING With brilliant insight and imagination, Therese Anne Fowler's New York Times bestseller Z brings us Zelda's irresistible story as she herself might have told it. I wish I could tell everyone who thinks we're ruined, Look closer...and you'll see something extraordinary, mystifying, something real and true. We have never been what we seemed. When beautiful, reckless Southern belle Zelda Sayre meets F. Scott Fitzgerald at a country club dance in 1918, she is seventeen years old and he is a young army lieutenant stationed in Alabama. Before long, the ""ungettable"" Zelda has fallen for him despite his unsuitability: Scott isn't wealthy or prominent or even a Southerner, and keeps insisting, absurdly, that his writing will bring him both fortune and fame. Her father is deeply unimpressed. But after Scott sells his first novel, This Side of Paradise, to Scribner's, Zelda optimistically boards a train north, to marry him in the vestry of St. Patrick's Cathedral and take the rest as it comes. What comes, here at the dawn of the Jazz Age, is unimagined attention and success and celebrity that will make Scott and Zelda legends in their own time. Everyone wants to meet the dashing young author of the scandalous novel—and his witty, perhaps even more scandalous wife. Zelda bobs her hair, adopts daring new fashions, and revels in this wild new world. Each place they go becomes a playground: New York City, Long Island, Hollywood, Paris, and the French Riviera—where they join the endless party of the glamorous, sometimes doomed Lost Generation that includes Ernest Hemingway, Sara and Gerald Murphy, and Gertrude Stein. Everything seems new and possible. Troubles, at first, seem to fade like morning mist. But not even Jay Gatsby's parties go on forever. Who is Zelda, other than the wife of a famous—sometimes infamous—husband? How can she forge her own identity while fighting her demons and Scott's, too?",Fiction,391,5,2,en

Chlorophyll a Fluorescence,"G.C. Papageorgiou, Govindjee",Springer Science & Business Media,2005-02-15,"Chlorophyll a Fluorescence: A Signature of Photosynthesis highlights chlorophyll (Chl) a fluorescence as a convenient, non-invasive, highly sensitive, rapid and quantitative probe of oxygenic photosynthesis. Thirty-one chapters, authored by 58 international experts, provide a solid foundation of the basic theory, as well as of the application of the rich information contained in the Chl a fluorescence signal as it relates to photosynthesis and plant productivity. Although the primary photochemical reactions of photosynthesis are highly efficient, a small fraction of absorbed photons escapes as Chl fluorescence, and this fraction varies with metabolic state, providing a basis for monitoring quantitatively various processes of photosynthesis. The book explains the mechanisms with which plants defend themselves against environmental stresses (excessive light, extreme temperatures, drought, hyper-osmolarity, heavy metals and UV). It also includes discussion on fluorescence imaging of leaves and cells and the remote sensing of Chl fluorescence from terrestrial, airborne, and satellite bases. The book is intended for use by graduate students, beginning researchers and advanced undergraduates in the areas of integrative plant biology, cellular and molecular biology, plant biology, biochemistry, biophysics, plant physiology, global ecology and agriculture.",Science,853,N/A,0,en
