Understanding by Design,"Grant P. Wiggins, Jay McTighe",ASCD,2005,"What is understanding and how does it differ from knowledge? How can we determine the big ideas worth understanding? Why is understanding an important teaching goal, and how do we know when students have attained it? How can we create a rigorous and engaging curriculum that focuses on understanding and leads to improved student performance in today's high-stakes, standards-based environment? Authors Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe answer these and many other questions in this second edition of Understanding by Design. Drawing on feedback from thousands of educators around the world who have used the UbD framework since its introduction in 1998, the authors have greatly revised and expanded their original work to guide educators across the K-16 spectrum in the design of curriculum, assessment, and instruction. With an improved UbD Template at its core, the book explains the rationale of backward design and explores in greater depth the meaning of such key ideas as essential questions and transfer tasks. Readers will learn why the familiar coverage- and activity-based approaches to curriculum design fall short, and how a focus on the six facets of understanding can enrich student learning. With an expanded array of practical strategies, tools, and examples from all subject areas, the book demonstrates how the research-based principles of Understanding by Design apply to district frameworks as well as to individual units of curriculum. Combining provocative ideas, thoughtful analysis, and tested approaches, this new edition of Understanding by Design offers teacher-designers a clear path to the creation of curriculum that ensures better learning and a more stimulating experience for students and teachers alike.",Education,383,3.5,7,en
The Perfect Capital,Karen Healey Wallace,Acorn Independent Press,2013-11-14,"“Like a Gill inscription itself: controlled, full of sexual tension, human, sensitive and with all this, rather wild and a bit unsettling.” - Lida Lopes Cardozo Kindersley Maud is dedicated to the art of lettercutting. Whilst observing a century-old inscription carved by Eric Gill into the outside wall of a London church, she is mistaken by Edward for a prostitute. She accepts his offer. Why does a woman seeking the precision and discipline of perfect letterforms abandon herself so recklessly to the undisciplined and all too imperfect world of Edward? What does rich, hedonistic city banker Edward see in the purposeful and unmaterialistic woman who is at least ten years older than his normal bedmates... and one still pining for her husband from whom she is separated? Lettercutting becomes not just a background, but an analogy for the search for perfection in an imperfect world. Can such shallow beginnings lead to a relationship that carves itself into their souls? The answer comes as a surprising end to this powerful and witty debut novel.",Fiction,285,N/A,0,en

Design Justice,Sasha Costanza-Chock,MIT Press,2020-03-03,"An exploration of how design might be led by marginalized communities, dismantle structural inequality, and advance collective liberation and ecological survival. What is the relationship between design, power, and social justice? “Design justice” is an approach to design that is led by marginalized communities and that aims expilcitly to challenge, rather than reproduce, structural inequalities. It has emerged from a growing community of designers in various fields who work closely with social movements and community-based organizations around the world. This book explores the theory and practice of design justice, demonstrates how universalist design principles and practices erase certain groups of people—specifically, those who are intersectionally disadvantaged or multiply burdened under the matrix of domination (white supremacist heteropatriarchy, ableism, capitalism, and settler colonialism)—and invites readers to “build a better world, a world where many worlds fit; linked worlds of collective liberation and ecological sustainability.” Along the way, the book documents a multitude of real-world community-led design practices, each grounded in a particular social movement. Design Justice goes beyond recent calls for design for good, user-centered design, and employment diversity in the technology and design professions; it connects design to larger struggles for collective liberation and ecological survival.",Design,358,N/A,0,en

Technically this is the second edition of The UX Book, but so much of it is new, it is more like a sequel. One of the major positive trends in UX is the continued emphasis on design—a kind of design that highlights the designer's creative skills and insights and embodies a synthesis of technology with usability, usefulness, aesthetics, and meaningfulness to the user. In this edition a new conceptual top-down design framework is introduced to help readers with this evolution. This entire edition is oriented toward an agile UX lifecycle process, explained in the funnel model of agile UX, as a better match to the now de facto standard agile approach to software engineering. To reflect these trends, even the subtitle of the book is changed to ""Agile UX design for a quality user experience. Designed as a how-to-do-it handbook and field guide for UX professionals and a textbook for aspiring students, the book is accompanied by in-class exercises and team projects. The approach is practical rather than formal or theoretical. The primary goal is still to imbue an understanding of what a good user experience is and how to achieve it.

Document Design,"Miles A. Kimball, Ann R. Hawkins",Bedford/St. Martin's,2007-12-12,"The technological revolution of the last ten years has radically changed document designers' materials, processes, and tools of the trade. In short, choices about everything from typography and color to planning and production have changed -- even multiplied. The first new text for the college market in ten years, Kimball and Hawkins' Document Design assumes from the start that students are working online to produce a fuller range of print and online documents, designed and delivered differently in a digital world. Through practical, accessible advice and examples, Kimball and Hawkins lay out the array of elements and choices that document designers need to consider, all in the context of a rhetorical framework that allows students to see the effects of those choices. The only text to integrate a range of theoretical perspectives, visual perception, visual culture, and visual rhetoric, Document Design teaches students to think more critically about their own design decisions and to keep usability in mind every step of the way. True to its message, this artfully designed text practices the principles it teaches and is sure to become a reference that students will keep.",Language Arts & Disciplines,440,N/A,0,en
The Jinni Key,Bethany Atazadeh,Grace House Press,2019-12-03,"She holds the key to his heart, and he wants it back. When Arie reveals her Gift, she thinks the worst is over. But she couldn't be more wrong. The only one who can save her now is a mermaid named Rena. Rena is the youngest daughter of the Sea King, and she's dreamed of the surface for years. But her first visit on her 16th birthday isn't what she expects. She watches a Jinni fall from the sky—and chooses to save him, despite her mother's warnings that all Jinn are evil. Once she meets Gideon, she can't get him out of her mind. And maybe, with a little help from Arie and some magic of her own, she doesn't have to... The Jinni Key is a loose ""Little Mermaid"" retelling. Set in a world that humans share with mermaids, dragons, and the elusive Jinn, this is not the fairytale you remember… If you enjoy fantasy worlds, magical races, and surprising spins on classic fairy tales, then you'll love this enchanting retelling of The Little Mermaid. WHAT READERS ARE SAYING: ""There was very little that I predicted, when there was a moment of loss I truly felt it, and I loved the unique spins she placed on the well-known THE LITTLE MERMAID tale."" Rachael Martin (Goodreads Reviewer) ""I went into this story super excited to find out more about Rena and Arie, and I was left unable to wait for the next book! I seriously read this book in one sitting (which left everything aching, but so worth it!). I absolutely loved The Stolen Kingdom, and book two did not disappoint. The Jinni Key's world-building was actually one of my favorites, so complex and detailed and very fun."" Sarah Sutton (Goodreads Reviewer) ""I couldn't even put the book down because I had to know what happened... These are the kind of retellings that I love because while the base story is weaved in there lightly the story doesn't rely on The Little Mermaid. It goes so far past that and you are invested in everything that is happening…"" Katelyn Spedden (Goodreads Reviewer) ""There is so much action going on in this book and as the story moved on, the stakes kept getting higher and higher - I couldn't put it down (read it in a few hours) and I can't wait to read the next book in the series!"" Elira Barnes (Goodreads Reviewer) ""This was an amazing second book! All of Bethany's hard work paid off ten fold! I loved how all the relationships developed and all the animal moments. I especially love Rena and her quirky personality. She makes an amazing POV character."" Andrea Roberts (Goodreads Reviewer) ""Once again, Bethany Atazadeh takes some risks with this Little Mermaid retelling and mixes in a lot of original story and world elements, along with engaging characters to make it an intriguing and magical read that I was sad to see end.""

Design to Live,"Azra Aksamija, Raafat Majzoub, Melina Philippou",MIT Press,2021-10-19,"The power of design to create a life worth living even in a refugee camp: designs, inventions, and artworks from the Azraq Refugee Camp in Jordan. This book shows how, even in the most difficult conditions--forced displacement, trauma, and struggle--design can help create a life worth living. Design to Live documents designs, inventions, and artworks created by Syrian refugees living in the Azraq Refugee Camp in Jordan. Through these ingenious and creative innovations--including the vertical garden, an arrangement necessitated by regulations that forbid planting in the ground; a front hall, fashioned to protect privacy; a baby swing made from recycled desks; and a chess set carved from a broomstick--refugees defy the material scarcity, unforgiving desert climate, and cultural isolation of the camp. Written in close collaboration with the residents of the camp, with text in both English and Arabic, Design to Live, reflects two perspectives on the camp: people living and working in Azraq and designers reflecting on humanitarian architecture within the broader field of socially engaged art and design. Architectural drawings, illustrations, photographs, narratives, and stories offer vivid testimony to the imaginative and artful ways that residents alter and reconstruct the standardized humanitarian design of the camp--and provide models that can be replicated elsewhere. The book is the product of a three-year project undertaken by MIT Future Heritage Lab, researchers and students with Syrian refugees at the Azraq Refugee Camp, CARE, Jordan, and the German-Jordanian University.

Mismatch,Kat Holmes,MIT Press,2018-10-16,"How inclusive methods can build elegant design solutions that work for all. Sometimes designed objects reject their users: a computer mouse that doesn't work for left-handed people, for example, or a touchscreen payment system that only works for people who read English phrases, have 20/20 vision, and use a credit card. Something as simple as color choices can render a product unusable for millions. These mismatches are the building blocks of exclusion. In Mismatch, Kat Holmes describes how design can lead to exclusion, and how design can also remedy exclusion. Inclusive design methods—designing objects with rather than for excluded users—can create elegant solutions that work well and benefit all. Holmes tells stories of pioneers of inclusive design, many of whom were drawn to work on inclusion because of their own experiences of exclusion. A gamer and designer who depends on voice recognition shows Holmes his “Wall of Exclusion,” which displays dozens of game controllers that require two hands to operate; an architect shares her firsthand knowledge of how design can fail communities, gleaned from growing up in Detroit's housing projects; an astronomer who began to lose her eyesight adapts a technique called “sonification” so she can “listen” to the stars. Designing for inclusion is not a feel-good sideline. Holmes shows how inclusion can be a source of innovation and growth, especially for digital technologies. It can be a catalyst for creativity and a boost for the bottom line as a customer base expands. And each time we remedy a mismatched interaction, we create an opportunity for more people to contribute to society in meaningful ways.",Technology & Engineering,173,N/A,0,en

All areas of engineering, parts of computer science and of course architecture and industrial design all claim to teach design. Yet the education of design tends ot follow tacit practices, without explicit assumptions, goals and processes. This book is premised on the belief that design education based on a cognitive science approach can lead to significant improvements in the effectiveness of university design courses and to the future capabilities of practicing designers. This applies to all professional areas of design. The book grew out of publications and a workshop focusing on design education. This volume attempts to outline a framework upon which new efforts in design education might be based. The book includes chapters dealing with six broad aspects of the study of design education: • Methodologies for undertaking studies of design learning • Longitudinal assessment of design learning • Methods and cases for assessing beginners, experts and special populations • Studies of important component processes • Structure of design knowledge • Design cognition in the classroom",Education,329,N/A,0,en

How to Design a Financial Management Information System,"Gerardo Uña, Richard Allen, Nicolas Botton",International Monetary Fund,2019-05-15,"A well-functioning financial management information system (FMIS) provides timely, reliable, and comprehensive reports that support implementation of the government's fiscal policies and fiscal rules, and the formulating, controlling, monitoring, and executing of the budget. The architecture of FMISs has undergone a transformation since these systems were first developed in the 1980s. Rather than attempting to cover all or most public financial management (PFM) functions, many FMISs now focus on a few core functions such as accounting and reporting, budget execution, and cash management. Yet a survey of 46 countries shows that many face severe challenges in transforming their FMIS into an effective tool of fiscal governance. These challenges relate to weaknesses in the system's core functions, its institutional coverage, the information technology platforms it uses, and the ease of sharing data with other IT systems. This How to Note discusses how to address these chal-lenges. Replacing an FMIS with an entirely new system may not be an optimal strategy. By utilizing the latest technology, a better approach may be to update or replace one or more core modules of the system: the so-called modular approach. Implementation of an effective FMIS, however, depends on two critical preconditions: strong political motivation and commitment, and the system's ability to meet ongoing and anticipated PFM needs.",,23,N/A,0,en

Reimagining Design,Kevin G. Bethune,MIT Press,2024-02-06,"The power of transformative design, multidisciplinary leaps, and diversity: lessons from a Black professional’s journey through corporate America. Design offers so much more than an aesthetically pleasing logo or banner, a beautification add-on after the heavy lifting. In Reimagining Design, Kevin Bethune shows how design provides a unique angle on problem-solving—how it can be leveraged strategically to cultivate innovation and anchor multidisciplinary teamwork. As he does so, he describes his journey as a Black professional through corporate America, revealing the power of transformative design, multidisciplinary leaps, and diversity. Bethune, who began as an engineer at Westinghouse, moved on to Nike (where he designed Air Jordans), and now works as a sought-after consultant on design and innovation, shows how design can transform both individual lives and organizations. In Bethune’s account, diversity, equity, and inclusion emerge as a recurring theme. He shows how, as we leverage design for innovation, we also need to consider the broader ecological implications of our decisions and acknowledge the threads of systemic injustice in order to realize positive change. His book is for anyone who has felt like the “other”—and also for allies who want to encourage anti-racist, anti-sexist, and anti-ageist behaviors in the workplace. Design transformation takes leadership—leaders who do not act as gatekeepers but, with agility and nimbleness, build teams that mirror the marketplace. Design in harmony with other disciplines can be incredibly powerful; multidisciplinary team collaboration is the foundation of future innovation.

Small Unmanned Fixed-wing Aircraft Design,"Andrew J. Keane, András Sóbester, James P. Scanlan",John Wiley & Sons,2017-12-04,"Small Unmanned Fixed-wing Aircraft Design is the essential guide to designing, building and testing fixed wing UAVs (or drones). It deals with aircraft from two to 150 kg in weight and is based on the first-hand experiences of the world renowned UAV team at the UK’s University of Southampton. The book covers both the practical aspects of designing, manufacturing and flight testing and outlines and the essential calculations needed to underpin successful designs. It describes the entire process of UAV design from requirements definition to configuration layout and sizing, through preliminary design and analysis using simple panel codes and spreadsheets to full CFD and FEA models and on to detailed design with parametric CAD tools. Its focus is on modest cost approaches that draw heavily on the latest digital design and manufacturing methods, including a strong emphasis on utilizing off-the-shelf components, low cost analysis, automated geometry modelling and 3D printing. It deliberately avoids a deep theoretical coverage of aerodynamics or structural mechanics; rather it provides a design team with sufficient insights and guidance to get the essentials undertaken more pragmatically. The book contains many all-colour illustrations of the dozens of aircraft built by the authors and their students over the last ten years giving much detailed information on what works best. It is predominantly aimed at under-graduate and MSc level student design and build projects, but will be of interest to anyone engaged in the practical problems of getting quite complex unmanned aircraft flying. It should also appeal to the more sophisticated aero-modeller and those engaged on research based around fixed wing UAVs.",Technology & Engineering,501,N/A,0,en

One of his most important works is Designing Programmes, which is presented here in a new edition of the original 1964 publication. In four essays, the author provides a basic introduction to his design methodology. Instead of set recipes, the method suggests a model for design in the early days of the computer era. The intellectual models it proposes, however, continue to be useful today. What it does not purvey is cut-and-dried, true-or-false solutions or absolutes of any kind - instead, it develops fundamental principles in an innovative and future-oriented way. The book is especially topical and exciting in the context of current developments in computational design, which seem to hold out the possibility of programmed design.

Laws of UX,Jon Yablonski,O'Reilly Media,2020-04-21,"An understanding of psychology—specifically the psychology behind how users behave and interact with digital interfaces—is perhaps the single most valuable nondesign skill a designer can have. The most elegant design can fail if it forces users to conform to the design rather than working within the ""blueprint"" of how humans perceive and process the world around them. This practical guide explains how you can apply key principles in psychology to build products and experiences that are more intuitive and human-centered. Author Jon Yablonski deconstructs familiar apps and experiences to provide clear examples of how UX designers can build experiences that adapt to how users perceive and process digital interfaces.

"Design, When Everybody Designs",Ezio Manzini,MIT Press,2015-02-20,"The role of design, both expert and nonexpert, in the ongoing wave of social innovation toward sustainability. In a changing world everyone designs: each individual person and each collective subject, from enterprises to institutions, from communities to cities and regions, must define and enhance a life project. Sometimes these projects generate unprecedented solutions; sometimes they converge on common goals and realize larger transformations. As Ezio Manzini describes in this book, we are witnessing a wave of social innovations as these changes unfold—an expansive open co-design process in which new solutions are suggested and new meanings are created. Manzini distinguishes between diffuse design (performed by everybody) and expert design (performed by those who have been trained as designers) and describes how they interact. He maps what design experts can do to trigger and support meaningful social changes, focusing on emerging forms of collaboration. These range from community-supported agriculture in China to digital platforms for medical care in Canada; from interactive storytelling in India to collaborative housing in Milan. These cases illustrate how expert designers can support these collaborations—making their existence more probable, their practice easier, their diffusion and their convergence in larger projects more effective. Manzini draws the first comprehensive picture of design for social innovation: the most dynamic field of action for both expert and nonexpert designers in the coming decades.",Design,257,N/A,0,en
Modular Online Learning Design,Amanda Nichols Hess,American Library Association,2020-12-14,"Does your online instruction program sometimes feel like a constant scramble to keep pace with requests and deadlines? Modular design is the answer. Approaching projects, whether large and small, with an eye towards future uses will put you on the path to accomplishing broader, organizational goals. And by intentionally building documentation and structure into your process, you will create content that can easily be scaled, modified, adapted, and transformed to meet different learner needs. Hess, experienced in online instruction in both K-12 and academic libraries, shows you how, using project examples of various sizes to illustrate each chapter’s concepts. Her resource guides you through such topics as the eight components of modular online learning design; key considerations for choosing the design model that best fits your organization and project; techniques for connecting your online learning goals with institutional strategy; using the IDEA process to align OER content with your instructional needs; documenting your planning with checklists, scaffolds, and templates; ensuring equity of access with all content formats using the Accessibility Inventory Index; principles for scaling up, down, or laterally; three models for more meaningful and functional collaboration with internal or external partners; and formative testing as a foundation for ongoing evaluation and assessment.",Language Arts & Disciplines,143,N/A,0,en

Design in Motion,Laura A. Frahm,MIT Press,2022-07-19,"The first comprehensive history in English of film at the Bauhaus, exploring practices that experimented with film as an adaptable, elastic “polymedium.” With Design in Motion, Laura Frahm proposes an alternate history of the Bauhaus—one in which visual media, and film in particular, are crucial to the Bauhaus’s visionary pursuit of integrating art and technology. In the first comprehensive examination in English of film at the Bauhaus, Frahm shows that experimentation with film spanned a range of Bauhaus practices, from textiles and typography to stage and exhibition design. Indeed, Bauhausler deployed film as an adaptable, elastic “polymedium,” malleable in shape and form, unfolding and refracting into multiple material, aesthetic, and philosophical directions. Frahm shows how the encounter with film imbued the Bauhaus of the 1920s and early 1930s with a flexible notion of design, infusing painting with temporal concepts, sculptures with moving forms, photographs with sequential aesthetics, architectural designs with a choreography of movement. Frahm considers, among other things, student works that explored light and the transparent features of celluloid and cellophane; weaving practices that incorporate cellophane; experimental films, social documentaries, and critical reportage by Bauhaus women; and the proliferation of film strips in posters, book covers, and other typographic work. Viewing the Bauhaus’s engagement with film through a media-theoretic lens, Frahm shows how film became a medium for “design in motion.” Movement and process, rather than stability and fixity, become the defining characteristics of Bauhaus educational, aesthetic, and philosophical ethos.",Art,429,N/A,0,en
Health Design Thinking,"Bon Ku, Ellen Lupton",MIT Press,2020-03-17,"Applying the principles of human-centered design to real-world health care challenges, from drug packaging to early detection of breast cancer. This book makes a case for applying the principles of design thinking to real-world health care challenges. As health care systems around the globe struggle to expand access, improve outcomes, and control costs, Health Design Thinking offers a human-centered approach for designing health care products and services, with examples and case studies that range from drug packaging and exam rooms to internet-connected devices for early detection of breast cancer. Written by leaders in the field—Bon Ku, a physician and founder of the innovative Health Design Lab at Sidney Kimmel Medical College, and Ellen Lupton, an award-winning graphic designer and curator at Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum—the book outlines the fundamentals of design thinking and highlights important products, prototypes, and research in health design. Health design thinking uses play and experimentation rather than a rigid methodology. It draws on interviews, observations, diagrams, storytelling, physical models, and role playing; design teams focus not on technology but on problems faced by patients and clinicians. The book's diverse case studies show health design thinking in action. These include the development of PillPack, which frames prescription drug delivery in terms of user experience design; a credit card–size device that allows patients to generate their own electrocardiograms; and improved emergency room signage.

The Politics of Design,Ruben Pater,BIS Publishers,2016-07-07,"Many designs that appear in today's society will circulate and encounter audiences of many different cultures and languages. With communication comes responsibility; are designers aware of the meaning and impact of their work? An image or symbol that is acceptable in one culture can be offensive or even harmful in the next. A typeface or colour in a design might appear to be neutral, but its meaning is always culturally dependent. If designers learn to be aware of global cultural contexts, we can avoid stereotyping and help improve mutual understanding between people. Politics of Design is a collection of visual examples from around the world. Using ideas from anthropology and sociology, it creates surprising and educational insight in contemporary visual communication. The examples relate to the daily practice of both online and offline visual communication: typography, images, colour, symbols, and information. Politics of Design shows the importance of visual literacy when communicating beyond borders and cultures. It explores the cultural meaning behind the symbols, maps, photography, typography, and colours that are used every day. It is a practical guide for design and communication professionals and students to create more effective and responsible visual communication.",Art,32,N/A,0,en
Design,John Heskett,OUP Oxford,2005-06-23,"John Heskett wants to transform the way we think about design by showing how integral it is to our daily lives, from the spoon we use to eat our breakfast cereal, and the car we drive to work in, to the medical equipment used to save lives. Design combines 'need' and 'desire' in the form of a practical object that can also reflect the user's identity and aspirations through its form and decoration. This concise guide to contemporary design goes beyond style and taste to look at how different cultures and individuals personalize objects. Heskett also reveals how simple objects, such as a toothpick, can have their design modified to suit the specific cultural behaviour in different countries. There are also fascinating insights into how major companies such as Nokia, Ford, and Sony approach design. Finally, the author gives us an exciting vision of what design can offer us in the future, showing in particular how it can humanize new technology.

Emotional Design,Don Norman,Basic Books,2007-03-20,"Why attractive things work better and other crucial insights into human-centered design Emotions are inseparable from how we humans think, choose, and act. In Emotional Design, cognitive scientist Don Norman shows how the principles of human psychology apply to the invention and design of new technologies and products. In The Design of Everyday Things, Norman made the definitive case for human-centered design, showing that good design demanded that the user's must take precedence over a designer's aesthetic if anything, from light switches to airplanes, was going to work as the user needed. In this book, he takes his thinking several steps farther, showing that successful design must incorporate not just what users need, but must address our minds by attending to our visceral reactions, to our behavioral choices, and to the stories we want the things in our lives to tell others about ourselves. Good human-centered design isn't just about making effective tools that are straightforward to use; it's about making affective tools that mesh well with our emotions and help us express our identities and support our social lives. From roller coasters to robots, sports cars to smart phones, attractive things work better. Whether designer or consumer, user or inventor, this book is the definitive guide to making Norman's insights work for you.",Design,276,N/A,0,en

Plants in Design,"Brad Davis, David Nichols",N/A,2021-04,"""The idea for Plants in Design emerged from Brad E. Davis' and David Nichols' love for plants and well-designed landscapes, and a frustration with the lack of concise information organized for those creating plant compositions. Most landscape and garden design texts focus either on design principles or on plant materials. The unique design of this book provides a palette of options organized by mature size and scale, covering many genres of plants from grasses to herbaceous perennials, woody shrubs and trees, and even annuals and interior plants. All of these genres are necessary for consideration when composing a well-designed landscape. Plants in Design combines two fundamental components of landscape and garden design: (1) principles and uses of plant material (color, line, texture, etc.) in design, and (2) resource information for analyzing and selecting a broad range of plant materials, from annuals and ground covers to shrubs and trees, for Southern landscapes (USDA hardiness zones 6 to 9). Introductory chapters will discuss plants and their uses in creating outdoor landscapes in settings ranging from small-scale applications (courtyards, walkways, etc.) to medium- and large-scale projects (streetscapes, parks etc.). The book includes many native species that should be used more in designs to benefit native wildlife and also points out the dangers of many non-native plants widely used in the past and now threatening natural ecosystems. A large audience of designers and homeowners will be interested in a well-organized book on designing with plants, without the confusing obscurities found in so many horticultural books that list cultivars and varieties impossible to locate in the nursery industry. The text features 500 Southern landscape plants organized into 13 categories, ranging from large trees to ferns and flowering annuals. Plant accounts include such things as scientific and common names, hardiness zones, flowers and fruit, growing conditions, and pests and diseases. Color photographs (approximately 1,750) will depict plant shape, form, characteristics, and landscape use, both for identification and to envisions how individual plants might appears in a composition.

Ruined by Design,Mike Monteiro,N/A,2024-10-18,"The world is working exactly as designed. The combustion engine which is destroying our planet's atmosphere and rapidly making it inhospitable is working exactly as we designed it. Guns, which lead to so much death, work exactly as they're designed to work. And every time we ""improve"" their design, they get better at killing. Facebook's privacy settings, which have outed gay teens to their conservative parents, are working exactly as designed. Their ""real names"" initiative, which makes it easier for stalkers to re-find their victims, is working exactly as designed. Twitter's toxicity and lack of civil discourse is working exactly as it's designed to work.The world is working exactly as designed. And it's not working very well. Which means we need to do a better job of designing it. Design is a craft with an amazing amount of power. The power to choose. The power to influence. As designers, we need to see ourselves as gatekeepers of what we are bringing into the world, and what we choose not to bring into the world. Design is a craft with responsibility. The responsibility to help create a better world for all. Design is also a craft with a lot of blood on its hands. Every cigarette ad is on us. Every gun is on us. Every ballot that a voter cannot understand is on us. Every time social network's interface allows a stalker to find their victim, that's on us. The monsters we unleash into the world will carry your name. This book will make you see that design is a political act. What we choose to design is a political act. Who we choose to work for is a political act. Who we choose to work with is a political act. And, most importantly, the people we've excluded from these decisions is the biggest (and stupidest) political act we've made as a society.If you're a designer, this book might make you angry. It should make you angry. But it will also give you the tools you need to make better decisions. You will learn how to evaluate the potential benefits and harm of what you're working on. You'll learn how to present your concerns. You'll learn the importance of building and working with diverse teams who can approach problems from multiple points-of-view. You'll learn how to make a case using data and good storytelling. You'll learn to say NO in a way that'll make people listen. But mostly, this book will fill you with the confidence to do the job the way you always wanted to be able to do it.

Kinship by Design,Ellen Herman,University of Chicago Press,2009-08-01,"What constitutes a family? Tracing the dramatic evolution of Americans’ answer to this question over the past century, Kinship by Design provides the fullest account to date of modern adoption’s history. Beginning in the early 1900s, when children were still transferred between households by a variety of unregulated private arrangements, Ellen Herman details efforts by the U.S. Children’s Bureau and the Child Welfare League of America to establish adoption standards in law and practice. She goes on to trace Americans’ shifting ideas about matching children with physically or intellectually similar parents, revealing how research in developmental science and technology shaped adoption as it navigated the nature-nurture debate. Concluding with an insightful analysis of the revolution that ushered in special needs, transracial, and international adoptions, Kinship by Design ultimately situates the practice as both a different way to make a family and a universal story about love, loss, identity, and belonging. In doing so, this volume provides a new vantage point from which to view twentieth-century America, revealing as much about social welfare, statecraft, and science as it does about childhood, family, and private life.",Social Science,394,N/A,0,en

Designing for Gesture and Tangible Interaction,"Mary Lou Maher, Lina Lee",Springer Nature,2022-05-31,"Interactive technology is increasingly integrated with physical objects that do not have a traditional keyboard and mouse style of interaction, and many do not even have a display. These objects require new approaches to interaction design, referred to as post-WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, and Pointer) or as embodied interaction design. This book provides an overview of the design opportunities and issues associated with two embodied interaction modalities that allow us to leave the traditional keyboard behind: tangible and gesture interaction. We explore the issues in designing for this new age of interaction by highlighting the significance and contexts for these modalities. We explore the design of tangible interaction with a reconceptualization of the traditional keyboard as a Tangible Keyboard, and the design of interactive three-dimensional (3D) models as Tangible Models. We explore the design of gesture interaction through the design of gesture-base commands for a walk-up-and-use information display, and through the design of a gesture-based dialogue for the willful marionette. We conclude with design principles for tangible and gesture interaction and a call for research on the cognitive effects of these modalities.",Computers,111,N/A,0,en

Design of Enterprise Systems,Ronald E. Giachetti,CRC Press,2011-05-19,"In practice, many different people with backgrounds in many different disciplines contribute to the design of an enterprise. Anyone who makes decisions to change the current enterprise to achieve some preferred structure is considered a designer. What is problematic is how to use the knowledge of separate aspects of the enterprise to achieve a globally optimized enterprise. The synthesis of knowledge from many disciplines to design an enterprise defines the field of enterprise engineering. Because enterprise systems are exceedingly complex, encompassing many independent domains of study, students must first be taught how to think about enterprise systems. Specifically written for advanced and intermediate courses and modules, Design of Enterprise Systems: Theory, Architecture, and Methods takes a system-theoretical perspective of the enterprise. It describes a systematic approach, called the enterprise design method, to design the enterprise. The design method demonstrates the principles, models, methods, and tools needed to design enterprise systems. The author uses the enterprise system design methodology to organize the chapters to mimic the completion of an actual project. Thus, the book details the enterprise engineering process from initial conceptualization of an enterprise to its final design. Pedagogical tools available include: For instructors: PowerPoint® slides for each chapter Project case studies that can be assigned as long-term projects to accompany the text Quiz questions for each chapter Business Process Analyzer software available for download For students: Templates, checklists, forms, and models to support enterprise engineering activities The book fills a need for greater design content in engineering curricula by describing how to design enterprise systems. Inclusion of design is also critical for business students, since they must realize the import their decisions may have on the long-term design of the enterprises they work with. The book’s practical focus and project-based approach coupled with the pedagogical tools gives students the knowledge and skills they need to lead enterprise engineering projects.",Business & Economics,448,5,2,en

Synthetic Aesthetics,"Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg, Jane Calvert, Pablo Schyfter, Alistair Elfick, Drew Endy",MIT Press,2017-01-06,"As synthetic biology transforms living matter into a medium for making, what is the role of design and its associated values? Synthetic biology manipulates the stuff of life. For synthetic biologists, living matter is programmable material. In search of carbon-neutral fuels, sustainable manufacturing techniques, and innovative drugs, these researchers aim to redesign existing organisms and even construct completely novel biological entities. Some synthetic biologists see themselves as designers, inventing new products and applications. But if biology is viewed as a malleable, engineerable, designable medium, what is the role of design and how will its values apply? In this book, synthetic biologists, artists, designers, and social scientists investigate synthetic biology and design. After chapters that introduce the science and set the terms of the discussion, the book follows six boundary-crossing collaborations between artists and designers and synthetic biologists from around the world, helping us understand what it might mean to 'design nature.' These collaborations have resulted in biological computers that calculate form; speculative packaging that builds its own contents; algae that feeds on circuit boards; and a sampling of human cheeses. They raise intriguing questions about the scientific process, the delegation of creativity, our relationship to designed matter, and, the importance of critical engagement. Should these projects be considered art, design, synthetic biology, or something else altogether? Synthetic biology is driven by its potential; some of these projects are fictions, beyond the current capabilities of the technology. Yet even as fictions, they help illuminate, question, and even shape the future of the field.",Science,372,N/A,0,en

PLC+,"Douglas Fisher, Nancy Frey, John Almarode, Karen Flories, Dave Nagel",Corwin,2019-05-16,"What makes a powerful and results-driven Professional Learning Community (PLC)? The answer is collaborative work that expands the emphasis on student learning and leverages individual teacher efficacy into collective teacher efficacy. PLC+: Better Decisions and Greater Impact by Design calls for strong and effective PLCs plus—and that plus is YOU. Until now, the PLC movement has been focused almost exclusively on students and what they were or were not learning. But keeping student learning at the forefront requires that we also recognize the vital role that you play in the equation of teaching and learning. This means that PLCs must take on two additional challenges: maximizing your individual expertise, while harnessing the power of the collaborative expertise you can develop with your peers. PLC+ is grounded in four cross-cutting themes—a focus on equity of access and opportunity, high expectations for all students, a commitment to building individual self-efficacy and the collective efficacy of the professional learning community and effective team activation and facilitation to move from discussion to action. The PLC+ framework supports educators in considering five essential questions as they work together to improve student learning: Where are we going? Where are we now? How do we move learning forward? What did we learn today? Who benefited and who did not benefit? The PLC+ framework leads educators to question practices as well as outcomes. It broadens the focus on student learning to encompass educational equity and teaching efficacy, and, in doing so, it leads educators to plan and implement learning communities that maximize individual expertise while harnessing the power of collaborative efficacy.",Education,217,N/A,0,en

Touching upon such issues as the emergence of the professional industrial designer, public work initiatives, debates about design as art, and the provocative notion of “anti-design,” Thomas argues that though Dutch design from the beginning has been driven by aims of functionality, simplicity, and affordability, it has also embraced luxury and exclusivity. The book also discusses the role played by leading Dutch designers and their works, including Wim Crouwel, Marcel Wanders, and the design collective Droog Design. An unprecedented, detailed history, Dutch Design Culture is a critical primer on one of the leading national design movements today.",Art,513,N/A,0,en

Designing Museum Experiences,Mark Walhimer,Rowman & Littlefield,2021-12-19,"Designing Museum Experiences is a “how-to” book for creating visitor-centered museums that emotionally and intellectually connect with museum visitors, stakeholders, and donors. Museums are changing from static, monolithic, and encyclopedic institutions to institutions that are visitor-centric, with shared authority that allows museum and visitors to become co-creators in content creation. Museum content is also changing, from static content to dynamic, evolving content that is multi-cultural and transparent regarding the evolution of facts and histories, allowing multi-person interpretations of events. Designing Museum Experiences leads readers through the methods and tools of the three stages of a museum visit (Pre-visit, In-Person Visit, and Post-visit), with a goal of motivating visitors to return and revisit the museum in the future. This museum visitation loop creates meaningful intellectual, emotional, and experiential value for the visitor. Using the business-world-proven methodologies of user centered design, Museum Visitor Experience leads the reader through the process of creating value for the visitor. Providing consistent messaging at all touchpoints (website, social media, museum staff visitor services, museum signage, etc.) creates a trusted bond between visitor and museum. The tools used to increase understanding of and encourage empathy for the museum visitor, and understand visitor motivations include: Empathy Mapping, Personas, Audience segmentation, Visitor Journey Mapping, Service Design Blueprints, System Mapping, Content Mapping, Museum Context Mapping, Stakeholder Mapping, and the Visitor Value Proposition. In the end, the reason for using the tools is to empower visitors and meet their emotional and intellectual needs, with the goal of creating a lifelong bond between museum and visitor. This is especially important as museums face a new post COVID-19 reality; only the most nimble, visitor-centered museums are likely to survive. The companion website to Designing Museum Experiences features: Links to additional visitor-centered museum information Downloadable sample documents and templates Bibliography of sources for further reading Online glossary of museum visitor experience terms Daily checklists of “how-to” provide and receive visitor-centered experiences More than 50 associated Designing Museum Experiences documents",Business & Economics,203,N/A,0,en

Designing Your New Work Life,"Bill Burnett, Dave Evans",Vintage,2021-10-26,"From the authors of the #1 New York Times bestseller Designing Your Life comes a revised, fully up-to-date edition of Designing Your New Work Life, a timely, urgently needed book that shows us how to transform our new uncharted work life into a meaningful dream job or company. With practical, useful tools, tips, and design ideas that show us how to navigate disruption (global, regional, or personal) and create new possibilities for our post-COVID work world and beyond. Bill Burnett and Dave Evans successfully taught graduate and undergraduate students at Stanford University and readers of their best-selling book, Designing Your Life (""The prototype for a happy life."" —Brian Lehrer, NPR), that designers don't analyze, worry, think, complain their way forward; they build their way forward. And now more than ever, we all need creative and adaptable tools to cope with the chaos caused by COVID-19. In Designing Your New Work Life, Burnett and Evans show us how design thinking can transform our present job, and how it can improve our experience of work in times of disruption. All disruption is personal, write Burnett and Evans, as with the life-altering global pandemic we are living through now. Designing Your New Work Life makes clear that disruption is the new normal, that it is here to stay and that it is accelerating. And in the book's new chapters, Burnett and Evans show us step by step, how to design our way through disruption and how to stay ahead of it—and thrive. Burnett and Evans's Disruption Design offers us a radical new concept that makes use of the designer mindsets: Curiosity, Reframing, Radical collaboration, Awareness, Bias to action, Storytelling, to find our way through these unchartered times. In Designing Your New Work Life, Burnett and Evans show us, with tools, tips, and design ideas, how we can make new possibilities available even when our lives have been disrupted (be it globally, regionally, or personally), giving us the tools to enjoy the present moment and allowing us to begin to prototype our possible future.",Business & Economics,401,N/A,0,en

Kennedy, a pipe bursts at Ann Lowe’s dress shop and ruins eleven dresses, including the expensive wedding dress, a dress that will be judged by thousands. A Black designer who has fought every step of the way, Ann knows this is only one struggle after a lifetime of them. She and her seamstresses will find the way to re-create the dresses. It may take all day and all night for the next week to accomplish the task, but they will do it. 1918, Tampa Raised in Jim Crow Alabama, Ann learned the art of sewing from her mother and her grandmother, a former slave, who are the most talented seamstresses in the state. After Ann elopes at twelve with an older man who soon proves himself to be an abusive alcoholic, her dreams of becoming a celebrated designer seem to be put on hold.

PostSecret,Frank Warren,Harper Collins,2005-11-29,"The project that captured a nation's imagination. The instructions were simple, but the results were extraordinary. ""You are invited to anonymously contribute a secret to a group art project. Your secret can be a regret, fear, betrayal, desire, confession, or childhood humiliation. Reveal anything -- as long as it is true and you have never shared it with anyone before. Be brief. Be legible. Be creative."" It all began with an idea Frank Warren had for a community art project. He began handing out postcards to strangers and leaving them in public places -- asking people to write down a secret they had never told anyone and mail it to him, anonymously. The response was overwhelming. The secrets were both provocative and profound, and the cards themselves were works of art -- carefully and creatively constructed by hand. Addictively compelling, the cards reveal our deepest fears, desires, regrets, and obsessions. Frank calls them ""graphic haiku,"" beautiful, elegant, and small in structure but powerfully emotional. As Frank began posting the cards on his website, PostSecret took on a life of its own, becoming much more than a simple art project. It has grown into a global phenomenon, exposing our individual aspirations, fantasies, and frailties -- our common humanity. Every day dozens of postcards still make their way to Frank, with postmarks from around the world, touching on every aspect of human experience. This extraordinary collection brings together the most powerful, personal, and beautifully intimate secrets Frank Warren has received -- and brilliantly illuminates that human emotions can be unique and universal at the same time.",Self-Help,290,N/A,0,en

Humans In-Training by Brooke Van Sickle and Elizabeth Savanella is a laugh-out-loud, children's picture book about Kobe, a puppy who must train his humans if he's ever going to be living the dog's life. If your child's been asking for a puppy, bring them home a children's dog book instead I really enjoyed this book because it reminded me of when my husband and I first got our dogs. It's a great book for a child because it helps them understand that having an animal is a big responsibility and that they need the owner to take care of them. The book is nicely written and has an adorable main character that a child can't help but fall in love with. The illustrations are beautifully done and go perfectly with the storyline. I think Brooke Van Sickle has done a wonderful job with this book and I can't wait to see what else she comes out with. -Tiffany Ferrell, Reader's Favorite Reviewer",Juvenile Fiction,0,5,1,en

They have answers.” –The New York Times). The book struck a chord, becoming an instant #1 New York Times bestseller. Now, in DESIGNING YOUR WORK LIFE: How to Thrive and Change and Find Happiness at Work they apply that transformative thinking to the place we spend more time than anywhere else: work. DESIGNING YOUR WORK LIFE teaches readers how to create the job they want—without necessarily leaving the job they already have. “Increasingly, it’s up to workers to define their own happiness and success in this ever-moving landscape,” they write, and chapter by chapter, they demonstrate how to build positive change, wherever you are in your career. Whether you want to stay in your job and make it a more meaningful experience, or if you decide it’s time to move on, Evans and Burnett show you how to visualize and build a work-life that is productive, engaged, meaningful, and more fun.",Business & Economics,305,N/A,0,en

Design Patterns Explained,"Alan Shalloway, James R. Trott",Pearson Education,2004-10-12,"""One of the great things about the book is the way the authors explain concepts very simply using analogies rather than programming examples–this has been very inspiring for a product I'm working on: an audio-only introduction to OOP and software development."" –Bruce Eckel ""...I would expect that readers with a basic understanding of object-oriented programming and design would find this book useful, before approaching design patterns completely. Design Patterns Explained complements the existing design patterns texts and may perform a very useful role, fitting between introductory texts such as UML Distilled and the more advanced patterns books."" –James Noble Leverage the quality and productivity benefits of patterns–without the complexity! Design Patterns Explained, Second Edition is the field's simplest, clearest, most practical introduction to patterns. Using dozens of updated Java examples, it shows programmers and architects exactly how to use patterns to design, develop, and deliver software far more effectively. You'll start with a complete overview of the fundamental principles of patterns, and the role of object-oriented analysis and design in contemporary software development. Then, using easy-to-understand sample code, Alan Shalloway and James Trott illuminate dozens of today's most useful patterns: their underlying concepts, advantages, tradeoffs, implementation techniques, and pitfalls to avoid. Many patterns are accompanied by UML diagrams. Building on their best-selling First Edition, Shalloway and Trott have thoroughly updated this book to reflect new software design trends, patterns, and implementation techniques. Reflecting extensive reader feedback, they have deepened and clarified coverage throughout, and reorganized content for even greater ease of understanding. New and revamped coverage in this edition includes Better ways to start ""thinking in patterns"" How design patterns can facilitate agile development using eXtreme Programming and other methods How to use commonality and variability analysis to design application architectures The key role of testing into a patterns-driven development process How to use factories to instantiate and manage objects more effectively The Object-Pool Pattern–a new pattern not identified by the ""Gang of Four"" New study/practice questions at the end of every chapter Gentle yet thorough, this book assumes no patterns experience whatsoever. It's the ideal ""first book"" on patterns, and a perfect complement to Gamma's classic Design Patterns. If you're a programmer or architect who wants the clearest possible understanding of design patterns–or if you've struggled to make them work for you–read this book.",Computers,449,5,1,en

Research into Design for a Connected World,Amaresh Chakrabarti,Springer,2019-01-08,"This book showcases cutting-edge research papers from the 7th International Conference on Research into Design (ICoRD 2019) – the largest in India in this area – written by eminent researchers from across the world on design processes, technologies, methods and tools, and their impact on innovation, for supporting design for a connected world. The theme of ICoRD‘19 has been “Design for a Connected World”. While Design traditionally focused on developing products that worked on their own, an emerging trend is to have products with a smart layer that makes them context aware and responsive, individually and collectively, through collaboration with other physical and digital objects with which these are connected. The papers in this volume explore these themes, and their key focus is connectivity: how do products and their development change in a connected world? The volume will be of interest to researchers, professionals and entrepreneurs working in the areas on industrial design, manufacturing, consumer goods, and industrial management who are interested in the use of emerging technologies such as IOT, IIOT, Digital Twins, I4.0 etc. as well as new and emerging methods and tools to design new products, systems and services.",Technology & Engineering,990,N/A,0,en

Hello World,Alice Rawsthorn,Abrams,2014-02-06,"Our gadgets, appliances, and cars are sleeker and more elegant than they’ve ever been; in our free time, we trawl the internet for pictures of flawless minimalist interiors; and even the great industrialist of our time—Steve Jobs—is admired more for his visual savvy than his technological inventiveness. And yet with Instagram and Pinterest at our fingers and great design more available—and more affordable—than ever, we’ve had no guidebook to this ever-fascinating field. Though it’s an inescapable part of our lives, there has been no single book that could, in one fell swoop, tell us everything we need to know about design. Enter Hello World. The design critic for the International Heard Tribune, Alice Rawsthorn has spent many years reckoning with the history of design and with its place in contemporary life, and Hello World is the extraordinary summation of her research and reporting. Rawsthorn takes us on a trip through design that ranges across continents and centuries, and wherever she goes, she discovers inspiring, thrilling examples of resourcefulness, inventiveness, and sheer vision. From the macabre symbol with which eighteenth-century pirates terrorized their victims into surrender, to one woman’s quest for the best prosthetic legs, to the evolution of the World Cup soccer ball, Hello World describes how warlords, scientists, farmers, hackers, activists, and professional designers have used the complex, often elusive process of design to different ends throughout history. Hailed as a “rapid-fire and illuminating ode to contemporary design†? (Telegraph) and “an extremely readable tour of the subject†? (Financial Times), Hello World is a major work that radically broadens our understanding of what design can mean, and explains how we can use it to make sense of our ever-changing universe.",Design,338,N/A,0,en

The Disobedience of Design,Gui Bonsiepe,Bloomsbury Publishing,2021-12-02,"This volume presents for the first time in English a curated selection of writings by the design thinker Gui Bonsiepe from the 1960s to the present day. Addressing as it does questions of non-Western design and a design practice that is both radical and democratic, Bonsiepe's work has assumed new importance for current debates inspired by global political and environmental crises. Structured into three sections, the anthology first addresses Bonsiepe's work on design theory and practice, particularly in relation to the history and contemporary relevance of the Ulm design school, where Bonsiepe was a professor in the 1960s. A second section then represents Bonsiepe's writings after his move to South America in the 1960s and '70s, where he worked as a design consultant for the Allende government in Chile before the military takeover. In writings from the period, Bonsiepe explores the concept of design 'at the periphery' and the relationship of national design traditions and practices in Latin American countries to those of 'the core' - Western European and American design. The final section comprises selections of Bonsiepe's writings on design in relation to literacy and language, visuality and cognition.

Schwab Kell is one of the last Antari—magicians with a rare, coveted ability to travel between parallel Londons; Red, Grey, White, and, once upon a time, Black. Kell was raised in Arnes—Red London—and officially serves the Maresh Empire as an ambassador, traveling between the frequent bloody regime changes in White London and the court of George III in the dullest of Londons, the one without any magic left to see. Unofficially, Kell is a smuggler, servicing people willing to pay for even the smallest glimpses of a world they'll never see. It's a defiant hobby with dangerous consequences, which Kell is now seeing firsthand. After an exchange goes awry, Kell escapes to Grey London and runs into Delilah Bard, a cut-purse with lofty aspirations. She first robs him, then saves him from a deadly enemy, and finally forces Kell to spirit her to another world for a proper adventure. Now perilous magic is afoot, and treachery lurks at every turn. To save all of the worlds, they'll first need to stay alive. ""A Darker Shade of Magic has all the hallmarks of a classic work of fantasy.

The book delves deep into 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Alien, Blade Runner, Total Recall, WALL·E, and Moon, studying the design tricks and inspirations that make each film transcend mere celluloid and become a believable reality. These studies are illustrated by film stills, concept art, type specimens, and ephemera, plus original interviews with Mike Okuda (Star Trek), Paul Verhoeven (Total Recall), and Ralph Eggleston and Craig Foster (Pixar). Typeset in the Future is an obsessively geeky study of how classic sci-fi movies draw us in to their imagined worlds.",Design,274,N/A,0,en

Pragmatic Power,William J. Eccles,Morgan & Claypool Publishers,2008,"Pragmatic Power is focused on just three aspects of the AC electrical power system that supplies and moves the vast majority of electrical energy nearly everywhere in the world: three-phase power systems, transformers, and induction motors. The reader needs to have had an introduction to electrical circuits and AC power, although the text begins with a review of the basics of AC power. Balanced three-phase systems are studied by developing their single-phase equivalents. The study includes a look at how the cost of ""power"" is affected by reactive power and power factor. Transformers are considered as a circuit element in a power system, one that can be reasonably modeled to simplify system analysis. Induction motors are presented as the most common way to change electrical energy into rotational energy. Examples include the correct selection of an induction motor for a particular rotating load. All of these topics include completely worked examples to aid the reader in understanding how to apply what has been learned. This short lecture book will be of use to students at any level of engineering, not just electrical, because it is intended for the practicing engineer or scientist looking for a practical, applied introduction to AC power systems. The authors ""pragmatic"" and applied style gives a unique and helpful ""nonidealistic, practical, and opinionated"" introduction to the topic.

Unified Theory of Reinforced Concrete,Thomas T.C. Hsu,Routledge,2017-09-29,"Reinforced concrete structures are subjected to a complex variety of stresses and strains. The four basic actions are bending, axial load, shear, and torsion. Presently, there is no single comprehensive theory for reinforced concrete structural behavior that addresses all of these basic actions and their interactions. Furthermore, there is little consistency among countries around the world in their building codes, especially in the specifications for shear and torsion. Unified Theory of Reinforced Concrete addresses this serious problem by integrating available information with new research data, developing one unified theory of reinforced concrete behavior that embraces and accounts for all four basic actions and their combinations. The theory is presented in a systematic manner, elucidating its five component models from a pedagogical and historical perspective while emphasizing the fundamental principles of equilibrium, compatibility, and the constitutive laws of materials. The significance of relationships between models and their intrinsic consistencies are emphasized. This theory can serve as the foundation on which to build a universal design code that can be adopted internationally. In addition to frames, the book explains the fundamental concept of the design of wall-type and shell-type structures. Unified Theory of Reinforced Concrete will be an important reference for all engineers involved in the design of concrete structures. The book can also serve well as a text for a graduate course in structural engineering.",Technology & Engineering,338,N/A,0,en

Work is defined as a process of performing a defined task or activity, such as research, development, operations, maintenance, repair, assembly, production, and so on. Very little is written on how to design, evaluate, justify, and integrate work. Using a comprehensive systems approach, this book facilitates a better understanding of work for the purpose of making it more effective and rewarding.",Technology & Engineering,312,N/A,0,en

Computational and Constructive Design Theory,W.D. Wallis,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-06-29,"Over the last several years, there has been a significant increase in compu tational combinatorics. The most widely reported results were, of course, the proof of the Four Color Theorem and the proof that there is no projective plane of parameter 10. Although the computer was essential in both proofs, the only reason for this was the fact that life is short. The computations involved were not different in kind from those which have been done by human brains without electronic assistance; they were just longer. Another important fact to notice is that both problems were theoretical, pure mathematical ones. The pursuit of the Four-Color Theorem has led to the development of whole branches of graph theory. The plane of parameter 10 is not an isolated case; its nonexistence is the first (and so far, the only) coun terexample to the conjecture that the Bruck-Chowla-Ryser conditions were necessary and sufficient for the existence of a symmetric balanced incomplete block design; the study of this problem has also led to a number of theoretical advances, including investigation of the relationship between codes and designs.",Mathematics,371,N/A,0,en

Combinatorics: A Guided Tour,David R. Mazur,American Mathematical Soc.,2020-02-19,"Combinatorics is mathematics of enumeration, existence, construction, and optimization questions concerning finite sets. This text focuses on the first three types of questions and covers basic counting and existence principles, distributions, generating functions, recurrence relations, Pólya theory, combinatorial designs, error correcting codes, partially ordered sets, and selected applications to graph theory including the enumeration of trees, the chromatic polynomial, and introductory Ramsey theory. The only prerequisites are single-variable calculus and familiarity with sets and basic proof techniques. The text emphasizes the brands of thinking that are characteristic of combinatorics: bijective and combinatorial proofs, recursive analysis, and counting problem classification. It is flexible enough to be used for undergraduate courses in combinatorics, second courses in discrete mathematics, introductory graduate courses in applied mathematics programs, as well as for independent study or reading courses. What makes this text a guided tour are the approximately 350 reading questions spread throughout its eight chapters. These questions provide checkpoints for learning and prepare the reader for the end-of-section exercises of which there are over 470.

New Statistics for Design Researchers,Martin Schmettow,Springer Nature,2021-07-13,"Design Research uses scientific methods to evaluate designs and build design theories. This book starts with recognizable questions in Design Research, such as A/B testing, how users learn to operate a device and why computer-generated faces are eerie. Using a broad range of examples, efficient research designs are presented together with statistical models and many visualizations. With the tidy R approach, producing publication-ready statistical reports is straight-forward and even non-programmers can learn this in just one day. Hundreds of illustrations, tables, simulations and models are presented with full R code and data included. Using Bayesian linear models, multi-level models and generalized linear models, an extensive statistical framework is introduced, covering a huge variety of research situations and yet, building on only a handful of basic concepts. Unique solutions to recurring problems are presented, such as psychometric multi-level models, beta regression for rating scales and ExGaussian regression for response times. A “think-first” approach is promoted for model building, as much as the quantitative interpretation of results, stimulating readers to think about data generating processes, as well as rational decision making. New Statistics for Design Researchers: A Bayesian Workflow in Tidy R targets scientists, industrial researchers and students in a range of disciplines, such as Human Factors, Applied Psychology, Communication Science, Industrial Design, Computer Science and Social Robotics. Statistical concepts are introduced in a problem-oriented way and with minimal formalism. Included primers on R and Bayesian statistics provide entry point for all backgrounds.

Implantable medical devices and human dignity. Private and secure access to information. Engineering projects that transform the Earth. Multigenerational information systems for international justice. How should designers, engineers, architects, policy makers, and others design such technology? Who should be involved and what values are implicated? In Value Sensitive Design, Batya Friedman and David Hendry describe how both moral and technical imagination can be brought to bear on the design of technology. With value sensitive design, under development for more than two decades, Friedman and Hendry bring together theory, methods, and applications for a design process that engages human values at every stage. After presenting the theoretical foundations of value sensitive design, which lead to a deep rethinking of technical design, Friedman and Hendry explain seventeen methods, including stakeholder analysis, value scenarios, and multilifespan timelines. Following this, experts from ten application domains report on value sensitive design practice. Finally, Friedman and Hendry explore such open questions as the need for deeper investigation of indirect stakeholders and further method development.

The Boulevard Book,"Allan B. Jacobs, Elizabeth MacDonald, Yodan Rofe",MIT Press,2003-08-29,"A celebration of the multiway boulevard and an argument for its revival, with design guidelines and historic examples. First built in Europe and grandly imported to the United States in the mid-nineteenth century, the classic multiway boulevard has been in decline for many years, victim of a narrowly focused approach to street design that views unencumbered vehicular traffic flow as the highest priority. The American preoccupation with destination and speed has made multiway boulevards increasingly rare as artifacts of the urban landscape. This book reintroduces the boulevard, tree-lined and with separate realms for through traffic and for slow-paced vehicular-pedestrian movement, as an important and often crucial feature of both historic and contemporary cities. It presents more than fifty boulevards—as varied as Avenue Montaigne, in Paris; C. G. Road, in Ahmedabad, India; and The Esplanade, in Chico, California—celebrating their usefulness and beauty. It discusses their history and evolution, the misconceptions that led to their near-demise in the United States, and their potential as a modern street type. Based on wide research, The Boulevard Book examines the safety of these streets and offers design guidelines for professionals, scholars, and community decision makers. Extensive plans, cross sections, and perspective drawings permit visual comparisons. The book shows how multiway boulevards respond to many issues that are central to urban life, including livability, mobility, safety, interest, economic opportunity, mass transit, and open space.",Architecture,282,N/A,0,en

Some C++ design decisions have been universally praised, while others remain controversial, and debated vigorously; still other features have been rejected based on experimentation. In this book, Stroustrup dissects many of these decisions to present a case study in ""real object- oriented language development"" for the working programmer. In doing so, he presents his views on programming and design in a concrete and useful way that makes this book a must-buy for every C++ programmer. Features Written by the inventor of C++: Bjarne Stroustrup Provides insights into the design decisions which shaped C++. Gives technical summaries of C++.

Design patterns are commonly accepted solutions to well-recognized design problems. In essence, they are a library of reusable components, only for software architecture, and not for a concrete implementation. The focus of this book is on the design patterns that naturally lend themselves to the needs of a C++ programmer, and on the patterns that uniquely benefit from the features of C++, in particular, the generic programming. Armed with the knowledge of these patterns, you will spend less time searching for a solution to a common problem and be familiar with the solutions developed from experience, as well as their advantages and drawbacks. The other use of design patterns is as a concise and an efficient way to communicate. A pattern is a familiar and instantly recognizable solution to specific problem; through its use, sometimes with a single line of code, we can convey a considerable amount of information. The code conveys: ""This is the problem we are facing, these are additional considerations that are most important in our case; hence, the following well-known solution was chosen."" By the end of this book, you will have gained a comprehensive understanding of design patterns to create robust, reusable, and maintainable code. What you will learnRecognize the most common design patterns used in C++Understand how to use C++ generic programming to solve common design problemsExplore the most powerful C++ idioms, their strengths, and drawbacksRediscover how to use popular C++ idioms with generic programmingUnderstand the impact of design patterns on the program’s performanceWho this book is for This book is for experienced C++ developers and programmers who wish to learn about software design patterns and principles and apply them to create robust, reusable, and easily maintainable apps.",Computers,499,N/A,0,en

Art Deco and Modernist Carpets,Susan Day,Chronicle Books,2002-10,"""In 1927, the critic Rene Chavance identified carpet production as the most successful of the decorative arts in achieving 'the more visionary aims of the times'. Susan Day's book, a work of original scholarship accompanied throughout by illustrations both of the carpets themselves and of contemporary interiors, demonstrates that these Art Deco carpets have lost none of their decorative power. A significant number of the carpets are shown precisely as they were meant to be seen, within the rooms for which they were made."" ""The fruits of the remarkable Art Deco efflorescence throughout Europe form the first part of the book. In the second, the focus turns to the reaction against the artistes-decorateurs by the champions of modernism. In France, the designs of Sonia Delaunay, Eileen Gray and Jean Lurcat evoked collage and Cubism; the Bauhaus and Scandinavia provided different influences. The fashion for abstract and modernist rugs was further stimulated by limited editions of rugs woven from works by such artists as Picasso, Klee and Miro, while in the USA, designers developed a style that was distinctly American."" ""This visual feast, of appeal not only to carpet collectors and textile specialists but to anyone with an interest in 20th-century design, ranges from the supremely imaginative achievements of Paul Poiret's unique weaving studio, the Ecole Martine, to the Scandinavian folk traditions of Marta Maas-Fjetterstrom, the innovations of Frank Lloyd Wright and Donald Deskey in the USA and Gunta Stolzl's handwoven carpets in Germany.

Cheap and Tasteful Dwellings,Jan Jennings,Univ. of Tennessee Press,2005,"In 1879, Carpentry and Building magazine launched its first house design competitionfor a cheap house. Forty-two competitions, eighty-six winning designs, and a slew ofnear winners and losers resulted in a body of work that offers an entire history of anarchitectural culture. The competitions represented a vital period of transition in delineating roles and responsibilities of architectural services and building trades. The contests helped to define the training, education, and values of ""practical architects"" and to solidify house-planning ideals. The lives and work of ordinary architects who competed in Carpentry and Building contests offer a reinterpretation of architectural professionalization in this time period.Cheap and Tasteful Dwellings thoroughly explores the results of these competitions, conducted over a thirty-year period from 1879 to 1909. The book outlines the philosophybehind and procedures developed for running the competitions; looks at characteristicsof the eighty-six winners of the competitions; examines the nature of architecturalpractices during the period; analyzes the winning competition designs; and providesbiographical details of competition winners and losers.A landmark book in architectural history, Cheap and Tasteful Dwellings makes a compelling case for the theory of convenient arrangement--its history, its role, its principles, its relationship to contemporary interior design education, and its meaning to American architecture. More importantly, the book explains the impact of Carpentry and Building's contests in furthering the tenets of convenient arrangement for house design. By using extensive material from the magazine, Jennings leaves little doubt as to how important this overlooked story is to the history of American architecture as a whole.",Architecture,364,N/A,0,en

Visual Thinking for Design,Colin Ware,Elsevier,2010-07-27,"Visual Thinking brings the science of perception to the art of design. Designers increasingly need to present information in ways that aid their audience's thinking process. Fortunately, results from the relatively new science of human visual perception provide valuable guidance. In this book, Colin Ware takes what we now know about perception, cognition, and attention and transforms it into concrete advice that designers can directly apply. He demonstrates how designs can be considered as tools for cognition – extensions of the viewer's brain in much the same way that a hammer is an extension of the user's hand. The book includes hundreds of examples, many in the form of integrated text and full-color diagrams. Experienced professional designers and students alike will learn how to maximize the power of the information tools they design for the people who use them. - Presents visual thinking as a complex process that can be supported in every stage using specific design techniques - Provides practical, task-oriented information for designers and software developers charged with design responsibilities - Includes hundreds of examples, many in the form of integrated text and full-color diagrams - Steeped in the principles of ""active vision, which views graphic designs as cognitive tools",Computers,210,4.5,5,en

The Electronic Design Automation Handbook,Dirk Jansen,Springer Science & Business Media,2010-02-23,"When I attended college we studied vacuum tubes in our junior year. At that time an average radio had ?ve vacuum tubes and better ones even seven. Then transistors appeared in 1960s. A good radio was judged to be one with more thententransistors. Latergoodradioshad15–20transistors and after that everyone stopped counting transistors. Today modern processors runing personal computers have over 10milliontransistorsandmoremillionswillbeaddedevery year. The difference between 20 and 20M is in complexity, methodology and business models. Designs with 20 tr- sistors are easily generated by design engineers without any tools, whilst designs with 20M transistors can not be done by humans in reasonable time without the help of Prof. Dr. Gajski demonstrates the Y-chart automation. This difference in complexity introduced a paradigm shift which required sophisticated methods and tools, and introduced design automation into design practice. By the decomposition of the design process into many tasks and abstraction levels the methodology of designing chips or systems has also evolved. Similarly, the business model has changed from vertical integration, in which one company did all the tasks from product speci?cation to manufacturing, to globally distributed, client server production in which most of the design and manufacturing tasks are outsourced.",Computers,672,N/A,0,en

"How to Design Programs, second edition","Matthias Felleisen, Robert Bruce Findler, Matthew Flatt, Shriram Krishnamurthi",MIT Press,2018-05-25,"A completely revised edition, offering new design recipes for interactive programs and support for images as plain values, testing, event-driven programming, and even distributed programming. This introduction to programming places computer science at the core of a liberal arts education. Unlike other introductory books, it focuses on the program design process, presenting program design guidelines that show the reader how to analyze a problem statement, how to formulate concise goals, how to make up examples, how to develop an outline of the solution, how to finish the program, and how to test it. Because learning to design programs is about the study of principles and the acquisition of transferable skills, the text does not use an off-the-shelf industrial language but presents a tailor-made teaching language. For the same reason, it offers DrRacket, a programming environment for novices that supports playful, feedback-oriented learning. The environment grows with readers as they master the material in the book until it supports a full-fledged language for the whole spectrum of programming tasks. This second edition has been completely revised. While the book continues to teach a systematic approach to program design, the second edition introduces different design recipes for interactive programs with graphical interfaces and batch programs. It also enriches its design recipes for functions with numerous new hints.

Design for Policy,Christian Bason,Routledge,2016-04-22,"Design for Policy is the first publication to chart the emergence of collaborative design approaches to innovation in public policy. Drawing on contributions from a range of the world’s leading academics, design practitioners and public managers, it provides a rich, detailed analysis of design as a tool for addressing public problems and capturing opportunities for achieving better and more efficient societal outcomes. In his introduction, Christian Bason suggests that design may offer a fundamental reinvention of the art and craft of policy making for the twenty-first century. From challenging current problem spaces to driving the creative quest for new solutions and shaping the physical and virtual artefacts of policy implementation, design holds a significant yet largely unexplored potential. The book is structured in three main sections, covering the global context of the rise of design for policy, in-depth case studies of the application of design to policy making, and a guide to concrete design tools for policy intent, insight, ideation and implementation. The summary chapter lays out a future agenda for design in government, suggesting how to position design more firmly on the public policy stage. Design for Policy is intended as a resource for leaders and scholars in government departments, public service organizations and institutions, schools of design and public management, think tanks and consultancies that wish to understand and use design as a tool for public sector reform and innovation.",Political Science,450,N/A,0,en
Design Thinking,"Hasso Plattner, Christoph Meinel, Larry Leifer",Springer Science & Business Media,2010-12-13,"“Everybody loves an innovation, an idea that sells.“ But how do we arrive at such ideas that sell? And is it possible to learn how to become an innovator? Over the years Design Thinking – a program originally developed in the engineering department of Stanford University and offered by the two D-schools at the Hasso Plattner Institutes in Stanford and in Potsdam – has proved to be really successful in educating innovators. It blends an end-user focus with multidisciplinary collaboration and iterative improvement to produce innovative products, systems, and services. Design Thinking creates a vibrant interactive environment that promotes learning through rapid conceptual prototyping. In 2008, the HPI-Stanford Design Thinking Research Program was initiated, a venture that encourages multidisciplinary teams to investigate various phenomena of innovation in its technical, business, and human aspects. The researchers are guided by two general questions: 1. What are people really thinking and doing when they are engaged in creative design innovation? How can new frameworks, tools, systems, and methods augment, capture, and reuse successful practices? 2. What is the impact on technology, business, and human performance when design thinking is practiced? How do the tools, systems, and methods really work to get the innovation you want when you want it? How do they fail? In this book, the researchers take a system’s view that begins with a demand for deep, evidence-based understanding of design thinking phenomena. They continue with an exploration of tools which can help improve the adaptive expertise needed for design thinking. The final part of the book concerns design thinking in information technology and its relevance for business process modeling and agile software development, i.e. real world creation and deployment of products, services, and enterprise systems.",Business & Economics,246,N/A,0,en

Frame Innovation,Kees Dorst,MIT Press,2015-03-27,"How organizations can use practices developed by expert designers to solve today's open, complex, dynamic, and networked problems. When organizations apply old methods of problem-solving to new kinds of problems, they may accomplish only temporary fixes or some ineffectual tinkering around the edges. Today's problems are a new breed—open, complex, dynamic, and networked—and require a radically different response. In this book, Kees Dorst describes a new, innovation-centered approach to problem-solving in organizations: frame creation. It applies “design thinking,” but it goes beyond the borrowed tricks and techniques that usually characterize that term. Frame creation focuses not on the generation of solutions but on the ability to create new approaches to the problem situation itself. The strategies Dorst presents are drawn from the unique, sophisticated, multilayered practices of top designers, and from insights that have emerged from fifty years of design research. Dorst describes the nine steps of the frame creation process and illustrates their application to real-world problems with a series of varied case studies. He maps innovative solutions that include rethinking a store layout so retail spaces encourage purchasing rather than stealing, applying the frame of a music festival to understand late-night problems of crime and congestion in a club district, and creative ways to attract young employees to a temporary staffing agency. Dorst provides tools and methods for implementing frame creation, offering not so much a how-to manual as a do-it-yourself handbook—a guide that will help practitioners develop their own approaches to problem-solving and creating innovation.",Business & Economics,221,N/A,0,en
Design for Reliability,"Dana Crowe, Alec Feinberg",CRC Press,2017-12-19,"Today's marketplace demands product reliability. At the same time, it places ever-increasing demands on products that push the limits of their performance and their functional life, and it does so with the expectation of lower per-unit product costs. To meet these demands, product design now requires a focused, streamlined, concurrent engineering process that will produce a product at the lowest possible cost in the least amount of time. Design for Reliability provides a systematic approach to the design process that is sharply focused on reliability and firmly based on the physics of failure. It imparts an understanding of how, why, and when to use the wide variety of reliability engineering tools available and offers fundamental insight into the total design cycle. Applicable from the idea phase of the product development cycle through product obsolescence, Design for Reliability (DfR) concepts integrated with reliability verification and analytical physics form a coherent stage gate/phase design process that helps ensure that a product will meet customers' reliability objectives. Whether you are a high-volume manufacturer of consumer items or a low volume producer of military commodities, your goal is the same: to bring a product to market using a process focused on designing out or mitigating potential failure modes prior to production release. Readers of Design for Reliability will learn to meet that goal and move beyond solidifying a basic offering to the marketplace to creating a true competitive advantage.",Technology & Engineering,252,N/A,0,en

Infrastructural Optimism,Linda C. Samuels,Routledge,2021-09-29,"Infrastructural Optimism investigates a new kind of twenty-first-century infrastructure, one that encourages a broader understanding of the interdependence of resources and agencies, recognizes a rightfully accelerated need for equitable access and distribution, and prioritizes rising environmental diligence across the design disciplines. Bringing together urban history, case studies, and speculative design propositions, the book explores and defines infrastructure as the basis for a new form of urbanism, emerging from the intersection of architecture, landscape architecture, and urban design. In defining this new infrastructure, the book introduces new dynamic and holistic performance metrics focused on ""measuring what matters"" over growth for the sake of growth and twelve criteria that define next generation infrastructure. By shifting the focus of infrastructure – our largest public realm – to environmental symbiosis and quality of life for all, design becomes a catalytic component in creating a more beautiful, productive, and optimistic future with Infrastructural Urbanism as its driver. Infrastructural Optimism will be invaluable to design, non-profit and agency professionals, and faculty and students in the fields of architecture, landscape architecture, and urban design, working in partnership with engineers, hydrologists, ecologists, urban planners, community members, and others who shape the built environment through the expanded field of infrastructure.",Architecture,423,N/A,0,en

Data Feminism,"Catherine D'Ignazio, Lauren F. Klein",MIT Press,2020-03-31,"A new way of thinking about data science and data ethics that is informed by the ideas of intersectional feminism. Today, data science is a form of power. It has been used to expose injustice, improve health outcomes, and topple governments. But it has also been used to discriminate, police, and surveil. This potential for good, on the one hand, and harm, on the other, makes it essential to ask: Data science by whom? Data science for whom? Data science with whose interests in mind? The narratives around big data and data science are overwhelmingly white, male, and techno-heroic. In Data Feminism, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein present a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics—one that is informed by intersectional feminist thought. Illustrating data feminism in action, D'Ignazio and Klein show how challenges to the male/female binary can help challenge other hierarchical (and empirically wrong) classification systems. They explain how, for example, an understanding of emotion can expand our ideas about effective data visualization, and how the concept of invisible labor can expose the significant human efforts required by our automated systems. And they show why the data never, ever “speak for themselves.” Data Feminism offers strategies for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work toward justice, and for feminists who want to focus their efforts on the growing field of data science. But Data Feminism is about much more than gender. It is about power, about who has it and who doesn't, and about how those differentials of power can be challenged and changed.",Social Science,328,N/A,0,en

Crafting Interpreters,Robert Nystrom,Genever Benning,2021-07-27,"Despite using them every day, most software engineers know little about how programming languages are designed and implemented. For many, their only experience with that corner of computer science was a terrifying ""compilers"" class that they suffered through in undergrad and tried to blot from their memory as soon as they had scribbled their last NFA to DFA conversion on the final exam. That fearsome reputation belies a field that is rich with useful techniques and not so difficult as some of its practitioners might have you believe. A better understanding of how programming languages are built will make you a stronger software engineer and teach you concepts and data structures you'll use the rest of your coding days. You might even have fun. This book teaches you everything you need to know to implement a full-featured, efficient scripting language. You'll learn both high-level concepts around parsing and semantics and gritty details like bytecode representation and garbage collection. Your brain will light up with new ideas, and your hands will get dirty and calloused. Starting from main(), you will build a language that features rich syntax, dynamic typing, garbage collection, lexical scope, first-class functions, closures, classes, and inheritance.

Until now, the aspiring DIY fashionista has been hard-pressed to find self-teaching tools other than dry textbooks or books with outdated looks. Finally, in Design-It-Yourself Clothes, former Urban Outfitters designer Cal Patch brings her youthful aesthetic to a how-to book. If you want to wear something you can’t find on store racks and make clothes that express your individual style, or if you’ve reached a sewing plateau and want to add pattern drafting to your repertoire, Design-It-Yourself Clothes is the book you have been waiting for. In five key projects (each with four variations)–a perfect-fitting dress, T-shirt, button-down shirt, A-line skirt, and pants–Patch shares the art of patternmaking. At its core, it’s much simpler than you think. Patch covers everything an intermediate sewer needs to know in order to become a fabulous fashion designer, from designing the patterns, taking your own measurements, and choosing fabrics to actually sewing the clothing. You will also learn how to stylize patterns by using darts, waistbands, patch pockets, and ruffles. Patch offers tips, explanations, options, and exercises throughout that will make the design process that much easier. But besides showing you how to create clothing from scratch, she also teaches you how to rub off patterns from existing clothing–so if you have a pair of pants that you love but are worn out, or you have your eye on a piece in the store with a prohibitive price tag, you can figure out how to get the looks you want by using your own two hands.",Crafts & Hobbies,162,N/A,0,en

By experiment we refer to that portion of research in which variables are manipulated and their effects upon other variables observed. It is well to distinguish the particular role of this chapter. It is not a chapter on experimental design in the Fisher (1925, 1935) tradition, in which an experimenter having complete mastery can schedule treatments and measurements for optimal statistical efficiency, with complexity of design emerging only from that goal of efficiency. Insofar as the designs discussed in the present chapter become complex, it is because of the intransigency of the environment: because, that is, of the experimenter’s lack of complete control.",Psychology,172,N/A,0,en

Deep Learning,"Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville",MIT Press,2016-11-10,"An introduction to a broad range of topics in deep learning, covering mathematical and conceptual background, deep learning techniques used in industry, and research perspectives. “Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject.” —Elon Musk, cochair of OpenAI; cofounder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX Deep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

Integrating Differentiated Instruction and Understanding by Design,"Carol Ann Tomlinson, Jay McTighe",ASCD,2006-01-15,"Teachers struggle every day to bring quality instruction to their students. Beset by lists of content standards and accompanying ""high-stakes"" accountability tests, many educators sense that both teaching and learning have been redirected in ways that are potentially impoverishing for those who teach and those who learn. Educators need a model that acknowledges the centrality of standards but also ensures that students truly understand content and can apply it in meaningful ways. For many educators, Understanding by Design addresses that need. Simultaneously, teachers find it increasingly difficult to ignore the diversity of the learners who populate their classrooms. Few teachers find their work effective or satisfying when they simply ""serve up"" a curriculum—even an elegant one—to students with no regard for their varied learning needs. For many educators, Differentiated Instruction offers a framework for addressing learner variance as a critical component of instructional planning. In this book the two models converge, providing readers fresh perspectives on two of the greatest contemporary challenges for educators: crafting powerful curriculum in a standards-dominated era and ensuring academic success for the full spectrum of learners. Each model strengthens the other. Understanding by Design is predominantly a curriculum design model that focuses on what we teach. Differentiated Instruction focuses on whom we teach, where we teach, and how we teach. Carol Ann Tomlinson and Jay McTighe show you how to use the principles of backward design and differentiation together to craft lesson plans that will teach essential knowledge and skills for the full spectrum of learners. Connecting content and kids in meaningful ways is what teachers strive to do every day. In tandem, UbD and DI help educators meet that goal by providing structures, tools, and guidance for developing curriculum and instruction that bring to students the best of what we know about effective teaching and learning.",Education,209,N/A,0,en

Cradle to Cradle,"William McDonough, Michael Braungart",North Point Press,2010-03-01,"A manifesto for a radically different philosophy and practice of manufacture and environmentalism ""Reduce, reuse, recycle"" urge environmentalists; in other words, do more with less in order to minimize damage. But as this provocative, visionary book argues, this approach perpetuates a one-way, ""cradle to grave"" manufacturing model that dates to the Industrial Revolution and casts off as much as 90 percent of the materials it uses as waste, much of it toxic. Why not challenge the notion that human industry must inevitably damage the natural world? In fact, why not take nature itself as our model? A tree produces thousands of blossoms in order to create another tree, yet we do not consider its abundance wasteful but safe, beautiful, and highly effective; hence, ""waste equals food"" is the first principle the book sets forth. Products might be designed so that, after their useful life, they provide nourishment for something new-either as ""biological nutrients"" that safely re-enter the environment or as ""technical nutrients"" that circulate within closed-loop industrial cycles, without being ""downcycled"" into low-grade uses (as most ""recyclables"" now are).

Golden Light: The Interior Design of Nickey Kehoe,"Todd Nickey, Amy Kehoe",Rizzoli Publications,2020-10-13,"A masterful combination of traditional inspiration with contemporary elegance. The sensibility of interior design firm Nickey Kehoe ranges from minimal to maximal, quiet to baroque, but always seeks to express the ephemeral feeling of a space. Designers Todd Nickey and Amy Kehoe are fascinated by how a room can come together to express its own persona, as though the design ""just happened."" Describing themselves as object-obsessed observers, Nickey and Kehoe pay keen attention to their clients' passions, preferences, and beloved pieces, juxtaposing elements and styles in deceptively simple ways. The result is interior design that appears as if it were a personal collection randomly put together, when in fact it is the product of their very mindful curating. Nickey Kehoe's studied but unfussy design is elegant but never staid, proud but humble, full of detail but resplendent with negative space. And then they add a bit of the unexpected--a combination of layered patterns and palettes, different time periods, humorous gestures, clever lighting--any element that keeps their impeccable sense of balance from becoming predictable or formulaic. This collection of residential interiors is for the curious, for lovers of studied but unfussy design, and for those who appreciate being surrounded by beautiful things with a story to tell.",House & Home,242,N/A,0,en

You find mistakes before they become bugs. You get early warning of design problems. You get immediate notification of side effect defects. You get to spend more time adding valuable features to your product. James is one of the few experts in applying TDD to embedded C. With his 1.5 decades of training,coaching, and practicing TDD in C, C++, Java, and C# he will lead you from being a novice in TDD to using the techniques that few have mastered. This book is full of code written for embedded C programmers. You don't just see the end product, you see code and tests evolve. James leads you through the thought process and decisions made each step of the way. You'll learn techniques for test-driving code right nextto the hardware, and you'll learn design principles and how to apply them to C to keep your code clean and flexible. To run the examples in this book, you will need a C/C++ development environment on your machine, and the GNU GCC tool chain or Microsoft Visual Studio for C++ (some project conversion may be needed).",Computers,486,N/A,0,en

Designing an Internet,David D. Clark,MIT Press,2018-10-30,"Why the Internet was designed to be the way it is, and how it could be different, now and in the future. How do you design an internet? The architecture of the current Internet is the product of basic design decisions made early in its history. What would an internet look like if it were designed, today, from the ground up? In this book, MIT computer scientist David Clark explains how the Internet is actually put together, what requirements it was designed to meet, and why different design decisions would create different internets. He does not take today's Internet as a given but tries to learn from it, and from alternative proposals for what an internet might be, in order to draw some general conclusions about network architecture. Clark discusses the history of the Internet, and how a range of potentially conflicting requirements—including longevity, security, availability, economic viability, management, and meeting the needs of society—shaped its character. He addresses both the technical aspects of the Internet and its broader social and economic contexts. He describes basic design approaches and explains, in terms accessible to nonspecialists, how networks are designed to carry out their functions. (An appendix offers a more technical discussion of network functions for readers who want the details.) He considers a range of alternative proposals for how to design an internet, examines in detail the key requirements a successful design must meet, and then imagines how to design a future internet from scratch. It's not that we should expect anyone to do this; but, perhaps, by conceiving a better future, we can push toward it.",Computers,433,N/A,0,en

Quantitative Biology,"Brian Munsky, William S. Hlavacek, Lev S. Tsimring",MIT Press,2018-08-21,"An introduction to the quantitative modeling of biological processes, presenting modeling approaches, methodology, practical algorithms, software tools, and examples of current research. The quantitative modeling of biological processes promises to expand biological research from a science of observation and discovery to one of rigorous prediction and quantitative analysis. The rapidly growing field of quantitative biology seeks to use biology's emerging technological and computational capabilities to model biological processes. This textbook offers an introduction to the theory, methods, and tools of quantitative biology. The book first introduces the foundations of biological modeling, focusing on some of the most widely used formalisms. It then presents essential methodology for model-guided analyses of biological data, covering such methods as network reconstruction, uncertainty quantification, and experimental design; practical algorithms and software packages for modeling biological systems; and specific examples of current quantitative biology research and related specialized methods. Most chapters offer problems, progressing from simple to complex, that test the reader's mastery of such key techniques as deterministic and stochastic simulations and data analysis. Many chapters include snippets of code that can be used to recreate analyses and generate figures related to the text. Examples are presented in the three popular computing languages: Matlab, R, and Python. A variety of online resources supplement the the text. The editors are long-time organizers of the Annual q-bio Summer School, which was founded in 2007. Through the school, the editors have helped to train more than 400 visiting students in Los Alamos, NM, Santa Fe, NM, San Diego, CA, Albuquerque, NM, and Fort Collins, CO. This book is inspired by the school's curricula, and most of the contributors have participated in the school as students, lecturers, or both. Contributors John H.

The contributors argue in different ways for a rethinking of design in the light of its cultural significance and its powerful position in today's society. The collection begins with a discussion of the various expressions of opposition to the modernists' purist approach toward design. Drawing on postmodernist theory and other critical strategies, the writers examine the relations among design, technology, and social organization to show how design has become a complex and multidisciplinary activity. The second section provides examples of new methods of interpreting and analysing design, ranging from rhetoric and semiotics to phenomenology, demonstrating how meaning is created visually. A final section related to design history shifts its emphasis to ideological frameworks such as capitalism and patriarchy that establish boundaries for the production and use of design.",Art,302,5,1,en

Bringing ideas into reality takes courage! In Drawing on Courage, designer, entrepreneur, and d.school teaching fellow Ashish Goel examines what it takes to be courageous. Using comics to illustrate real-world situations with humor and insight, Goel explains the four stages of every courage journey: fear, values, action, and change. And he helps you develop the skills you need to master each stage (even if it scares you), from embracing fear and defining the values that drive you forward to taking action when you're unsure and adapting to the changes that result from your courage. Each chapter features a series of tools designed to develop a mindset of fearlessness: Open the Tap to generate new ideas; develop A Risky Streak to take the all-important first step; or create an Origin Story to remember your purpose. Whether you're launching a side hustle or trying to convince your company to recycle, creativity takes pluck, nerve, and grit.

Microsystem Design,Stephen D. Senturia,Springer Science & Business Media,2005-12-20,"It is a real pleasure to write the Foreword for this book, both because I have known and respected its author for many years and because I expect this book’s publication will mark an important milestone in the continuing worldwide development of microsystems. By bringing together all aspects of microsystem design, it can be expected to facilitate the training of not only a new generation of engineers, but perhaps a whole new type of engineer – one capable of addressing the complex range of problems involved in reducing entire systems to the micro- and nano-domains. This book breaks down disciplinary barriers to set the stage for systems we do not even dream of today. Microsystems have a long history, dating back to the earliest days of mic- electronics. While integrated circuits developed in the early 1960s, a number of laboratories worked to use the same technology base to form integrated sensors. The idea was to reduce cost and perhaps put the sensors and circuits together on the same chip. By the late-60s, integrated MOS-photodiode arrays had been developed for visible imaging, and silicon etching was being used to create thin diaphragms that could convert pressure into an electrical signal. By 1970, selective anisotropic etching was being used for diaphragm formation, retaining a thick silicon rim to absorb package-induced stresses. Impurity- and electrochemically-based etch-stops soon emerged, and ""bulk micromachining"" came into its own.",Technology & Engineering,699,N/A,0,en

Place Advantage,"Sally Augustin, Neil Frankel, Cindy Coleman",John Wiley & Sons,2015-09-23,"Using psychology to develop spaces that enrich human experience Place design matters. Everyone perceives the world around them in a slightly different way, but there are fundamental laws that describe how people experience their physical environments. Place science principles can be applied in homes, schools, stores, restaurants, workplaces, healthcare facilities, and the other spaces people inhabit. This guide to person-centered place design shows architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and other interested individuals how to develop spaces that enrich human experience using concepts derived from rigorous qualitative and quantitative research. In Place Advantage: Applied Psychology for Interior Architecture, applied environmental psychologist Sally Augustin offers design practitioners accessible environmental psychological insights into how elements of the physical environment influence human attitudes and behaviors. She introduces the general principles of place science and shows how factors such as colors, scents, textures, and the spatial composition of a room, as well as personality and cultural identity, impact the experience of a place. These principles are applied to multiple building types, including residences, workplaces, healthcare facilities, schools, and retail spaces. Building a bridge between research and design practice, Place Advantage gives people designing and using spaces the evidence-based information and psychological insight to create environments that encourage people to work effectively, learn better, get healthy, and enjoy life.",Architecture,433,N/A,0,en

Critical Approaches to TV and Film Set Design,Geraint D'Arcy,Routledge,2018-09-25,"The analysis of scenic design in film and television is often neglected, with visual design elements relegated to part of the mise-en-scène in cinema or simply as ""wallpaper"" in television. Critical Approaches to TV and Film Set Design positions itself from the audience perspective to explore how we watch TV and film, and how set design enhances and influences the viewing experience. By using semiotics, history and narratology and adding concepts drawn from art, architecture and theatre, Geraint D’Arcy reworks the key concepts of set design. Looking at the impact of production design on how the viewer reads film and television, these updated theories can be applied more flexibly and extensively in academic criticism. D’Arcy creates a new theoretical approach, representing a significant expansion of the field and filling the remaining gaps. This book is ideal for anyone interested in understanding how we can read and interpret design in film and television, and should be the primary point of reference for those studying TV and film set design.",Performing Arts,345,N/A,0,en

Good design can have a hugely positive impact in terms of the recovery of patients and their hospital experience as a whole. Good design can also contribute to productivity and quality of the work experience for the staff. Design for Critical Care presents a thorough and insightful guide to the very best practice in intensive care design, focusing on design that has been successful and beneficial to both hospital staff and hospital patients. By making the connection between research evidence and design practice, D.

Designing with the Mind in Mind,Jeff Johnson,Morgan Kaufmann,2010-05-20,"Early user interface (UI) practitioners were trained in cognitive psychology, from which UI design rules were based. But as the field evolves, designers enter the field from many disciplines. Practitioners today have enough experience in UI design that they have been exposed to design rules, but it is essential that they understand the psychology behind the rules in order to effectively apply them. In Designing with the Mind in Mind, Jeff Johnson, author of the best selling GUI Bloopers, provides designers with just enough background in perceptual and cognitive psychology that UI design guidelines make intuitive sense rather than being just a list of rules to follow. - The first practical, all-in-one source for practitioners on user interface design rules and why, when and how to apply them - Provides just enough background into the reasoning behind interface design rules that practitioners can make informed decisions in every project - Gives practitioners the insight they need to make educated design decisions when confronted with tradeoffs, including competing design rules, time constrictions, or limited resources",Computers,201,N/A,0,en

The Design of Everyday Things,Don Norman,Constellation,2013-11-05,"Even the smartest among us can feel inept as we fail to figure out which light switch or oven burner to turn on, or whether to push, pull, or slide a door. The fault, argues this ingenious—even liberating—book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Don Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behavior. Now fully expanded and updated, with a new introduction by the author, The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how—and why—some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.",Business & Economics,370,N/A,0,en

Creating Significant Learning Experiences,L. Dee Fink,John Wiley & Sons,2003-06-17,"Dee Fink poses a fundamental question for all teachers: ""How can I create courses that will provide significant learning experiences for my students?"" In the process of addressing this question, he urges teachers to shift from a content-centered approach to a learning-centered approach that asks ""What kinds of learning will be significant for students, and how can I create a course that will result in that kind of learning?"" Fink provides several conceptual and procedural tools that will be invaluable for all teachers when designing instruction. He takes important existing ideas in the literature on college teaching (active learning, educative assessment), adds some new ideas (a taxonomy of significant learning, the concept of a teaching strategy), and shows how to systematically combine these in a way that results in powerful learning experiences for students. Acquiring a deeper understanding of the design process will empower teachers to creatively design courses for significant learning in a variety of situations.",Education,317,N/A,0,en

Drawdown,Paul Hawken,Penguin,2017-04-18,"• New York Times bestseller • The 100 most substantive solutions to reverse global warming, based on meticulous research by leading scientists and policymakers around the world “At this point in time, the Drawdown book is exactly what is needed; a credible, conservative solution-by-solution narrative that we can do it. Reading it is an effective inoculation against the widespread perception of doom that humanity cannot and will not solve the climate crisis. Reported by-effects include increased determination and a sense of grounded hope.” —Per Espen Stoknes, Author, What We Think About When We Try Not To Think About Global Warming “There’s been no real way for ordinary people to get an understanding of what they can do and what impact it can have. There remains no single, comprehensive, reliable compendium of carbon-reduction solutions across sectors. At least until now. . . . The public is hungry for this kind of practical wisdom.” —David Roberts, Vox “This is the ideal environmental sciences textbook—only it is too interesting and inspiring to be called a textbook.” —Peter Kareiva, Director of the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, UCLA In the face of widespread fear and apathy, an international coalition of researchers, professionals, and scientists have come together to offer a set of realistic and bold solutions to climate change. One hundred techniques and practices are described here—some are well known; some you may have never heard of. They range from clean energy to educating girls in lower-income countries to land use practices that pull carbon out of the air. The solutions exist, are economically viable, and communities throughout the world are currently enacting them with skill and determination. If deployed collectively on a global scale over the next thirty years, they represent a credible path forward, not just to slow the earth’s warming but to reach drawdown, that point in time when greenhouse gases in the atmosphere peak and begin to decline. These measures promise cascading benefits to human health, security, prosperity, and well-being—giving us every reason to see this planetary crisis as an opportunity to create a just and livable world.",Science,258,5,2,en

Speculative Everything,"Anthony Dunne, Fiona Raby",MIT Press,2013-12-06,"How to use design as a tool to create not only things but ideas, to speculate about possible futures. Today designers often focus on making technology easy to use, sexy, and consumable. In Speculative Everything, Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby propose a kind of design that is used as a tool to create not only things but ideas. For them, design is a means of speculating about how things could be—to imagine possible futures. This is not the usual sort of predicting or forecasting, spotting trends and extrapolating; these kinds of predictions have been proven wrong, again and again. Instead, Dunne and Raby pose “what if” questions that are intended to open debate and discussion about the kind of future people want (and do not want). Speculative Everything offers a tour through an emerging cultural landscape of design ideas, ideals, and approaches. Dunne and Raby cite examples from their own design and teaching and from other projects from fine art, design, architecture, cinema, and photography. They also draw on futurology, political theory, the philosophy of technology, and literary fiction. They show us, for example, ideas for a solar kitchen restaurant; a flypaper robotic clock; a menstruation machine; a cloud-seeding truck; a phantom-limb sensation recorder; and devices for food foraging that use the tools of synthetic biology. Dunne and Raby contend that if we speculate more—about everything—reality will become more malleable. The ideas freed by speculative design increase the odds of achieving desirable futures.",Design,235,N/A,0,en

Make It New,Barry M. Katz,MIT Press,2015-09-04,"The role of design in the formation of the Silicon Valley ecosystem of innovation. California's Silicon Valley is home to the greatest concentration of designers in the world: corporate design offices at flagship technology companies and volunteers at nonprofit NGOs; global design consultancies and boutique studios; research laboratories and academic design programs. Together they form the interconnected network that is Silicon Valley. Apple products are famously “Designed in California,” but, as Barry Katz shows in this first-ever, extensively illustrated history, the role of design in Silicon Valley began decades before Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak dreamed up Apple in a garage. Offering a thoroughly original view of the subject, Katz tells how design helped transform Silicon Valley into the most powerful engine of innovation in the world. From Hewlett-Packard and Ampex in the 1950s to Google and Facebook today, design has provided the bridge between research and development, art and engineering, technical performance and human behavior. Katz traces the origins of all of the leading consultancies—including IDEO, frog, and Lunar—and shows the process by which some of the world's most influential companies came to place design at the center of their business strategies. At the same time, universities, foundations, and even governments have learned to apply “design thinking” to their missions. Drawing on unprecedented access to a vast array of primary sources and interviews with nearly every influential design leader—including Douglas Engelbart, Steve Jobs, and Don Norman—Katz reveals design to be the missing link in Silicon Valley's ecosystem of innovation.",Design,281,N/A,0,en

Market Threads,Koray Çalişkan,Princeton University Press,2010-08-16,"What is a global market? How does it work? At a time when new crises in world markets cannot be satisfactorily resolved through old ideas, Market Threads presents a detailed analysis of the international cotton trade and argues for a novel and groundbreaking understanding of global markets. The book examines the arrangements, institutions, and power relations on which cotton trading and production depend, and provides an alternative approach to the analysis of pricing mechanisms. Drawing upon research from such diverse places as the New York Board of Trade and the Turkish and Egyptian countrysides, the book explores how market agents from peasants to global merchants negotiate, accept, reject, resist, reproduce, understand, and misunderstand a global market. The book demonstrates that policymakers and researchers must focus on the specific practices of market maintenance in order to know how they operate. Markets do not simply emerge as a relationship among self-interested buyers and sellers, governed by appropriate economic institutions. Nor are they just social networks embedded in wider economic social structures. Rather, global markets are maintained through daily interventions, the production of prosthetic prices, and the waging of struggles among those who produce and exchange commodities. The book illustrates the crucial consequences that these ideas have on economic reform projects and market studies. Spanning a variety of disciplines, Market Threads offers an original look at the world commodity trade and revises prevailing explanations for how markets work.",Business & Economics,249,N/A,0,en

Hegemann and Peets American Vitruvius,"Werner Hegemann, Elbert Peets",N/A,1988,"""American Vitruvius: an Architects' Handbook of Civic Art. At the end of the second decade of this [the twentieth] century, Werner Hegemann, a German-born urban planning theorist and practitioner, and Elbert Peets, a young American recently graduated from Harvard University's School of Landscape Architecture, joined together in Wisconsin in a professional partnership. The association of these two students of American urbanism culminated in 1922 with The American Vitruvius: an Architects' Handbook of Civic Art, a critical text that played an essential role in the definition and promotion of modern American city planning. American Vitruvius offers the reader an atlas of design solutions and advocates a humanistic, as well as rational, development of the urban environment. Princeton Architectural Press has reprinted the entire original text including the book's 1203 plates. These illustrations consist of plans, elevations, and perspective views of both European and American cities, spanning in date from the Renaissance to the twentieth century. The republication of this volume suggests the relevance of Hegemann and Peets' approach for contemporary city planning. Today, in the midst of an era responding to the de-humanization of the city, American Vitruvius offers a reconciliation of artistic aspects of civic art with scientific theory of city planning -- the authors insist upon a city that allows its residents both pleasure and freedom of expression""--Front flap.",Architecture,336,N/A,0,en

The Structure of Design,Leslie Earl Robertson,"The Monacelli Press, LLC",2017-05-02,"In The Structure of Design, Leslie Earl Robertson recounts a storied career in engineering which has generated among the most innovative and formally daring buildings of the modern era, as well as his extensive collaborations with several titans of the practice: Minoru Yamasaki, Philip Johnson, Max Abramovitz, Romaldo Giurgola, I. M. Pei, Pei Partnership, KPF, Kiyonori Kikutake, and Gunnar Birkerts. Robertson’s large-scale projects with some of the leading sculptors of the day, including Richard Serra and Beverly Pepper, display the range of this engineer’s craft. As a restless student from modest origins, Robertson’s first encounters with engineering were almost accidental, yet he would go on to be lead engineer of the landmark IBM buildings in Pittsburgh and Seattle while still in his early thirties. Immediately thereafter he embarked on what would become his most renowned project, the World Trade Center, to be followed by scores of major buildings around the world. The Structure of Design is a personal and accessible chronicle of the partnerships and problem-solving that have forged classics of modern architecture, and a privileged look at how the key discipline of engineering influences design, as told by a genius and poet of structure.",Architecture,337,N/A,0,en

Superhumanity,"Nick Axel, Beatriz Colomina, Nikolaus Hirsch, Anton Vidokle, Mark Wigley",U of Minnesota Press,2018-01-01,"A wide-ranging and challenging exploration of design and how it engages with the self The field of design has radically expanded. As a practice, design is no longer limited to the world of material objects but rather extends from carefully crafted individual styles and online identities to the surrounding galaxies of personal devices, new materials, interfaces, networks, systems, infrastructures, data, chemicals, organisms, and genetic codes. Superhumanity seeks to explore and challenge our understanding of “design” by engaging with and departing from the concept of the “self.” This volume brings together more than fifty essays by leading scientists, artists, architects, designers, philosophers, historians, archaeologists, and anthropologists, originally disseminated online via e-flux Architecture between September 2016 and February 2017 on the invitation of the Third Istanbul Design Biennial. Probing the idea that we are and always have been continuously reshaped by the artifacts we shape, this book asks: Who designed the lives we live today? What are the forms of life we inhabit, and what new forms are currently being designed? Where are the sites, and what are the techniques, to design others? This vital and far-reaching collection of essays and images seeks to explore and reflect on the ways in which both the concept and practice of design are operative well beyond tangible objects, expanding into the depths of self and forms of life.

Medium Design,Keller Easterling,Verso Books,2021-01-19,"How to Design the World: Working Without Solutions In Medium Design everyone is a designer. But design, in this case, inverts the typical focus on object over its settings to concentrate on the medium—the matrix space between objects, events, and ideological declarations. It disrupts habitual modern approaches to the world’s intractable dilemmas—from climate cataclysm to inequality to concentrations of authoritarian power. In a series of case studies dealing with everything from automation and migration to explosive urban growth and atmospheric changes, Medium Design offers spatial tools for innovation and global decision-making to challenge the authority of more familiar legal or economic approaches. From this perspective, solutions are mistakes and ideologies are unreliable guides. Rather than the modern desire for the new, designers find more sophistication in relationships between emergent and incumbent technologies. Encouraging entanglement, medium design does not try to eliminate problems but rather to put them together in productive combinations. And in the process of reconceptualizing design, Easterling puzzles over bulletproof powers, Stanley Kubrick, ISIS recruits, literary characters, and iconic activists in the hope of outwitting political deadlocks and offering forms of activism for modulating power and temperament in organizations of all kinds.",Art,177,N/A,0,en

Type Graphics,Margaret E. Richardson,Rockport Publishers,2000,"In the post-RayGun world of design, the use of type has become the singularly most important innovation in a new genre-deconstructive design. Whether on the page, screen or monitor, the digital creation, manipulation and use of type has transformed print media and new media. Design is now most dramatically judged on the use of type. Type can be emotive, expressive, illustrative, and interpretive, and a range of international designers working with type has managed to transform expectations and create startling designs which challenge static notions of the role of type in graphics. This volume presents some of the most innovative work from around the world with insight from the designers on their mission and creative process as it relates to the synthesis of type and image.",Design,192,N/A,0,en

Design for Safety,"Louis J. Gullo, Jack Dixon",John Wiley & Sons,2018-02-20,"A one-stop reference guide to design for safety principles and applications Design for Safety (DfSa) provides design engineers and engineering managers with a range of tools and techniques for incorporating safety into the design process for complex systems. It explains how to design for maximum safe conditions and minimum risk of accidents. The book covers safety design practices, which will result in improved safety, fewer accidents, and substantial savings in life cycle costs for producers and users. Readers who apply DfSa principles can expect to have a dramatic improvement in the ability to compete in global markets. They will also find a wealth of design practices not covered in typical engineering books—allowing them to think outside the box when developing safety requirements. Design Safety is already a high demand field due to its importance to system design and will be even more vital for engineers in multiple design disciplines as more systems become increasingly complex and liabilities increase. Therefore, risk mitigation methods to design systems with safety features are becoming more important. Designing systems for safety has been a high priority for many safety-critical systems—especially in the aerospace and military industries. However, with the expansion of technological innovations into other market places, industries that had not previously considered safety design requirements are now using the technology in applications. Design for Safety: Covers trending topics and the latest technologies Provides ten paradigms for managing and designing systems for safety and uses them as guiding themes throughout the book Logically defines the parameters and concepts, sets the safety program and requirements, covers basic methodologies, investigates lessons from history, and addresses specialty topics within the topic of Design for Safety (DfSa) Supplements other books in the series on Quality and Reliability Engineering Design for Safety is an ideal book for new and experienced engineers and managers who are involved with design, testing, and maintenance of safety critical applications. It is also helpful for advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students in engineering. Design for Safety is the second in a series of “Design for” books. Design for Reliability was the first in the series with more planned for the future.",Technology & Engineering,532,N/A,0,en

Medical Device Design,,Academic Press,2012-12-17,"This book provides the bridge between engineering design and medical device development. There is no single text that addresses the plethora of design issues a medical devices designer meets when developing new products or improving older ones. It addresses medical devices' regulatory (FDA and EU) requirements--some of the most stringent engineering requirements globally. Engineers failing to meet these requirements can cause serious harm to users as well as their products’ commercial prospects. This Handbook shows the essential methodologies medical designers must understand to ensure their products meet requirements. It brings together proven design protocols and puts them in an explicit medical context based on the author's years of academia (R&D phase) and industrial (commercialization phase) experience. This design methodology enables engineers and medical device manufacturers to bring new products to the marketplace rapidly. The medical device market is a multi-billion dollar industry. Every engineered product for this sector, from scalpelsstents to complex medical equipment, must be designed and developed to approved procedures and standards.

Order without Design,Alain Bertaud,MIT Press,2018-12-04,"An argument that operational urban planning can be improved by the application of the tools of urban economics to the design of regulations and infrastructure. Urban planning is a craft learned through practice. Planners make rapid decisions that have an immediate impact on the ground—the width of streets, the minimum size of land parcels, the heights of buildings. The language they use to describe their objectives is qualitative—“sustainable,” “livable,” “resilient”—often with no link to measurable outcomes. Urban economics, on the other hand, is a quantitative science, based on theories, models, and empirical evidence largely developed in academic settings. In this book, the eminent urban planner Alain Bertaud argues that applying the theories of urban economics to the practice of urban planning would greatly improve both the productivity of cities and the welfare of urban citizens. Bertaud explains that markets provide the indispensable mechanism for cities' development. He cites the experience of cities without markets for land or labor in pre-reform China and Russia; this “urban planners' dream” created inefficiencies and waste. Drawing on five decades of urban planning experience in forty cities around the world, Bertaud links cities' productivity to the size of their labor markets; argues that the design of infrastructure and markets can complement each other; examines the spatial distribution of land prices and densities; stresses the importance of mobility and affordability; and critiques the land use regulations in a number of cities that aim at redesigning existing cities instead of just trying to alleviate clear negative externalities. Bertaud concludes by describing the new role that joint teams of urban planners and economists could play to improve the way cities are managed.",Political Science,433,N/A,0,en

"QSAR, Rational Approaches to the Design of Bioactive Compounds","C. Silipo, A. Vittoria",Elsevier Publishing Company,1991,"Quantitative structure-activity relationships constitute a subject which has seen enormous growth in the past decade. Techniques which have been developed and used widely outside of medicinal chemistry are now used by those working with QSAR. These techniques employ powerful computers, molecular graphics systems and sophisticated software. Although QSAR techniques have been developed to optimize activities of known sets of analogs, recent methodologies suggest that these techniques can be useful in the modeling of new chemical entities. The contributions in this state-of-the-art volume cover a wide range of disciplines, tools and ideas which will be of interest to medicinal chemists, pharmacologists and biologists. The book gives an update of progress in the science of the quantitative approaches of the interface between chemistry, physical chemistry and biology-pharmacology. The use of molecular graphics, computational and conformational methods in drug research is extensively covered.",Medical,604,N/A,0,en

Designing with the Body,Kristina Hook,MIT Press,2018-11-13,"Interaction design that entails a qualitative shift from a symbolic, language-oriented stance to an experiential stance that encompasses the entire design and use cycle. With the rise of ubiquitous technology, data-driven design, and the Internet of Things, our interactions and interfaces with technology are about to change dramatically, incorporating such emerging technologies as shape-changing interfaces, wearables, and movement-tracking apps. A successful interactive tool will allow the user to engage in a smooth, embodied, interaction, creating an intimate correspondence between users' actions and system response. And yet, as Kristina Höök points out, current design methods emphasize symbolic, language-oriented, and predominantly visual interactions. In Designing with the Body, Höök proposes a qualitative shift in interaction design to an experiential, felt, aesthetic stance that encompasses the entire design and use cycle. Höök calls this new approach soma design; it is a process that reincorporates body and movement into a design regime that has long privileged language and logic. Soma design offers an alternative to the aggressive, rapid design processes that dominate commercial interaction design; it allows (and requires) a slow, thoughtful process that takes into account fundamental human values. She argues that this new approach will yield better products and create healthier, more sustainable companies. Höök outlines the theory underlying soma design and describes motivations, methods, and tools. She offers examples of soma design “encounters” and an account of her own design process. She concludes with “A Soma Design Manifesto,” which challenges interaction designers to “restart” their field—to focus on bodies and perception rather than reasoning and intellect.",Design,273,N/A,0,en

Domain-Driven Design Distilled,Vaughn Vernon,Addison-Wesley Professional,2016-06-01,"Domain-Driven Design (DDD) software modeling delivers powerful results in practice, not just in theory, which is why developers worldwide are rapidly moving to adopt it. Now, for the first time, there’s an accessible guide to the basics of DDD: What it is, what problems it solves, how it works, and how to quickly gain value from it. Concise, readable, and actionable, Domain-Driven Design Distilled never buries you in detail–it focuses on what you need to know to get results. Vaughn Vernon, author of the best-selling Implementing Domain-Driven Design, draws on his twenty years of experience applying DDD principles to real-world situations. He is uniquely well-qualified to demystify its complexities, illuminate its subtleties, and help you solve the problems you might encounter. Vernon guides you through each core DDD technique for building better software. You’ll learn how to segregate domain models using the powerful Bounded Contexts pattern, to develop a Ubiquitous Language within an explicitly bounded context, and to help domain experts and developers work together to create that language. Vernon shows how to use Subdomains to handle legacy systems and to integrate multiple Bounded Contexts to define both team relationships and technical mechanisms. Domain-Driven Design Distilled brings DDD to life. Whether you’re a developer, architect, analyst, consultant, or customer, Vernon helps you truly understand it so you can benefit from its remarkable power. Coverage includes What DDD can do for you and your organization–and why it’s so important The cornerstones of strategic design with DDD: Bounded Contexts and Ubiquitous Language Strategic design with Subdomains Context Mapping: helping teams work together and integrate software more strategically Tactical design with Aggregates and Domain Events Using project acceleration and management tools to establish and maintain team cadence",Computers,254,N/A,0,en
Deaddies,"Tobias Rehberger, Margrit Brehm",Hopeful Monster,2002,"""Deaddies"": a sarcastic-sounding neologism that can be found in no dictionary, but is by now well established in American slang. Its lexicographic roots stem from both the father and death, thereby providing a convenient shorthand for the Oedipal complex, while at the same time sounding cute when spoken out loud. Tobias Rehberger took this word as the name for his exhibition in Turin, and he takes it again as the title of this book. From his earliest works thorugh his most recent, the span of which is represented in this publication, Rehberger has perplexed viewers by confronting them with his constant production of new and unusual methods of art making. Uncategorizable in their ever varying style and medium, Rehberger's works share an existence as open communication systems, in both their production and their reception. Often reflecting the artist's preoccupation with his personal environment--his friends, other artists, gallery owners, and art collectors--Rehberger's installations create public spaces for unexpected but familiar interractions, questioning context, society, and environmental issues.",Art,136,N/A,0,en

The Experimenters,Eva Díaz,University of Chicago Press,2015,"Practically every major artistic figure of the mid-twentieth century spent some time at Black Mountain College: Harry Callahan, Merce Cunningham, Walter Gropius, Willem and Elaine de Kooning, Robert Motherwell, Robert Rauschenberg, Aaron Siskind, Cy Twombly - the list goes on and on. Yet scholars have tended to view these artists' time at the college as little more than prologue, a step on their way to greatness. With The Experimenters, Eva Diaz reveals the influence of Black Mountain College - and especially of three key instructors, Josef Albers, John Cage, and R. Buckminster Fuller - to be much greater than that. Diaz's focus is on experimentation. Albers, Cage, and Fuller, she shows, taught new models of art making that favored testing procedures rather than personal expression. The resulting projects not only reconfigured the relationships among chance, order, and design - they helped redefine what artistic practice was, and could be, for future generations. Offering a bold, compelling new angle on some of the most widely studied creative minds of the twentieth century, The Experimenters does nothing less than rewrite the story of art in the mid-twentieth century.",Art,242,N/A,0,en

Chemical Product Design,"E. L. Cussler, G. D. Moggridge",Cambridge University Press,2001-04-16,"Until recently, the chemical industry has been dominated by the manufacture of bulk commodity chemicals such as benzene, ammonia, and polypropylene. However, over the last decade a significant shift occurred. Now most chemical companies devote any new resources to the design and manufacture of specialty, high value-added chemical products such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and electronic coatings. Although the jobs held by chemical engineers have also changed to reflect this altered business, their training has remained static, emphasizing traditional commodities. This ground-breaking text starts to redress the balance between commodities and higher value-added products. It expands the scope of chemical engineering design to encompass both process design and product design. The authors use a four-step procedure for chemical product design - needs, ideas, selection, manufacture - drawing numerous examples from industry to illustrate the discussion. The book concludes with a brief review of the economic issues. Chemical engineering students and beginning chemical engineers will find this text an inviting introduction to chemical product design.",Science,152,N/A,0,en

A novel approach is adopted not found elsewhere. Materials are introduced through their properties; materials selection charts (a new development) capture the important features of all materials, allowing rapid retrieval of information and application of selection techniques. Merit indices, combined with charts, allow optimisation of the materials selection process. Sources of material property data are reviewed and approaches to their use are given. Material processing and its influence on the design are discussed. The book closes with chapters on aesthetics and industrial design.

Since the beginning, technology and industry have been undeniably intertwined, and Noble demonstrates how corporate capitalism has not only become the driving force behind the development of technology in this country but also how scientific research—particularly within universities—has been dominated by the corporations who fund it, who go so far as to influence the education of the engineers that will one day create the technology to be used for capitalist gain. Noble reveals that technology, often thought to be an independent science, has always been a means to an end for the men pulling the strings of Corporate America—and it was these men that laid down the plans for the design of the modern nation today.",Technology & Engineering,574,N/A,0,en

Elements of Structural Optimization,"Raphael T. Haftka, Zafer Gürdal",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The field of structural optimization is still a relatively new field undergoing rapid changes in methods and focus. Until recently there was a severe imbalance between the enormous amount of literature on the subject, and the paucity of applications to practical design problems. This imbalance is being gradually redressed. There is still no shortage of new publications, but there are also exciting applications of the methods of structural optimizations in the automotive, aerospace, civil engineering, machine design and other engineering fields. As a result of the growing pace of applications, research into structural optimization methods is increasingly driven by real-life problems. t-.Jost engineers who design structures employ complex general-purpose software packages for structural analysis. Often they do not have any access to the source program, and even more frequently they have only scant knowledge of the details of the structural analysis algorithms used in this software packages. Therefore the major challenge faced by researchers in structural optimization is to develop methods that are suitable for use with such software packages. Another major challenge is the high computational cost associated with the analysis of many complex real-life problems. In many cases the engineer who has the task of designing a structure cannot afford to analyze it more than a handful of times.",Technology & Engineering,481,N/A,0,en

Linking Conjoint Analysis and QFD,Bernd Österreicher,diplom.de,1999-08-10,"Inhaltsangabe:Zusammenfassung: Die vorliegende Arbeit (in Englisch) beschäftigt sich mit der Integration der Methodik Conjointanalyse (CA) in den Quality Function Deployment Prozeß, um den QFD-Prozeß in Entscheidungs- und Bewertungssituationen zu unterstützen. Im Mittelpunkt steht dabei die Untersuchung der gängigen Conjointmethoden auf Anwendbarkeit und Eignung für groß angelegte Studien, wie z. B. QFD-Anwendungen. Detailliert wird dabei auf eine Erweiterung oder Unterstützung der Conjointanalyse eingegangen, um eine Vielzahl an Merkmalen und Merkmalsausprägungen (Kundenanforderungen) berücksichtigen zu können. Die kommerzielle Anwendung der einzelnen Methodiken, eine Fragebogenauswertung sowie ein Vergleich von 21 CA- und 3 der bekanntesten QFD Software-tools runden diese Arbeit ab. Abstract: This paper is structured into 5 chapters: Chapter 1 contains an introduction into the problem area and the aim of the thesis. Moreover, it gives a survey of the procedure to reach the target of extending and supporting several Conjoint Analysis methodologies to be able for an integration into the Quality Function Deployment approach with its huge amount of customer requirements (attributes and levels). Chapter 2 shows the integration of Conjoint Analysis and Quality Function Deployment into the Total Quality Management concept as quality improving, customer orientated (key word mass customization), and cost reducing tools. The importance to support Quality Function Deployment by Conjoint Analysis is pointed out to lead over to the main chapter of the paper. Chapter 3 is dedicated to several Conjoint Analysis models and the way in which to extend and support these methods, so that an integration into a large industrial study such as a Quality Function Deployment application can take place without any problems. To this purpose several conjoint techniques are described in detail, are extended by further techniques, and are compared to each other concerning their validity so that, finally, explicit recommendations can be given. The commercial use of Conjoint Analysis and the method transfer into several software-tools round off this chapter. Chapter 4 describes the Quality Function Deployment methodology in relation to the aim of this paper. The central subject is the House of Quality and its places where the Conjoint Analysis technique(s) can be applied. Results about the commercial use of several software-tools finish this chapter.

New Perspectives on Sport Volunteerism,"Berit Skirstad, Alison Doherty, Vassil Girginov",Routledge,2017-10-02,"The book highlights ‘new perspectives’ on volunteerism in sport, covering frameworks, methods, context and variables on several levels from community sport clubs to international events. In analysing the processes of control within voluntary sport clubs, a new theoretical framework – critical realism (CR) – challenges how we think about theory and how scientific inquiry should proceed. Further themes raised are: Should sports clubs be viewed as a crossing between a traditional volunteer culture dominated by collective solidarity, and a modern volunteer culture focused on the individual benefits? Are former athletes a new group of possible volunteers? Can personal narratives of experiences of being a volunteer in a big international event provide us with new insight that has not previously been considered? Identity is suggested as a motive for understanding volunteers at sporting events. Two new theoretical models are presented, one on the development of volunteer commitment and the other on a framework that incorporates both individual- and institutional-level variables. All chapters have recommendations for future research. The testing of these theories and influencing factors will provide new directions in the research of sport volunteerism. This book was originally published as a special issue of European Sport Management Quarterly.",Sports & Recreation,155,N/A,0,en

Practical RF System Design,William F. Egan,John Wiley & Sons,2004-03-15,"The ultimate practical resource for today's RF system design professionals Radio frequency components and circuits form the backbone of today's mobile and satellite communications networks. Consequently, both practicing and aspiring industry professionals need to be able to solve ever more complex problems of RF design. Blending theoretical rigor with a wealth of practical expertise, Practical RF System Design addresses a variety of complex, real-world problems that system engineers are likely to encounter in today's burgeoning communications industry with solutions that are not easily available in the existing literature. The author, an expert in the field of RF module and system design, provides powerful techniques for analyzing real RF systems, with emphasis on some that are currently not well understood. Combining theoretical results and models with examples, he challenges readers to address such practical issues as: * How standing wave ratio affects system gain * How noise on a local oscillator will affect receiver noise figure and desensitization * How to determine the dynamic range of a cascade from module specifications * How phase noise affects system performance and where it comes from * How intermodulation products (IMs) predictably change with signal amplitude, and why they sometimes change differently An essential resource for today's RF system engineers, the text covers important topics in the areas of system noise and nonlinearity, frequency conversion, and phase noise. Along with a wealth of practical examples using MATLAB(r) and Excel, spreadsheets are available for download from an FTP Web site to help readers apply the methods outlined in this important resource.",Technology & Engineering,414,5,1,en

Handbook on Decision Making,Chee Peng Lim,Springer Science & Business Media,2010-09-07,"Decision making arises when we wish to select the best possible course of action from a set of alternatives. With advancements of the digital technologies, it is easy, and almost instantaneous, to gather a large volume of information and/or data pertaining to a problem that we want to solve. For instance, the world-wi- web is perhaps the primary source of information and/or data that we often turn to when we face a decision making problem. However, the information and/or data that we obtain from the real world often are complex, and comprise various kinds of noise. Besides, real-world information and/or data often are incomplete and ambiguous, owing to uncertainties of the environments. All these make decision making a challenging task. To cope with the challenges of decision making, - searchers have designed and developed a variety of decision support systems to provide assistance in human decision making processes. The main aim of this book is to provide a small collection of techniques stemmed from artificial intelligence, as well as other complementary methodo- gies, that are useful for the design and development of intelligent decision support systems. Application examples of how these intelligent decision support systems can be utilized to help tackle a variety of real-world problems in different - mains, e. g. business, management, manufacturing, transportation and food ind- tries, and biomedicine, are also presented.

British Cruisers,Norman Friedman,Seaforth Publishing,2011-01-24,"“An extraordinarily detailed account of the development of Royal Navy cruisers . . . a towering work” from the author of Fighting the Great War at Sea (Warship 2012). For most of the twentieth century, Britain possessed both the world’s largest merchant fleet and its most extensive overseas territories. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Royal Navy always showed a particular interest in the cruiser—a multipurpose warship needed in large numbers to defend trade routes and police the empire. Above all other types, the cruiser’s competing demands of quality and quantity placed a heavy burden on designers, and for most of the interwar period, Britain sought to square this circle through international treaties restricting both size and numbers. In the process, she virtually invented the heavy cruiser and inspired the large 6in-armed cruiser, neither of which, ironically, served her best interests. This book seeks to comprehend, for the first time, the full policy background—from which a different and entirely original picture of British cruiser development emerges. After the war, the cruiser’s role was reconsidered, and the final chapters of the book cover modernizations, the plans for missile-armed ships, and the convoluted process that turned the “through-deck cruiser” into the Invincible class light carriers. With detailed appendices of ship data, and illustrated in depth with photos and A.D. Baker’s specially commissioned plans, British Cruisers truly matches the lofty standards set by Friedman’s previous books on British destroyers. “Wow! . . . Lavishly illustrated with a photograph or line plan on almost every page.

Çatalhöyük Excavations,Ian Hodder,British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara,2023-02-22,"This volume discusses the main excavations at Neolithic Çatalhöyük East undertaken from 2009 to 2017. The site is well known because of its large size, elaborate symbolism and wall paintings, and long history of excavation. This volume covers the last period of excavation directed by Ian Hodder in the North and South Areas of the site. It also describes the work conducted in the GDN Area on the later phases of occupation. The main aim of these excavations was to understand the layout and social geography of the settlement (both houses and open areas) and to situate the elaborate art and symbolism within a secure architectural and depositional context. Excavation and conservation methods are described and the campaign of geophysical prospection is described. Considerable focus is placed on detailed dating using Bayesian modeling that alters significantly our understanding of the organization of the settlement. New light is thrown on the degree of contemporaneity of buildings and on the continuities and breaks in house occupation and in the site as a whole. A fuller understanding has also been reached of the variability of houses and burials and of how these variations relate to social differentiation. The descriptions of excavated units, features and buildings incorporates results from the analyses of animal bone, chipped stone, groundstone, shell, ceramics, phytoliths, micromorphology. The integration of different types of data and of different voices within the excavation team mimics the process of collaborative interpretation that took place during the excavation and post-excavation process.",Social Science,752,N/A,0,en

Participatory IT Design,"Keld Bodker, Finn Kensing, Jesper Simonsen",MIT Press,2009-01-23,"A state-of-the-art method for introducing new information technology systems into an organization, illustrated by case studies drawn from a ten-year research project. The goal of participatory IT design is to set sensible, general, and workable guidelines for the introduction of new information technology systems into an organization. Reflecting the latest systems-development research, this book encourages a business-oriented and socially sensitive approach that takes into consideration the specific organizational context as well as first-hand knowledge of users' work practices and allows all stakeholders—users, management, and staff—to participate in the process. Participatory IT Design is a guide to the theory and practice of this process that can be used as a reference work by IT professionals and as a textbook for classes in information technology at introductory through advanced levels. Drawing on the work of a ten-year research program in which the authors worked with Danish and American companies, the book offers a framework for carrying out IT design projects as well as case studies that stand as examples of the process. The method presented in Participatory IT Design—known as the MUST method, after a Danish acronym for theories and methods of initial analysis and design activities—was developed and tested in thirteen industrial design projects for companies and organizations that included an American airline, a multinational pharmaceutical company, a national broadcasting corporation, a multinational software house, and American and Danish universities. The first part of the book introduces the concepts and guidelines on which the method is based, while the second and third parts are designed as a practical toolbox for utilizing the MUST method. Part II describes the four phases of a design project—initiation, in-line analysis, in-depth analysis, and innovation. Part III explains the method's sixteen techniques and related representation tools, offering first an overview and then specific descriptions of each in separate sections.",Computers,357,N/A,0,en

'Designing Women',"Annmarie Adams, Peta Tancred",University of Toronto Press,2000-05-18,"Historically, the contributions of women architects to their profession have been minimized or overlooked. 'Designing Women' explores the tension that has existed between the architectural profession and its women members. It demonstrates the influence that these women have had on architecture in Canada, and links their so-called marginalization to the profession's restrictive and sometimes discriminatory practices. Co-written by an architectural historian and a sociologist, this book provides a welcome blend of disciplinary approaches. The product of much original research, it looks at issues that are specific to architecture in Canada and at the same time characteristic of many male-dominated workplaces. Annmarie Adams and Peta Tancred examine the issue of gender and its relation to the larger dynamics of status and power. They argue that many women architects have reacted with ingenuity to the difficulties they have faced, making major innovations in practice and design. Branching out into a wide range of alternative fields, these women have extended and developed what are considered to be the core specializations within architecture. As the authors point out, while the profession designs women's place within it, women design buildings and careers that transcend that narrow professional definition.",Architecture,212,N/A,0,en

Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design IV,"Weiming Shen, Jianming Yong, Yun Yang, Jean-Paul A. Barthès, Junzhou Luo",Springer,2008-12-18,"Design of complex artifacts and systems requires the cooperation of multidisciplinary design teams using multiple sophisticated commercial and non-commercial engine- ing tools such as CAD tools, modeling, simulation and optimization software, en- neering databases, and knowledge-based systems. Individuals or individual groups of multidisciplinary design teams usually work in parallel and independently with various engineering tools, which are located on different sites, often for quite a long period of time. At any moment, individual members may be working on different versions of a design or viewing the design from various perspectives, at different levels of details. In order to meet these requirements, it is necessary to have efficient comput- supported collaborative design systems. These systems should not only automate in- vidual tasks, in the manner of traditional computer-aided engineering tools, but also enable individual members to share information, collaborate, and coordinate their activities within the context of a design project. Based on close international collaboration between the University of Technology of Compiègne in France and the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Ac- emy of Sciences in the early 1990s, a series of international workshops on CSCW in Design started in 1996. In order to facilitate the organization of these workshops, an International Working Group on CSCW in Design (CSCWD) was established and an International Steering Committee was formed in 1998. The series was converted to int- national conferences in 2000 building on the success of the four previous workshops.",Computers,688,N/A,0,en
Conversations With My Good Friend the Atheist,Richard Cannon,"Christian Faith Publishing, Inc.",2022-08-01,"Why should Christians care about what Atheists believe? It is easy to discover what Atheists have to say about Christianity and Christians. Pick up a book by any modern Atheist writer, read a few random pages, and the reader will have a sampling of the criticisms Atheists have regarding religion and people of faith. A natural first response is the desire to set the record straight. A person responding this way will quickly find themselves going in circles. This is one point Christians need to accept and understand. From the Christian's perspective, it serves no useful purpose when Christians engage Atheists in an attempt to set the record straight. Atheism is a worldview or a way of seeing the world. Just as the Christian sees their Christian faith as reasonable and rational, the Atheist has the same view of what they believe to be true. Atheists vary in their definition of what it means to be an Atheist. There are, however, common themes found in the beliefs of people identifying themselves as Atheist. It is common, for example, to find people identifying themselves as Atheists to believe the natural world is all there is. This of course, excludes the supernatural and since God operates outside of nature, God is supernatural and is therefore eliminated in the thinking of Atheism. How should the Christian respond when Atheists challenge Christian beliefs? How can the Christian respond effectively unless the Christian understands what Atheists believe? How can the Christian respond unless the Christian understands why Atheists believe as they do? The apostle Paul tells Christians to be ambassadors. Ambassadors need to understand the world in which they serve. This is why Christians should care about what Atheists believe.",Religion,147,N/A,0,en

Design for Sustainability (Open Access),"Fabrizio Ceschin, İdil Gaziulusoy",Routledge,2019-08-21,"This book discusses the most significant ways in which design has been applied to sustainability challenges using an evolutionary perspective. It puts forward an innovation framework that is capable of coherently integrating multiple design for sustainability (DfS) approaches developed so far. It is now widely understood that design can and must play a crucial role in the societal transformations towards sustainability. Design can in fact act as a catalyst to trigger and support innovation, and can help to shape the world at different levels: from materials to products, product–service systems, social organisations and socio-technical systems. This book offers a unique perspective on how DfS has evolved in the past decades across these innovation levels, and provides insights on its promising and necessary future development directions. For design scholars, this book will trigger and feed the academic debate on the evolution of DfS and its next research frontiers. For design educators, the book can be used as a supporting tool to design courses and programmes on DfS. For bachelor’s and master’s level design, engineering and management students, the book can be a general resource to provide an understanding of the historical evolution of DfS. For design practitioners and businesses, the book offers a rich set of practical examples, design methods and tools to apply the various DfS approaches in practice, and an innovation framework which can be used as a tool to support change in organisations that aim to integrate DfS in their strategy and processes.",Design,213,N/A,0,en

Seismic Design and Retrofit of Bridges,"M. J. N. Priestley, F. Seible, Gian Michele Calvi",John Wiley & Sons,1996-04-12,"Because of their structural simplicity, bridges tend to beparticularly vulnerable to damage and even collapse when subjectedto earthquakes or other forms of seismic activity. Recentearthquakes, such as the ones in Kobe, Japan, and Oakland,California, have led to a heightened awareness of seismic risk andhave revolutionized bridge design and retrofit philosophies. In Seismic Design and Retrofit of Bridges, three of the world's topauthorities on the subject have collaborated to produce the mostexhaustive reference on seismic bridge design currently available.Following a detailed examination of the seismic effects of actualearthquakes on local area bridges, the authors demonstrate designstrategies that will make these and similar structures optimallyresistant to the damaging effects of future seismicdisturbances. Relying heavily on worldwide research associated with recentquakes, Seismic Design and Retrofit of Bridges begins with anin-depth treatment of seismic design philosophy as it applies tobridges. The authors then describe the various geotechnicalconsiderations specific to bridge design, such as soil-structureinteraction and traveling wave effects. Subsequent chapters coverconceptual and actual design of various bridge superstructures, andmodeling and analysis of these structures. As the basis for their design strategies, the authors' focus is onthe widely accepted capacity design approach, in which particularlyvulnerable locations of potentially inelastic flexural deformationare identified and strengthened to accommodate a greater degree ofstress. The text illustrates how accurate application of thecapacity design philosophy to the design of new bridges results instructures that can be expected to survive most earthquakes withonly minor, repairable damage. Because the majority of today's bridges were built before thecapacity design approach was understood, the authors also devoteseveral chapters to the seismic assessment of existing bridges,with the aim of designing and implementing retrofit measures toprotect them against the damaging effects of future earthquakes.These retrofitting techniques, though not considered appropriate inthe design of new bridges, are given considerable emphasis, sincethey currently offer the best solution for the preservation ofthese vital and often historically valued thoroughfares. Practical and applications-oriented, Seismic Design and Retrofit ofBridges is enhanced with over 300 photos and line drawings toillustrate key concepts and detailed design procedures. As the onlytext currently available on the vital topic of seismic bridgedesign, it provides an indispensable reference for civil,structural, and geotechnical engineers, as well as students inrelated engineering courses. A state-of-the-art text on earthquake-proof design and retrofit ofbridges Seismic Design and Retrofit of Bridges fills the urgent need for acomprehensive and up-to-date text on seismic-ally resistant bridgedesign. The authors, all recognized leaders in the field,systematically cover all aspects of bridge design related toseismic resistance for both new and existing bridges. * A complete overview of current design philosophy for bridges,with related seismic and geotechnical considerations * Coverage of conceptual design constraints and their relationshipto current design alternatives * Modeling and analysis of bridge structures * An exhaustive look at common building materials and theirresponse to seismic activity * A hands-on approach to the capacity design process * Use of isolation and dissipation devices in bridge design * Important coverage of seismic assessment and retrofit design ofexisting bridges",Technology & Engineering,704,3.5,3,en

Do the F*cking Work,"Brian Buirge, Jason Bacher, Jason Richburg",HarperCollins,2019-12-30,"A wake-up call for creatives who need that inspiring kick to finally create the thing they’ve been meaning to make, while celebrating the journey of trying, learning, and failing. Over the last eight years, Jason Bacher and Brian Buirge of Good F*cking Design Advice (GFDA) have made a name for themselves in the international design community, inspiring creatives, artists, and entrepreneurs with their products, weekly e-mails, and most important, their unorthodox advice about work ethic and the creative process. Do the F*cking Work is a collection of 100 beautifully packaged pieces that showcase their irreverent advice—inspiration that will help unstick even the most dedicated procrastinators. Covering everything from drinking your morning coffee to handling productive criticism, from embracing failure to rejecting the status quo, their insights upend conventional thinking and teach you to embrace and celebrate the journey of creation—the joy of trying, failing, learning, and sometimes failing again. To make something good we have to make some mistakes. Bacher and Buirge teach you to embrace the unknown and to f*cking laugh at yourself during the process. There is a method to their madness—a surprising reassurance that is baked into their bluntness. We’re all trying, messing up, and trying again. And there’s joy to be found in that—something we often overlook in our rush to get everything done and get it right the first time. With personal insights, actionable advice, stylish visuals, and lots of colorful language, Do the F*cking Work will leave you feeling renewed and inspired, and will make you see that the value of work is as much about the process as the outcome.",Self-Help,256,N/A,0,en

""This book has the power to change everything! Writing with depth, wit, and insight, Ingrid Fetell Lee shares all you need to know in order to create external environments that give rise to inner joy."" —Susan Cain, author of Quiet and founder of Quiet Revolution Have you ever wondered why we stop to watch the orange glow that arrives before sunset, or why we flock to see cherry blossoms bloom in spring? Is there a reason that people—regardless of gender, age, culture, or ethnicity—are mesmerized by baby animals, and can't help but smile when they see a burst of confetti or a cluster of colorful balloons? We are often made to feel that the physical world has little or no impact on our inner joy. Increasingly, experts urge us to find balance and calm by looking inward—through mindfulness or meditation—and muting the outside world. But what if the natural vibrancy of our surroundings is actually our most renewable and easily accessible source of joy? In Joyful, designer Ingrid Fetell Lee explores how the seemingly mundane spaces and objects we interact with every day have surprising and powerful effects on our mood. Drawing on insights from neuroscience and psychology, she explains why one setting makes us feel anxious or competitive, while another fosters acceptance and delight—and, most importantly, she reveals how we can harness the power of our surroundings to live fuller, healthier, and truly joyful lives.",Psychology,324,N/A,0,en

Dominance by Design,Michael Adas,Harvard University Press,2009,"Long before the United States became a major force in global affairs, Americans believed in their superiority over others due to their inventiveness, productivity, and economic and social well-being. U.S. expansionists assumed a mandate to civilize non-Western peoples by demanding submission to American technological prowess and design. As an integral part of America's national identity and sense of itself in the world, this civilizing mission provided the rationale to displace the Indians from much of our continent, to build an island empire in the Pacific and Caribbean, and to promote unilateral--at times military--interventionism throughout Asia. In our age of smart bombs and mobile warfare, technological aptitude remains preeminent in validating America's global mission. Michael Adas brilliantly pursues the history of this mission through America's foreign relations over nearly four centuries from North America to the Philippines, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf. The belief that it is our right and destiny to remake foreign societies in our image has endured from the early decades of colonization to our current crusade to implant American-style democracy in the Muslim Middle East. Dominance by Design explores the critical ways in which technological superiority has undergirded the U.S.'s policies of unilateralism, preemption, and interventionism in foreign affairs and raised us from an impoverished frontier nation to a global power. Challenging the long-held assumptions and imperatives that sustain the civilizing mission, Adas gives us an essential guide to America's past and present role in the world as well as cautionary lessons for the future.",History,566,N/A,0,en

"I Belong to This Band, Hallelujah!",Laura Clawson,University of Chicago Press,2011-06-01,"The Sacred Harp choral singing tradition originated in the American South in the mid-nineteenth century, spread widely across the country, and continues to thrive today. Sacred Harp isn’t performed but participated in, ideally in large gatherings where, as the a cappella singers face each other around a hollow square, the massed voices take on a moving and almost physical power. I Belong to This Band, Hallelujah! is a vivid portrait of several Sacred Harp groups and an insightful exploration of how they manage to maintain a sense of community despite their members’ often profound differences. Laura Clawson’s research took her to Alabama and Georgia, to Chicago and Minneapolis, and to Hollywood for a Sacred Harp performance at the Academy Awards, a potent symbol of the conflicting forces at play in the twenty-first-century incarnation of this old genre. Clawson finds that in order for Sacred Harp singers to maintain the bond forged by their love of music, they must grapple with a host of difficult issues, including how to maintain the authenticity of their tradition and how to carefully negotiate the tensions created by their disparate cultural, religious, and political beliefs.",Music,220,N/A,0,en

Making America Modern,Marilyn F. Friedman,Bauer and Dean Publishers,2018-04-23,"A valuable resource for design professionals and historians, this book chronicles the evolution of modern interior design in the United States throughout the 1930s. With more than 200 images and detailed descriptions, design historian Marilyn F. Friedman presents more than eighty interiors by forty-five designers, including Donald Deskey, Paul T. Frankl, Percival Goodman, Frederick Kiesler, William Lescaze, William Muschenheim Tommi Parzinger, Gilbert Rohde, Eugene Schoen, Kem Weber, set designers Cedric Gibbons and Joseph Urban, and industrial designers Raymond Loewy, Walter Dorwin Teague, and Russel Wright. The book also highlights the work of women modernists who are practically unknown today, including Virginia Conner, Freda Diamond, Eleanor Le Maire, and Madame Majeska. Interiors cover the economic spectrum, from those created for wealthy patrons who embraced the modernist aesthetic, including Walter Annenberg, George Vanderbilt III, William Paley, and Abby Rockefeller Milton, to those designed with affordability in mind, including private commissions, as well as furniture and model rooms for manufacturers, design associations, and museum exhibitions. The book also profiles in detail entire model homes that highlighted new concepts in design and construction, such as Norman Bel Geddes¿ House of Tomorrow for Ladies¿ Home Journal, Macy¿s ¿Forward House,¿ Frederick Kiesler¿s ¿Space House¿ for the Modernage showroom, Eleanor Le Maire¿s ¿House of Planes¿ for Abraham & Straus, and the model houses at the 1933 and 1939 world¿s fairs held in Chicago and New York, respectively. The trajectory of American modern design during the 1930s was not linear. In rejecting the revivalism that had defined American design during the nineteenth century, the designers covered in this book forged something new-an American movement defined by simplicity, practicality, and comfort that embraced experimentation and variation in materials and style.

Stainless Steels for Design Engineers,Michael F. McGuire,ASM International,2008,"The rate of growth of stainless steel has outpaced that of other metals and alloys, and by 2010 may surpass aluminum as the second most widely used metal after carbon steel. The 2007 world production of stainless steel was approximately 30,000,000 tons and has nearly doubled in the last ten years. This growth is occurring at the same time that the production of stainless steel continues to become more consolidated. One result of this is a more widespread need to understand stainless steel with fewer resources to provide that information. The concurrent technical evolution in stainless steel and increasing volatility of raw material prices has made it more important for the engineers and designers who use stainless steel to make sound technical judgments about which stainless steels to use and how to use them.",Technology & Engineering,311,N/A,0,en

The Digital Document,Bruce Duyshart,Routledge,2013-02-01,"Documents, such as drawings, memos and specifications, form an essential function in the design and construction industry. Throughout the lifecycle of a built asset, starting from an initial design idea, right through to a final built form and its ongoing management, thousands, even millions of documents can be used to convey various forms of information to a range of interested parties. In many ways, therefore, the success of a design, or construction-based company, relies upon an understanding of the use of documents, as well as the technologies and techniques that are used to create them. The Digital Document provides an extensive background to the issues and technologies surrounding this very important topic. It examines a technical subject in an insightful manner that is neither intimidating nor confusing, even to the novice computer user. By introducing the subject through a series of preliminary reviews of current practices and essential computing technologies, the reader is able to better appreciate the benefits and capabilities of a wide range of digital document types. This book explores the role of documents in a professional practice, examines the components, capabilities, viability, and use of digital documents in the design and construction industry, and identifies and explains many of the standards in use today. In order to facilitate a better understanding of digital document technologies, a number of essential reviews are provided including: - the definition and purpose of a document - how documents are typically used by design professionals - the nature of the digital document environment - the data types which make up digital documents The Digital Document is an essential reference for the architect, engineer or design professional that wants to find out more about effective communication in the digital workplace. Bruce Duyshart is an IT Project Manager with Lend Lease Corporation and specialises in the development and implementation of digital media and information management technologies on design and construction projects.

Sketching User Experiences: Getting the Design Right and the Right Design,Bill Buxton,Morgan Kaufmann,2010-07-28,"Sketching User Experiences approaches design and design thinking as something distinct that needs to be better understood—by both designers and the people with whom they need to work— in order to achieve success with new products and systems. So while the focus is on design, the approach is holistic. Hence, the book speaks to designers, usability specialists, the HCI community, product managers, and business executives. There is an emphasis on balancing the back-end concern with usability and engineering excellence (getting the design right) with an up-front investment in sketching and ideation (getting the right design). Overall, the objective is to build the notion of informed design: molding emerging technology into a form that serves our society and reflects its values. Grounded in both practice and scientific research, Bill Buxton's engaging work aims to spark the imagination while encouraging the use of new techniques, breathing new life into user experience design. - Covers sketching and early prototyping design methods suitable for dynamic product capabilities: cell phones that communicate with each other and other embedded systems, ""smart"" appliances, and things you only imagine in your dreams - Thorough coverage of the design sketching method which helps easily build experience prototypes—without the effort of engineering prototypes which are difficult to abandon - Reaches out to a range of designers, including user interface designers, industrial designers, software engineers, usability engineers, product managers, and others - Full of case studies, examples, exercises, and projects, and access to video clips that demonstrate the principles and methods",Computers,445,4.5,2,en

Crossover Designs,Kung-Jong Lui,John Wiley & Sons,2016-09-26,"A comprehensive and practical resource for analyses of crossover designs For ethical reasons, it is vital to keep the number of patients in a clinical trial as low as possible. As evidenced by extensive research publications, crossover design can be a useful and powerful tool to reduce the number of patients needed for a parallel group design in studying treatments for non-curable chronic diseases. This book introduces commonly-used and well-established statistical tests and estimators in epidemiology that can easily be applied to hypothesis testing and estimation of the relative treatment effect for various types of data scale in crossover designs. Models with distribution-free random effects are assumed and hence most approaches considered here are semi-parametric. The book provides clinicians and biostatisticians with the exact test procedures and exact interval estimators, which are applicable even when the number of patients in a crossover trial is small. Systematic discussion on sample size determination is also included, which will be a valuable resource for researchers involved in crossover trial design. Key features: Provides exact test procedures and interval estimators, which are especially of use in small-sample cases. Presents most test procedures and interval estimators in closed-forms, enabling readers to calculate them by use of a pocket calculator or commonly-used statistical packages.

Foundations of Multiliteracies,"Michèle Anstey, Geoff Bull",Routledge,2018-05-03,"Using the concept of multiliteracies and multimodality, this book provides foundation knowledge about the new and continuously changing literacies of the 21st century. It details the five semiotic systems (linguistic, visual, auditory, gestural and spatial) and how they contribute to the reading and writing of increasingly complex and dynamic texts that are delivered by live, paper or digital technologies. One of the main tenets of the book is that social, cultural and technological developments will continue to give rise to changing literate practices around texts and communication, requiring a rethinking of classroom practices that are employed in the teaching of literacy. Therefore, the role of talk, together with traditional lesson structures, is examined and the concept of dialogic talk is introduced as a way of moving towards an effective pedagogy for the teaching and learning of multiliteracies and multimodality. The book also demonstrates that children’s literature can provide a bridge between old and new literacies and be an effective vehicle for introducing the five semiotic systems to all age groups. Comprehensive and accessible, this book addresses the issue of translating complex theories, research and concepts into effective practice, by providing the reader with four avenues for reflecting upon and implementing the ideas it contains: Reflection Strategies that enable the reader to gauge their understanding of key concepts; Theory into Practice tasks that enable the trialling of specific theoretical concepts in the classroom; Auditing instruments provide specific tasks related to assessment of student performance and evaluation of teacher pedagogy; QR codes immediately link the reader to multimodal texts and further references that illustrate and enhance the concepts being developed.",Education,278,N/A,0,en

Implantable medical devices and human dignity. Private and secure access to information. Engineering projects that transform the Earth. Multigenerational information systems for international justice. How should designers, engineers, architects, policy makers, and others design such technology? Who should be involved and what values are implicated? In Value Sensitive Design, Batya Friedman and David Hendry describe how both moral and technical imagination can be brought to bear on the design of technology. With value sensitive design, under development for more than two decades, Friedman and Hendry bring together theory, methods, and applications for a design process that engages human values at every stage. After presenting the theoretical foundations of value sensitive design, which lead to a deep rethinking of technical design, Friedman and Hendry explain seventeen methods, including stakeholder analysis, value scenarios, and multilifespan timelines. Following this, experts from ten application domains report on value sensitive design practice. Finally, Friedman and Hendry explore such open questions as the need for deeper investigation of indirect stakeholders and further method development. This definitive account of the state of the art in value sensitive design is an essential resource for designers and researchers working in academia and industry, students in design and computer science, and anyone working at the intersection of technology and society.",Design,258,N/A,0,en

Design of Experiments for Generalized Linear Models,Kenneth G. Russell,CRC Press,2018-12-14,"Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) allow many statistical analyses to be extended to important statistical distributions other than the Normal distribution. While numerous books exist on how to analyse data using a GLM, little information is available on how to collect the data that are to be analysed in this way. This is the first book focusing specifically on the design of experiments for GLMs. Much of the research literature on this topic is at a high mathematical level, and without any information on computation. This book explains the motivation behind various techniques, reduces the difficulty of the mathematics, or moves it to one side if it cannot be avoided, and gives examples of how to write and run computer programs using R. Features The generalisation of the linear model to GLMs Background mathematics, and the use of constrained optimisation in R Coverage of the theory behind the optimality of a design Individual chapters on designs for data that have Binomial or Poisson distributions Bayesian experimental design An online resource contains R programs used in the book This book is aimed at readers who have done elementary differentiation and understand minimal matrix algebra, and have familiarity with R. It equips professional statisticians to read the research literature. Nonstatisticians will be able to design their own experiments by following the examples and using the programs provided.",Mathematics,260,N/A,0,en

World History and the Eonic Effect,John C. Landon,Xlibris Corporation,2010-04-27,"At a time when theories of evolution are undergoing renewed controversy, the study of the Eonic Effect can break the deadlock, by looking at world history in the light of evolution. The assumption that evolution occurs at random is the crux of the dispute, and one confused with issues of religion and secularism. We can detect a non-random pattern in the record of civilization itself, to see evolution in action on a stupendous scale. We live in the first generations with enough data to detect this phenomenon. In the confusion of evolutionary theories, the unexpected discovery of deep level structure can allow us to deconstruct fl at history, and assess claims of directionality in evolution. In the process the theory of natural selection applied to human evolution is seen to fail a photo finish test. The book provides a new model for the study of the overlap of history and evolution, and a critique of current views of the descent of man.",History,728,N/A,0,en

Design Thinking in the Digital Age,Peter G. Rowe,Sternberg Press,2017,"In 1987, Peter G. Rowe published his pioneering book Design Thinking. In it, he interrogated conceptual approaches to design in terms of both process and form. Thirty years later, in a lecture at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design, Rowe offered a reappraisal of his earlier work, describing ways in which the capacities of the digital age have changed the way we perceive and understand creative problem-solving in architectural design. In this new account of ""design thinking"" based on that memorable talk, Rowe charges that ideas about the ""precision"" and ""incompleteness"" of information have become exaggerated and made more manifest. He dives into the crucial role of schema theory and the heuristics that flow from it, but concedes that the ""ineffable characteristics of design problems and of design thinking also appear to have remained."" The Incidents is a series of publications based on events that occured at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design between 1936 and tomorrow.

The Phylogenetic System of Ephemeroptera,Nikita Kluge,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-11-27,"The book has general biological significance due to usage of the new non-ranking nomenclature and the rational layout of taxonomic text, which can be qualified as post-Linnaean systematics. While after the works by Lameere and Hennig, non-ranking classifications became widely used, this book represents the first experience of consistently non-ranking classification, including taxa of low taxonomic level (i.e. taxa traditionally regarded as genera, families et al.). In contrast to other recent attempts to elaborate a non-ranking nomenclature not contradictory to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, this one appears to be successful and can be applied to any zoological taxa (although its application in botany could be possible only after further elaboration). Biology is currently going through a crisis, which causes some investigators to use such non-scientific methods of reconstructing phylogeny as parsimony analysis. The author believes that the new method of phylogeny description and reconstruction used in this book will help indicate a way out of this crisis.",Science,450,N/A,0,en

Transdisciplinary Engineering Methods for Social Innovation of Industry 4.0,"M. Peruzzini, M. Pellicciari, C. Bil",IOS Press,2018-09-14,"The concept of concurrent engineering (CE) was first developed in the 1980s. Now often referred to as transdiciplinary engineering, it is based on the idea that different phases of a product life cycle should be conducted concurrently and initiated as early as possible within the Product Creation Process (PCP). The main goal of CE is to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the PCP and reduce errors in later phases, as well as incorporating considerations – including environmental implications – for the full lifecycle of the product. It has become a substantive methodology in many industries, and has also been adopted in the development of new services and service support. This book presents the proceedings of the 25th ISPE Inc. International Conference on Transdisciplinary Engineering, held in Modena, Italy, in July 2018. This international conference attracts researchers, industry experts, students, and government representatives interested in recent transdisciplinary engineering research, advancements and applications. The book contains 120 peer-reviewed papers, selected from 259 submissions from all continents of the world, ranging from the theoretical and conceptual to papers addressing industrial best practice, and is divided into 11 sections reflecting the themes addressed in the conference program and addressing topics as diverse as industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing; human-centered design; modeling, simulation and virtual design; and knowledge and data management among others. With an overview of the latest research results, product creation processes and related methodologies, this book will be of interest to researchers, design practitioners and educators alike.",Technology & Engineering,1250,N/A,0,en

Norman Bel Geddes Designs America,Donald Albrecht,Harry N. Abrams,2012-11-01,"This book explores the career of one of the twentieth century's foremost theatrical and industrial designers. This book outlines the career of this complex and influential man through approximately fifty projects, bringing together never before exhibited drawings, models, photographs and films. Norman Bel Geddes was an innovative stage designer, director, producer, architect, industrial designer, futurist and urban planner. His professional credo was to simplify, to unify, to use form to communicate and, at times, shape function and to question the status quo. His research based approach to problem solving followed by his complete re imagining of a design problem, as if starting from scratch, resulted in the creation of a new, ideal product. hroughout his multi faceted career, Bel Geddes was a paradoxical figure made up of equal parts visionary and pragmatist, naturalist and industrialist, democrat and egoist. A number of products and practices now taken for granted can be traced directly back to Bel Geddes. His impact on the American landscape ranges from the U.S. federal highway system to all weather sports stadiums, revolving restaurants, modular domestic appliances and stylish home entertainment systems.",Design,0,N/A,0,en

Thoughtful Interaction Design,"Jonas Lowgren, Erik Stolterman",MIT Press,2007-01-26,"The authors of Thoughtful Interaction Design go beyond the usual technical concerns of usability and usefulness to consider interaction design from a design perspective. The shaping of digital artifacts is a design process that influences the form and functions of workplaces, schools, communication, and culture; the successful interaction designer must use both ethical and aesthetic judgment to create designs that are appropriate to a given environment. This book is not a how-to manual, but a collection of tools for thought about interaction design. Working with information technology—called by the authors ""the material without qualities""—interaction designers create not a static object but a dynamic pattern of interactivity. The design vision is closely linked to context and not simply focused on the technology. The authors' action-oriented and context-dependent design theory, drawing on design theorist Donald Schön's concept of the reflective practitioner, helps designers deal with complex design challenges created by new technology and new knowledge. Their approach, based on a foundation of thoughtfulness that acknowledges the designer's responsibility not only for the functional qualities of the design product but for the ethical and aesthetic qualities as well, fills the need for a theory of interaction design that can increase and nurture design knowledge. From this perspective they address the fundamental question of what kind of knowledge an aspiring designer needs, discussing the process of design, the designer, design methods and techniques, the design product and its qualities, and conditions for interaction design.",Computers,213,N/A,0,en

Principles of Computer System Design,"Jerome H. Saltzer, M. Frans Kaashoek",Morgan Kaufmann,2009-05-21,"Principles of Computer System Design is the first textbook to take a principles-based approach to the computer system design. It identifies, examines, and illustrates fundamental concepts in computer system design that are common across operating systems, networks, database systems, distributed systems, programming languages, software engineering, security, fault tolerance, and architecture.Through carefully analyzed case studies from each of these disciplines, it demonstrates how to apply these concepts to tackle practical system design problems. To support the focus on design, the text identifies and explains abstractions that have proven successful in practice such as remote procedure call, client/service organization, file systems, data integrity, consistency, and authenticated messages. Most computer systems are built using a handful of such abstractions. The text describes how these abstractions are implemented, demonstrates how they are used in different systems, and prepares the reader to apply them in future designs.The book is recommended for junior and senior undergraduate students in Operating Systems, Distributed Systems, Distributed Operating Systems and/or Computer Systems Design courses; and professional computer systems designers. - Concepts of computer system design guided by fundamental principles - Cross-cutting approach that identifies abstractions common to networking, operating systems, transaction systems, distributed systems, architecture, and software engineering - Case studies that make the abstractions real: naming (DNS and the URL); file systems (the UNIX file system); clients and services (NFS); virtualization (virtual machines); scheduling (disk arms); security (TLS) - Numerous pseudocode fragments that provide concrete examples of abstract concepts - Extensive support.

Design and Analysis of Analog Filters,Larry D. Paarmann,Springer Science & Business Media,2005-12-30,"Design and Analysis of Analog Filters: A Signal Processing Perspective includes signal processing/systems concepts as well as implementation. While most books on analog filter design briefly present the signal processing/systems concepts, and then concentrate on a variety of filter implementation methods, the present book reverses the emphasis, stressing signal processing concepts. Filter implementation topics are presented in Part II: passive filters, and operational amplifier active filters. However, greater emphasis on signal processing/systems concepts is included in Part I of the book than is typical. This emphasis makes the book very appropriate as part of a signal processing curriculum. Useful Aspects of Design and Analysis of Analog Filters: A Signal Processing Perspective extensive use of MATLAB® throughout, with many homework problems involving the use of MATLAB. over 200 figures; over 100 examples; a total of 345 homework problems, appearing at the ends of the chapters; complete and thorough presentation of design characteristics; complete catalog of design approaches. Audience: Design and Analysis of Analog Filters: A Signal Processing Perspective will interest anyone with a standard electrical engineering background, with a B.S. degree or beyond, or at the senior level. While designed as a textbook, its numerous practical examples make it useful as a reference for practicing engineers and scientists, particularly those working in systems design or communications. MATLAB® Examples: A valuable relationship between analog filter theory and analysis and modern digital signal processing is made by the application of MATLAB to both the design and analysis of analog filters.

Aircraft Design,Mohammad H. Sadraey,John Wiley & Sons,2012-11-20,"A comprehensive approach to the air vehicle design process using the principles of systems engineering Due to the high cost and the risks associated with development, complex aircraft systems have become a prime candidate for the adoption of systems engineering methodologies. This book presents the entire process of aircraft design based on a systems engineering approach from conceptual design phase, through to preliminary design phase and to detail design phase. Presenting in one volume the methodologies behind aircraft design, this book covers the components and the issues affected by design procedures. The basic topics that are essential to the process, such as aerodynamics, flight stability and control, aero-structure, and aircraft performance are reviewed in various chapters where required. Based on these fundamentals and design requirements, the author explains the design process in a holistic manner to emphasise the integration of the individual components into the overall design. Throughout the book the various design options are considered and weighed against each other, to give readers a practical understanding of the process overall. Readers with knowledge of the fundamental concepts of aerodynamics, propulsion, aero-structure, and flight dynamics will find this book ideal to progress towards the next stage in their understanding of the topic. Furthermore, the broad variety of design techniques covered ensures that readers have the freedom and flexibility to satisfy the design requirements when approaching real-world projects.

Since the analysis and design of a foundation are based on the soil properties under short-term (undrained) or long-term (drained) conditions, the assessment of soil properties from the geotechnical site investigation and the concept of drained or undrained soil properties are discussed in the first two chapters. Foundation elements transfer various load combinations from the superstructure to the underlying soils or rocks. The load transfer mechanisms, vertical stress or earth pressure distributions, and failure modes of each foundation type are clearly explained in this book. After understanding the soil responses subjected to the loadings from the foundation, the design methods, required factors of safety, and improvement measures for each foundation type are elaborated. This book presents both theoretical explication and practical applications for readers to easily comprehend the theoretical background, design methods, and practical applications and considerations. Each chapter provides relevant exercise examples and a problem set for self-practice. The analysis methods introduced in the book can be applied in actual analysis and design as they contain the most up-to-date knowledge of foundation design. This book is suitable for teachers and students to use in foundation engineering courses and engineers who are engaged in foundation design to create a technically sound, construction-feasible, and economical design of the foundation system.",Technology & Engineering,468,N/A,0,en

This introduction to programming places computer science at the core of a liberal arts education. Unlike other introductory books, it focuses on the program design process, presenting program design guidelines that show the reader how to analyze a problem statement, how to formulate concise goals, how to make up examples, how to develop an outline of the solution, how to finish the program, and how to test it. Because learning to design programs is about the study of principles and the acquisition of transferable skills, the text does not use an off-the-shelf industrial language but presents a tailor-made teaching language. For the same reason, it offers DrRacket, a programming environment for novices that supports playful, feedback-oriented learning. The environment grows with readers as they master the material in the book until it supports a full-fledged language for the whole spectrum of programming tasks. This second edition has been completely revised. While the book continues to teach a systematic approach to program design, the second edition introduces different design recipes for interactive programs with graphical interfaces and batch programs. It also enriches its design recipes for functions with numerous new hints. Finally, the teaching languages and their IDE now come with support for images as plain values, testing, event-driven programming, and even distributed programming.",Computers,793,N/A,0,en

Human Freedom in the Age of AI,Filippo Santoni de Sio,Taylor & Francis,2024-03-29,"This book claims that artificial intelligence (AI) may affect our freedom at work, in our daily life, and in the political sphere. The author provides a philosophical framework to help make sense of and govern the ethical and political impact of AI in these domains. AI presents great opportunities and risks, raising the question of how to reap its potential benefits without endangering basic human and societal values. The author identifies three major risks for human freedom. First, AI offers employers new forms of control of the workforce, opening the door to new forms of domination and exploitation. Second, it may reduce our capacity to remain in control of and responsible for our decisions and actions, thereby affecting our free will and moral responsibility. Third, it may increase the power of governments and tech companies to steer the political debate, thereby affecting the possibility of a free and inclusive political participation. The author claims that it is still possible to promote human freedom in our interactions with AI. This requires designing AI systems that help promote workers’ freedom, strengthen human control and responsibility, and foster a free, active, and inclusive democratic participation. Human Freedom in the Age of AI will be of interest to scholars and graduate students working on the ethics of technology, philosophy of technology, political philosophy, design, and artificial intelligence.",Philosophy,278,N/A,0,en

Introduction to Combinatorics,Martin J. Erickson,John Wiley & Sons,2011-10-24,"This gradual, systematic introduction to the main concepts of combinatorics is the ideal text for advanced undergraduate and early graduate courses in this subject. Each of the book's three sections--Existence, Enumeration, and Construction--begins with a simply stated first principle, which is then developed step by step until it leads to one of the three major achievements of combinatorics: Van der Waerden's theorem on arithmetic progressions, Polya's graph enumeration formula, and Leech's 24-dimensional lattice. Along the way, Professor Martin J. Erickson introduces fundamental results, discusses interconnection and problem-solving techniques, and collects and disseminates open problems that raise new and innovative questions and observations. His carefully chosen end-of-chapter exercises demonstrate the applicability of combinatorial methods to a wide variety of problems, including many drawn from the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition. Many important combinatorial methods are revisited several times in the course of the text--in exercises and examples as well as theorems and proofs. This repetition enables students to build confidence and reinforce their understanding of complex material. Mathematicians, statisticians, and computer scientists profit greatly from a solid foundation in combinatorics.

Housekeeping by Design,David Brody,University of Chicago Press,2016-10-17,"A mattress, box spring, and duvet for a king-size hotel bed weighs in at 225 pounds. Imagine trying to wrestle with changing the sheets and getting the hospital corners just right; it is easy to see why hotel housekeepers experience back and shoulder injuries at increasing rates. David Brody got behind the scenes at the Chicago Hyatt Regency and the Starwood hotels in Hawaii, bypassing management and corporate press releases to interview the housekeeping staff directly. Given Brody s expertise in architecture and design, his mission here is to help us understand service design in hotels in order to situate the needs of hotel customers, housekeepers, and hotel management one relative to the other. What unfolds as a new perspective on hotels is designin terms of spaces, products, maintenance, and workflow systems. We get vivid examples of how a hotel room s design encapsulates a highly orchestrated, hidden process of management and labor, where work is invisible and surface appearances are paramount to the guest s sense of domestic comfort. ( Turndown service is one exampleroom light dimmed, drapes drawn, music on classical, turndown mat on floor, slippers in place, mint on pillow, etc.) Brody opts strongly for what he calls co-design, which means collaboration between workers and management on improving hotel design, and he is unabashedly partisan in taking sides with hotel workers and their unions. He also advocates for sustainability and green politics.""",Architecture,208,N/A,0,en

A New Design for Living,"Ernest Holmes, Willis H. Kinnear",Penguin,2010-09-02,"Nothing lies beyond the scope of your ability. The new design for living you create has no limitations. Literally all the good things that life and the world offer are yours to have and enjoy. But you need to recognize them, accept them, and incorporate them into the new design you are now going to create. In its scope, and in its effect on readers, A New Design for Living is second only to Ernest Holmes's magnum opus, The Science of Mind. In this cherished spiritual classic, Holmes demonstrates that wishes-from health, love, and friendship to the career and home of your dreams-are not only possible to realize but are within each person's very reach. At last available again, this galvanizing book teaches how to turn mind-power into an infinitely positive force-the very force of creation itself. Harmonize with the beauty and intelligence of the universe, watch the magnificence of life transform before you, and awaken to the nature of reality. With this newfound power of transformative thinking, every goal is attainable.","Body, Mind & Spirit",241,N/A,0,en
Inventing the Medium,Janet H. Murray,MIT Press,2011-11-23,"A foundational text offering a unified design vocabulary and a common methodology for maximizing the expressive power of digital artifacts. Digital artifacts from iPads to databases pervade our lives, and the design decisions that shape them affect how we think, act, communicate, and understand the world. But the pace of change has been so rapid that technical innovation is outstripping design. Interactors are often mystified and frustrated by their enticing but confusing new devices; meanwhile, product design teams struggle to articulate shared and enduring design goals. With Inventing the Medium, Janet Murray provides a unified vocabulary and a common methodology for the design of digital objects and environments. It will be an essential guide for both students and practitioners in this evolving field. Murray explains that innovative interaction designers should think of all objects made with bits—whether games or Web pages, robots or the latest killer apps—as belonging to a single new medium: the digital medium. Designers can speed the process of useful and lasting innovation by focusing on the collective cultural task of inventing this new medium. Exploring strategies for maximizing the expressive power of digital artifacts, Murray identifies and examines four representational affordances of digital environments that provide the core palette for designers across applications: computational procedures, user participation, navigable space, and encyclopedic capacity. Each chapter includes a set of Design Explorations—creative exercises for students and thought experiments for practitioners—that allow readers to apply the ideas in the chapter to particular design problems. Inventing the Medium also provides more than 200 illustrations of specific design strategies drawn from multiple genres and platforms and a glossary of design concepts.",Design,499,N/A,0,en

Song Blue and White Porcelain on the Silk Road,Adam T.

Even in China today these porcelains are still termed “Yuan Blue and White.” Based upon first-hand surveys of sites in Inner Mongolia, Adam T. Kessler’s Song Blue and White Porcelain on the Silk Road demonstrates that blue and white was made during the Song (960-1279 A.D.) ended up in the hands of the Xi Xia (1038-1226 A.D.) and the Jin (1115-1234 A.D.). Blue and white found today in hoards was buried prior to Mongol invasions of China in the 1200s. Sites from the Philippines to Egypt have yielded Song blue and white.

Fragile by Design,"Charles W. Calomiris, Stephen Haber",Princeton University Press,2014-02-23,"Why stable banking systems are so rare Why are banking systems unstable in so many countries—but not in others? The United States has had twelve systemic banking crises since 1840, while Canada has had none. The banking systems of Mexico and Brazil have not only been crisis prone but have provided miniscule amounts of credit to business enterprises and households. Analyzing the political and banking history of the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Brazil through several centuries, Fragile by Design demonstrates that chronic banking crises and scarce credit are not accidents. Calomiris and Haber combine political history and economics to examine how coalitions of politicians, bankers, and other interest groups form, why they endure, and how they generate policies that determine who gets to be a banker, who has access to credit, and who pays for bank bailouts and rescues. Fragile by Design is a revealing exploration of the ways that politics inevitably intrudes into bank regulation.",Business & Economics,585,N/A,0,en

The Memory Trace (PLE: Memory),Erich Goldmeier,Psychology Press,2014-05-09,"There was some agreement about what memory traces were not, but little about what actually did characterize the memory trace. Yet models and theories of memory at the time could not help making implicit and often unrecognized assumptions about the memory trace. Originally published in 1982, this title aimed to strengthen the meagre base on which memory theories rested at the time. It challenges old assumptions and introduces new concepts, foremost the notion of singularity, as they become necessary to understand traces adequately. Some research data of the past was found in need of reinterpretation. The result is a new theory of the memory trace.",Psychology,270,N/A,0,en

Statistical Methods and the Improvement of Data Quality,Tommy Wright,Academic Press,2014-05-10,"Statistical Methods and the Improvement of Data Quality contains the proceedings of The Small Conference on the Improvement of the Quality of Data Collected by Data Collection Systems, held on November 11-12, 1982, in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The conference provided a forum for discussing the use of statistical methods to improve data quality, with emphasis on the problems of data collection systems and how to handle them using state-of-the-art techniques. Comprised of 16 chapters, this volume begins with an overview of some of the limitations of surveys, followed by an annotated bibliography on frames from which the probability sample is selected. The reader is then introduced to sample designs and methods for collecting data over space and time; response effects to behavior and attitude questions; and how to develop and use error profiles. Subsequent chapters focus on principles and methods for handling outliers in data sets; influence functions, outlier detection, and data editing; and application of pattern recognition techniques to data analysis. The use of exploratory data analysis as an aid in modeling and statistical forecasting is also described. This monograph is likely to be of primary benefit to students taking a general course in survey sampling techniques, and to individuals and groups who deal with large data collection systems and are constantly seeking ways to improve the overall quality of their data.",Reference,378,N/A,0,en

"Drug-like Properties: Concepts, Structure Design and Methods","Li Di, Edward H Kerns",Elsevier,2010-07-26,"Of the thousands of novel compounds that a drug discovery project team invents and that bind to the therapeutic target, typically only a fraction of these have sufficient ADME/Tox properties to become a drug product. Understanding ADME/Tox is critical for all drug researchers, owing to its increasing importance in advancing high quality candidates to clinical studies and the processes of drug discovery. If the properties are weak, the candidate will have a high risk of failure or be less desirable as a drug product. This book is a tool and resource for scientists engaged in, or preparing for, the selection and optimization process. The authors describe how properties affect in vivo pharmacological activity and impact in vitro assays. Individual drug-like properties are discussed from a practical point of view, such as solubility, permeability and metabolic stability, with regard to fundamental understanding, applications of property data in drug discovery and examples of structural modifications that have achieved improved property performance. The authors also review various methods for the screening (high throughput), diagnosis (medium throughput) and in-depth (low throughput) analysis of drug properties. - Serves as an essential working handbook aimed at scientists and students in medicinal chemistry - Provides practical, step-by-step guidance on property fundamentals, effects, structure-property relationships, and structure modification strategies - Discusses improvements in pharmacokinetics from a practical chemist's standpoint",Science,549,N/A,0,en

Ultralearning,Scott H. Young,HarperCollins,2019-08-06,"Now a Wall Street Journal bestseller. Learn a new talent, stay relevant, reinvent yourself, and adapt to whatever the workplace throws your way. Ultralearning offers nine principles to master hard skills quickly. This is the essential guide to future-proof your career and maximize your competitive advantage through self-education. In these tumultuous times of economic and technological change, staying ahead depends on continual self-education—a lifelong mastery of fresh ideas, subjects, and skills. If you want to accomplish more and stand apart from everyone else, you need to become an ultralearner. The challenge of learning new skills is that you think you already know how best to learn, as you did as a student, so you rerun old routines and old ways of solving problems. To counter that, Ultralearning offers powerful strategies to break you out of those mental ruts and introduces new training methods to help you push through to higher levels of retention. Scott H. Young incorporates the latest research about the most effective learning methods and the stories of other ultralearners like himself—among them Benjamin Franklin, chess grandmaster Judit Polgár, and Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynman, as well as a host of others, such as little-known modern polymath Nigel Richards, who won the French World Scrabble Championship—without knowing French. Young documents the methods he and others have used to acquire knowledge and shows that, far from being an obscure skill limited to aggressive autodidacts, ultralearning is a powerful tool anyone can use to improve their career, studies, and life. Ultralearning explores this fascinating subculture, shares a proven framework for a successful ultralearning project, and offers insights into how you can organize and exe - cute a plan to learn anything deeply and quickly, without teachers or budget-busting tuition costs. Whether the goal is to be fluent in a language (or ten languages), earn the equivalent of a college degree in a fraction of the time, or master multiple tools to build a product or business from the ground up, the principles in Ultralearning will guide you to success.",Business & Economics,278,N/A,0,en

"The Capability Approach, Technology and Design","Ilse Oosterlaken, Jeroen van den Hoven",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-03-28,"The capability approach of Martha Nussbaum and Amartya Sen places human capabilities at the centre stage of discussions about justice, equality, development and the quality of life. It rejects too much emphasis on mere preference satisfaction or resource provision and highlights the importance of human agency and freedom. This approach has already significantly influenced different fields of application, such as economics and development studies. Only recently have scholars started to explore its relevance for and application to the area of technology and design, which can be crucial factors in the expansion of human capabilities. How does technology influence human capabilities? What difference could a capability approach make to policies and practices of applying ICT in development processes in the South? How can we criticize and improve the design of technology from the perspective of the capability approach? The authors of this volume explore the implications of the capability approach for technology & design and together create the first volume on this emerging topic.",Philosophy,258,N/A,0,en
Empirical Direction in Design and Analysis,Norman H. Anderson,Psychology Press,2001-07-01,"The goal of Norman H. Anderson's new book is to help students develop skills of scientific inference. To accomplish this he organized the book around the ""Experimental Pyramid""--six levels that represent a hierarchy of considerations in empirical investigation--conceptual framework, phenomena, behavior, measurement, design, and statistical inference. To facilitate conceptual and empirical understanding, Anderson de-emphasizes computational formulas and null hypothesis testing. Other features include: *emphasis on visual inspection as a basic skill in experimental analysis to help students develop an intuitive appreciation of data patterns; *exercises that emphasize development of conceptual and empirical application of methods of design and analysis and de-emphasize formulas and calculations; and *heavier emphasis on confidence intervals than significance tests. The book is intended for use in graduate-level experimental design/research methods or statistics courses in psychology, education, and other applied social sciences, as well as a professional resource for active researchers. The first 12 chapters present the core concepts graduate students must understand. The next nine chapters serve as a reference handbook by focusing on specialized topics with a minimum of technicalities.",Psychology,879,N/A,0,en

Harald Szeemann,"Glenn Phillips, Philipp Kaiser, Doris Chon, Pietro Rigolo",Getty Publications,2018-04-10,"Widely regarded as the most influential curator of the second half of the twentieth century, Harald Szeemann (1933–2005) is associated with some of the most important artistic developments of the postwar era. A passionate advocate for avant-garde movements like Conceptualism and Postminimalism, he collaborated with artists such as Joseph Beuys, Bruce Nauman, Richard Serra, and Cy Twombly, developing new ways of presenting art that reflected his sweeping vision of contemporary culture. Szeemann once stated that his goal as an exhibition maker was to create a “Museum of Obsessions.” This richly illustrated volume is a virtual collection catalogue for that imaginary institution, tracing the evolution of his curatorial method through letters, drawings, personal datebooks, installation plans, artists’ books, posters, photographs, and handwritten notes. This book documents all phases of Szeemann’s career, from his early stint as director of the Kunsthalle Bern, where he organized the seminal Live in Your Head: When Attitudes Become Form (1969); to documenta 5 (1972) and the intensely personal exhibition he staged in his own apart-ment using the belongings of his hairdresser grandfather (1974); to his reinvention as a freelance curator who realized projects on wide-ranging themes until his death in 2005. The book contains essays exploring Szeemann’s curatorial approach as well as interviews with collaborators. Its more than 350 illustrations include previously unpublished installation photographs and documents as well as archival materials. This volume is published to accompany an exhibition on view at the Getty Research Institute at the Getty Center February 6 to May 6, 2018 (a satellite show will be at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles February 4 to April 22, 2018); at the Kunsthalle Bern in Bern, Switzerland, June to September 2018; at the Kunsthalle Düsseldorf in Düsseldorf, Germany October 2018 to January 2019; and at the Castello di Rivoli Museo d’Arte Contemporanea Rivoli in Turin, Italy, February to May 2019.",Art,418,N/A,0,en

Design Thinking Research,"Christoph Meinel, Larry Leifer",Springer Nature,2021-03-26,"Extensive research conducted by the Hasso Plattner Design Thinking Research Program at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, USA, and the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam, Germany, has yielded valuable insights on why and how design thinking works. The participating researchers have identified metrics, developed models, and conducted studies, which are featured in this book, and in the previous volumes of this series. This volume provides readers with tools to bridge the gap between research and practice in design thinking with varied real world examples. Several different approaches to design thinking are presented in this volume. Acquired frameworks are leveraged to understand design thinking team dynamics. The contributing authors lead the reader through new approaches and application fields and show that design thinking can tap the potential of digital technologies in a human-centered way. In a final section, new ideas in neurodesign at Stanford University and at Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam are elaborated upon thereby challenging the reader to consider newly developed methodologies and provide discussion of how these insights can be applied to various sectors. Special emphasis is placed on understanding the mechanisms underlying design thinking at the individual and team levels. Design thinking can be learned. It has a methodology that can be observed across multiple settings and accordingly, the reader can adopt new frameworks to modify and update existing practice.

Supersonic Wing and Wing-body Shape Optimization Using an Adjoint Formulation,"James Reuther, Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science (U.S.)",N/A,1995,"Abstract: ""This paper describes the implementation of optimization techniques based on control theory for wing and wing-body design of supersonic configurations. The work represents an extension of our earlier research in which control theory is used to devise a design procedure that significantly reduces the computational cost by employing an adjoint equation. In previous studies it was shown that control theory could be used to devise transonic design methods for air-foils and wings in which the shape and the surrounding body-fitted mesh are both generated analytically, and the control is the mapping function [5, 6, 8]. The method has also been implemented for both transonic potential flows and transonic flows governed by the Euler equations using an alternative formulation which employs numerically generated grids, so that it can treat more general configurations [16, 9, 17]. Here results are presented for three-dimensional design cases subject to supersonic flows governed by the Euler equation.""",Aerodynamics,14,N/A,0,en

Individuals or individual groups of multidisciplinary design teams usually work in parallel and separately with various engineering tools, which are located on different sites, often for quite a long time. At any moment, individual members may be working on different versions of a design or viewing the design from various perspectives, at different levels of detail. In order to meet these requirements, it is necessary to have effective and efficient collaborative design environments. These environments should not only automate individual tasks, in the manner of traditional computer-aided engineering tools, but also enable individual members to share information, collaborate and coordinate their activities within the context of a design project.

Reintroducing Materials for Sustainable Design,Mette Bak-Andersen,Routledge,2021-05-07,"Reintroducing Materials for Sustainable Design provides instrumental theory and practical guidance to bring materials back into a central role in the design process and education. To create designs that are sustainable and respond to current environmental, economic and cultural concerns, practitioners and educators require a clear framework for materials use in design and product manufacturing. While much has been written about sustainable design over the last two decades, outlining systems of sustainability and product criteria, to design for material circularity requires a detailed understanding of the physical matter that constitutes products. Designers must not just know of materials but know how to manipulate them and work with them creatively. This book responds to the gap by offering a way to acquire the material knowledge necessary to design physical objects for sustainability. It reinforces the key role and responsibility of designers and encourages designers to take back control over the ideation and manufacturing process. Finally, it discusses the educational practice involved and the potential implications for design education following implementation, addressing didactics, facilities and expertise.

Instructional Design: International Perspectives I,"Sanne Dijkstra, Franz Schott, Robert D. Tennyson, Norbert M. Seel",Routledge,2013-05-13,"Instructional design theory and practice has evolved over the past 30 years from an initial narrow focus on programmed instruction to a multidimensional field of study integrating psychology, technology, evaluation, measurement, and management. The growth of instructional design (ID) has occurred because of direct needs, problems, and goals from society. Its application in planning instruction first developed in the United States with the Department of Defense during World War II with the purpose of meeting immediate concerns for effective training of larger numbers of military personnel. From the beginning, ID has rapidly expanded into applications in industrial and executive training, vocational training, classroom learning, and professional education. Although ID has its roots in the U.S., applications and theoretical growth is an international activity. However, literature at the international level is still limited to either individual author contributions or collections primarily represented by single countries. As a result, there is no standard reference source that contains the rich variety of theories and applications to form the international foundation for the field. The goal of this two-volume set is to establish international foundations for ID theory, research, and practice within the framework of the two following objectives: * to identify and define the theoretical, research, and model foundations for ID, and * to bridge the gap between ID foundations and application. Volume I includes chapters on philosophical and theoretical issues on learning theory and ID models. Volume II provides an overview of the state of the art of solving ID problems. The contributors offer contrasting points of view which provide a rare opportunity to see the diversity and complexity in the field.

The first volume of this handbook extensively explored these oppressive roles. This second volume illustrates that escaping the corporatized and bureaucratized orders of power, techno-managerial and consumer-oriented capitalist economic models is more urgent and necessary than ever before. Herein lies the political role of architecture and urban space, including the ways through which they can be transformed and alternative political realities constituted. The volume explores the methods and spatial practices required to activate the political dimension and the possibility for alternative practices to operate in the existing oppressive systems while not being swallowed by these structures. Fostering new political consciousness is explored in terms of the following themes: Events and Dissidence; Biopolitics, Ethics and Desire; Climate and Ecology; Urban Commons and Social Participation; Marginalities and Postcolonialism. Volume II embraces engagement across disciplines and offers a wide range of projects and critical analyses across the so-called Global North and South.

Repeat Printed Pattern for Interiors,Kate Farley,Bloomsbury Publishing,2023-01-12,"Repeating patterns can soothe or energize us, bringing joy and harmony to everyday life. Repeat Printed Pattern for Interiors explores the power repeat patterns hold over us and what goes into creating original, effective printed designs. Beginning with the history of patterns in interior design, Kate Farley uncovers lessons from the work of Owen Jones, William Morris, Collier Campbell and Josef Frank.

Darwin’S Racism,Leon Zitzer,iUniverse,2016-06-10,"Throughout the 19th century in the British Empire, parallel developments in science and the law were squeezing Aborigines everywhere into nonexistence. Charles Darwin took part in this. Again and again, he expressed his approval of the extermination of the native lower races. The more interesting part of the story is that there were plenty of voices, albeit a minority and mostly forgotten now, who objected on humanitarian grounds (and sometimes scientific grounds as well). Europeans, they said, were becoming polished savages and dehumanizing the Other. Darwin was very aware of this criticism and cared not one whit. As he said in a letter to Charles Lyell, I care not much whether we are looked at as mere savages in a remotely distant future. But he well knew it was not a remote future. He had read several writers who accused Europeans of being the real savages. For a brief moment in his youth in his Diary, he himself dabbled in such criticism, even though he already believed in the inferiority of indigenous peoples. That belief grew firmer as he matured. Darwin did not dispute humanitarians so much as he ignored them. Its a sad story. But oh those humanitarians, how they inspire.",History,856,5,1,en

As per the UGC NET 2022 exam pattern, the exam consists of two papers- Paper 1 and Paper 2. Both papers are comprised of objective-type multiple-choice questions (MCQs). There is no break between Paper 1 and 2. The exam will be conducted in Computer Based Test (CBT) mode. The medium of the UGC NET question paper is in English and Hindi languages only. Till December 2018, the UGC NET exam pattern was such that the test consisted of two papers (Paper 1 and 2) that were conducted in two different sessions. Candidates had to complete both the papers (Paper 1 and 2) in a duration of one and two hours, respectively. However, in June 2019, NTA changed the exam pattern as per which candidates now have to give both the papers in a single three-hour duration.In UGC NET Paper 1, the official website of NTA informs, ""The questions will be generic in nature, intending to assess the teaching/research aptitude of the candidate. It will primarily be designed to test reasoning ability, comprehension, divergent thinking and general awareness of the candidate.""This book ‘A Handbook for General Paper on Teaching & Research Aptitude (Paper -I) of UGC-NET & PET Exams: A Crash Course for all Aspiring Students’ (For All 101 Subjects) is an outcome of not just efforts from the authors, but contributions by many Research Scholars.

In Designing Design, he impresses upon the reader the importance of emptiness in both the visual and philosophical traditions of Japan, and its application to design, made visible by means of numerous examples from his own work: Hara for instance designed the opening and closing ceremony programs for the Nagano Winter Olympic Games 1998. In 2001, he enrolled as a board member for the Japanese label MUJI and has considerably moulded the identity of this successful corporation as communication and design advisor ever since.

"House of Commons - Culture, Media and Sport Committee: Supporting The Creative Economy - Volume I: HC 674","Great Britain: Parliament: House of Commons: Culture, Media and Sport Committee",The Stationery Office,2013-09-26,"This report warns that the extraordinary success of the UK's creative industries may be jeopardised by any dilution of intellectual property rights and the failure to tackle online piracy. The Committee also strongly condemns the failure of Google in particular to tackle access of copyright infringing websites through its search engine. Such illegal piracy, combined with proposals arising from the Hargreaves review to introduce copyright exceptions, and a failure to strengthen copyright enforcement as envisaged by the Digital Economy Act 2010, together threaten the livelihoods of the individuals and industries that contribute over £36 billion annually to the UK economy. Also, the Olympics No Marketing Rights scheme is excessively restrictive and is preventing British creative companies from realising the benefits they deserve from the Olympic legacy. The Committee calls for: a central champion of Intellectual Property in Government to promote and protect the interests of UK intellectual property; the maximum penalty for serious online IP theft to be increased to 10 years imprisonment, in line with the punishment for such offences in the physical world; more evidence and scrutiny before any exceptions to copyright such as those suggested by Hargreaves are applied; redoubled efforts to ensure that the video games tax credit is approved by the European Commission and introduced as soon as possible; reforms to the income tax and tax reliefs systems to recognise adequately the freelance nature of much creative work; greater recognition of the importance of arts subjects in the curriculum.",Business & Economics,428,N/A,0,en

I Won't Do Wrong,Hamish Robertson,AuthorHouse,2022-12-13,"This book is not a magic cure, but could be an aid for a sufferer or carer. If you wish to tackle this demon head on, and feel that education of the illness the only way forward, then this book is for you. Educate your self to the brim if you wish too, Hamish did, one thing that Hamish has learnt is that if you are prepared to be wrong it makes you more right even if you are not so. This book is about transient understanding and Hamish, being very transcendental, is well placed to observe and to experiment. This is not a case of the blind leading the blind but a story of how one person has ploughed through life with only his own mind and steely sincerity to work with. He has not stopped he has ploughed through life and has been able to explain his way to recovery, by writing this book. In effect educating himself better. His findings include voice hearing truths and untruths transient timing (probably the best evidence of the existence of God) Transient Response (the best way to experience God) duel realities Including Feuds Super Ego (Talking in tongues). The existence of numbers being more than just mathematical as well as other interesting true tales and short stories. He believes in four dimensions and in parallel universes, which are separated from our world and so are not dimensions but universes. He believes that there is a reason for the barrier between such universes. Having started writing for himself for personal progression he soon realised that this work could be worth something to others, and so he started writing to an audience and not just to himself. The essence of Hamish' life is represented in this book as transience, he is very transcendental and so is well placed to study its workings.",Self-Help,208,N/A,0,en

Designing with the Body,Kristina Hook,MIT Press,2024-03-12,"Interaction design that entails a qualitative shift from a symbolic, language-oriented stance to an experiential stance that encompasses the entire design and use cycle. With the rise of ubiquitous technology, data-driven design, and the Internet of Things, our interactions and interfaces with technology are about to change dramatically, incorporating such emerging technologies as shape-changing interfaces, wearables, and movement-tracking apps. A successful interactive tool will allow the user to engage in a smooth, embodied, interaction, creating an intimate correspondence between users' actions and system response. And yet, as Kristina Höök points out, current design methods emphasize symbolic, language-oriented, and predominantly visual interactions. In Designing with the Body, Höök proposes a qualitative shift in interaction design to an experiential, felt, aesthetic stance that encompasses the entire design and use cycle. Höök calls this new approach soma design; it is a process that reincorporates body and movement into a design regime that has long privileged language and logic. Soma design offers an alternative to the aggressive, rapid design processes that dominate commercial interaction design; it allows (and requires) a slow, thoughtful process that takes into account fundamental human values. She argues that this new approach will yield better products and create healthier, more sustainable companies. Höök outlines the theory underlying soma design and describes motivations, methods, and tools. She offers examples of soma design “encounters” and an account of her own design process. She concludes with “A Soma Design Manifesto,” which challenges interaction designers to “restart” their field—to focus on bodies and perception rather than reasoning and intellect.",Design,273,N/A,0,en

Software Design Decoded,"Marian Petre, Andre Van Der Hoek",MIT Press,2016-10-06,"An engaging, illustrated collection of insights revealing the practices and principles that expert software designers use to create great software. What makes an expert software designer? It is more than experience or innate ability. Expert software designers have specific habits, learned practices, and observed principles that they apply deliberately during their design work. This book offers sixty-six insights, distilled from years of studying experts at work, that capture what successful software designers actually do to create great software. The book presents these insights in a series of two-page illustrated spreads, with the principle and a short explanatory text on one page, and a drawing on the facing page. For example, “Experts generate alternatives” is illustrated by the same few balloons turned into a set of very different balloon animals. The text is engaging and accessible; the drawings are thought-provoking and often playful. Organized into such categories as “Experts reflect,” “Experts are not afraid,” and “Experts break the rules,” the insights range from “Experts prefer simple solutions” to “Experts see error as opportunity.” Readers learn that “Experts involve the user”; “Experts take inspiration from wherever they can”; “Experts design throughout the creation of software”; and “Experts draw the problem as much as they draw the solution.” One habit for an aspiring expert software designer to develop would be to read and reread this entertaining but essential little book. The insights described offer a guide for the novice or a reference for the veteran—in software design or any design profession. A companion web site provides an annotated bibliography that compiles key underpinning literature, the opportunity to suggest additional insights, and more.",Computers,185,N/A,0,en

Order without Design,Alain Bertaud,MIT Press,2024-08-06,"An argument that operational urban planning can be improved by the application of the tools of urban economics to the design of regulations and infrastructure. Urban planning is a craft learned through practice. Planners make rapid decisions that have an immediate impact on the ground—the width of streets, the minimum size of land parcels, the heights of buildings. The language they use to describe their objectives is qualitative—“sustainable,” “livable,” “resilient”—often with no link to measurable outcomes. Urban economics, on the other hand, is a quantitative science, based on theories, models, and empirical evidence largely developed in academic settings. In this book, the eminent urban planner Alain Bertaud argues that applying the theories of urban economics to the practice of urban planning would greatly improve both the productivity of cities and the welfare of urban citizens. Bertaud explains that markets provide the indispensable mechanism for cities’ development. He cites the experience of cities without markets for land or labor in pre-reform China and Russia; this “urban planners’ dream” created inefficiencies and waste. Drawing on five decades of urban planning experience in forty cities around the world, Bertaud links cities’ productivity to the size of their labor markets; argues that the design of infrastructure and markets can complement each other; examines the spatial distribution of land prices and densities; stresses the importance of mobility and affordability; and critiques the land use regulations in a number of cities that aim at redesigning existing cities instead of just trying to alleviate clear negative externalities. Bertaud concludes by describing the new role that joint teams of urban planners and economists could play to improve the way cities are managed.",Political Science,429,N/A,0,en

User Interface Design for Programmers,Avram Joel Spolsky,Apress,2008-01-01,"Most programmers' fear of user interface (UI) programming comes from their fear of doing UI design. They think that UI design is like graphic design—the mysterious process by which creative, latte-drinking, all-black-wearing people produce cool-looking, artistic pieces. Most programmers see themselves as analytic, logical thinkers instead—strong at reasoning, weak on artistic judgment, and incapable of doing UI design. In this brilliantly readable book, author Joel Spolsky proposes simple, logical rules that can be applied without any artistic talent to improve any user interface, from traditional GUI applications to websites to consumer electronics. Spolsky's primary axiom, the importance of bringing the program model in line with the user model, is both rational and simple. In a fun and entertaining way, Spolky makes user interface design easy for programmers to grasp. After reading User Interface Design for Programmers, you'll know how to design interfaces with the user in mind. You'll learn the important principles that underlie all good UI design, and you'll learn how to perform usability testing that works.",Computers,152,N/A,0,en

In addition to its High Street, Chiddingwick also possesses a Mayor, a Corporation, a town pump, an Early English church, a Baptist chapel, and abundant opportunities for alcoholic refreshment.

Discursive Design,"Bruce M. Tharp, Stephanie M. Tharp",MIT Press,2019-02-12,"Exploring how design can be used for good—prompting self-reflection, igniting the imagination, and affecting positive social change. Good design provides solutions to problems. It improves our buildings, medical equipment, clothing, and kitchen utensils, among other objects. But what if design could also improve societal problems by prompting positive ideological change? In this book, Bruce and Stephanie Tharp survey recent critical design practices and propose a new, more inclusive field of socially minded practice: discursive design. While many consider good design to be unobtrusive, intuitive, invisible, and undemanding intellectually, discursive design instead targets the intellect, prompting self-reflection and igniting the imagination. Discursive design (derived from “discourse”) expands the boundaries of how we can use design—how objects are, in effect, good(s) for thinking. Discursive Design invites us to see objects in a new light, to understand more than their basic form and utility. Beyond the different foci of critical design, speculative design, design fiction, interrogative design, and adversarial design, Bruce and Stephanie Tharp establish a more comprehensive, unifying vision as well as innovative methods. They not only offer social criticism but also explore how objects can, for example, be used by counselors in therapy sessions, by town councils to facilitate a pre-vote discussions, by activists seeking engagement, and by institutions and industry to better understand the values, beliefs, and attitudes of those whom they serve. Discursive design sparks new ways of thinking, and it is only through new thinking that our sociocultural futures can change.",Design,641,N/A,0,en

Design Alchemy,Roderick Sims,Springer Science & Business Media,2014-01-09,"The promise of online learning--flexible, learner-centered, responsive--was forward-looking and poised to revolutionize education. But too often online learning courses have little room for student engagement and their design does not reflect the potential for interactive and collaborative learning. Design Alchemy counters this trend by synthesizing the art and science of educational design to model a whole that transcends the sum of its parts. Challenging yet accessible, it clearly sets out steps for harnessing innovative strategies and designer creativity to provide educational platforms that reduce learner boredom and instructor burnout, and encourage deeper interaction with subject matter.

Design for Belonging,"Susie Wise, Stanford d.school",Ten Speed Press,2022-04-19,"A practical, illustrated guide to using the tools of design to create feelings of inclusion, collaboration, and respect in groups of any type or size—a classroom, a work team, an international organization—from Stanford University's d.school. “This is a beautiful book. Wise has applied the gift and imagination and lenses of the d.school to one of our most precious questions: how to create belonging.”—Priya Parker, author of the Art of Gathering and host of the New York Times podcast Together Apart Belonging brings out the best in everyone. Whether you’re a parent, teacher, community organizer, or leader of any sort, your group is unlikely to thrive if the individuals don’t feel welcomed, included, and valued for who they are. The good news is that you can use design to create feelings of inclusion in your organization: rituals that bring people together, spaces that promote calm, roles that create a sense of responsibility, systems that make people feel respected, and more. You can’t force feelings, but in Design for Belonging, author and educator Susie Wise explains how to use simple levers of design to set the stage for belonging to emerge. For example, add moveable furniture to a meeting space to customize for your group size; switch up the role of group leader regularly to increase visibility for everyone; or create a special ritual for people joining or leaving your organization to welcome fresh per­spectives and honor work well done. Inspiration and stories from leaders and scholars are paired with frameworks, tools, and tips, providing an opportunity to try on different approaches. By the end of the book, you’ll be able to spot where a greater sense of belonging is needed and actively shape your world to cultivate it—whether it’s a party, a high-stakes meeting, or a new national organization.",Business & Economics,167,N/A,0,en
Inclusive Design for a Digital World,Regine M. Gilbert,Apress,2019-12-19,"What is inclusive design? It is simple. It means that your product has been created with the intention of being accessible to as many different users as possible. For a long time, the concept of accessibility has been limited in terms of only defining physical spaces. However, change is afoot: personal technology now plays a part in the everyday lives of most of us, and thus it is a responsibility for designers of apps, web pages, and more public-facing tech products to make them accessible to all. Our digital era brings progressive ideas and paradigm shifts – but they are only truly progressive if everybody can participate. In Inclusive Design for a Digital World, multiple crucial aspects of technological accessibility are confronted, followed by step-by-step solutions from User Experience Design professor and author Regine Gilbert. Think about every potential user who could be using your product. Could they be visually impaired? Have limited motor skills? Be deaf or hard of hearing? This book addresses a plethora of web accessibility issues that people with disabilities face. Your app might be blocking out an entire sector of the population without you ever intending or realizing it. For example, is your instructional text full of animated words and Emoji icons? This makes it difficult for a user with vision impairment to use an assistive reading device, such as a speech synthesizer, along with your app correctly. In Inclusive Design for a Digital World, Gilbert covers the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 requirements, emerging technologies such as VR and AR, best practices for web development, and more. As a creator in the modern digital era, your aim should be to make products that are inclusive of all people. Technology has, overall, increased connection and information equality around the world. To continue its impact, access and usability of such technology must be made a priority, and there is no better place to get started than Inclusive Design for a Digital World. What You’ll LearnThe moral, ethical, and high level legal reasons for accessible design Tools and best practices for user research and web developers The different types of designs for disabilities on various platforms Familiarize yourself with web compliance guidelines Test products and usability best practicesUnderstand past innovations and future opportunities for continued improvementWho This Book Is For Practitioners of product design, product development, content, and design can benefit from this book.",Computers,292,N/A,0,en

Addiction by Design,Natasha Dow Schüll,Princeton University Press,2014-05-11,"An anthropologist looks at the new ""crack cocaine"" of high-tech gambling Recent decades have seen a dramatic shift away from social forms of gambling played around roulette wheels and card tables to solitary gambling at electronic terminals. Slot machines, revamped by ever more compelling digital and video technology, have unseated traditional casino games as the gambling industry's revenue mainstay. Addiction by Design takes readers into the intriguing world of machine gambling, an increasingly popular and absorbing form of play that blurs the line between human and machine, compulsion and control, risk and reward. Drawing on fifteen years of field research in Las Vegas, anthropologist Natasha Dow Schüll shows how the mechanical rhythm of electronic gambling pulls players into a trancelike state they call the ""machine zone,"" in which daily worries, social demands, and even bodily awareness fade away. Once in the zone, gambling addicts play not to win but simply to keep playing, for as long as possible—even at the cost of physical and economic exhaustion. In continuous machine play, gamblers seek to lose themselves while the gambling industry seeks profit. Schüll describes the strategic calculations behind game algorithms and machine ergonomics, casino architecture and ""ambience management,"" player tracking and cash access systems—all designed to meet the market's desire for maximum ""time on device."" Her account moves from casino floors into gamblers' everyday lives, from gambling industry conventions and Gamblers Anonymous meetings to regulatory debates over whether addiction to gambling machines stems from the consumer, the product, or the interplay between the two. Addiction by Design is a compelling inquiry into the intensifying traffic between people and machines of chance, offering clues to some of the broader anxieties and predicaments of contemporary life. At stake in Schüll's account of the intensifying traffic between people and machines of chance is a blurring of the line between design and experience, profit and loss, control and compulsion.",Social Science,456,N/A,0,en

Institutional Design,David L. Weimer,Springer Science & Business Media,1995-03-31,"Policy scientists have long been concerned with understanding the basic tools, or instruments, that governments can use to accomplish their goals. The initial interest in inductively developing comprehensive lists of generic instruments for policy analysis soon gave way to efforts to discover more parsimonious, but still useful, specifications of the elementary components out of which instruments can be assembled. Moving from a generic instrument to a fully specified policy alternative, however, requires the designer to go much beyond the elementary components. Rather than directly specifying some of these details, the designer may instead set the rules by which they will be specified. The creation of these specifications and rules can be thought of as institutional design. This book helps scholars and policy analysts formulate more effective policy alternatives by a better understanding of institutional design. The feasibility and effectiveness of policies depend on the political, economic, and social contexts in which they are embedded. These contexts provide an environment of existing institutions that offer opportunities and barriers to institutional design. A fundamental understanding of institutional design requires theories of institutions and institutional change. With a resurgence of interest in institutions in recent years, there are many possible sources of theory. The contributors to this volume draw from the variety of sources to identify implications for understanding institutional design.",Business & Economics,206,N/A,0,en
Designing the Social,Harry T. Dyer,Springer Nature,2020-06-11,"This book uses data collected from in-depth interviews with young people over the course of a year to explore the complex role of social media in their lives, and the part it plays in shaping how they understand and present their identity to a broad public on a wide array of platforms. Using this data, the book proposes and develops a new theoretical framework for understanding identity performances. Comic Theory, detailed in this book, centres on a consideration of the role of social media design in shaping identity, and explores the ways in which socio-culturally grounded users engage in acts of compromise, novelty, and negotiation with social media designs and digital technologies to produce unique identity performances. Positioned within the field of educational research, this book overtly challenges assumptions and myths about the internet as a neutral source of knowledge, instead exploring the way in which designs and technologies shape who we interact with and how we understand what it is to be social. Moving beyond the over-used ‘digital natives’ paradigm, this book makes a clear case that educators and education researchers need to move beyond a focus on coding and digital skills alone, highlighting the pressing need to take explicit account of the overlaps between digital technology, culture, and education.",Social Science,177,5,1,en
Design Things,"Thomas Binder, Giorgio De Michelis, Pelle Ehn, Giulio Jacucci, Per Linde",MIT Press,2024-12-17,"A new perspective on design thinking and design practice: beyond products and projects, toward participatory design things. Design Things offers an innovative view of design thinking and design practice, envisioning ways to combine creative design with a participatory approach encompassing aesthetic and democratic practices and values. The authors of Design Things look at design practice as a mode of inquiry that involves people, space, artifacts, materials, and aesthetic experience, following the process of transformation from a design concept to a thing. Design Things, which grew out of the Atelier (Architecture and Technology for Inspirational Living) research project, goes beyond the making of a single object to view design projects as sociomaterial assemblies of humans and artifacts—“design things.” The book offers both theoretical and practical perspectives, providing empirical support for the authors' conceptual framework with field projects, case studies, and examples from professional practice. The authors examine the dynamics of the design process; the multiple transformations of the object of design; metamorphing, performing, and taking place as design strategies; the concept of the design space as “emerging landscapes”; the relation between design and use; and the design of controversial things.",Design,257,N/A,0,en

Mindful Design,Scott Riley,Apress,2018-12-10,"Learn to create seamless designs backed by a responsible understanding of the human mind. This book examines how human behavior can be used to integrate your product design into lifestyle, rather than interrupt it, and make decisions for the good of those that are using your product. Mindful Design introduces the areas of brain science that matter to designers, and passionately explains how those areas affect each human’s day-to-day experiences with products and interfaces. You will learn about the neurological aspects and limitations of human vision and perception; about our attachment to harmony and dissonance, such as visual harmony, musical harmony; and about our brain’s propensity towards pattern recognition and how we perceive the world cognitively. In the second half of the book you will focus on the practical application of what you have learned, specific to interaction and interface design. Real-world examples are used throughout so that you can really see how design is impacting our everyday digital experience. Design is a responsibility, but not enough designers understand the human mind or the process of thought. This book explores the key factors involved and shows you how to make the right design choices. What You'll Learn Review how attention and distraction work and the cost of attentional switching Use Gestalt principles to communicate visual grouping Ensure your underlying models make sense to your audience Use time, progression, and transition to create a composition Carefully examine controlling behavior through reductionist and behaviorist motivation concepts Apply the theoretical knowledge to practical, mindful application design Who This Book Is For The primary audience for this book is professional designers who wish to learn more about the human mind and how to apply that to their work. The book is also useful for design-focussed product owners and startup founders who wish to apply ethical thinking to a team, or when bootstrapping their products. The secondary audience is design students who are either studying a ‘traditional’ visual design course, or a UX/interaction design course who have a desire to learn how they might be able to apply mindful design to their early careers. Finally, a tertiary audience for this book would be tutors involved in teaching design, or peripheral, courses who may wish to incorporate its teachings into their lectures, workshops or seminars.",Computers,368,N/A,0,en

"Design Rules, Volume 1","Carliss Y. Baldwin, Kim B. Clark",MIT Press,2000-03-02,"We live in a dynamic economic and commerical world, surrounded by objects of remarkable complexity and power. In many industries, changes in products and technologies have brought with them new kinds of firms and forms of organization. We are discovering news ways of structuring work, of bringing buyers and sellers together, and of creating and using market information. Although our fast-moving economy often seems to be outside of our influence or control, human beings create the things that create the market forces. Devices, software programs, production processes, contracts, firms, and markets are all the fruit of purposeful action: they are designed. Using the computer industry as an example, Carliss Y. Baldwin and Kim B. Clark develop a powerful theory of design and industrial evolution. They argue that the industry has experienced previously unimaginable levels of innovation and growth because it embraced the concept of modularity, building complex products from smaller subsystems that can be designed independently yet function together as a whole. Modularity freed designers to experiment with different approaches, as long as they obeyed the established design rules. Drawing upon the literatures of industrial organization, real options, and computer architecture, the authors provide insight into the forces of change that drive today's economy.",Business & Economics,508,N/A,0,en

Segregation by Design,Jessica Trounstine,Cambridge University Press,2018-11-15,"Segregation by Design draws on more than 100 years of quantitative and qualitative data from thousands of American cities to explore how local governments generate race and class segregation. Starting in the early twentieth century, cities have used their power of land use control to determine the location and availability of housing, amenities (such as parks), and negative land uses (such as garbage dumps). The result has been segregation - first within cities and more recently between them. Documenting changing patterns of segregation and their political mechanisms, Trounstine argues that city governments have pursued these policies to enhance the wealth and resources of white property owners at the expense of people of color and the poor. Contrary to leading theories of urban politics, local democracy has not functioned to represent all residents. The result is unequal access to fundamental local services - from schools, to safe neighborhoods, to clean water.",Political Science,287,N/A,0,en

Mind Design II,John Haugeland,MIT Press,1997-03-06,"Mind design is the endeavor to understand mind (thinking, intellect) in terms of its design (how it is built, how it works). Unlike traditional empirical psychology, it is more oriented toward the ""how"" than the ""what."" An experiment in mind design is more likely to be an attempt to build something and make it work—as in artificial intelligence—than to observe or analyze what already exists. Mind design is psychology by reverse engineering. When Mind Design was first published in 1981, it became a classic in the then-nascent fields of cognitive science and AI. This second edition retains four landmark essays from the first, adding to them one earlier milestone (Turing's ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"") and eleven more recent articles about connectionism, dynamical systems, and symbolic versus nonsymbolic models. The contributors are divided about evenly between philosophers and scientists. Yet all are ""philosophical"" in that they address fundamental issues and concepts; and all are ""scientific"" in that they are technically sophisticated and concerned with concrete empirical research.

There is no single text that addresses the plethora of design issues a medical devices designer meets when developing new products or improving older ones. It addresses medical devices' regulatory (FDA and EU) requirements--some of the most stringent engineering requirements globally. Engineers failing to meet these requirements can cause serious harm to users as well as their products' commercial prospects. This Handbook shows the essential methodologies medical designers must understand to ensure their products meet requirements. It brings together proven design protocols and puts them in an explicit medical context based on the author's years of academia (R&D phase) and industrial (commercialization phase) experience. This design methodology enables engineers and medical device manufacturers to bring new products to the marketplace rapidly. The medical device market is a multi-billion dollar industry. Every engineered product for this sector, from scalpelsstents to complex medical equipment, must be designed and developed to approved procedures and standards. This book shows how. Covers US, and EU and ISO standards, enabling a truly international approach, providing a guide to the international standards that practicing engineers require to understand. Written by an experienced medical device engineers and entrepreneurs with products in the from the US and UK and with real world experience of developing and commercializing medical products.",Medical,350,N/A,0,en

Accessible America,Bess Williamson,NYU Press,2019-01-15,"A history of design that is often overlooked—until we need it Have you ever hit the big blue button to activate automatic doors? Have you ever used an ergonomic kitchen tool? Have you ever used curb cuts to roll a stroller across an intersection? If you have, then you’ve benefited from accessible design—design for people with physical, sensory, and cognitive disabilities. These ubiquitous touchstones of modern life were once anything but. Disability advocates fought tirelessly to ensure that the needs of people with disabilities became a standard part of public design thinking. That fight took many forms worldwide, but in the United States it became a civil rights issue; activists used design to make an argument about the place of people with disabilities in public life. In the aftermath of World War II, with injured veterans returning home and the polio epidemic reaching the Oval Office, the needs of people with disabilities came forcibly into the public eye as they never had before. The US became the first country to enact federal accessibility laws, beginning with the Architectural Barriers Act in 1968 and continuing through the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990, bringing about a wholesale rethinking of our built environment. This progression wasn’t straightforward or easy. Early legislation and design efforts were often haphazard or poorly implemented, with decidedly mixed results. Political resistance to accommodating the needs of people with disabilities was strong; so, too, was resistance among architectural and industrial designers, for whom accessible design wasn’t “real” design. Bess Williamson provides an extraordinary look at everyday design, marrying accessibility with aesthetic, to provide an insight into a world in which we are all active participants, but often passive onlookers. Richly detailed, with stories of politics and innovation, Williamson’s Accessible America takes us through this important history, showing how American ideas of individualism and rights came to shape the material world, often with unexpected consequences.",Design,290,N/A,0,en

Guerrilla Publishing,Derek Murphy,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2017-01-24,"TRAIN THE INTERNET TO SELL BOOKS FOR YOU Book marketing doesn't need to be an exhausting hamster wheel of promotion and publicity. Put your book sales on autopilot... so you can focus on writing your next bestseller. FAST AND EFFECTIVE BOOK MARKETING This book is a crash course on some of the more creative book marketing strategies I've discovered in my first year of publishing fiction. It will provide simple, actionable, measurable steps to publishing a high quality book quickly, doing only as much marketing as is necessary to launch your book like a rock star, and keep it selling enough to support you while you write another. I only mention the things I actually use, that I know work, and ignore options that don't get results. We'll discuss paid advertising, release strategies, pricing and pre-orders, book giveaways, how to target your audience, viral exposure and press coverage, marketing hacks, and how to reach your first $1000 on Kindle. LAUNCH BIG EVEN IF YOU'RE STARTING SMALL Guerrilla is a style of warfare intended to surprise and harass enemies. It can also mean using unconventional and usually inexpensive means to generate interest or raise concern among the public. That's basically how I'll use it: book marketing strategies from the trenches to help you win the publishing war. However, instead of ""surprise and harass"" I will focus on ""surprise and delight."" First you need to show up and get in front of the right people. Then you need to surprise and delight them. You need to be remarkable enough to be noticed. Few authors are using these strategies (yet) so it's relatively easy to outrank your competition, get more visibility and reach new readers.",,152,N/A,0,en

Our Enemies in Blue,Kristian Williams,AK Press,2015-08-03,"Let's begin with the basics: violence is an inherent part of policing. The police represent the most direct means by which the state imposes its will on the citizenry. They are armed, trained, and authorized to use force. Like the possibility of arrest, the threat of violence is implicit in every police encounter. Violence, as well as the law, is what they represent. Using media reports alone, the Cato Institute's last annual study listed nearly seven thousand victims of police ""misconduct"" in the United States. But such stories of police brutality only scratch the surface of a national epidemic. Every year, tens of thousands are framed, blackmailed, beaten, sexually assaulted, or killed by cops. Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on civil judgments and settlements annually. Individual lives, families, and communities are destroyed. In this extensively revised and updated edition of his seminal study of policing in the United States, Kristian Williams shows that police brutality isn't an anomaly, but is built into the very meaning of law enforcement in the United States. From antebellum slave patrols to today's unarmed youth being gunned down in the streets, ""peace keepers"" have always used force to shape behavior, repress dissent, and defend the powerful. Our Enemies in Blue is a well-researched page-turner that both makes historical sense of this legalized social pathology and maps out possible alternatives.",Political Science,532,N/A,0,en

Building for Life,Stephen R. Kellert,Island Press,2012-09-26,"Sustainable design has made great strides in recent years; unfortunately, it still falls short of fully integrating nature into our built environment. Through a groundbreaking new paradigm of ""restorative environmental design,"" award-winning author Stephen R. Kellert proposes a new architectural model of sustainability. In Building For Life, Kellert examines the fundamental interconnectedness of people and nature, and how the loss of this connection results in a diminished quality of life. This thoughtful new work illustrates how architects and designers can use simple methods to address our innate needs for contact with nature. Through the use of natural lighting, ventilation, and materials, as well as more unexpected methodologies-the use of metaphor, perspective, enticement, and symbol-architects can greatly enhance our daily lives. These design techniques foster intellectual development, relaxation, and physical and emotional well-being. In the works of architects like Frank Lloyd Wright, Eero Saarinen, Cesar Pelli, Norman Foster, and Michael Hopkins, Kellert sees the success of these strategies and presents models for moving forward. Ultimately, Kellert views our fractured relationship with nature as a design problem rather than an unavoidable aspect of modern life, and he proposes many practical and creative solutions for cultivating a more rewarding experience of nature in our built environment.",Architecture,261,3,3,en

Systems Biology Application in Synthetic Biology,Shailza Singh,Springer,2016-09-08,"This book introduces students to methods that will help them understand behaviour in terms of cellular components and their interactions in non-intuitive ways, which calls for an interdisciplinary approach combining mathematical, chemical, computational and biological strategies. Tibor Ganti was one of the early pioneers who proposed a theoretical framework to understand living principles in terms of chemical transformation cycles and their coupling. The twenty-first century then brought with it a novel ‘systems’ paradigm, which shone new light on all previous work and was accompanied by numerous implications for the way we conceive of chemical and biological complexity today. This book seeks to equip students to take advantage of any field that investigates living systems. Based on a conceptualisation of science-oriented branches, engineering-oriented branches and biology as astoundingly complex fields, those structures laden with biochemical detail encompass a deeper theory unifying our knowledge of designed systems. Readers will be pleasantly surprised at how lucidly the topics are presented.

The regressors are supposed to belong to a generic finite dimensional Haar linear space, which substitutes for the classical polynomial case. The estimation pertains to a general linear form of the coefficients of the model, extending the interpolation and extrapolation framework; the errors in the model may be correlated, and the model may be heteroscedastic. Non-linear models, as well as multivariate ones, are briefly discussed. The book focuses to a large extent on criteria for optimality, and an entire chapter presents algorithms leading to optimal designs in multivariate models.

Slotta, Nathaniel Lasry",Frontiers Media SA,2019-07-11,"This book represents the emerging efforts of a growing international network of researchers and practitioners to promote the development and uptake of evidence-based pedagogies in higher education, at something a level approaching large-scale impact. By offering a communication venue that attracts and enhances much needed partnerships among practitioners and researchers in pedagogical innovation, we aim to change the conversation and focus on how we work and learn together – i.e. extending the implementation and knowledge of co–design methods. In this first edition of our Research Topic on Active Learning, we highlight two (of the three) types of publications we wish to promote. First are studies aimed at understanding the pedagogical designs developed by practitioners in their own practices by bringing to bear the theoretical lenses developed and tested in the education research community. These types of studies constitute the ""practice pull"" that we see as a necessary counterbalance to ""knowledge push"" in a more productive pedagogical innovation ecosystem based on research-practitioner partnerships. Second are studies empirically examining the implementations of evidence-based designs in naturalistic settings and under naturalistic conditions. Interestingly, the teams conducting these studies are already exemplars of partnerships between researchers and practitioners who are uniquely positioned as “in-betweens” straddling the two worlds. As a result, these publications represent both the rigours of research and the pragmatism of reflective practice. In forthcoming editions, we will add to this collection a third type of publication -- design profiles. These will present practitioner-developed pedagogical designs at varying levels of abstraction to be held to scrutiny amongst practitioners, instructional designers and researchers alike. We hope by bringing these types of studies together in an open access format that we may contribute to the development of new forms of practitioner-researcher interactions that promote co-design in pedagogical innovation.",,172,N/A,0,en

With the progress of social civilization, social science and its research are becoming more and more important. Theoretically and practically, the study of social phenomena and social problems and the development of prosperous social sciences are the eternal themes of human beings. At present, social science research and its results can hardly meet the needs of social development, especially the unscientific evaluation of social science results, which has aroused great concern from all walks of life, and has produced dirt and questions on social science, thus affecting the proper development of social science. Max Weber once said that ""the most important function of social science in modern times is to keep people ""clear-headed"" and to resist the delusions of ""prophetic legislators"". "" Humanities and arts are the process of perceiving, realizing, thinking, manipulating, and expressing objective or subjective objects through capturing and excavating, feeling and analyzing, integrating and applying, or displaying the stage results in the form obtained through feeling (seeing, hearing, smelling, touching). The social sciences and humanities and arts contain content that will directly affect our lives and the way society functions. And by reacting to today's increasingly intricate problems and situations through systematic and professional discussions, they will further contribute to the improvement of institutions and the development of society. By thinking about issues and looking at problems and the world from different perspectives by putting the two together, it may be possible to have more comprehensive, appropriate, and better responses; for example, the development of laws requires a deeper understanding of the environment in which they are implemented; international trade requires a certain understanding of the customs of different countries; and the development of tax and economic policies requires a certain understanding of the population, consumer demand, etc.",Social Science,1398,N/A,0,en

Perspectives in Civil Engineering,Jeffrey S. Russell,ASCE Publications,2003-01-01,"This report contains 27 papers that serve as a testament to the state-of-the-art of civil engineering at the outset of the 21st century, as well as to commemorate the ASCE's Sesquicentennial. Written by the leading practitioners, educators, and researchers of civil engineering, each of these peer-reviewed papers explores a particular aspect of civil engineering knowledge and practice. Each paper explores the development of a particular civil engineering specialty, including milestones and future barriers, constraints, and opportunities. The papers celebrate the history, heritage, and accomplishments of the profession in all facets of practice, including construction facilities, special structures, engineering mechanics, surveying and mapping, irrigation and water quality, forensics, computing, materials, geotechnical engineering, hydraulic engineering, and transportation engineering. While each paper is unique, collectively they provide a snapshot of the profession while offering thoughtful predictions of likely developments in the years to come. Together the papers illuminate the mounting complexity facing civil engineering stemming from rapid growth in scientific knowledge, technological development, and human populations, especially in the last 50 years. An overarching theme is the need for systems-level approaches and consideration from undergraduate education through advanced engineering materials, processes, technologies, and design methods and tools. These papers speak to the need for civil engineers of all specialties to recognize and embrace the growing interconnectedness of the global infrastructure, economy, society, and the need to work for more sustainable, life-cycle-oriented solutions. While embracing the past and the present, the papers collected here clearly have an eye on the future needs of ASCE and the civil engineering profession.",Technology & Engineering,422,5,1,en

A life cycle decision framework of China offshore wind turbines with ANP-Intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS method,"Jiaxuan Zhou, Liming Wang, Fangyi Li, Chunli Ge, Jianfeng Li, Yitong Wang, Lin Kong, Jing Guo",OAE Publishing Inc.,2024-03-18,"In China, offshore wind energy is a popular source of green energy. Selecting offshore wind turbine design schemes is a decision problem based on multiple criteria. However, the selection is hardly made from the point of view of the life cycle due to the complex association of evaluation criteria, especially in the conceptual design stage. To solve this problem, a new multi-criteria decision-making framework for selecting the life cycle design scheme of offshore wind turbines is designed. The design information of the life cycle process of these turbines is expressed using Function-Structure-Material-Process-Transportation model in this framework. The life cycle evaluation index system of offshore wind turbines was established and mapped with this model to carry out rapid evaluation of various schemes. In light of this, an intuitive fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method based on analytic network process (ANP) was proposed to process fuzzy decision information and establish criteria correlation. Finally, a case study was conducted, and sensitivity and comparative analyses were carried out. The proposed method can effectively select the optimal scheme from six different design schemes for the life cycle of offshore wind turbines.",Technology & Engineering,25,N/A,0,en

In the Bubble,John Thackara,MIT Press,2006-02-17,"How to design a world in which we rely less on stuff, and more on people. We're filling up the world with technology and devices, but we've lost sight of an important question: What is this stuff for? What value does it add to our lives? So asks author John Thackara in his new book, In the Bubble: Designing for a Complex World. These are tough questions for the pushers of technology to answer. Our economic system is centered on technology, so it would be no small matter if ""tech"" ceased to be an end-in-itself in our daily lives. Technology is not going to go away, but the time to discuss the end it will serve is before we deploy it, not after. We need to ask what purpose will be served by the broadband communications, smart materials, wearable computing, and connected appliances that we're unleashing upon the world. We need to ask what impact all this stuff will have on our daily lives. Who will look after it, and how? In the Bubble is about a world based less on stuff and more on people. Thackara describes a transformation that is taking place now—not in a remote science fiction future; it's not about, as he puts it, ""the schlock of the new"" but about radical innovation already emerging in daily life. We are regaining respect for what people can do that technology can't. In the Bubble describes services designed to help people carry out daily activities in new ways. Many of these services involve technology—ranging from body implants to wide-bodied jets. But objects and systems play a supporting role in a people-centered world. The design focus is on services, not things. And new principles—above all, lightness—inform the way these services are designed and used. At the heart of In the Bubble is a belief, informed by a wealth of real-world examples, that ethics and responsibility can inform design decisions without impeding social and technical innovation.",Business & Economics,334,N/A,0,en

Design Technics,"Zeynep Çelik Alexander, John May",U of Minnesota Press,2020-01-21,"Leading scholars historicize and theorize technology’s role in architectural design Although the question of technics pervades the contemporary discipline of architecture, there are few critical analyses on the topic. Design Technics fills this gap, arguing that the technical dimension of design has often been flattened into the broader celebratory rhetoric of innovation. Bringing together leading scholars in architectural and design history, the volume’s contributors situate these tools on a broader epistemological and chronological canvas. The essays here construct histories—some panoramic and others unfolding around a specific episode—of seven techniques regularly used by the designer in the architectural studio today: rendering, modeling, scanning, equipping, specifying, positioning, and repeating. Starting with observations about the epistemological changes that have unfolded in the discipline in recent decades but seeking to offer a more expansive meaning for technics, the volume casts new light on concepts such as form, experience, and image that have played central roles in historical architectural discourses. Among the questions addressed: How was the concept of form immanent in practices of scanning since the late nineteenth century? What was the historical relationship between rendering and experience in Enlightenment discourses? How did practices of specifying reconfigure the distinction between intellectual and manual labor? What kind of rationality is inherent in the designer’s constant clicking of the mouse in front of her screen? In addressing these and other questions, this engaging and timely collection thereby proposes technics as a site for historical and philosophical reflection not only for those engaged in architectural design but also for any scholar working in the humanities today.

Design in Nature,"Adrian Bejan, J. Peder Zane",Anchor,2013-01-08,"In this groundbreaking book, Adrian Bejan takes the recurring patterns in nature—trees, tributaries, air passages, neural networks, and lightning bolts—and reveals how a single principle of physics, the constructal law, accounts for the evolution of these and many other designs in our world. Everything—from biological life to inanimate systems—generates shape and structure and evolves in a sequence of ever-improving designs in order to facilitate flow. River basins, cardiovascular systems, and bolts of lightning are very efficient flow systems to move a current—of water, blood, or electricity. Likewise, the more complex architecture of animals evolve to cover greater distance per unit of useful energy, or increase their flow across the land. Such designs also appear in human organizations, like the hierarchical “flowcharts” or reporting structures in corporations and political bodies. All are governed by the same principle, known as the constructal law, and configure and reconfigure themselves over time to flow more efficiently. Written in an easy style that achieves clarity without sacrificing complexity, Design in Nature is a paradigm-shifting book that will fundamentally transform our understanding of the world around us.",Science,306,N/A,0,en
Legal Writing by Design,"Teresa J. Reid Rambo, Leanne J. Pflaum",N/A,2013,"The second edition of Legal Writing by Design remains unique in demonstrating how to transform thoughts into writing by explaining the link between thinking and writing. It doesn't just tell the reader to ""argue by analogy"" or to ""apply the rule"" -- it explains the design of the thinking involved in those processes and shows how to transform that design into writing. Through easily understandable hypotheticals, outlines, graphics, exercises, and writing samples, many garnered during the authors' combined forty-plus years of teaching legal writing and appellate advocacy to law students, Legal Writing by Design comprehensively demonstrates how to transform ideas into exceptional writing. It demystifies the writing process by explaining the design of (1) deductive and inductive reasoning, (2) analogical thinking, and (3) relevancy. Once that design is understood, writing becomes easy. Writing with liberal doses of humor, the authors provide clearly readable charts, examples, and templates throughout this second edition. All chapters include a chapter review, and many also provide writing prompts. In addition to chapters explaining the fundamentals of writing legal memos and briefs, Legal Writing by Design contains sections on (1) clear and effective writing; (2) the appellate process, including an easily understandable explanation of standards of review; (3) oral argument techniques and practice; (4) the writing and editing process; (5) case briefing; and (6) professionalism in the practice of law. Exercises corresponding to the principles explained are included throughout most chapters, with answers provided in a separate Teacher's Manual. Successfully used for over ten years by thousands of law school students, Legal Writing by Design is the perfect tool for anyone -- attorneys, legal assistants, pro se litigants, undergraduate students, or the public -- who seeks the ideal way to analyze issues, to write clearly, and to write persuasively.",Law,0,N/A,0,en

Designs on the Public,Kristine F. Miller,U of Minnesota Press,N/A,"New York City is home to some of the most recognizable places in the world. As familiar as the sight of New Year’s Eve in Times Square or a protest in front of City Hall may be to us, do we understand who controls what happens there? Kristine Miller delves into six of New York’s most important public spaces to trace how design influences their complicated lives. Miller chronicles controversies in the histories of New York locations including Times Square, Trump Tower, the IBM Atrium, and Sony Plaza. The story of each location reveals that public space is not a concrete or fixed reality, but rather a constantly changing situation open to the forces of law, corporations, bureaucracy, and government. The qualities of public spaces we consider essential, including accessibility, public ownership, and ties to democratic life, are, at best, temporary conditions and often completely absent. Design is, in Miller’s view, complicit in regulation of public spaces in New York City to exclude undesirables, restrict activities, and privilege commercial interests, and in this work she shows how design can reactivate public space and public life.

Designing Experiences,"J. Robert Rossman, Mathew D. Duerden",Columbia University Press,2019-07-23,"In an increasingly experience-driven economy, companies that deliver great experiences thrive, and those that do not die. Yet many organizations face difficulties implementing a vision of delivering experiences beyond the provision of goods and services. Because experience design concepts and approaches are spread across multiple, often disconnected disciplines, there is no book that succinctly explains to students and aspiring professionals how to design them. J. Robert Rossman and Mathew D. Duerden present a comprehensive and accessible introduction to experience design. They synthesize the fundamental theories and methods from multiple disciplines and lay out a process for designing experiences from start to finish. Rossman and Duerden challenge us to reflect on what makes a great experience from the user’s perspective. They provide a framework of experience types, explaining people’s engagement with products and services and what makes experiences personal and fulfilling. The book presents interdisciplinary research underlying key concepts such as memory, intentionality, and dramatic structure in a down-to-earth style, drawing attention to both the macro and micro levels. Designing Experiences features detailed instructions and numerous real-world examples that clarify theoretical principles, making it useful for students and professionals. An invaluable overview of a growing field, the book provides readers with the tools they need to design innovative and indelible experiences and to move their organizations into the experience economy.

"Reach Everyone, Teach Everyone","Thomas J. Tobin, Kirsten T. Behling",N/A,2018,"Advocates for the rights of people with disabilities have worked hard to make universal design in the built environment ""just part of what we do."" We no longer see curb cuts, for instance, as accommodations for people with disabilities, but perceive their usefulness every time we ride our bikes or push our strollers through crosswalks. This is also a perfect model for Universal Design for Learning (UDL), a framework grounded in the neuroscience of why, what, and how people learn. Tobin and Behling show that, although it is often associated with students with disabilities, UDL can be profitably broadened toward a larger ease-of-use and general diversity framework. Captioned instructional videos, for example, benefit learners with hearing impairments but also the student who worries about waking her young children at night or those studying on a noisy team bus. Reach Everyone, Teach Everyone is aimed at faculty members, faculty-service staff, disability support providers, student-service staff, campus leaders, and graduate students who want to strengthen the engagement, interaction, and performance of all college students. It includes resources for readers who want to become UDL experts and advocates: real-world case studies, active-learning techniques, UDL coaching skills, micro- and macro-level UDL-adoption guidance, and use-them-now resources.","Education, Higher",0,N/A,0,en

"Drawing, Design, and Craft-Work",Frederick J. Glass,Colchis Books,N/A,"It is hardly necessary to-day to advance a plea for the teaching of drawing, design, and craft-work. Their importance is, or should be, recognised by all authorities on education. It is well, however, that the teacher should have a clear comprehension of the part played by these subjects in the development of the intellect and character of the scholar. This is essential, firstly, that he may have confidence in his teaching, with a corresponding strength of purpose and enthusiasm; and, secondly, that he may be in a position to defend effectively his belief in the work he is doing. Despite the fact that the majority of educational authorities recognise its value, critics still abound who would have us believe that such work merely panders to effeminate tastes and a love of luxury, whilst denying its practical utility. Such critics need to be confuted, and this can only be done by formulating definite reasons for the serious study of the subjects in hand. At the outset we must recognise that man is complex and many-sided, hence his needs are complex and multifarious. An unfortunate tendency exists in some quarters to regard human beings merely as productive machines with a capacity for executing so much work upon which the profit (usually accruing to those holding this view) will be so much, and that education should, therefore, be designed on this basis. Such an opinion is unworthy of consideration, and may be dismissed at once. It must be granted that, as far as possible, all human capacities are worth developing, otherwise the curriculum will have a bias, tending to develop certain faculties, leaving others to become atrophied. It is in some such comprehensive scheme that art work, as here dealt with, plays its part. It develops certain powers for which no scope is permitted in other subjects. The faculty of observation is quickened by training the vision, whilst the memory is cultivated to retain the images thus correctly seen. Drawing is a method of expression older by far, and more natural than writing, for the alphabet in use to-day is a development of early picture writing. Again, the child as soon as he can walk endeavours to express graphically the beings and objects amongst which he lives, making no attempt to write.",Juvenile Nonfiction,360,N/A,0,en

This book invites readers to navigate a purposeful path from adulthood to elderhood with choice, curiosity, and courage. Everyone is getting old; not everyone is growing old. But the path of purposeful aging is accessible to all—and it's fundamental to health, happiness, and longevity. With a focus on growing whole through developing a sense of purpose in later life, Who Do You Want to Be When You Grow Old? celebrates the experience of aging with inspiring stories, real-world practices, and provocative questions. Framed by a long conversation between two old friends, the book reconceives aging as a liberating experience that enables us to become more authentically the person we always meant to be with each passing year. In their bestseller Repacking Your Bags, Richard J. Leider and David A.

Improvement by Design,"David K. Cohen, Donald J. Peurach, Joshua L. Glazer, Karen E. Gates, Simona Goldin",University of Chicago Press,2013-12-06,"One of the great challenges now facing education reformers in the United States is how to devise a consistent and intelligent framework for instruction that will work across the nation’s notoriously fragmented and politically conflicted school systems. Various programs have tried to do that, but only a few have succeeded. Improvement by Design looks at three different programs, seeking to understand why two of them—America’s Choice and Success for All—worked, and why the third—Accelerated Schools Project—did not. The authors identify four critical puzzles that the successful programs were able to solve: design, implementation, improvement, and sustainability. Pinpointing the specific solutions that clearly improved instruction, they identify the key elements that all successful reform programs share. Offering urgently needed guidance for state and local school systems as they attempt to respond to future reform proposals, Improvement by Design gets America one step closer to truly successful education systems.",Education,236,N/A,0,en

School Social Work,"Michael S. Kelly, James C. Raines, Susan Stone, Andy Frey",Oxford University Press,2010-02-08,"School Social Work: An Evidence-Informed Framework for Practice offers school social work students and veteran practitioners a new framework for choosing their interventions based on the best available evidence. It is the first work that synthesizes the evidence-based practice (EBP) process with recent conceptual frameworks of school social work clinical practice offered by leading scholars and policymakers. Many other books on EBP try to fit empirically validated treatments into practice contexts without considering the multiple barriers to implementing evidence-based practices in places as complicated and multi-faceted as schools. Additionally, there are vital questions in the literature about what the best levels for intervention are in school social work. Responding to the complexity of applying EBP in schools, this volume offers a conceptual framework that addresses the real-world concerns of practitioners as they work to provide the best services to their school clients. For each domain of school social work practice, the authors critically review interventions, presenting the current research with guidelines for addressing such implementation issues as cost, school culture, adaptations for special populations, and negotiating multiple arenas of practice. In addition, the chapters are grounded in the process of evidence-based practice, illustrating how school practitioners can pose useful questions, search for relevant evidence, appraise the evidence, apply it in keeping with client values, and monitor the results. Written by four school social work scholars with over four decades of theoretical, research, and practice experience, this volume will be relevant to both research faculty studying school social work interventions and students learning about school social work practice.",Social Science,289,N/A,0,en

A Calculus for Factorial Arrangements,"Sudhir Gupta, Rahul Mukerjee",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-09-10,"Factorial designs were introduced and popularized by Fisher (1935). Among the early authors, Yates (1937) considered both symmetric and asymmetric factorial designs. Bose and Kishen (1940) and Bose (1947) developed a mathematical theory for symmetric priIi't&-powered factorials while Nair and Roo (1941, 1942, 1948) introduced and explored balanced confounded designs for the asymmetric case. Since then, over the last four decades, there has been a rapid growth of research in factorial designs and a considerable interest is still continuing. Kurkjian and Zelen (1962, 1963) introduced a tensor calculus for factorial arrangements which, as pointed out by Federer (1980), represents a powerful statistical analytic tool in the context of factorial designs. Kurkjian and Zelen (1963) gave the analysis of block designs using the calculus and Zelen and Federer (1964) applied it to the analysis of designs with two-way elimination of heterogeneity. Zelen and Federer (1965) used the calculus for the analysis of designs having several classifications with unequal replications, no empty cells and with all the interactions present. Federer and Zelen (1966) considered applications of the calculus for factorial experiments when the treatments are not all equally replicated, and Paik and Federer (1974) provided extensions to when some of the treatment combinations are not included in the experiment. The calculus, which involves the use of Kronecker products of matrices, is extremely helpful in deriving characterizations, in a compact form, for various important features like balance and orthogonality in a general multifactor setting.",Mathematics,133,N/A,0,en

BiCMOS Technology and Applications,Antonio R. Alvarez,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-03-09,"The topic of bipolar compatible CMOS (BiCMOS) is a fascinating one and of ever-growing practical importance. The ""technology pendulum"" has swung from the two extremes of preeminence of bipolar in the 1950s and 60s to the apparent endless horizons for VLSI NMOS technology during the 1970s and 80s. Yet starting in the 1980s severallimits were clouding the horizon for pure NMOS technology. CMOS reemerged as a· viable high density, high performance technology. Similarly by the mid 1980s scaled bipolar devices had not only demonstrated new high speed records, but early versions of mixed bipolar/CMOS technology were being produced. Hence the paradigm of either high density . Q[ high speed was metamorphasizing into an opportunity for both speed and density via a BiCMOS approach. Now as we approach the 1990s there have been a number of practical demonstrations of BiCMOS both for memory and logic applications and I expect the trend to escalate over the next decade. This book makes a timely contribution to the field of BiCMOS technology and circuit development. The evolution is now indeed rapid so that it is difficult to make such a book exhaustive of current developments. Probably equally difficult is the fact that the new technology opens a range of novel circuit opportunities that are as yet only formative in their development.

DNA Computing,"Max H. Garzon, Hao Yan",Springer,2008-02-09,"Biomolecular/DNA computing is now well established as an interdisciplinary field where chemistry, computer science, molecular biology, physics, and mathematics come together with the common purpose of fundamental scientific understanding of biology and chemistry and its applications. This international meeting has been the premier forum where scientists with different backgrounds and a common focus meet to present their latest results and entertain visions of the future. In this tradition, about 100 participants converged in Memphis, Tennessee to hold the 13th International Meeting on DNA Computing during June 4–8, 2007, under the auspices of the International Society for Nanoscale Science, Computation and Engineering (ISNSCE) and The University of Memphis. The call for papers encouraged submissions of original, recent, and promising experimental and theoretical results in the field. The Call for Papers elicited some 62 submissions, almost perfectly balanced among the major theoretical and experimental categories. It is evidence of how well the interdisciplinary nature of the conference has truly matured that the major criterion of quality, agreed upon in advance by the Program Committee (PC), produced a nearly balanced program as well across the two major categories, full papers and talks with an abstract only. The program with the greatest perceived impact consisted of 24 papers for plenary oral talks; in addition, 15 full-paper posters and 10 poster abstracts were accepted, of which 5 authors were invited to give five short demos in a new submission category this year. The conference program retained the structure now customary for this meeting.",Computers,302,N/A,0,en

Design for Strengths,John K. Coyle,N/A,2018-03-26,"This book is for anyone who has worked very hard at something--in business, life, sport, music, hobbies--and stopped seeing progress. In these pages, John K. Coyle explores the intersection of two popular frameworks¿Design Thinking and Strengths-finding¿and shows how they can be combined to achieve breakthrough performance. Coyle demonstrates how to leverage the mindset and process of Design Thinking to define the ¿right¿ problem, and to ask and answer a ¿better question.¿ Instead of ¿how do I fix my weaknesses,¿ he re-defines the central challenge of ¿how can I design for my strengths?¿ To illuminate these concepts, Coyle weaves a fascinating thread from ¿Imaginariums"" as a student under Stanford's David Kelley, to world-class racing as a cyclist and speedskater, to applying Design Thinking to emerging business problems. With contributions from more than a dozen leading experts, including Steven Kotler, David Kelley, David Eagleman, Daniel Coyle and Chip Conley, as well as Olympic gold medalists, Apolo Ohno and Meryl Davis, this book will engage, entertain and inform.At its core, this book is about sharing the tools and mindsets required to find and reveal hidden potential, and imparting the belief that each and every one of us contains the capacity to do something extraordinary - if we design for it.",Sports & Recreation,272,N/A,0,en

MODA 5 - Advances in Model-Oriented Data Analysis and Experimental Design,"Anthony C. Atkinson, Luc Pronzato, Henry P. Wynn",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This volume contains the majority of the papers presented at the 5th Inter national Workshop on Model-Oriented Data Analysis held in June 1998. This series started in March 1987 with a meeting on the Wartburg, Eisenach (Germany). The next three meetings were in 1990 (St Kyrik monastery, Bulgaria), 1992 (Petrodvorets, StPetersburg, Russia) and 1995 (Spetses, Greece). The main purpose of these workshops was to bring together lead ing scientists from 'Eastern' and 'Western' Europe for the exchange of ideas in theoretical and applied statistics, with special emphasis on experimen tal design. Now that the separation between East and West has become less rigid, this dialogue has, in principle, become much easier. However, providing opportunities for this dialogue is as vital as ever. MODA meetings are known for their friendly atmosphere, leading to fruitful discussions and collaboration, especially between young and senior scien tists. Indeed, many long term collaborations were initiated during these events. This intellectually stimulating atmosphere is achieved by limiting the number of participants to around eighty, by the choice of location so that participants can live as a community, and, of course, through the care ful selection of scientific direction made by the Programme Committee.",Mathematics,297,N/A,0,en

Domain Modeling Made Functional,Scott Wlaschin,Pragmatic Bookshelf,2018-01-25,"You want increased customer satisfaction, faster development cycles, and less wasted work. Domain-driven design (DDD) combined with functional programming is the innovative combo that will get you there. In this pragmatic, down-to-earth guide, you'll see how applying the core principles of functional programming can result in software designs that model real-world requirements both elegantly and concisely - often more so than an object-oriented approach. Practical examples in the open-source F# functional language, and examples from familiar business domains, show you how to apply these techniques to build software that is business-focused, flexible, and high quality. Domain-driven design is a well-established approach to designing software that ensures that domain experts and developers work together effectively to create high-quality software. This book is the first to combine DDD with techniques from statically typed functional programming. This book is perfect for newcomers to DDD or functional programming - all the techniques you need will be introduced and explained. Model a complex domain accurately using the F# type system, creating compilable code that is also readable documentation---ensuring that the code and design never get out of sync. Encode business rules in the design so that you have ""compile-time unit tests,"" and eliminate many potential bugs by making illegal states unrepresentable. Assemble a series of small, testable functions into a complete use case, and compose these individual scenarios into a large-scale design. Discover why the combination of functional programming and DDD leads naturally to service-oriented and hexagonal architectures. Finally, create a functional domain model that works with traditional databases, NoSQL, and event stores, and safely expose your domain via a website or API. Solve real problems by focusing on real-world requirements for your software. What You Need: The code in this book is designed to be run interactively on Windows, Mac and Linux.You will need a recent version of F# (4.0 or greater), and the appropriate .NET runtime for your platform.Full installation instructions for all platforms at fsharp.org.",Computers,426,N/A,0,en

"The Allied Defense of the Malay Barrier, 1941-1942",Tom Womack,McFarland,2015-12-15,"Though few realize it, the Netherlands East Indies were the object of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Likewise, their invasions of Guam, Wake Island and the Philippines were mainly diversionary operations to safeguard their main assault on Dutch and British colonies. Since the end of World War I, Japan had coveted the vast East Indies oil reserves, and the colony had feared invasion since Germany overran Holland in May 1940. Isolated politically the weakly defended archipelago was a tempting prize. The East Indies government initially maintained a strict policy of neutrality while desperately working to build up its military strength. As Japanese actions pushed the region toward war, the Dutch reluctantly embraced closer ties with America and Britain. For a brief period, the East Indies were key players in Pacific War strategy. This book details for the first time in English the Dutch prewar strategy, their efforts to counter Japanese espionage and their sizable though largely forgotten military contribution in the early months of the Pacific War.",History,367,N/A,0,en

Experiencing Design,"Jeanne Liedtka, Karen Hold, Jessica Eldridge",Columbia University Press,2021-07-20,"In daylong hackathons, design thinking seems deceptively easy. On the surface, it involves a set of seemingly simple activities such as gathering data, identifying insights, generating ideas, prototyping, and experimentation. But practiced at a superficial level, even great design tools don’t go deep enough to create the shifts in mindset and skillset that are required to achieve transformational impact. Going deep with design requires more than changing the activities of innovators; it involves creating the conditions that shape who they become. Individuals become design thinkers by experiencing design. Drawing on decades of researching design thinking and teaching it to people not trained in design, Jeanne Liedtka, Karen Hold, and Jessica Eldridge offer a guide for how to create these deep experiences at each stage of the design thinking journey, whether for an individual, a team, or an organization. For each experience phase, they specify the mindset shifts and competencies that need to be achieved, describe how different personality types experience different kinds of journeys, and show how to fully leverage the diversity of teams. Experiencing Design explores both the science and practicalities of design and includes two assessment instruments for individual and organizational development. Ultimately, innovators need to be someone new to create something new. This book shows you how to use design thinking to make this happen.",Business & Economics,327,N/A,0,en
Macromolecular Crystallography,"Mark R. Sanderson, Jane V. Skelly",OUP Oxford,2007-08-23,"Macromolecular Crystallography is the study of macromolecules (proteins and nucleic acids) using X-ray crystallographic techniques in order to determine their molecular structure. The knowledge of accurate molecular structures is a pre-requisite for rational drug design, and for structure-based function studies to aid the development of effective therapeutic agents and drugs. The successful determination of the complete genome (genetic sequence) of several species (including humans) has recently directed scientific attention towards identifying the structure and function of the complete complement of proteins that make up that species; a new and rapidly growing field of study called 'structural genomics'. There are now several important and well-funded global initiatives in operation to identify all of the proteins of key model species. One of the main requirements for these initiatives is a high-throughput crystallization facility to speed-up the protein identification process. The extent to which these technologies have advanced, calls for an updated review of current crystallographic theory and practice. This practical reference book features the latest conventional and high-throughput methods, and includes contributions from a team of internationally recognized leaders and experts. It will be of relevance and use to graduate students, research scientists and professionals currently working in the field of conventional and high-throughput macromolecular crystallography.",Science,293,N/A,0,en

Rules of Play,"Katie Salen Tekinbas, Eric Zimmerman",MIT Press,2003-09-25,"An impassioned look at games and game design that offers the most ambitious framework for understanding them to date. As pop culture, games are as important as film or television—but game design has yet to develop a theoretical framework or critical vocabulary. In Rules of Play Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman present a much-needed primer for this emerging field. They offer a unified model for looking at all kinds of games, from board games and sports to computer and video games. As active participants in game culture, the authors have written Rules of Play as a catalyst for innovation, filled with new concepts, strategies, and methodologies for creating and understanding games. Building an aesthetics of interactive systems, Salen and Zimmerman define core concepts like ""play,"" ""design,"" and ""interactivity."" They look at games through a series of eighteen ""game design schemas,"" or conceptual frameworks, including games as systems of emergence and information, as contexts for social play, as a storytelling medium, and as sites of cultural resistance. Written for game scholars, game developers, and interactive designers, Rules of Play is a textbook, reference book, and theoretical guide. It is the first comprehensive attempt to establish a solid theoretical framework for the emerging discipline of game design.",Computers,680,4,10,en

Integrated Design for Space Transportation System,"B.N. Suresh, K. Sivan",Springer,2015-11-20,"The book addresses the overall integrated design aspects of a space transportation system involving several disciplines like propulsion, vehicle structures, aerodynamics, flight mechanics, navigation, guidance and control systems, stage auxiliary systems, thermal systems etc. and discusses the system approach for design, trade off analysis, system life cycle considerations, important aspects in mission management, the risk assessment, etc. There are several books authored to describe the design aspects of various areas, viz., propulsion, aerodynamics, structures, control, etc., but there is no book which presents space transportation system (STS) design in an integrated manner. This book attempts to fill this gap by addressing systems approach for STS design, highlighting the integrated design aspects, interactions between various subsystems and interdependencies. The main focus is towards the complex integrated design to arrive at an optimum, robust and cost effective space transportation system. The orbital mechanics of satellites including different coordinate frames, orbital perturbations and orbital transfers are explained. For launching the satellites to meet specific mission requirements, viz., payload/orbit, design considerations, giving step by step procedure are briefed. The selection methodology for launch vehicle configuration, its optimum staging and the factors which influence the vehicle performance are summarized. The influence of external, internal and dynamic operating environments experienced by the vehicle subsystems and the remedial measures needed are highlighted. The mission design strategies and their influence on the vehicle design process are elaborated. The various critical aspects of STS subsystems like flight mechanics, propulsion, structures and materials, thermal systems, stage auxiliary systems, navigation, guidance and control and the interdependencies and interactions between them are covered. The design guidelines, complexity of the flight environment and the reentry dynamics for the reentry missions are included. The book is not targeted as a design tool for any particular discipline or subsystem. Some of the design related equations or expressions are not attempted to derive from the first principle as this is beyond the scope of this book. However, the important analytical expressions, graphs and sketches which are essential to provide in-depth understanding for the design process as well as to understand the interactions between different subsystems are appropriately included.",Technology & Engineering,792,5,1,en

"Library Book, The: Design Collaborations in the Public Schools",Anooradha Iyer Siddiqi,Princeton Architectural Press,2010-04-07,"It's often said a child's lifelong love of reading begins at home. But declining literacy rates among the nation's public elementary school students suggests this maxim needs revision. For reading to become an everyday habit, it needs to be nurtured in a home of its own. Fortunately, there is space available inside most elementary schools. At just 5 percent of a school's total real estate, the school library is the most powerful and efficient way to reach 100 percent of the student body. But far too many of the nation's public school libraries lack even the most basic resources to support learning and encourage achievement. The nonprofit L!brary Initiative, created by the Robin Hood Foundation, has been working since 2001 to enhance student literacy and overall academic achievement by collaborating with school districts to design, build, equip, and staff new elementary school libraries. The L!brary Book takes readers behind the scenes of fifty groundbreaking library projects to show how widely varied fields and communities—corporate underwriters, children's book publishers, architects, graphic designers, product manufacturers, library associations, teachers, and students—can join forces to make a difference in the lives of children. Based on the premise that good library design can actually inspire learning, the L!brary Initiative brings together some of the world's leading architects to reimagine the elementary school libraries in New York City—the nation's largest public school system. Working on a pro bono basis, architecture firms—including 1100 Architects, Weiss/Manfredi Architects, Della Valle Bernheimer, Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects, and Dean/Wolf Architects—have in just eight years built or transformed more than fifty libraries into vital resources for the whole school community. These libraries—both beautiful learning spaces and innovative architecture—feature a wide range of design solutions, including creative uses of space, color, lighting, and furniture. Author and former L!brary Initiative director Anooradha Iyer Siddiqi documents every project with beautiful photos as well as renderings and measured drawings. The L!brary Book concludes with the chapter How to Make a Library which shows how community organizers and architects can pursue similar initiatives in their own communities.",Architecture,180,5,1,en

Learning by Effective Utilization of Technologies: Facilitating Intercultural Understanding,"R. Mizoguchi, P. Dillenbourg, Z. Zhu",IOS Press,2006-11-15,"A major theme of this book is the use of computers for supporting collaborative learning. This is not surprising since computer-supported collaborative learning has become both a widespread educational practice and a main domain of research. Moreover, collaborative learning has deep roots in Asian educational traditions. Given the large number of researchers within this field, its scope has become very broad. Under this umbrella, one finds a variety of more specific topics such as: interaction analysis, collaboration scripts (e.g. the Jigsaw script), communities of practice, sociocognitive conflict resolution, cognitive apprenticeship, various tools for argumentation, online discussion or collaborative drawing tools (whiteboards), collaborative writing and the role of facilitators. Most research work on collaborative learning focuses on interactions rather than on the contents of environments, which had been the focus in the previous decades of learning technology research. However, there is no reason to focus on one aspect to the detriment of the other. The editors are pleased that the selected papers also cover multiple issues related to the storage, representation and retrieval of knowledge: ontologies for learning environments and the semantic web, knowledge bases and data mining, meta-data and content management systems, and so forth. This publication also reveals a growing interest for non-verbal educational material, namely pictures and video materials, which are already central to new popular web-based applications. This book includes contributions that bridge both research tracks, the one focusing on interactions and the other on contents: the pedagogical use of digital portfolios, both for promoting individual reflections and for scaffolding group interactions.",Computers,688,N/A,0,en

An Introduction to Discrete-Valued Time Series,Christian H. Weiss,John Wiley & Sons,2017-12-06,"A much-needed introduction to the field of discrete-valued time series, with a focus on count-data time series Time series analysis is an essential tool in a wide array of fields, including business, economics, computer science, epidemiology, finance, manufacturing and meteorology, to name just a few. Despite growing interest in discrete-valued time series—especially those arising from counting specific objects or events at specified times—most books on time series give short shrift to that increasingly important subject area. This book seeks to rectify that state of affairs by providing a much needed introduction to discrete-valued time series, with particular focus on count-data time series. The main focus of this book is on modeling. Throughout numerous examples are provided illustrating models currently used in discrete-valued time series applications. Statistical process control, including various control charts (such as cumulative sum control charts), and performance evaluation are treated at length. Classic approaches like ARMA models and the Box-Jenkins program are also featured with the basics of these approaches summarized in an Appendix. In addition, data examples, with all relevant R code, are available on a companion website. Provides a balanced presentation of theory and practice, exploring both categorical and integer-valued series Covers common models for time series of counts as well as for categorical time series, and works out their most important stochastic properties Addresses statistical approaches for analyzing discrete-valued time series and illustrates their implementation with numerous data examples Covers classical approaches such as ARMA models, Box-Jenkins program and how to generate functions Includes dataset examples with all necessary R code provided on a companion website An Introduction to Discrete-Valued Time Series is a valuable working resource for researchers and practitioners in a broad range of fields, including statistics, data science, machine learning, and engineering.

Temporary Structure Design,Christopher Souder,John Wiley & Sons,2014-11-10,"A comprehensive guide to temporary structures in construction projects Temporary Structure Design is the first book of its kind, presenting students and professionals with authoritative coverage of the major concepts in designing temporary construction structures. Beginning with a review of statistics, it presents the core topics needed to fully comprehend the design of temporary structures: strength of materials; types of loads on temporary structures; scaffolding design; soil properties and soil loading; soldier beam, lagging, and tiebacks; sheet piling and strutting; pressure and forces on formwork and falsework; concrete formwork design; falsework; bracing and guying; trestles and equipment bridges; and the support of existing structures. Temporary structures during construction include scaffolding, formwork, shoring, ramps, platforms, earth-retaining structures, and other construction structures that are not part of the permanent installation. These structures are less regulated and monitored than most other parts of the construction process, even though they are often supporting tons of steel or concrete—and the safety of all workers on the site depends on these structures to perform as designed. Unfortunately, most tragic failures occur during construction and are usually the result of improperly designed, constructed, and/or maintained temporary structures. Temporary Structure Design fills an important need in the literature by providing a trusted, comprehensive guide to designing temporary construction structures. Serves as the first book to provide a design-oriented approach to the design of temporary structures Includes coverage of the various safety considerations inherent in temporary structure design and construction Provides information on estimating cost and schedules for these specialized structures Covers formwork and falsework, as well as personnel protection, production support, environmental protection, and foundational structures If you're a student or a professional working in the field of construction or structural engineering, Temporary Structure Design is a must-have resource you'll turn to again and again.",Technology & Engineering,450,N/A,0,en

Dynamic Surface Control of Uncertain Nonlinear Systems,"Bongsob Song, J. Karl Hedrick",Springer Science & Business Media,2011-05-16,"Although the problem of nonlinear controller design is as old as that of linear controller design, the systematic design methods framed in response are more sparse. Given the range and complexity of nonlinear systems, effective new methods of control design are therefore of significant importance. Dynamic Surface Control of Uncertain Nonlinear Systems provides a theoretically rigorous and practical introduction to nonlinear control design. The convex optimization approach applied to good effect in linear systems is extended to the nonlinear case using the new dynamic surface control (DSC) algorithm developed by the authors. A variety of problems – DSC design, output feedback, input saturation and fault-tolerant control among them – are considered. The inclusion of applications material demonstrates the real significance of the DSC algorithm, which is robust and easy to use, for nonlinear systems with uncertainty in automotive and robotics. Written for the researcher and graduate student of nonlinear control theory, this book will provide the applied mathematician and engineer alike with a set of powerful tools for nonlinear control design. It will also be of interest to practitioners working with a mechatronic systems in aerospace, manufacturing and automotive and robotics, milieux.",Technology & Engineering,257,N/A,0,en

Sequential Analysis,"Alexander Tartakovsky, Igor Nikiforov, Michele Basseville",CRC Press,2014-08-27,"Sequential Analysis: Hypothesis Testing and Changepoint Detection systematically develops the theory of sequential hypothesis testing and quickest changepoint detection. It also describes important applications in which theoretical results can be used efficiently. The book reviews recent accomplishments in hypothesis testing and changepoint detection both in decision-theoretic (Bayesian) and non-decision-theoretic (non-Bayesian) contexts. The authors not only emphasize traditional binary hypotheses but also substantially more difficult multiple decision problems. They address scenarios with simple hypotheses and more realistic cases of two and finitely many composite hypotheses. The book primarily focuses on practical discrete-time models, with certain continuous-time models also examined when general results can be obtained very similarly in both cases. It treats both conventional i.i.d. and general non-i.i.d. stochastic models in detail, including Markov, hidden Markov, state-space, regression, and autoregression models. Rigorous proofs are given for the most important results. Written by leading authorities in the field, this book covers the theoretical developments and applications of sequential hypothesis testing and sequential quickest changepoint detection in a wide range of engineering and environmental domains. It explains how the theoretical aspects influence the hypothesis testing and changepoint detection problems as well as the design of algorithms.",Mathematics,605,N/A,0,en

Informatics and Medicine,"P. L. Reichertz, G. Goos",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The modern development of medicine has been characterized by the grow ing use of new technologies in health care delivery and research. As an empirical science, medicine is based on many types and quantities of information to recognize alterations, explore causes and apply cor rective action. Dealing with biological objects, signals have to be collected, processed and interpreted to recognize the state of this object. It is therefore understandable that data processing technology and informatics have been employed to a growing extent in medicine. The increasing economic repercussions of modern medicine lead also to the demand of ways and means to assess the system as such and to develop means for evaluation and regulation. However, the application of data processing to the medical field has very often grown in parallel to and remote from the development of in formatics and data processing in general. Furthermore, difficulties have occurred resulting from the differing concepts of reasoning, deci sion making and methodology. We therefore decided to start a series of seminars with the attempt to bring scientists from both medicine and informatics together to discuss basic principles of informatics and medicine and to attempt a synthesis between the problems in medicine and health care delivery and methods in informatics to approach a solu tion of these problems. This volume contains the lecture notes of the first seminar of this type.",Medical,719,N/A,0,en

Event-Based Control and Signal Processing,Marek Miskowicz,CRC Press,2018-09-03,"Event-based systems are a class of reactive systems deployed in a wide spectrum of engineering disciplines including control, communication, signal processing, and electronic instrumentation. Activities in event-based systems are triggered in response to events usually representing a significant change of the state of controlled or monitored physical variables. Event-based systems adopt a model of calls for resources only if it is necessary, and therefore, they are characterized by efficient utilization of communication bandwidth, computation capability, and energy budget. Currently, the economical use of constrained technical resources is a critical issue in various application domains because many systems become increasingly networked, wireless, and spatially distributed. Event-Based Control and Signal Processing examines the event-based paradigm in control, communication, and signal processing, with a focus on implementation in networked sensor and control systems. Featuring 23 chapters contributed by more than 60 leading researchers from around the world, this book covers: Methods of analysis and design of event-based control and signal processing Event-driven control and optimization of hybrid systems Decentralized event-triggered control Periodic event-triggered control Model-based event-triggered control and event-triggered generalized predictive control Event-based intermittent control in man and machine Event-based PID controllers Event-based state estimation Self-triggered and team-triggered control Event-triggered and time-triggered real-time architectures for embedded systems Event-based continuous-time signal acquisition and DSP Statistical event-based signal processing in distributed detection and estimation Asynchronous spike event coding technique with address event representation Event-based processing of non-stationary signals Event-based digital (FIR and IIR) filters Event-based local bandwidth estimation and signal reconstruction Event-Based Control and Signal Processing is the first extensive study on both event-based control and event-based signal processing, presenting scientific contributions at the cutting edge of modern science and engineering.",Technology & Engineering,573,N/A,0,en

Introduction to Loudspeaker Design,John L Murphy,N/A,2014-03-04,"Introduction to Loudspeaker Design is written for students, technicians, engineers and hobbyists seeking an overview of the technology of loudspeakers. Starting with a brief history of audio developments the book begins by introducing the concepts of frequency, pitch and loudness and proceeds to develop the idea of a loudspeaker as a system. The book covers such topics as loudspeaker design tradeoffs, spatial loading, diffraction loss, cavity effect and enclosure construction. A complete chapter is devoted to the subject of crossover design including design equations. The second edition adds a new chapter on simulation and analysis which includes design equations for closed and vented type speakers. The appendices contain technical references, design aids, glossaries and a chart depicting 18 different loudspeaker enclosure types. The author is a physicist/audio design engineer with over 35 years experience in the research and development of audio products spanning both hardware and software. His WinSpeakerz, TrueRTA and DATS software applications are widely used throughout the audio industry as tools for simulating and measuring loudspeaker performance. Captain Murphy served as a space systems analyst for NORAD during his military career. Changes for the Second Edition: The second edition brings new material and polishes the first edition with many new or improved illustrations. Chapter 2 was expanded with the second half split into a new Chapter 3 titled ""Speaker Response Functions."" The discussion of Thiele-Small parameters has been expanded and now covers small-signal parameters vs. large-signal parameters as it explores the role of the test signal level in parameter measurement. The crossover design chapter has been expanded to include formulas for calculating component values for the most popular crossover types. Equations have been added for calculating impedance compensation and attenuation networks. The old Chapter 7 FAQ material was integrated into other chapters as appropriate. A new Chapter 8 titled ""Loudspeaker Simulation"" has been added and introduces loudspeaker equivalent circuit analysis with equations for calculating the magnitude and phase responses of closed and vented loudspeaker systems. Additional design equations are introduced and then examples are given for calculating the responses of a closed box and a vented box loudspeaker. Detailed design equation summaries are given for closed and vented boxes. Appendix C was added to provide a glossary of symbols and a glossary of terms.

DFT Modulated Filter Bank Transceivers for Interweave and Underlay Cognitive Radio,Nour Mansour,kassel university press GmbH,2018-03-19,"DFT modulated filter banks for non-orthogonal multicarrier transmission are considered a strong tool to implement both dynamic spectrum access and spectrum sensing in cognitive radio systems where signaling schemes have to meet different objectives. A constrained optimization approach is presented to design a cognitive radio transceiver which can be tailored to system specifications with a reasonable trade-off between performance and implementation efficiency. In interweave cognitive radio, the secondary user receiver is synchronized in time and frequency by designing a synthesis filter bank preamble with periodic symbols in analogy to short training fields in IEEE 802.11a. A simple post-detection integration at the secondary user receiver is employed for differently coherent detection. In underlay cognitive radio, a novel transmission scheme for secondary user power adaptation is proposed aiming to minimize the secondary user average probability of error for bit-interleaved coded modulation. The powers of the subcarrier signals are adapted subject to total power and stochastic chance-based interference constraints in order to provide a confidence level for limiting the interference at the licensed primary user receiver.",,201,N/A,0,en

Interest Group Design,Marcie L. Reynolds,Routledge,2019-06-07,"In Interest Group Design, Marcie L. Reynolds examines the evolution of Common Cause, the first national government reform lobby. Founded in 1970 by John W. Gardner, the organization gained influence with Congress and established an organizational culture that lasted several decades. External and internal environmental changes led to mounting crises and by 2000 Common Cause's survival was in question. Yet fifteen years later Common Cause is a renewed organization, with evidence of revival across the United States. Empirical evidence suggests how Common Cause changed its interest group design but kept its identity in order to survive. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach to frame and analyze the history of Common Cause, Reynolds provides a lens for studying how key aspects of the U.S. political system—interest groups, collective action, lobbying, and representation—work as environments change. She extends work by previous scholars Andrew S. McFarland (1984) and Lawrence Rothenberg (1992) creating a sequence of analytical research about one interest group spanning almost fifty years, a unique contribution to political science. This thoroughly researched and comprehensive book will be of great interest to those who study political participation and organizational change.",Political Science,229,N/A,0,en

Elements of Yacht Design,Norman L. Skene,Rowman & Littlefield,2023-09-08,"""This book is intended to be a practical and concise presentation of some of the operations involved in designing yachts of all types. Cumbersome and impractical methods which are so often found in more pretentious works on naval architecture have been avoided. Those presented have been in everyday use by the author."" Thus wrote Norman L. Skene in the preface to the fifth edition of Elements of Yacht Design. Skene's is one of the most famous books on yacht design ever written. First published in 1904, Skene did several revisions, the last of which was published in 1938 and is reprinted here in its original form. In 1962, the book was completely revised by Francis S. Kinney and republished as Skene's Elements of Yacht Design. Kinney's last version was published in 1973 and it is long out of print. While the experts are divided on the relative merits of the different editions, it appears that there is strong demand for Skene's original work. At last the book is again available to the many boatbuilders, aspiring naval architects, and sailors who need it for frequent reference.

Broad Band,Claire L. Evans,Penguin,2018-03-06,"If you loved Hidden Figures or The Rise of the Rocket Girls, you'll love Claire Evans' breakthrough book on the women who brought you the internet--written out of history, until now. ""This is a radically important, timely work,"" says Miranda July, filmmaker and author of The First Bad Man. The history of technology you probably know is one of men and machines, garages and riches, alpha nerds and brogrammers--but from Ada Lovelace, who wrote the first computer program in the Victorian Age, to the cyberpunk Web designers of the 1990s, female visionaries have always been at the vanguard of technology and innovation. In fact, women turn up at the very beginning of every important wave in technology. They may have been hidden in plain sight, their inventions and contributions touching our lives in ways we don't even realize, but they have always been part of the story. VICE reporter and YACHT lead singer Claire L. Evans finally gives these unsung female heroes their due with her insightful social history of the Broad Band, the women who made the internet what it is today. Seek inspiration from Grace Hopper, the tenacious mathematician who democratized computing by leading the charge for machine-independent programming languages after World War II. Meet Elizabeth ""Jake"" Feinler, the one-woman Google who kept the earliest version of the Internet online, and Stacy Horn, who ran one of the first-ever social networks on a shoestring out of her New York City apartment in the 1980s. Join the ranks of the pioneers who defied social convention to become database poets, information-wranglers, hypertext dreamers, and glass ceiling-shattering dot com-era entrepreneurs. This inspiring call to action shines a light on the bright minds whom history forgot, and shows us how they will continue to shape our world in ways we can no longer ignore. Welcome to the Broad Band. You're next.",Biography & Autobiography,290,N/A,0,en

Ten Principles for Good Design,"Cees de Jong, Klaus Klemp, Erik Mattie",Prestel Publishing,2017,"Exquisitely produced to reflect Dieter Rams' aesthetic philosophy, this book presents highlights from a forty-year career designing iconic consumer products that enhance our daily lives. For decades, anyone who cared about product design looked to the Braun label when choosing their appliances, radios, and other consumer items. Now Dieter Rams, the guiding force behind the Braun look, breaks down his design principles and processes in this elegant book. Enumerating each of his ten principles such as good design is innovative; good design is aesthetic; good design is useful, etc., this book presents one hundred items that embody these guidelines. Readers will find items that are familiar such as the ubiquitous coffee grinder but also those that are more unusual such as shelving systems and cigarette lighters. A fascinating essay places Dieter Rams in the context of modern design, from Bauhaus to Philip Johnson. Archival materials include photos of Rams' design team and excerpts from his publications and speeches. The book closes with a chronological overview of design icons, categorized by function, that show the enormous breadth of Rams' vision. Taken together, these images and texts offer the most comprehensive overview of Dieter Rams' work to date and will serve as both a reference and an inspiration for anyone interested in how and why good design matters.",Design,0,N/A,0,en

Communicating Design,Dan M. Brown,New Riders,2010-09-15,"Successful web design teams depend on clear communication between developers and their clients—and among members of the development team. Wireframes, site maps, flow charts, and other design diagrams establish a common language so designers and project teams can capture ideas, track progress, and keep their stakeholders informed. In this all new edition of Communicating Design, author and information architect Dan Brown defines and describes each deliverable, then offers practical advice for creating the documents and using them in the context of teamwork and presentations, independent of methodology. Whatever processes, tools, or approaches you use, this book will help you improve the creation and presentation of your wireframes, site maps, flow charts, and other deliverables. The book now features: An improved structure comprising two main sections: Design Diagrams and Design Deliverables. The first focuses on the nuts and bolts of design documentation and the second explains how to pull it all together. New deliverable: design briefs, as well as updated advice on wireframes, flow charts, and concept models. More illustrations, to help designers understand the subtle variations and approaches to creating design diagrams. Reader exercises, for those lonely nights when all you really want to do is practice creating wireframes, or for use in workshops and classes. Contributions from industry leaders: Tamara Adlin, Stephen Anderson, Dana Chisnell, Nathan Curtis, Chris Fahey, James Melzer, Steve Mulder, Donna Spencer, and Russ Unger. “As an educator, I have looked to Communicating Design both as a formal textbook and an informal guide for its design systems that ultimately make our ideas possible and the complex clear.” —Liz Danzico, from the Foreword",Computers,1040,N/A,0,en
Swedish Design,Keith M. Murphy,Cornell University Press,2019-06-22,"Swedish designers are noted for producing distinctive and elegant forms; their furniture and household goods have an especially loyal following around the world. Design in Sweden has more than just an aesthetic component, however. Since at least the late nineteenth century, Swedish politicians and social planners have viewed design as a means for advocating and enacting social change and pushing for a more egalitarian social organization. In this book, Keith M. Murphy examines the special relationship between politics and design in Sweden, revealing in particular the cultural meanings this relationship holds for Swedish society. Over the course of fourteen months of research in Stockholm and at other sites, Murphy conducted in-depth interviews with various players involved in the Swedish design industry—designers, design instructors, government officials, artists, and curators—and observed several different design collectives in action. He found that for Swedes design is never socially or politically neutral. Even for common objects like furniture and other household goods, design can be labeled ""responsible,"" ""democratic,"" or ""ethical""— descriptors that all neatly resonate with the traditional moral tones of Swedish social democracy. Murphy also considers the example of Ikea and its power to politicize perceptions of the everyday world. More broadly, his book serves as a model for an anthropological approach to the study of design practice, one that accounts for the various ways in which order is purposefully and meaningfully imposed by designers on the domains of human life, and the consequences those impositions have on the social worlds in which they are embedded.",Social Science,265,N/A,0,en
"Design Unbound: Designing for Emergence in a White Water World, Volume 1","Ann M. Pendleton-Jullian, John Seely Brown",MIT Press,2018-12-04,"Tools for navigating today's hyper-connected, rapidly changing, and radically contingent white water world. Design Unbound presents a new tool set for having agency in the twenty-first century, in what the authors characterize as a white water world—rapidly changing, hyperconnected, and radically contingent. These are the tools of a new kind of practice that is the offspring of complexity science, which gives us a new lens through which to view the world as entangled and emerging, and architecture, which is about designing contexts. In such a practice, design, unbound from its material thingness, is set free to design contexts as complex systems. In a world where causality is systemic, entangled, in flux, and often elusive, we cannot design for absolute outcomes. Instead, we need to design for emergence. Design Unbound not only makes this case through theory but also presents a set of tools to do so. With case studies that range from a new kind of university to organizational, and even societal, transformation, Design Unbound draws from a vast array of domains: architecture, science and technology, philosophy, cinema, music, literature and poetry, even the military. It is presented in five books, bound as two volumes. Different books within the larger system of books will resonate with different reading audiences, from architects to people reconceiving higher education to the public policy or defense and intelligence communities. The authors provide different entry points allowing readers to navigate their own pathways through the system of books.",Design,284,N/A,0,en

The design delights the user, seamlessly integrating the physical object, a service, and its use into something whole. A design-inspired innovation is so simple that it becomes an extension of the user. It creates meaning and a new language.Design-Inspired Innovation takes a unique look at the intersection between design and innovation, and explores the novel ways in which designers are contributing to the development of products and services. The book's scope is international, with emphasis on design activities in Boston, England, Sweden, and Milan. Through a rich variety of cases and cultural prisms, the book extends the traditional design viewpoint and stretches the context of industrial design to question — and answer — what design is really all about.

Williams and cross back over the Plain with The Alpha-Nina There is no such thing as a coincidence in an infinite multiverse. Each action happens, it is inevitable. It was bound to occur, somewhere, sometime. Or, more elegantly put: It is destiny. While Nina Marks may have found her way back home after being kidnapped across the multiverse, her alter-egos are now in danger. The technology needed to travel the multiverse exists in at least 4 known universes, and perhaps more. How can Nina, now stuck in Universe Alpha keep all the infinite universes safe from those looking to exploit this technology? And, if the weight of protecting parallel universes wasn’t enough on her shoulders, she is the primary suspect in the disappearance of Dr. Parker Lovett. Can Nina exonerate herself without exposing the secrets of The Portal? Can she trust her alter-egos to keep watch on their entry point to the multiverse? Can she just get through the first week at her new job without having to worry about the fate of all people living across the infinite universes? Read The Alpha-Nina, the second book in The Feminina Series, and the anxiously awaited sequel to The Infinite-Infinite to find out.",Fiction,272,N/A,0,en
Manufacturing Processes for Design Professionals,Rob Thompson,Thames & Hudson,2007-11-30,"An encyclopaedic guide to production techniques and materials for product and industrial designers, engineers, and architects. Today's product designers are presented with a myriad of choices when creating their work and preparing it for manufacture. They have to be knowledgeable about a vast repertoire of processes, ranging from what used to be known as traditional ""crafts"" to the latest technology, to enable their designs to be manufactured effectively and efficiently. Information on the internet about such processes is often unreliable, and search engines do not usefully organize material for designers. This fundamental new resource explores innovative production techniques and materials that are having an impact on the design industry worldwide. Organized into four easily referenced parts—Forming, Cutting, Joining, and Finishing—over seventy manufacturing processes are explained in depth with full technical descriptions; analyses of the typical applications, design opportunities, and considerations each process offers; and information on cost, speed, and environmental impact. The accompanying step-by-step case studies look at a product or component being manufactured at a leading international supplier. A directory of more than fifty materials includes a detailed technical profile, images of typical applications and finishes, and an overview of each material's design characteristics. With some 1,200 color photographs and technical illustrations, specially commissioned for this book, this is the definitive reference for product designers, 3D designers, engineers, and architects who need a convenient, highly accessible, and practical reference.",Design,266,N/A,0,en

Most established companies have deployed such digital technologies as the cloud, mobile apps, the internet of things, and artificial intelligence. But few established companies are designed for digital. Full of practical advice and real-life examples of digital transformation, this book is an essential guide for retooling organizations for digital success through 5 key building blocks: • Shared Customer Insights • Operational Backbone • Digital Platform • Accountability Framework • External Developer Platform In the digital economy, rapid pace of change in technology capabilities and customer desires means that business strategy must be fluid. As a result, business design has become a critical management responsibility. Effective business design enables a company to quickly pivot in response to new competitive threats and opportunities. Most leaders today, however, rely on organizational structure to implement strategy, unaware that structure inhibits, rather than enables, agility. In companies that are designed for digital, people, processes, data, and technology are synchronized to identify and deliver innovative customer solutions—and redefine strategy. Digital design, not strategy, is what separates winners from losers in the digital economy. Designed for Digital includes case studies from Amazon, BNY Mellon, DBS Bank, LEGO, Philips, Schneider Electric, USAA, and many other global organizations.

Subband Image Coding,John W. Woods,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-06-29,"This book concerns a new method of image data compression which weil may supplant the well-established block-transfonn methods that have been state-of-the art for the last 15 years. Subband image coding or SBC was first perfonned as such in 1985, and as the results became known at first through conference proceedings, and later through journal papers, the research community became excited about both the theoretical and practical aspects of this new approach. This excitement is continuing today, with many major research laboratories and research universities around the world investigating the subband approach to coding of color images, high resolution images, video- including video conferencing and advanced tele vision, and the medical application of picture archiving systems. Much of the fruits of this work is summarized in the eight chapters of this book which were written by leading practitioners in this field. The subband approach to image coding starts by passing the image through a two- or three-dimensional filter bank. The two-dimensional (2-D) case usually is hierarchical' consisting of two stages of four filters each. Thus the original image is split into 16 subband images, with each one decimated or subsampled by 4x4, resulting in a data conservation. The individual channel data is then quantized ·for digital transmission. In an attractive variation an octave-like approach, herein tenned subband pyramid, is taken for the decomposition resulting in a total of just eleven subbands.",Technology & Engineering,365,N/A,0,en

The 'embryonic' director of the ASI brought this opportunity to the attention of the group of people, (some at BruneI and some from outside), who were together responsible for the teaching and management of the course in Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) in BruneI's Department of Manufacturing and Engineering Systems. This course had been conceived in 1986 and was envisaged as a vehicle for teaching manufacturing engineering students the technology of information integration through project work. While the original idea of the course had also included the organisational aspects of CIM, the human factors questions were not considered. This shortcoming was recognised and the trial run of the course in 1988 contained some lectures on 'people' issues. The course team were therefore well prepared and keen to explore the People, Organisation and Technology (POT) aspects of computer integration, as applied to industrial production. A context was proposed which would allow the inclusion of people from many different backgrounds and which would open up time and space for reflection.

Advanced Vibration Analysis,S. Graham Kelly,CRC Press,2006-12-19,"Delineating a comprehensive theory, Advanced Vibration Analysis provides the bedrock for building a general mathematical framework for the analysis of a model of a physical system undergoing vibration. The book illustrates how the physics of a problem is used to develop a more specific framework for the analysis of that problem. The author elucidates a general theory applicable to both discrete and continuous systems and includes proofs of important results, especially proofs that are themselves instructive for a thorough understanding of the result. The book begins with a discussion of the physics of dynamic systems comprised of particles, rigid bodies, and deformable bodies and the physics and mathematics for the analysis of a system with a single-degree-of-freedom. It develops mathematical models using energy methods and presents the mathematical foundation for the framework. The author illustrates the development and analysis of linear operators used in various problems and the formulation of the differential equations governing the response of a conservative linear system in terms of self-adjoint linear operators, the inertia operator, and the stiffness operator. The author focuses on the free response of linear conservative systems and the free response of non-self-adjoint systems. He explores three method for determining the forced response and approximate methods of solution for continuous systems. The use of the mathematical foundation and the application of the physics to build a framework for the modeling and development of the response is emphasized throughout the book. The presence of the framework becomes more important as the complexity of the system increases. The text builds the foundation, formalizes it, and uses it in a consistent fashion including application to contemporary research using linear vibrations.",Technology & Engineering,672,5,2,en

In a highly readable, original presentation that embraces everything from depletion curves to the Feedback Principle (the method of controlling a system by reinserting it into the results of its past performance), the Weinbergs explore the subtle art and science of regulating systems, projects, and people in the most efficient and logical manner possible. The authors draw on their respective backgrounds in technology and social science to offer fresh insights and translate them into a language that anyone can understand. In the course of this presentation, the Weinbergs introduce a host of laws and theorems derived from the best thinking of systems thinkers over the past century. In addition to being a reference book for professional and lay people alike, General Principles of Systems Design is suitable as an undergraduate text in the humanities, social, natural, and engineering sciences. It is unique in its approach, highly readable, and offers practical ways of solving problems.",System analysis,0,N/A,0,en
Control of Higher–Dimensional PDEs,Thomas Meurer,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-08-13,"This monograph presents new model-based design methods for trajectory planning, feedback stabilization, state estimation, and tracking control of distributed-parameter systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Flatness and backstepping techniques and their generalization to PDEs with higher-dimensional spatial domain lie at the core of this treatise. This includes the development of systematic late lumping design procedures and the deduction of semi-numerical approaches using suitable approximation methods. Theoretical developments are combined with both simulation examples and experimental results to bridge the gap between mathematical theory and control engineering practice in the rapidly evolving PDE control area. The text is divided into five parts featuring: - a literature survey of paradigms and control design methods for PDE systems - the first principle mathematical modeling of applications arising in heat and mass transfer, interconnected multi-agent systems, and piezo-actuated smart elastic structures - the generalization of flatness-based trajectory planning and feedforward control to parabolic and biharmonic PDE systems defined on general higher-dimensional domains - an extension of the backstepping approach to the feedback control and observer design for parabolic PDEs with parallelepiped domain and spatially and time varying parameters - the development of design techniques to realize exponentially stabilizing tracking control - the evaluation in simulations and experiments Control of Higher-Dimensional PDEs — Flatness and Backstepping Designs is an advanced research monograph for graduate students in applied mathematics, control theory, and related fields. The book may serve as a reference to recent developments for researchers and control engineers interested in the analysis and control of systems governed by PDEs.",Technology & Engineering,373,N/A,0,en

Analysis and Design of Certain Quantitative Multiresponse Experiments,"S. N. Roy, R. Gnanadesikan, J. N. Srivastava",Elsevier,2014-05-15,"Analysis and Design of Certain Quantitative Multiresponse Experiments highlights (i) the need for multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA); (ii) the need for multivariate design for multiresponse experiments; and (iii) the actual procedures and interpretation that have been used for this purpose by the authors. The development in this monograph is such that the theory and methods of uniresponse analysis and design stay very close to classical ANOVA. The book first discusses the multivariate aspect of linear models for location type of parameters, but under a univariate design, i.e. one in which each experimental unit is measured or studied with respect to all the responses. Separate chapters cover point estimation of location parameters; testing of linear hypotheses; properties of test procedures; and confidence bounds on a set of parametric functions. Subsequent chapters discuss a graphical internal comparison method for analyzing certain kinds of multiresponse experimental data; two classes of multiresponse designs, i.e. designated hierarchical and p-block designs; and the construction of various kinds of multiresponse designs.",Reference,316,N/A,0,en

Automatic Programming Applied to VLSI CAD Software: A Case Study,"Dorothy E. Setliff, Rob A. Rutenbar",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This book, and the research it describes, resulted from a simple observation we made sometime in 1986. Put simply, we noticed that many VLSI design tools looked ""alike"". That is, at least at the overall software architecture level, the algorithms and data structures required to solve problem X looked much like those required to solve problem X'. Unfortunately, this resemblance is often of little help in actually writing the software for problem X' given the software for problem X. In the VLSI CAD world, technology changes rapidly enough that design software must continually strive to keep up. And of course, VLSI design software, and engineering design software in general, is often exquisitely sensitive to some aspects of the domain (technology) in which it operates. Modest changes in functionality have an unfortunate tendency to require substantial (and time-consuming) internal software modifications. Now, observing that large engineering software systems are technology dependent is not particularly clever. However, we believe that our approach to xiv Preface dealing with this problem took an interesting new direction. We chose to investigate the extent to which automatic programming ideas cold be used to synthesize such software systems from high-level specifications. This book is one of the results of that effort.",Technology & Engineering,237,N/A,0,en

Models for Large Integrated Circuits,"Patrick DeWilde, Zhen-Qiu Ning",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"A modern microelectronic circuit can be compared to a large construction, a large city, on a very small area. A memory chip, a DRAM, may have up to 64 million bit locations on a surface of a few square centimeters. Each new generation of integrated circuit- generations are measured by factors of four in overall complexity -requires a substantial increase in density from the current technology, added precision, a decrease of the size of geometric features, and an increase in the total usable surface. The microelectronic industry has set the trend. Ultra large funds have been invested in the construction of new plants to produce the ultra large-scale circuits with utmost precision under the most severe conditions. The decrease in feature size to submicrons -0.7 micron is quickly becoming availabl- does not only bring technological problems. New design problems arise as well. The elements from which microelectronic circuits are build, transistors and interconnects, have different shape and behave differently than before. Phenomena that could be neglected in a four micron technology, such as the non-uniformity of the doping profile in a transistor, or the mutual capacitance between two wires, now play an important role in circuit design. This situation does not make the life of the electronic designer easier: he has to take many more parasitic effects into account, up to the point that his ideal design will not function as originally planned.",Technology & Engineering,228,N/A,0,en

Remanufacturing in the Circular Economy,Nabil Nasr,John Wiley & Sons,2019-11-12,"Economic growth and rising levels of consumption in developing and developed countries has been observed as being deeply coupled with natural resource usage and material consumption. The increasing need for natural resources has raised concerns regarding issues such as resource scarcity, undesirable environmental impacts due to material extraction, primary production, and suboptimal product disposal, and social or political tensions. Product End-of-Life (EoL) options, such as reusing or recycling, attempt to limit or reduce the amount of waste sent to a landfill, providing strategic means to decouple the link between economic growth and resource usage. These EoL options have the potential to close material loops, further utilizing wastes as resources, reducing environmental impacts, conserving natural resources, reducing material prices, and providing job opportunities in developing countries. Remanufacturing, on the other hand, is a unique EoL option due to increasing the number of life cycles of a product before final disposal. First, recurring environmental benefits, such as emission and raw material extraction avoidance are obtained with each additional product life cycle. Second, individual resource efficiency yields increase through product remanufacture. Resource efficiency or, using more with less will continue to compound with each additional life cycle. Third, recirculating products decreases the demand and dependency for primary resource production, further closing the material loop and creating a more circular economy. In addition, remanufacturing can initiate more preferable EoL options such as recovery, recycling, and waste reduction. While remanufacturing offers numerous benefits, there is significant lack of literature and books covering the fundamentals of operations, technologies and business models. The proposed book will provide in-depth coverage of remanufacturing fundamentals and its strong link to circular economy and resource efficiency.",Technology & Engineering,230,N/A,0,en

Graph Design for the Eye and Mind,Stephen Michael Kosslyn,Oxford University Press,2006,"Graphs have become a fixture of everyday life, used in scientific and business publications, in magazines and newspapers, on television, on billboards, and even on cereal boxes. Nonetheless, surprisingly few graphs communicate effectively, and most graphs fail because they do not take into account the goals, needs, and abilities of the viewers. In Graph Design for Eye and Mind, Stephen Kosslyn addresses these problems by presenting eight psychological principles for constructing effective graphs. Each principle is solidly rooted both in the scientific literature on how we perceive and comprehend graphs and in general facts about how our eyes and brains process visual information. Kosslyn then uses these eight psychological principles as the basis for hundreds of specific recommendations that serve as a concrete, step-by-step guide to deciding whether a graph is an appropriate display to use, choosing the correct type of graph for a specific type of data and message, and then constructing graphs that will be understood at a glance. Kosslyn also includes a complete review of the scientific literature on graph perception and comprehension, and appendices that provide a quick tutorial on basic statistics and a checklist for evaluating computer-graphics programs. Graph Design for Eye and Mind is an invaluable reference for anyone who uses visual displays to convey information in the sciences, humanities, and businesses such as finance, marketing, and advertising.",Mathematics,303,N/A,0,en

Military Industry in Taiwan and South Korea,Janne E. Nolan,Springer,1986-02-24,"Since World War II, the United States has done much to support economic, political, and social development in the Third World. At the same time, its policies toward developing nations often reflect an overly narrow conception of national and global security in which the influences of the modernization process seem scarcely to have been taken into account. Both strains in US policy are mirrored in strong academic traditions upon which policy-makers have drawn liberally in the postwar years. Developmentalists and security scholars alike will find much that is familiar in the case studies presented in Military Industry in Taiwan and South Korea. Dr Nolan's discussion of the stresses of rapid economic and political development in both states draws deeply on the modernization and dependencia studies of the last two decades, while her treatment of the 'security environment' within which domestic policies must be made will satisfy the international relationist concerned with states as actors within the international system. Throughout, Dr Nolan provides a detailed presentation of the behaviour of both polities that will be of interest to North-east Asian area specialists and students of US arms policy.",Political Science,215,N/A,0,en
Sustainable Industrial Design and Waste Management,Salah El Haggar,Academic Press,2010-07-28,"Sustainable Industrial Design and Waste Management was inspired by the need to have a text that enveloped awareness and solutions to the ongoing issues and concerns of waste generated from industry. The development of science and technology has increased human capacity to extract resources from nature and it is only recently that industries are being held accountable for the detrimental effects the waste they produce has on the environment. Increased governmental research, regulation and corporate accountability are digging up issues pertaining to pollution control and waste treatment and environmental protection. The traditional approach for clinical waste, agricultural waste, industrial waste, and municipal waste are depleting our natural resources. The main objective of this book is to conserve the natural resources by approaching 100 % full utilization of all types of wastes by cradle – to - cradle concepts, using Industrial Ecology methodology documented with case studies. Sustainable development and environmental protection cannot be achieved without establishing the concept of industrial ecology.

Spatial Design Education,Ashraf M. Salama,Routledge,2016-03-09,"Design education in architecture and allied disciplines is the cornerstone of design professions that contribute to shaping the built environment of the future. In this book, design education is dealt with as a paradigm whose evolutionary processes, underpinning theories, contents, methods, tools, are questioned and critically examined. It features a comprehensive discussion on design education with a focus on the design studio as the backbone of that education and the main forum for creative exploration and interaction, and for knowledge acquisition, assimilation, and reproduction. Through international and regional surveys, the striking qualities of design pedagogy, contemporary professional challenges and the associated sociocultural and environmental needs are identified. Building on twenty-five years of research and explorations into design pedagogy in architecture and urban design, this book authoritatively offers a critical analysis of a continuously evolving profession, its associated societal processes and the way in which design education reacts to their demands. Matters that pertain to traditional pedagogy, its characteristics and the reactions developed against it in the form of pioneering alternative studio teaching practices. Advances in design approaches and methods are debated including critical inquiry, empirical making, process-based learning, and Community Design, Design-Build, and Live Project Studios. Innovative teaching practices in lecture-based and introductory design courses are identified and characterized including inquiry-based, active and experiential learning. These investigations are all interwoven to elucidate a comprehensive understanding of contemporary design education in architecture and allied disciplines. A wide spectrum of teaching approaches and methods is utilized to reveal a theory of a ’trans-critical’ pedagogy that is conceptualized to shape a futuristic thinking about design teaching. Lessons learned from techniques and mechanisms for accommodation, adaptation, and implementation of a ‘trans-critical’ pedagogy in education are conceived to invigorate a new student-centered, evidence-based design culture sheltered in a wide variety of learning settings in architecture and beyond.",Architecture,509,N/A,0,en

Education Outcomes and Poverty,Christopher Colclough,Routledge,2013-08-15,"What do we know about the outcomes of education in developing countries? Where are the gaps in our knowledge, and why are they important to fill? What are the policy challenges that underlie these knowledge gaps, and how can education best contribute to eliminating the problem of widespread poverty in the developing world? This book arises out of a five year, DFID-funded programme of research examining the impact of education on the lives and livelihoods of people in developing countries, particularly those living in poorer areas and from poorer households. Based on highly innovative research that addressed common research questions across four countries in Africa and South Asia, the book presents new theoretical and empirical knowledge that will help to improve education and poverty reduction strategies in developing countries, through an enhanced recognition of education's actual and potential role. In addition to introducing the reader to a wide range of conceptual and policy-related problems concerning the impact of education on individuals and society, the book: provides the field of educational research with a contemporary economic and socio-cultural reassessment of educational outcomes in relation to poverty. discusses the challenges and priorities facing policy makers, practitioners and the international development community in improving the outcomes of education, particularly for the most disadvantaged in Africa, South Asia and other low income countries; identifies the key theoretical and methodological challenges involved in researching the outcomes of education for the poor. This book will appeal to undergraduate and postgraduate students and researchers in the fields of international and comparative education, education policy, development studies, African and Asian studies and related disciplines, and to those working on education policy at national or international levels in governments and international institutions.

In Miniature,Simon Garfield,Atria Books,2019-03-12,"Bestselling, award-winning writer Simon Garfield returns with an enthralling investigation of humans’ peculiar fascination with small things—and what small things tell us about our larger world. “[Simon Garfield is] an exuberant truffle-hound of the recondite and delightful factoid.” —Sunday Times (London) Simon Garfield writes books that shine a light on aspects of the everyday world in order to reveal the charms and eccentricities hiding in plain sight around us. After beguiling fans with books about everything from typography to time, from historic maps to the color mauve, he’s found his most delightful topic yet: miniatures. Tiny Eiffel Towers. Platoons of brave toy soldiers. A doll’s house created for a Queen. Diminutive crime scenes crafted to catch a killer. Model villages and miniscule railways. These are just a few of the objects you will discover in the pages of In Miniature. Bringing together history, psychology, art, and obsession, Garfield explores what fuels the strong appeal of miniature objects among collectors, modelers, and fans. The toys we enjoy as children invest us with a rare power at a young age, conferring on us a taste of adult-sized authority. For some, the desire to play with small things becomes a desire to make small things. We live in a vast and uncertain world, and controlling just a tiny, scaled-down part of it restores our sense of order and worth. As it explores flea circuses, microscopic food, ancient tombs, and the Vegas Strip, In Miniature changes the way we perceive our surroundings, encouraging all of us to find greatness in the smallest of things.",Art,336,N/A,0,en

Making Use,John M. Carroll,MIT Press,2003-01-01,"John Carroll shows how a pervasive but underused element of design practice, the scenario, can transform information systems design. Difficult to learn and awkward to use, today's information systems often change our activities in ways that we do not need or want. The problem lies in the software development process. In this book John Carroll shows how a pervasive but underused element of design practice, the scenario, can transform information systems design. Traditional textbook approaches manage the complexity of the design process via abstraction, treating design problems as if they were composites of puzzles. Scenario-based design uses concretization. A scenario is a concrete story about use. For example: ""A person turned on a computer; the screen displayed a button labeled Start; the person used the mouse to select the button."" Scenarios are a vocabulary for coordinating the central tasks of system development—understanding people's needs, envisioning new activities and technologies, designing effective systems and software, and drawing general lessons from systems as they are developed and used. Instead of designing software by listing requirements, functions, and code modules, the designer focuses first on the activities that need to be supported and then allows descriptions of those activities to drive everything else. In addition to a comprehensive discussion of the principles of scenario-based design, the book includes in-depth examples of its application.",Computers,766,5,1,en

"California Design, 1930¿1965 Living In a Modern Way",Wendy Kaplan,MIT Press,2011,"The first comprehensive examination of California''s mid-century modern design, generously illustrated. In 1951, designer Greta Magnusson Grossman observed that California design was ""not a superimposed style, but an answer to present conditions.... It has developed out of our own preferences for living in a modern way."" California design influenced the material culture of the entire country, in everything from architecture to fashion. This generously illustrated book, which accompanies a major exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, is the first comprehensive examination of California''s mid-century modern design. It begins by tracing the origins of a distinctively California modernism in the 1930s by such European émigrés as Richard Neutra, Rudolph Schindler, and Kem Weber; it finds other specific design influences and innovations in solid-color commercial ceramics, inspirations from Mexico and Asia, new schools for design training, new concepts about leisure, and the conversion of wartime technologies to peacetime use (exemplified by Charles and Ray Eames''s plywood and fiberglass furniture). The heart of California Design is the modern California home, famously characterized by open plans conducive to outdoor living. The layouts of modernist homes by Pierre Koenig, Craig Ellwood, and Raphael Soriano, for example, were intended to blur the distinction between indoors and out. Homes were furnished with products from Heath Ceramics, Van Keppel-Green, and Architectural Pottery as well as other, previously unheralded companies and designers. Many objects were designed to be multifunctional: pool and patio furniture that was equally suitable indoors, lighting that was both task and ambient, bookshelves that served as room dividers, and bathing suits that would turn into ensembles appropriate for indoor entertainment. California Design includes 350 images, most in color, of furniture, ceramics, metalwork, architecture, graphic and industrial design, film, textiles, and fashion, and ten incisive essays that trace the rise of the California design aesthetic. of wartime technologies to peacetime use (exemplified by Charles and Ray Eames''s plywood and fiberglass furniture).

Shipboard Power Systems Design and Verification Fundamentals,Mohammed M. Islam,John Wiley & Sons,2018-06-11,"The only book that covers fundamental shipboard design and verification concepts from individual devices to the system level Shipboard electrical system design and development requirements are fundamentally different from utility-based power generation and distribution requirements. Electrical engineers who are engaged in shipbuilding must understand various design elements to build both safe and energy-efficient power distribution systems. This book covers all the relevant technologies and regulations for building shipboard power systems, which include commercial ships, naval ships, offshore floating platforms, and offshore support vessels. In recent years, offshore floating platforms have been frequently discussed in exploring deep-water resources such as oil, gas, and wind energy. This book presents step-by-step shipboard electrical system design and verification fundamentals and provides information on individual electrical devices and practical design examples, along with ample illustrations to back them. In addition, Shipboard Power Systems Design and Verification Fundamentals: Presents real-world examples and supporting drawings for shipboard electrical system design Includes comprehensive coverage of domestic and international rules and regulations (e.g. IEEE 45, IEEE 1580) Covers advanced devices such as VFD (Variable Frequency Drive) in detail This book is an important read for all electrical system engineers working for shipbuilders and shipbuilding subcontractors, as well as for power engineers in general.",Technology & Engineering,379,N/A,0,en
History of Design and Design Law,"Tsukasa Aso, Christoph Rademacher, Jonathan Dobinson",Springer Nature,2022-04-22,"For the first time, this book provides an up-to-date history of product design and product design law covering 17 countries — Japan, Korea, China, Singapore, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden), Russia, the United States, Brazil and Australia — selected for their innovative or influential approach to design or design protection. Each country is the subject of two chapters — one on the history of design and the other on the history of design law — authored by experts in design and intellectual property (IP) law. This unique interdisciplinary approach explains why and how various national design protection systems (that can include design, copyright, trade mark, competition and civil laws) developed, making it an ideal book for students, researchers and lawyers. The book also serves as an international survey of different national policy and legal responses to historical developments and specific design and legal issues allowing readers to consider their advantages and disadvantages — and so is also recommended for policy and law makers, as well as organizations that administer IP rights. Topics include the subject matter of design protection; procedural and substantive requirements; design registration; infringement; and the overlap of design rights and other IP rights. The chapters on design history provide further context to the historical development of these legal concepts by considering major design movements, key designers and iconic designs and the current state of design. The chapters highlight the connected and often complementary relationship between the two histories, not only for each country, but at the regional and international level, often as a result of government policies, trade, colonialism, immigration and globalisation. Design and design practice continue to become more global and evolve with developments in technology. At the same time, design laws are not internationally harmonized and continue to develop at the national level, with a number of significant changes occurring in recent years. This timely book shows how the lessons of the past continue to inform the future direction of design and the legal systems developed to protect it.",Law,562,N/A,0,en

Ethics in Design and Communication,"Laura Scherling, Andrew DeRosa",Bloomsbury Publishing,2020-02-20,"This timely collection brings together critical, analytic, historical, and practical studies to address what ethics means in the practice of design. Designers face the same challenges as everyone else in the complex conditions of contemporary cultural life-choices about consumption, waste, exploitation, ecological damage, and political problems built into the supply chains on which the global systems of inequity currently balance precariously. But designers face the additional dilemma that their paid work is often entangled with promoting the same systems such critical approaches seek to redress: how to reconcile this contradiction, among others, in seeking to chart an ethical course of action while still functioning effectively in the world. Ethics in Design and Communication acknowledges the complexity of this subject matter, while also demonstrating that in the ongoing struggle towards an equitable and sustainable world, the talents of design and critical thought are essential. Featured case studies include graphic design internships today, the dark web, and media coverage of the 2016 US presidential election. The fact that within this book such a wide array of practitioners, scholars, critics, and professionals commit to addressing current injustices is already a positive sign. Nonetheless, it is essential that we guard against confusing the coercive force of moral imperatives with ethical deliberation when conceiving a foundation for action.",Design,269,N/A,0,en

Designing a Garden,Michael Van Valkenburgh,"The Monacelli Press, LLC",2019-10-15,"The intimate Monk's Garden at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston embodies the design principles that inform the work of noted landscape architect Michael Van Valkenburgh. In Designing a Garden, Van Valkenburgh presents the design of the Monk's Garden at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, an intimate, walled garden that Laurie Olin has described as ""a masterpiece, and not a minor one."" The book documents the evolution of the garden's design, which is based on the concept of meandering paths through a dreamlike woodland to create a contemplative space. Sketches and models show how the idea was worked out, and lush photographs reveal the completed garden through the seasons. Van Valkenburgh's text explores the origins of his love of landscape and plants in his family farm in Upstate New York and how this has influenced his intuitions as a designer. He shares the full background story of the Monk's Garden, focusing on the experimental nature of design work as well as the challenges and satisfactions of the small scale and the historic and cultural context. Designing a Garden provides a unique first-person account of the design process from the most prominent landscape architects in the country.",Gardening,209,N/A,0,en

"Quality Control, Robust Design, and the Taguchi Method",Khosrow Dehnad,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"In 1980, I received a grant from Aoyama-gakuin university to come to the United States to assist American Industry improve the quality of their products. In a small way this was to repay the help the US had given Japan after the war. In the summer of 1980, I visited the AT&T Bell Laboratories Quality Assurance Center, the organization that founded modern quality control. The result of my first summer at AT&T was an experiment with an orthogonal array design of size 18 (OA18) for optimization of an LSI fabrication process. As a measure of quality, the quantity ""signal-ta-noise"" ratio was to be optimized. Since then, this experi mental approach has been named ""robust design"" and has attracted the attention of both engineers and statisticians. My colleagues at Bell Laboratories have written several expository articles and a few theoretical papers on robust design from the viewpoint of statistics. Because so many people have asked for copies of these papers, it has been decided to publish them in a book form. This anthology is the result of these efforts. Despite the fact that quality engineering borrows some technical words from traditional design of experiments, the goals of quality engineering are different from those of statistics. For example, suppose there are two vendors. One vendor supplies products whose quality characteristic has a normal distribution with the mean on target (the desired value) and a certain standard deviation.",Technology & Engineering,287,N/A,0,en
Non-Design,Anthony Fontenot,University of Chicago Press,2021-07-09,"Anthony Fontenot’s staggeringly ambitious book uncovers the surprisingly libertarian heart of the most influential British and American architectural and urbanist discourses of the postwar period, expressed as a critique of central design and a support of spontaneous order. Non-Design illuminates the unexpected philosophical common ground between enemies of state support, most prominently the economist Friedrich Hayek, and numerous notable postwar architects and urbanists like Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown, Reyner Banham, and Jane Jacobs. These thinkers espoused a distinctive concept of ""non-design,""characterized by a rejection of conscious design and an embrace of various phenomenon that emerge without intention or deliberate human guidance. This diffuse and complex body of theories discarded many of the cultural presuppositions of the time, shunning the traditions of modern design in favor of the wisdom, freedom, and self-organizing capacity of the market. Fontenot reveals the little-known commonalities between the aesthetic deregulation sought by ostensibly liberal thinkers and Hayek’s more controversial conception of state power, detailing what this unexplored affinity means for our conceptions of political liberalism. Non-Design thoroughly recasts conventional views of postwar architecture and urbanism, as well as liberal and libertarian philosophies.",Architecture,396,N/A,0,en

A New Program for Graphic Design,David Reinfurt,Inventory Press,2019-09-17,"A toolkit for visual literacy in the 21st century A New Program for Graphic Design is the first communication-design textbook expressly of and for the 21st century. Three courses--Typography, Gestalt and Interface--provide the foundation of this book. Through a series of in-depth historical case studies (from Benjamin Franklin to the Macintosh computer) and assignments that progressively build in complexity, A New Program for Graphic Design serves as a practical guide both for designers and for undergraduate students coming from a range of other disciplines. Synthesizing the pragmatic with the experimental, and drawing on the work of Max Bill, György Kepes, Bruno Munari and Stewart Brand (among many others), it builds upon mid- to late-20th-century pedagogical models to convey contemporary design principles in an understandable form for students of all levels--treating graphic design as a liberal art that informs the dissemination of knowledge across all disciplines. For those seeking to understand and shape our increasingly networked world of information, this guide to visual literacy is an indispensable tool. David Reinfurt (born 1971), a graphic designer, writer and educator, reestablished the Typography Studio at Princeton University and introduced the study of graphic design. Previously, he held positions at Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, Rhode Island School of Design and Yale University School of Art. As a cofounder of O-R-G inc. (2000), Dexter Sinister (2006) and the Serving Library (2012), Reinfurt has been involved in several studios that have reimagined graphic design, publishing and archiving in the 21st century.

The Design of Urban Manufacturing,"Robert N. Lane, Nina Rappaport",Routledge,2020-03-13,"American cities are rediscovering the economic and social value of urban manufacturing. However, urban manufacturing is often invisible and poorly understood in terms of urban design, architecture, and policy. The Design of Urban Manufacturing brings a multidisciplinary approach to a new complex reality that urban manufacturing now sits squarely at the intersection of research, education, and neighborhood revitalization. Using cases studies from across North America and beyond, this book presents innovative approaches not only to the design of districts and buildings, but to the design of policy as well: the special roles that governments, local development corporations, and not-for-profit organizations all have to play in supporting manufacturing. This book presents current models for working neighborhoods where factories enable fine-grained, mixed-use communities and face-to-face contact while creatively solving the very real problems of goods movement and functional buildings. Design guidelines and policy recommendations are calibrated to different types of production districts.

We Are Not Users,"Eswaran Subrahmanian, Yoram Reich, Sruthi Krishnan",MIT Press,2024-10-29,"A call to reclaim and rethink the field of designing as a liberal art where diverse voices come together to shape the material world. We live in a material world of designed artifacts, both digital and analog. We think of ourselves as users; the platforms, devices, or objects provide a service that we can use. But is this really the case? We Are Not Users argues that people cannot be reduced to the entity called “user”; we are not homogenous but diverse. That buzz of dissonance that we hear reflects the difficulty of condensing our diversity into “one size fits all.” This book proposes that a new understanding of design could resolve that dissonance, and issues a call to reclaim and rethink the field of designing as a liberal art where diverse voices come together to shape the material world. The authors envision designing as a dialogue, simultaneously about the individual and the social—an act enriched by diversity of both disciplines and perspectives. The book presents the building blocks of a language that can conceive designing in all its richness, with relevance for both theory and practice. It introduces a theoretical model, terminology, examples, and a framework for bringing together the social, cultural, and political aspects of designing.

Co-design and Social Innovation,Garth Britton,Taylor & Francis,2017-04-21,"Although co-design has been practised in new service and product development for some years, it has only recently begun to appear in the burgeoning field of social innovation. It appears to be well-attuned to this new context, offering as it does an open-ended relational process to generate novel solutions to problems whose very definition seems to escape more conventional approaches. However, even less research attention has been paid to co-design than to social innovation. This book explores the potential of co-design as a social innovation process. It reviews the diverse theoretical and disciplinary foundations on which co-design is based. It proposes a framework for understanding co-design as a cohesive practice across the extremely broad scope of its potential applications. It explores appropriate approaches to governance and evaluation of co-design initiatives and outlines the key issues and limitations on its use. Although it is intended to provide a robust theoretical basis for researching co-design initiatives, it will also be of interest to anyone who is contemplating putting co-design into practice.",Business & Economics,187,N/A,0,en

Talk to Me,Paola Antonelli,The Museum of Modern Art,2011,"Published in conjunction with an exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art, Talk to Me thrives on an important late 20th-century cultural development in design: a shift from the centrality of function to that of meaning. From this new perspective, objects contain information that goes well beyond their immediate use or appearance, providing access to complex systems and networks and acting as gateways and interpreters. Whether openly and actively, or in subtle, subliminal ways, things talk to us, and designers write the initial script that lets us develop and improvise the dialogue. Talk to Me focuses on objects that involve direct interaction, such as interfaces, information systems, communication devices, and projects that establish a practical, emotional or even sensual connection between their users and entities such as cities, companies, governmental institutions, as well as other people. The featured objects range in date from the early 1980s - beginning with the first Graphic User Interface, developed by Xerox Parc in 1981 - with particular attention given to projects from the last five years and to several ones currently in development. Included are a diverse array of examples, from computer and machine interfaces to websites, video games, devices and tools, and installations. Organized thematically, Talk to Me features essays by Paola Antonelli, Jamer Hunt, Alexandra Midel, Kevin Slavin, and Koi Vinh. By introducing design practices that are becoming increasingly crucial to our world, the book presents a highly distilled sample of today's best design production that uses technology in creative and unexpected ways, showing how rich and deep design's influence will be on our future.",Art,210,N/A,0,en

CMF Design,Liliana Becerra,Frame Publishers,2016-05-01,"In this first book about the rather young discipline, the author consolidated its key principles, so that they can be consulted, referenced and utilised by both design students and professionals. Only when the perfect balance between visual beauty and functional performance is achieved, can a product provide a consistent and successful user experience. The discipline of CMF design focuses on designing and specifying colours, materials and finishes to support both functional and emotional attributes of products. The work of the CMF designer combines aesthetics and practical knowledge of materials and technologies with intangible human perceptions of value. This area of design expertise is increasingly in demand. Consumer product manufacturers have an enhanced awareness of its great potential for diversifying product portfolios at relatively low costs, while still maintaining a similar or the same product shape, functionality or tooling. It can work as a key avenue to create a sense of novelty and higher value propositions. From a marketing perspective, CMF design is a valuable tool when it comes to positioning products, collections and categories according to market tiers and consumer segmentations. Introducing the CMF process and detailing the areas of colour, material and finish design, this book serves as a valuable source of information about this emerging professional discipline and its fundamental principles.",Architecture,212,N/A,0,en

Organization Design,Naomi Stanford,Routledge,2012-06-14,"Organization Design looks at how you need to change the ways your organization does things in order to increase productivity, performance, and profit. Providing the knowledge and method to handle the kind of recurring organisational change that all businesses face, those which do not involve transforming the entire enterprise but which necessitate significant change at the business unit, divisional, functional, facility or local levels. The problem lies in knowing what needs to change and how to change it. Taking the organisation as a designed system, it describes four major elements of organizations: the work - the basic tasks to be done by the organisation and its parts, the people - characteristics of individuals in the organization, formal organization - structures eg the organisation hierarchy, processes, and methods that are formally created to get individuals to perform tasks, informal organization - emerging arrangements including variations to the norm, processes, and relationships, commonly described as the culture or 'the way we do things round here'. The way these four elements relate, combine and interact affects productivity, performance and profit. Most books on this subject target a wide management audience rather than HR, this is specifically written for HR practitioners and line managers working together to achieve the goal. It clarifies why and how organisations need to be in a state of readiness to design or redesign and emphasises that people as well as business processes must be part of design considerations.",Business & Economics,321,N/A,0,en

Neri & Hu Design and Research Office,"Neri & Hu Design and Research Office, Lyndon Neri, Rossana Hu, Nellie Yang",Park Publishing (WI),2017,"Founded in 2004 by partners Lyndon Neri and Rossana Hu, Neri&Hu Design and Research Office is an inter-disciplinary architectural design practice based in Shanghai, China with an additional office in London, UK. Neri&Hu works internationally providing architecture, interior, master planning, graphic, and product design services. Currently working on projects in many countries, Neri&Hu is composed of multi-cultural staff who speak over 30 different languages. The diversity of the team reinforces a core vision for the practice: to respond to a global worldview incorporating overlapping design disciplines for a new paradigm in architecture. Neri&Hu s location is purposeful. With Shanghai considered a new global frontier, Neri&Hu is in the center of this contemporary chaos. The city s cultural, urban, and historic contexts function as a point of departure for the architectural explorations involved in every project. Because new sets of contemporary problems relating to buildings now extend beyond traditional architecture, the practice challenges traditional boundaries of architecture to include other complementary disciplines. Neri&Hu believes strongly in research as a design tool, as each project bears its unique set of contextual issues. A critical probing into the specificities of program, site, function, and history is essential to the creation of rigorous design work. Based on research, Neri&Hu desires to anchor its work on the dynamic interaction of experience, detail, material, form, and light rather than conforming to a formulaic style. The ultimate significance behind each project comes from how the built forms create meaning through their physical representations. In 2014, UK Wallpaper* announced Mr. Neri and his partner Rossana Hu as 2014 Designer of The Year. In 2013, Mr. Neri was inducted into U.S. Interior Design Hall of Fame with partner Rossana Hu and was selected as AD 100 top talents in architecture and interior design by Architectural Digest China. The practice was selected as the 2011 INSIDE Festival Overall Winner, won AR Awards for Emerging Architecture 2010 by Architectural Review (UK) and one of the Design Vanguards in 2009 by Architectural Record (US). In 2006, Mr. Neri was selected by I.D. Magazine as one of the 40 designers globally who deserve more attention in the I.D. 40 . http: //enthepractice.neriandhu.com/content/philosophy This new monograph is the first book ever published on Neri&Hu. In a lavishly illustrated beautiful design concept it presents a selection of their work in architecture and product design. The content is structured in an introduction including also an essay on the topic of renovation, and three sections: Buildings, Products, and Projects. ""Buildings"" features seven renovation projects in Shanghai, complete refurbishments as well as interior redesigns. The projects include three retail spaces, Neri&Hu s own office building, a hotel, a restaurant, and a private home. ""Products"" presents tea ware, a chair and table, and a picnic basket. ""Projects"" documents ongoing and unrealized architectural work: a private residence in Florida (US), two hotel renovations projects in London and Shanghai, and a museum renovation in Kuala Lumpur. An overview on Neri&Hu s projects to date rounds out the book. The illustrative concept zooms from overview to detail: project documentations include with site plans, demolition plans and sections (i.e. showing demolished, and preserved parts of existing buildings as well as proposed additions) as well as detailed paving and furniture plans for interiors and details of selected products.

Life Is a Game,Edward Castronova,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2020-09-17,"What if life is a game? Are you winning? Have you even decided what 'winning' is? Game design could be defined in many ways, but here the term is used to denote the practice of creating choices. Designing a game, in this sense, involves crafting limits, rewards, incentives, and risks in such a way that the person who interacts with the game – the player – makes choices that have consequences. Edward Castronova urges readers to think about the fundamentals of the human condition and compare them to different games that we all know. In some ways, life is like an idle game: providing unchallenging distractions that fit easily into a person's daily routine. In other ways, life is like the game Minesweeper: You poke in different places to learn about what you don't know, taking care to avoid big explosions. Or, life is like a role-playing game: You adopt a persona and speak your part, always seeking adventure. Bringing together questions relating to diverse fields – such as politics, economics, sociology and philosophy - Castronova persuades readers to broaden the scope of game design to answer questions about life's everyday obstacles. The object of this book is to take seriously the idea that life is a game. The goal is not to make readers wealthier or healthier. Its goal is to go on a journey into the human condition, with game design as a guide.",Computers,233,N/A,0,en

Knowing What Students Know,"National Research Council, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Center for Education, Board on Testing and Assessment, Committee on the Foundations of Assessment",National Academies Press,2001-10-27,"Education is a hot topic. From the stage of presidential debates to tonight's dinner table, it is an issue that most Americans are deeply concerned about. While there are many strategies for improving the educational process, we need a way to find out what works and what doesn't work as well. Educational assessment seeks to determine just how well students are learning and is an integral part of our quest for improved education. The nation is pinning greater expectations on educational assessment than ever before. We look to these assessment tools when documenting whether students and institutions are truly meeting education goals. But we must stop and ask a crucial question: What kind of assessment is most effective? At a time when traditional testing is subject to increasing criticism, research suggests that new, exciting approaches to assessment may be on the horizon. Advances in the sciences of how people learn and how to measure such learning offer the hope of developing new kinds of assessments-assessments that help students succeed in school by making as clear as possible the nature of their accomplishments and the progress of their learning. Knowing What Students Know essentially explains how expanding knowledge in the scientific fields of human learning and educational measurement can form the foundations of an improved approach to assessment. These advances suggest ways that the targets of assessment-what students know and how well they know it-as well as the methods used to make inferences about student learning can be made more valid and instructionally useful. Principles for designing and using these new kinds of assessments are presented, and examples are used to illustrate the principles. Implications for policy, practice, and research are also explored. With the promise of a productive research-based approach to assessment of student learning, Knowing What Students Know will be important to education administrators, assessment designers, teachers and teacher educators, and education advocates.",Education,383,N/A,0,en

Architect + Entrepreneur,Eric W. Reinholdt,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2015,"Part narrative, part business book; Architect + Entrepreneur is filled with contemporary, relevant, fresh tips and advice, from a seasoned professional architect building a new business. The guide advocates novel strategies and tools that merge entrepreneurship with the practice of architecture and interior design. The Problem:Embarking on a new business venture is intimidating; you have questions. But many of the resources available to help entrepreneur architects and interior designers start their design business lack timeliness and relevance. Most are geared toward building colossal firms like SOM and Gensler using outdated methods and old business models. If you're an individual or small team contemplating starting a design business, this is your field guide; crafted to inspire action. The Solution:Using the lean startup methodology to create a minimum viable product, the handbook encourages successive small wins that support a broader vision enabling one to, ""think big, start small, and learn fast."" It's a unique take on design practice viewed through the lens of entrepreneurship and is designed to answer the questions all new business owners face, from the rote to the existential. Questions about: - Startup costs - Business models (old and new) - Marriage of business and design - Mindset - Branding & naming (exercises and ideas) - Internet marketing strategies - Passive income ideas - Setting your fee - Taxes - Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) - Securing the work - Client relations - Software - Billing rates - Contracts Building a business isn't a singular act; it's a series of small steps. Using the outline found in Architect + Entrepreneur you can start today. The chapters are organized to guide you from idea to action. Rather than write a business plan you'll be challenged to craft a brand and you'll sell it using new technologies. Follow the guide sequentially and you'll have both the tools and a profitable small business.",Architects,0,N/A,0,en

Shadows of Doubt,"Brendan O'Flaherty, Rajiv Sethi",Harvard University Press,2019-04-15,"Shadows of Doubt reveals how deeply stereotypes distort our interactions, shape crime, and deform the criminal justice system. If you’re a robber, how do you choose your victims? As a police officer, how afraid are you of the young man you’re about to arrest? As a judge, do you think the suspect in front of you will show up in court if released from pretrial detention? As a juror, does the defendant seem guilty to you? Your answers may depend on the stereotypes you hold, and the stereotypes you believe others hold. In this provocative, pioneering book, economists Brendan O’Flaherty and Rajiv Sethi explore how stereotypes can shape the ways crimes unfold and how they contaminate the justice system through far more insidious, pervasive, and surprising paths than we have previously imagined. Crime and punishment occur under extreme uncertainty. Offenders, victims, police officers, judges, and jurors make high-stakes decisions with limited information, under severe time pressure. With compelling stories and extensive data on how people act as they try to commit, prevent, or punish crimes, O’Flaherty and Sethi reveal the extent to which we rely on stereotypes as shortcuts in our decision making. Sometimes it’s simple: Robbers tend to target those they stereotype as being more compliant. Other interactions display a complex and sometimes tragic interplay of assumptions: “If he thinks I’m dangerous, he might shoot. I’ll shoot first.” Shadows of Doubt shows how deeply stereotypes are implicated in the most controversial criminal justice issues of our time, and how a clearer understanding of their effects can guide us toward a more just society.",Social Science,385,N/A,0,en

Readers are provided with an in-depth analysis of psychometrics in a format that will keep their attention and that they will be able to relate to the significance of psychological testing across numerous areas such as schools, businesses, clinical settings, military, or government."" -Todd L. Chmielewski, PsycCRITIQUES, December 7, 2005 VOL. 50, NO. 49, ARTICLE 12 Psychological Testing: A Practical Approach to Design and Evaluation offers a fresh and innovative approach to students and faculty in the fields of testing, measurement, psychometrics, research design, and related areas of study. Author Theresa J.B. Kline guides readers through the process of designing and evaluating a test, while ensuring that the test meets the highest professional standards. The author uses simple, clear examples throughout and fully details the required statistical analyses. Topics include—but are not limited to—design of item stems and responses; sampling strategies; classical and modern test theory; IRT program examples; reliability of tests and raters; validation using content, criterion-related, and factor analytic approaches; test and item bias; and professional and ethical issues in testing. With the student in mind, Kline has created features that ease them into more difficult ideas, always stressing the practical use of theoretical concepts. Features include A step-by-step approach to designing a test, including construct identification, construct operationalization, collecting data, item assessment, and reliability and validity techniques Examples of data analyses with printouts and interpretation Up-to-date coverage of psychometric topics, such as difference scores, change scores, translation, computer adaptive testing, reliability and validity generalization, professional and ethical guidelines, and references IRT program outputs (dichotomous and multiple response) Coverage of traditional topics in the context of how they would be used, such as standard errors and confidence intervals Sampling approaches and their strengths and weaknesses, as well as response rates and missing data management Psychological Testing is perfectly suited as a main text for upper-level undergraduate and graduate Testing or Psychometrics courses in departments of Psychology, Education, Sociology, Management, and in the Human Services disciplines. Professional researchers, educators, and consultants will also want to add this to their libraries for up-to-date coverage of test design and evaluation techniques. ""Professor Kline′s attempts to de-mystify complex measurement concepts are beautifully simplified and illustrated in her countless illustrations of practical and relevant problems for the mathematically-challenged student.

Embodied Energy and Design,David Benjamin,Lars Müller Publishers,2017,"Architecture is increasingly understood as a field of practice that is inextricably embedded in ecologies and energy systems, and yet embodied energy-the various forms of energy required to ex- tract raw matter, to produce and transport building materials, and to assemble a given building- remains largely under-explored in its ramifications for both design and environment. As operational energy has declined as a proportion of buildings' total energy consumption, embodied energy has become an essential site for further speculation and innovation. 'Embodied Energy and Design: Making Architecture between Metrics and Narratives' asks questions about the varying scales, methods of analysis, and opportunities through which we might reconsider the making of architecture in the context of global flows of energy and resources. 120 illustrations",ARCHITECTURE,231,N/A,0,en
Urban Street Design Guide,National Association of City Transportation Officials,Island Press,2013-10-01,"The NACTO Urban Street Design Guide shows how streets of every size can be reimagined and reoriented to prioritize safe driving and transit, biking, walking, and public activity. Unlike older, more conservative engineering manuals, this design guide emphasizes the core principle that urban streets are public places and have a larger role to play in communities than solely being conduits for traffic. The well-illustrated guide offers blueprints of street design from multiple perspectives, from the bird’s eye view to granular details. Case studies from around the country clearly show how to implement best practices, as well as provide guidance for customizing design applications to a city’s unique needs. Urban Street Design Guide outlines five goals and tenets of world-class street design: • Streets are public spaces. Streets play a much larger role in the public life of cities and communities than just thoroughfares for traffic. • Great streets are great for business. Well-designed streets generate higher revenues for businesses and higher values for homeowners. • Design for safety. Traffic engineers can and should design streets where people walking, parking, shopping, bicycling, working, and driving can cross paths safely. • Streets can be changed. Transportation engineers can work flexibly within the building envelope of a street. Many city streets were created in a different era and need to be reconfigured to meet new needs. • Act now! Implement projects quickly using temporary materials to help inform public decision making. Elaborating on these fundamental principles, the guide offers substantive direction for cities seeking to improve street design to create more inclusive, multi-modal urban environments. It is an exceptional resource for redesigning streets to serve the needs of 21st century cities, whose residents and visitors demand a variety of transportation options, safer streets, and vibrant community life.",Architecture,0,N/A,0,en

Between Two Kingdoms,Suleika Jaouad,Random House,2021-02-09,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A deeply moving memoir of illness and recovery that traces one young woman’s journey from diagnosis to remission to re-entry into “normal” life—from the founder of The Isolation Journals and a subject of the Netflix documentary American Symphony ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: The New York Times Book Review, The Washington Post, Bloomberg, The Rumpus, She Reads, Library Journal, Booklist “I was immersed for the whole ride and would follow Jaouad anywhere. . . . Her writing restores the moon, lights the way as we learn to endure the unknown.”—Chanel Miller, The New York Times Book Review “Beautifully crafted . . . affecting . . . a transformative read . . . Jaouad’s insights about the self, connectedness, uncertainty and time speak to all of us.”—The Washington Post In the summer after graduating from college, Suleika Jaouad was preparing, as they say in commencement speeches, to enter “the real world.” She had fallen in love and moved to Paris to pursue her dream of becoming a war correspondent. The real world she found, however, would take her into a very different kind of conflict zone. It started with an itch—first on her feet, then up her legs, like a thousand invisible mosquito bites. Next came the exhaustion, and the six-hour naps that only deepened her fatigue. Then a trip to the doctor and, a few weeks shy of her twenty-third birthday, a diagnosis: leukemia, with a 35 percent chance of survival. Just like that, the life she had imagined for herself had gone up in flames. By the time Jaouad flew home to New York, she had lost her job, her apartment, and her independence. She would spend much of the next four years in a hospital bed, fighting for her life and chronicling the saga in a column for The New York Times. When Jaouad finally walked out of the cancer ward—after countless rounds of chemo, a clinical trial, and a bone marrow transplant—she was, according to the doctors, cured. But as she would soon learn, a cure is not where the work of healing ends; it’s where it begins. She had spent the past 1,500 days in desperate pursuit of one goal—to survive. And now that she’d done so, she realized that she had no idea how to live. How would she reenter the world and live again? How could she reclaim what had been lost? Jaouad embarked—with her new best friend, Oscar, a scruffy terrier mutt—on a 100-day, 15,000-mile road trip across the country. She set out to meet some of the strangers who had written to her during her years in the hospital: a teenage girl in Florida also recovering from cancer; a teacher in California grieving the death of her son; a death-row inmate in Texas who’d spent his own years confined to a room. What she learned on this trip is that the divide between sick and well is porous, that the vast majority of us will travel back and forth between these realms throughout our lives. Between Two Kingdoms is a profound chronicle of survivorship and a fierce, tender, and inspiring exploration of what it means to begin again.",Biography & Autobiography,370,1,1,en

Brilliant,Linda O'Keeffe,"The Monacelli Press, LLC",2011-10-25,"It all begins and ends with white. White is everywhere, from sculptures and art installations to interior and furniture designs to fields of snow and mythical animals. In its countless tones—eggshell, ballerina, off-white, edelweiss, and so many more—white elicits a range of emotions, depending on the viewer, the design, the culture, the use. Brilliant: White in Design examines the spectrum of colors and talents inherent in white, exploring how it is used, and viewed, in art, design, architecture, and nature. Noted design writer Linda O’Keeffe parses the language of white and considers its strengths and, at times, its weaknesses. She shows that living with white has soothing rewards and dust-collecting drawbacks; that beige is not a four-letter word but a glamorous alternative to its more pristine counterpart; that designing with white reduces everything to pure form; and much more. In more than 250 photographs, O’Keeffe showcases work, both recent and historic, from around the world—France, Japan, Spain, England, Mexico, Canada, South Africa—and across the United States.

Integrated circuits are used in almost all electronic devices and systems, many of which, such as the Internet, computers, and mobile phones, have become essential parts of modern life and have changed the way we live. Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) provides a revolutionary approach to computing with device-to-device interactions. The design of a QCA circuit is radically different from a conventional digital design due to its unique characteristics at both the physical level and logic level.

Design of Interconnection Networks for Programmable Logic,"Guy Lemieux, David Lewis",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-06-29,"Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs) have become the key implementation medium for the vast majority of digital circuits designed today. While the highest-volume devices are still built with full-fabrication rather than field programmability, the trend towards ever fewer ASICs and more FPGAs is clear. This makes the field of PLD architecture ever more important, as there is stronger demand for faster, smaller, cheaper and lower-power programmable logic. PLDs are 90% routing and 10% logic. This book focuses on that 90% that is the programmable routing: the manner in which the programmable wires are connected and the circuit design of the programmable switches themselves. Anyone seeking to understand the design of an FPGA needs to become lit erate in the complexities of programmable routing architecture. This book builds on the state-of-the-art of programmable interconnect by providing new methods of investigating and measuring interconnect structures, as well as new programmable switch basic circuits. The early portion of this book provides an excellent survey of interconnec tion structures and circuits as they exist today. Lemieux and Lewis then provide a new way to design sparse crossbars as they are used in PLDs, and show that the method works with an empirical validation. This is one of a few routing architecture works that employ analytical methods to deal with the routing archi tecture design. The analysis permits interesting insights not typically possible with the standard empirical approach.",Technology & Engineering,221,N/A,0,en

Design of Simple and Robust Process Plants,J. L. A. Koolen,John Wiley & Sons,2001-10-15,"The approaches to design process plants described in this book lead to process designs which require 30-40% less capital than usual. The book is unique since it is the first comprehensive work addressing both the total process design and operational approach. Technological developments during the last decade made the design of really competitive processes possible. Mechanical developments have resulted in reliable and robust equipment. Process developments have created opportunities to minimize the amount of equipment; furthermore, different logistic approaches, integration of process functionality and intensification of the unit operations are possible. Computer and control technology allows remote-control operation and first pass prime production. In this work design philosophies are discussed and their implementation is shown as a structured approach for planned and existing plants. Numerous examples are presented to illustrate what simple design can create. The work is intended for experienced engineers and managers involved in process design, control design and operation, but is also interesting for students. Project engineers and managers have to apply these new approaches to achieve competitive processes. ""A process plant should meet the simplicity and robustness of a household refrigerator.""

Design of Steel-Concrete Composite Bridges to Eurocodes,"Ioannis Vayas, Aristidis Iliopoulos",CRC Press,2013-08-29,"Combining a theoretical background with engineering practice, Design of Steel-Concrete Composite Bridges to Eurocodes covers the conceptual and detailed design of composite bridges in accordance with the Eurocodes. Bridge design is strongly based on prescriptive normative rules regarding loads and their combinations, safety factors, material properties, analysis methods, required verifications, and other issues that are included in the codes. Composite bridges may be designed in accordance with the Eurocodes, which have recently been adopted across the European Union. This book centers on the new design rules incorporated in the EN-versions of the Eurocodes. The book addresses the design for a majority of composite bridge superstructures and guides readers through the selection of appropriate structural bridge systems. It introduces the loads on bridges and their combinations, proposes software supported analysis models, and outlines the required verifications for sections and members at ultimate and serviceability limit states, including fatigue and plate buckling, as well as seismic design of the deck and the bearings. It presents the main types of common composite bridges, discusses structural forms and systems, and describes preliminary design aids and erection methods. It provides information on railway bridges, but through the design examples makes road bridges the focal point. This text includes several design examples within the chapters, explores the structural details, summarizes the relevant design codes, discusses durability issues, presents the properties for structural materials, concentrates on modeling for global analysis, and lays down the rules for the shear connection. It presents fatigue analysis and design, fatigue load models, detail categories, and fatigue verifications for structural steel, reinforcement, concrete, and shear connectors. It also covers structural bearings and dampers, with an emphasis on reinforced elastomeric bearings. The book is appropriate for structural engineering students, bridge designers or practicing engineers converting from other codes to Eurocodes.",Technology & Engineering,586,N/A,0,en

Ultimate Limit State Design of Steel-Plated Structures,"Jeom Kee Paik, Anil Kumar Thayamballi",John Wiley & Sons,2003-03-28,"Steel plated structures are important in a variety of marine and land-based applications, including ships, offshore platforms, power and chemical plants, box girder bridges and box girder cranes. The basic strength members in steel plated structures include support members (such as stiffeners and plate girders), plates, stiffened panels/grillages and box girders. During their lifetime, the structures constructed using these members are subjected to various types of loading which is for the most part operational, but may in some cases be extreme or even accidental. Ultimate Limit State Design of Steel Plated Structures reviews and describes both fundamentals and practical design procedures in this field. The derivation of the basic mathematical expressions is presented together with a thorough discussion of the assumptions and the validity of the underlying expressions and solution methods. Particularly valuable coverage in the book includes: * Serviceability and the ultimate limit state design of steel structural systems and their components * The progressive collapse and the design of damage tolerant structures in the context of marine accidents * Age related structural degradation such as corrosion and fatigue cracks Furthermore, this book is also an easily accessed design tool which facilitates learning by applying the concepts of the limit states for practice using a set of computer programs which can be downloaded. In addition, expert guidance on mechanical model test results as well as nonlinear finite element solutions, sophisticated design methodologies useful for practitioners in industries or research institutions, selected methods for accurate and efficient analyses of nonlinear behavior of steel plated structures both up to and after the ultimate strength is reached, is provided. Designed as both a textbook and a handy reference, the book is well suited to teachers and university students who are approaching the limit state design technology of steel plated structures for the first time. The book also meets the needs of structural designers or researchers who are involved in civil, marine and mechanical engineering as well as offshore engineering and naval architecture.",Technology & Engineering,548,3,1,en

The Architecture of Waste,"Caroline O'Donnell, Dillon Pranger",Routledge,2020-11-16,"Global material crises are imminent. In the very near future, recycling will no longer be a choice made by those concerned about the environment, but a necessity for all. This means a paradigm shift in domestic behavior, manufacturing, construction, and design is inevitable. The Architecture of Waste provides a hopeful outlook through examining current recycling practices, rethinking initial manufacturing techniques, and proposing design solutions for second lives of material-objects. The book touches on a variety of inescapable issues beyond our global waste crisis including cultural psyches, politics, economics, manufacturing, marketing, and material science. A series of crucial perspectives from experts cover these topics and frames the research by providing a past, present, and future look at how we got here and where we go next: the historical, the material, and the design. Twelve design proposals look beyond the simple application of recycled and waste materials in architecture—an admirable endeavor but one that does not engage the urgent reality of a circular economy—by aiming to transform familiar, yet flawed, material-objects into closed-loop resources. Complete with over 150 color images and written for both professionals and students, The Architecture of Waste is a necessary reference for rethinking the traditional role of the architect and challenging the discipline to address urgent material issues within the larger design process.",Architecture,258,N/A,0,en

The Design of Everyday Things,Don Norman,Basic Books,2013-11-05,"One of the world's great designers shares his vision of ""the fundamental principles of great and meaningful design"", that's ""even more relevant today than it was when first published"" (Tim Brown, CEO, IDEO). Even the smartest among us can feel inept as we fail to figure out which light switch or oven burner to turn on, or whether to push, pull, or slide a door. The fault, argues this ingenious -- even liberating -- book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how -- and why -- some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.",Design,370,N/A,0,en

Circular Design for Fashion,ELLEN MACARTHUR FOUNDATION. PUBLISHING,N/A,2021-12,"At heart, this book aims to inspire fearless innovators committed to spearheading the future of fashion. It is for all of us looking to make a positive impact in an industry that we love and care about. It is increasingly acknowledged that the practice of design is not exclusive to designers, nor is it found only in studios. The materials, garments, services, shows, supply chains and stores that make up the fashion industry all work the way they do because of innumerable design decisions, made by creatives all over the world. Circular design goes far beyond rethinking single products or services, it has the potential to redefine how the entire fashion system operates. It's a chance for anyone in the fashion industry - regardless of job title - to support the shift to a circular economy where, by design, waste and pollution are eliminated, products and materials are circulated, and nature is regenerated. Circular design is a pioneering practice of design. It is the creative opportunity of the coming decade for the creatives, innovators, and pioneers who seek to reshape the fashion industry.",Clothing trade,0,N/A,0,en

Designs for the Pluriverse,Arturo Escobar,Duke University Press,2018-03-15,"In Designs for the Pluriverse Arturo Escobar presents a new vision of design theory and practice aimed at channeling design's world-making capacity toward ways of being and doing that are deeply attuned to justice and the Earth. Noting that most design—from consumer goods and digital technologies to built environments—currently serves capitalist ends, Escobar argues for the development of an “autonomous design” that eschews commercial and modernizing aims in favor of more collaborative and placed-based approaches. Such design attends to questions of environment, experience, and politics while focusing on the production of human experience based on the radical interdependence of all beings. Mapping autonomous design’s principles to the history of decolonial efforts of indigenous and Afro-descended people in Latin America, Escobar shows how refiguring current design practices could lead to the creation of more just and sustainable social orders.",Social Science,300,N/A,0,en

The Design of Approximation Algorithms,"David P. Williamson, David B. Shmoys",Cambridge University Press,2011-04-26,"Discrete optimization problems are everywhere, from traditional operations research planning problems, such as scheduling, facility location, and network design; to computer science problems in databases; to advertising issues in viral marketing. Yet most such problems are NP-hard. Thus unless P = NP, there are no efficient algorithms to find optimal solutions to such problems. This book shows how to design approximation algorithms: efficient algorithms that find provably near-optimal solutions. The book is organized around central algorithmic techniques for designing approximation algorithms, including greedy and local search algorithms, dynamic programming, linear and semidefinite programming, and randomization. Each chapter in the first part of the book is devoted to a single algorithmic technique, which is then applied to several different problems. The second part revisits the techniques but offers more sophisticated treatments of them. The book also covers methods for proving that optimization problems are hard to approximate. Designed as a textbook for graduate-level algorithms courses, the book will also serve as a reference for researchers interested in the heuristic solution of discrete optimization problems.",Computers,518,N/A,0,en

Design History,Dennis P. Doordan,MIT Press,1996-03-06,"his anthology compiled from volumes 3-10 of Design Issues, includes material from areas seldom discussed in existing surveys and will facilitate the general discourse within the design community on a wide range of conceptual and methodological issues of contemporary design history. Design history has emerged in recent years as a significant field of scholarly research and critical reflection. With their interest in the conceptualization, production, and consumption of objects (large and small, unique or multiple, anonymous or signed) and environments (ephemeral or enduring, public or private), design historians investigate the multiple ways in which intentionally produced objects, environments, and experiences both shape and reflect their historical moments. This anthology compiled from volumes 3-10 of Design Issues, includes material from areas seldom discussed in existing surveys and will facilitate the general discourse within the design community on a wide range of conceptual and methodological issues of contemporary design history. Individual essays investigate various aspects of design in the modern era. They provide fresh insights on familiar figures such as Harley Earl and Norman Bel Geddes and shed new light on neglected aspects of design history such as the history of women in early American graphic design or the history of modern design in China. The essays are grouped in three broad categories: Graphic Design, Design in the American Corporate Milieu, and Design in the Context of National Experiences. Contributors David Brett, Bradford R.

Structure and Form in Design,Michael Hann,A&amp;C Black,2013-08-01,"This book provides a critical examination of structure and form in design, covering a range of topics of great value to students and practitioners engaged in any of the specialist decorative arts and design disciplines. The complexities of two-dimensional phenomena are explained and illustrated in detail, while various three-dimensional forms are also discussed. In the context of the decorative arts and design, structure is the underlying framework, and form the resultant, visible, two- or three-dimensional outcome of the creative process. Whether hidden or visually detectable in the final design, structure invariably determines whether or not a design is successful in terms of both its aesthetics and its practical performance. Hann successfully identifies various geometric concepts, and presents and discusses a number of simple guidelines to assist the creative endeavours of both accomplished and student practitioners, teachers and researchers.",Technology & Engineering,217,N/A,0,en

Accounting Irregularities in Financial Statements,Benny K.B. Kwok,Routledge,2017-05-15,"Accounting irregularities are at the heart of those kinds of frauds that hit financial statements and include misstatement, misclassification as well as misrepresentation. In essence, they involve manipulation of accounting data, description or disclosure in order to distort the true financial picture of the organization in question. This book provides an in-depth practical reference, designed for litigators, investigators, auditors, accountants and other professionals who need to understand and combat accounting irregularities and to uphold the integrity of financial statements. Regulators will find this book an essential source of ideas and references when considering reforms. Educators and students will see this book as an alternative, inspiring way of understanding accounting and how to stay alert for accounting irregularities. The first two chapters introduce the basics of accounting irregularities in the context of the financial reporting environments, and generally accepted accounting principles in the UK and Hong Kong. Perpetrators often seek ways to creating financial illusions in four common directions - selling more, costing less, owning more and owing less as discussed in Chapters 3 to 6. The seventh chapter considers various ways that perpetrators manipulate the classification and disclosure of financial statements. Chapter 8 explores three scenarios of accounting irregularities - tax evasion, theft and commercial dispute. The concluding chapter sets out the deterrents to accounting irregularities in two dimensions. At the micro-level, deterrents are implemented within the authority of the organization in question, whilst the macro-level deterrents refer to the external environment beyond the controls of any individual organization.",Business & Economics,156,N/A,0,en

Reorganizing the Factory,"Nancy Hyer, Urban Wemmerlov",CRC Press,2001-10-22,"Winner of the 2003 Shingo Prize! Reorganizing work processes into cells has helped many organizations streamline operations, shorten lead times, increase quality, and lower costs. Cellular manufacturing is a powerful concept that is simple to understand; however, its ultimate success depends on deciding where cells fit into your organization, and then applying the know-how to design, implement and operate them. Reorganizing the Factory presents a thoroughly researched and comprehensive ""life cycle"" approach to competing through cellular work organizations. It takes you from the basic cell concept and its benefits through the process of justifying, designing, implementing, operating, and improving this new type of work organization in offices and on the factory floor. The book discusses many important technical dimensions, such as factory analysis, cell design, planning and control systems, and principles for lead time and inventory reduction. However, unique to the literature, it also covers in depth the numerous managerial issues that accompany organizing work into cells. In most implementations, performance measurement, compensation, education and training, employee involvement, and change management are critically important. These issues are often overlooked in the planning process, yet they can occupy more of the implementation time than do the technical aspects of cells. Includes: Why do cells improve lead time, quality, and cost? Planning for cell implementation Justifying the move to cells, strategically and economically Designing efficient manufacturing and office cells Selecting and training cell employees Compensation system for cell employees Performance and cost measurement Planning and control of materials and capacity Managing the change to cells Problems in designing, implementing, and operating cells Improving and adapting existing cells Structured frameworks and checklists to help analysis and decision-making Numerous examples of cells in various industries",Business & Economics,788,5,1,en
Jan Van Toorn,Rick Poynor,010 Publishers,2008,"Jan van Toorn is one of the most significant and influential Dutch graphic designers to have emerged since the early 1960s. His designs persistently call attention to their status as visual contrivances, obliging the viewer to make an effort to process their complexities. Van Toorn wants the public to measure the motives of both the client and the designer who mediates the client's message against their own experiences of the world. He hoped in this way to stimulate a more active and skeptical view of art, communication, media ownership and society. Projects such as Van Toorn's posters and catalogues for the Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven and his long-running series of calendars for the printing firm Mart.Spruijt are powerful demonstrations of graphic design used as a means of commentary and as a tool of critique. Later, as director of the Jan van Eyck Academy, Van Toorn drew together all the strands of his critical practice into a multi-levelled educational initiative that urged designers to think harder about design's role in shaping contemporary reality.",Commercial art,240,N/A,0,en

Design for Health,"Emmanuel Tsekleves, Rachel Cooper",Taylor & Francis,2017-05-18,"One of the most complex global challenges is improving wellbeing and developing strategies for promoting health or preventing ‘illbeing’ of the population. The role of designers in indirectly supporting the promotion of healthy lifestyles or in their contribution to illbeing has emerged. This means designers now need to consider, both morally and ethically, how they can ensure that they ‘do no harm’ and that they might deliberately decide to promote healthy lifestyles and therefore prevent ill health. Design for Health illustrates the history of the development of design for health, the various design disciplines and domains to which design has contributed. Through 26 case studies presented in this book, the authors reveal a plethora of design research methodologies and research methods employed in design for health. The editors also present, following a thematic analysis of the book chapters, seven challenges and seven areas of opportunity that designers are called upon to address within the context of healthcare. Furthermore, five emergent trends in design in healthcare are presented and discussed. This book will be of interest to students of design as well as designers and those working to improve the quality of healthcare.",Design,439,N/A,0,en

Design and Nature,"Kate Fletcher, Louise St. Pierre, Mathilda Tham",Routledge,2019-09-09,"Organised as a dialogue between nature and design, this book explores design ideas, opportunities, visions and practices through relating and uncovering experience of the natural world. Presented as an edited collection of 25 wide-ranging short chapters, the book explores the possibility of new relations between design and nature, beyond human mastery and understandings of nature as resource and by calling into question the longstanding role for design as agent of capitalism. The book puts forward ways in which design can form partnerships with living species and examines designers’ capacities for direct experience, awe, integrated relationships and new ways of knowing. It covers: • New design ethics of care • Indigenous perspectives • Prototyping with nature • Methods for new design and nature relations • A history of design and nature • Animist beliefs • De-centering human-centered design • Understanding nature has power and agency Design and Nature: A Partnership is a rich resource for designers who wish to learn to engage with sustainability from the ground up.",Design,329,N/A,0,en

The Design Experience,"Mike Press, Rachel Cooper",Routledge,2017-03-02,"How are we to understand the changing role of design and designers in the new age of consumer experience? Drawing on perspectives from cultural studies, design management, marketing, new product development and communications theory, The Design Experience explores the contexts, practices and roles of designers in today's world, providing an accessible introduction to the key issues reshaping design. The book begins by analysing how consumers acquire meaning and identity from product and other experiences made possible by design. It then explores issues of competitiveness, innovation and management in the context of industry and commerce. If designers are creators of human experiences, what does this mean for their future role in culture and commerce? Subsequent chapters look at new ways in which designers conduct user research and how designers should communicate about design and decision-making with key stakeholders. The authors conclude with a discussion of the design 'profession': will that label be a help or hindrance for tomorrow's designer? Written for students of design, design management, cultural and business studies, The Design Experience is also of interest to practitioners of design, marketing and management. Illustrated case study material is integrated into the text, and the book also includes a glossary, and extensive references.",Business & Economics,250,N/A,0,en

Statistical Design for Research,Leslie Kish,Wiley,1987-03-11,"The Wiley Classics Library consists of selected books that have become recognized classics in their respective fields. With these new unabridged and inexpensive editions, Wiley hopes to extend the life of these important works by making them available to future generations of mathematicians and scientists. This title addresses those basic aspects of research design which are common to many related fields in the social sciences, health sciences, education, and market research. The work presents a unified approach to a common core of problems of statistical design that exists in all these fields, along with basic similarities in practical solutions. Describing many examples and analogies that are 'portable' from application field to application field, Statistical Design for Research deals with designs that are the primary basis of research studies, but are neglected in most statistical textbooks that tend to concentrate on statistical analysis. This text takes a broader, more general and philosophical view of the statistics for the more fundamental aspects of design than do the standard treatments of experimental design. Extensively illustrated and carefully organized into seven chapters and 44 sections, this book can be readily consulted by research workers or graduate students!",Mathematics,304,N/A,0,en

Low Power Digital CMOS Design,"Anantha P. Chandrakasan, Robert W. Brodersen",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Power consumption has become a major design consideration for battery-operated, portable systems as well as high-performance, desktop systems. Strict limitations on power dissipation must be met by the designer while still meeting ever higher computational requirements. A comprehensive approach is thus required at all levels of system design, ranging from algorithms and architectures to the logic styles and the underlying technology. Potentially one of the most important techniques involves combining architecture optimization with voltage scaling, allowing a trade-off between silicon area and low-power operation. Architectural optimization enables supply voltages of the order of 1 V using standard CMOS technology. Several techniques can also be used to minimize the switched capacitance, including representation, optimizing signal correlations, minimizing spurious transitions, optimizing sequencing of operations, activity-driven power down, etc. The high- efficiency of DC-DC converter circuitry required for efficient, low-voltage and low-current level operation is described by Stratakos, Sullivan and Sanders. The application of various low-power techniques to a chip set for multimedia applications shows that orders-of-magnitude reduction in power consumption is possible. The book also features an analysis by Professor Meindl of the fundamental limits of power consumption achievable at all levels of the design hierarchy. Svensson, of ISI, describes emerging adiabatic switching techniques that can break the CV2f barrier and reduce the energy per computation at a fixed voltage. Srivastava, of AT&T, presents the application of aggressive shut-down techniques to microprocessor applications.",Technology & Engineering,419,N/A,0,en

School Design Together,Pamela Woolner,Routledge,2014-07-17,"The time is ripe for interdisciplinary, collaborative approaches to school design. Whatever the current funding limitations, we still need to think about how we design, organise and use space in schools for learning and teaching. This edited book ensures that we don’t start from ground zero in terms of good design. Including chapters from researchers and practitioners in architecture and education, it assesses, describes and illustrates how education and environment can be mutually supportive. The centrality of participation and collaboration between architects, educators and school users holds these diverse contributions together. The book embodies the practice as well as the principle of interdisciplinary working. Organised in two parts, this volume considers how schools are designed and used with chapters looks at current and past school environments in the UK, US and Europe. It then questions how the learning environment can be improved through participatory design processes with contributors from design and education backgrounds offering both theoretical understanding and practical ideas. Written without subject-specific jargon or assumptions, it can be used by readers from either an architectural or educational background, bridging the on-going communication gap between education and design professionals. Design and education professionals alike will appreciate the: • practical information which shows how to change or improve a learning environment • focus on evidence-based research • case studies and chapter topics including schools from across the primary and secondary sectors.",Architecture,227,N/A,0,en

Suh, Ralph & Eloise F Cross Professor and Head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering Nam Pyo Suh",Oxford University Press on Demand,1990,"Here is a basic introduction to the principles of industrial design and their application in all phases of planning and production. It is intended to offer experienced instruction, based on scientific knowledge, in place of the intuitive approach to the field often encountered in engineering practice and education. The book presents basic principles and constitutes an exposition of these fundamental axioms and their application. The emphasis is on identifying problems in a clear, scientific manner, so that the correct solution may be arrived at regardless of the mathematical treatment involved. In particular, the importance of conceptualizing design approaches--a uniquely human, intellectual skill--is highlighted, since too often educators and engineers try to limit this process to computer techniques. Case studies are extensively presented to illustrate the significance as well as the use of the axioms in solving real problems. The work is based on extensive experience at M.I.T's Laboratory for Manufacturing and Productivity, where axiomatics is a major program. The goal of the program is to bring a scientific approach to the decision-making process related to manufacturing--an approach that facilitates rational design of processes and products, as well as the optimization of manufacturing systems.",Technology & Engineering,401,N/A,0,en

The Routledge Companion to Design Studies,"Penny Sparke, Fiona Fisher",Routledge,2016-06-17,"Since the 1990s, in response to dramatic transformations in the worlds of technology and the economy, design - a once relatively definable discipline, complete with a set of sub-disciplines - has become unrecognizable. Consequently, design scholars have begun to address new issues, themes and sub-disciplines such as: sustainable design, design for well-being, empathic design, design activism, design anthropology, and many more. The Routledge Companion to Design Studies charts this new expanded spectrum and embraces the wide range of scholarship relating to design - theoretical, practice-related and historical - that has emerged over the last four decades. Comprised of forty-three newly-commissioned essays, the Companion is organized into the following six sections: Defining Design: Discipline, Process Defining Design: Objects, Spaces Designing Identities: Gender, Sexuality, Age, Nation Designing Society: Empathy, Responsibility, Consumption, the Everyday Design and Politics: Activism, Intervention, Regulation Designing the World: Globalization, Transnationalism, Translation Contributors include both established and emerging scholars and the essays offer an international scope, covering work emanating from, and relating to, design in the United Kingdom, mainland Europe, North America, Asia, Australasia and Africa.

The Politics of Design in French Colonial Urbanism,Gwendolyn Wright,University of Chicago Press,1991,"Politics and culture are at once semi-autonomous and intertwined. Nowhere is this more revealingly illustrated than in urban design, a field that encompasses architecture and social life, traditions and modernization. Here aesthetic goals and political intentions meet, sometimes in collaboration, sometimes in conflict. Here the formal qualities of art confront the complexities of history. When urban design policies are implemented, they reveal underlying aesthetic, cultural, and political dilemmas with startling clarity. Gwendolyn Wright focuses on three French colonies--Indochina, Morocco, and Madagascar--that were the most discussed, most often photographed, and most admired showpieces of the French empire in the early twentieth century. She explores how urban policy and design fit into the French colonial policy of ""association,"" a strategy that accepted, even encouraged, cultural differences while it promoted modern urban improvements that would foster economic development for Western investors. Wright shows how these colonial cities evolved, tracing the distinctive nature of each locale under French imperialism. She also relates these cities to the larger category of French architecture and urbanism, showing how consistently the French tried to resolve certain stylistic and policy problems they faced at home and abroad. With the advice of architects and sociologists, art historians and geographers, colonial administrators sought to exert greater control over such matters as family life and working conditions, industrial growth and cultural memory. The issues Wright confronts--the potent implications of traditional norms, cultural continuity, modernization, and radical urban experiments--still challenge us today.",Architecture,400,N/A,0,en

Retail Design,"Ann Petermans, Anthony Kent",Taylor & Francis,2016-12-01,"The late twentieth century saw rapid growth in consumption and the expansion of retailing and services. This was reflected in the number and type of stores and locations, from regional shopping malls and out-of-town superstores to concept and flagship stores. Retail design became an essential part of its success by creating distinctive brands and formats. However, the economic recession in the developed world and competition for consumer goods from the developing world has led to a re-assessment of the growth-led conventions of the retail industry. In addition, the rapid advance of e-commerce and online shopping has created new challenges for physical stores and the communication and distribution of retail brands. The book will provide students, researchers and practitioners a detailed assessment of retail design, taking a distinctive global approach to place design practice and theory in context. Chapters are devoted to key issues in the visual and structural contribution of design to retail brands and format development, and to the role of design in communication. In the course of the book, the authors engage with problems of convergence between retailing and other services and between the physical and virtual worlds, and also changing patterns of use, re-use and ownership of retail spaces and buildings. Retail Design concerns designers and organisations but also defines its broader contribution to society, culture and economy.",Business & Economics,247,N/A,0,en

The book initially provides a review of the nature and sources of non-point source P pollution, examines short and long term solutions to the problem, and provides detailed theory on design and operation of the P removal structure. As with many areas of study, one of the best methods of communicating concepts is through illustrations and examples. This book is no exception; several years of experience in studying P sorption and constructing P removal structures at multiple scales and settings is utilized for providing real examples and applications. With an understanding of the P removal structure established, the reader is instructed on how to obtain all of the necessary inputs for properly designing a site-specific P removal structure for meeting a desired lifetime and performance, or predict the performance and lifetime of a previously constructed P removal structure. For the readers who already possess the Phrog design software or are interested in obtaining it, one chapter is dedicated to detailed use of the software as demonstrated with various examples of structure design and also prediction.",Technology & Engineering,242,N/A,0,en

A permutation is an ordered arrangement of elements in a set. In our case, the set is design and the elements are design components, such as lines, shapes, forms, or spaces. Traditionally, such arrangements are done by human designers who base their decision-making process either on intuition or on random sampling until a valid solution is found. However, in both cases the solution found may be an acceptable one but cannot be labeled as ""the best possible solution"" due to the subjective or arbitrary nature of the selection process. In contrast, by harnessing the potential of computational design, these elements can be arranged in all possible ways and then the best ones are chosen based on specific criteria. By presenting a complete list of permutation-based arrangements the ""best solution"" will eventually reveal itself by excluding all other possible solutions. This book comprehensively addresses theories, techniques, and examples of permutation design in order to fully demonstrate to the reader the full range of possibilities this method represents. The significance of such an approach to design is enormous, paradigmatic, and far-reaching. It provides an alternative method for design analysis, synthesis, and evaluation that is based on computational force rather than pure human intelligence alone. In contrast to human-based random sampling or intuition, permutation-based design offers the assurance of an optimum design since any possible alternative design can be eliminated. From a practical point of view, this methodology offers a paradigmatic shift away from the current state of design practice where arbitrariness, repetition, and redundancy often exist. From a theoretical viewpoint, this new paradigm will offer alternative insights into the value of human creativity, intuition, and intelligence.",Architecture,283,N/A,0,en

Design + Anthropology,Christine Miller,Routledge,2017-11-22,"This book explores the evolution of two disciplines, design and anthropology, and their convergence within commercial and organizational arenas. Focusing on the transdisciplinary field of design anthropology, the chapters cover the global forces and conditions that facilitated its emergence, the people that have contributed to its development and those who are likely to shape its future. Christine Miller touches on the invention and diffusion of new practices, the recontextualization of ethnographic inquiry within design and innovations in applications of anthropological theory and methodology. She considers how encounters between anthropology and ‘designerly’ practice have impacted the evolution of both disciplines. The book provides students, scholars and practitioners with valuable insight into the movement to formalize the nascent field of design anthropology and how the relationship between the two fields might develop in the future given the dynamic global forces that continue to impact them both.",Social Science,196,N/A,0,en

Building Successful Online Communities,"Robert E. Kraut, Paul Resnick",MIT Press,2016-02-12,"How insights from the social sciences, including social psychology and economics, can improve the design of online communities. Online communities are among the most popular destinations on the Internet, but not all online communities are equally successful. For every flourishing Facebook, there is a moribund Friendster—not to mention the scores of smaller social networking sites that never attracted enough members to be viable. This book offers lessons from theory and empirical research in the social sciences that can help improve the design of online communities. The authors draw on the literature in psychology, economics, and other social sciences, as well as their own research, translating general findings into useful design claims. They explain, for example, how to encourage information contributions based on the theory of public goods, and how to build members' commitment based on theories of interpersonal bond formation. For each design claim, they offer supporting evidence from theory, experiments, or observational studies.",Social Science,323,N/A,0,en

Philosophy in Experience,"Richard E. Hart, Douglas R. Anderson",N/A,1997,"This collection of essays aims to mark a place for American philosophy as it moves into the twenty-first century. Taking their cue from the work of Peirce, James, Santayana, Dewey, Mead, Buchler, and others, the contributors assess and employ philosophy as an activity taking place within experience and culture. Within the broad background of the American tradition, the essays reveal a variety of approaches to the transition in which American philosophy is currently engaged. Some of the pieces argue from an historical dialogue with the tradition, some are more polemically involved with American philosophy's current status among the contemporary philosophical ""schools"", and still others seek to reveal the possibilities for the future of American philosophy. In thus addressing past, present, and future, the pieces, taken together, outline a trajectory for American philosophy that reinvests its importance from a new angle of vision.",Philosophy,304,N/A,0,en
The Design of Design,Frederick P. Brooks Jr.,Pearson Education,2010-03-22,"Making Sense of Design Effective design is at the heart of everything from software development to engineering to architecture. But what do we really know about the design process? What leads to effective, elegant designs? The Design of Design addresses these questions. These new essays by Fred Brooks contain extraordinary insights for designers in every discipline. Brooks pinpoints constants inherent in all design projects and uncovers processes and patterns likely to lead to excellence. Drawing on conversations with dozens of exceptional designers, as well as his own experiences in several design domains, Brooks observes that bold design decisions lead to better outcomes. The author tracks the evolution of the design process, treats collaborative and distributed design, and illuminates what makes a truly great designer. He examines the nuts and bolts of design processes, including budget constraints of many kinds, aesthetics, design empiricism, and tools, and grounds this discussion in his own real-world examples—case studies ranging from home construction to IBM’s Operating System/360. Throughout, Brooks reveals keys to success that every designer, design project manager, and design researcher should know.",Computers,549,N/A,0,en

Discovering Cultural Psychology,"Ernst Eduard Boesch, Walter J. Lonner, Susanna A. Hayes",Information Age Publishing,2007,"This book is a landmark in contemporary cultural psychology. Ernest Boesch's synthesis of ideas is the first comprehensive theory of culture in psychology since Wilhelm Wundt's Völkerpsychologie of the first decades of the twentieth century. Cultural psychology of today is an attempt to advance the program of research that was charted out by Wundt-yet at times we are carefully avoiding direct recognition of such continuity. While Wundt's experimental psychology has been hailed as the root for contemporary scientific psychology, the other side of his contribution- ethnographic analysis of folk traditions and higher psychological functions- has been largely discredited as something disconnected from the scientific realm. As an example of ""soft"" science-lacking the ""hardness"" of experimentation-it has been considered to be an esoteric hobby of the founding father of contemporary psychology. Of course that focus is profoundly wrong-the opposition ""soft"" versus ""hard"" just does not fit as a metalevel organizer of any science. Yet the rhetoric discounting the descriptive side of Wundt's psychology is merely an act of social guidance of what psychologists do-not a way of creating knowledge.",Education,434,N/A,0,en

Voice User Interface Design,"Michael Harris Cohen, James P. Giangola, Jennifer Balogh",Addison-Wesley Professional,2004,"This book is a comprehensive and authoritative guide to voice user interface (VUI) design. The VUI is perhaps the most critical factor in the success of any automated speech recognition (ASR) system, determining whether the user experience will be satisfying or frustrating, or even whether the customer will remain one. This book describes a practical methodology for creating an effective VUI design. The methodology is scientifically based on principles in linguistics, psychology, and language technology, and is illustrated here by examples drawn from the authors' work at Nuance Communications, the market leader in ASR development and deployment. The book begins with an overview of VUI design issues and a description of the technology. The authors then introduce the major phases of their methodology. They first show how to specify requirements and make high-level design decisions during the definition phase. They next cover, in great detail, the design phase, with clear explanations and demonstrations of each design principle and its real-world applications. Finally, they examine problems unique to VUI design in system development, testing, and tuning. Key principles are illustrated with a running sample application. A companion Web site provides audio clips for each example: www.VUIDesign.org The cover photograph depicts the first ASR system, Radio Rex: a toy dog who sits in his house until the sound of his name calls him out. Produced in 1911, Rex was among the few commercial successes in earlier days of speech recognition.

The Poster,Ruth E. Iskin,Dartmouth College Press,2014-10-07,"The Poster: Art, Advertising, Design, and Collecting, 1860sÐ1900s is a cultural history that situates the poster at the crossroads of art, design, advertising, and collecting. Though international in scope, the book focuses especially on France and England. Ruth E. Iskin argues that the avant-garde poster and the original art print played an important role in the development of a modernist language of art in the 1890s, as well as in the adaptation of art to an era of mass media. She moreover contends that this new form of visual communication fundamentally redefined relations between word and image: poster designers embedded words within the graphic, rather than using images to illustrate a text. Posters had to function as effective advertising in the hectic environment of the urban street. Even though initially commissioned as advertisements, they were soon coveted by collectors. Iskin introduces readers to the late nineteenth-century ÒiconophileÓÑa new type of collector/curator/archivist who discovered in poster collecting an ephemeral archaeology of modernity. Bridging the separation between the fields of art, design, advertising, and collecting, IskinÕs insightful study proposes that the poster played a constitutive role in the modern culture of spectacle. This stunningly illustrated book will appeal to art historians and students of visual culture, as well as social and cultural history, media, design, and advertising.",Art,465,N/A,0,en

The Grand Design,Oliver P. Richmond,Oxford University Press,2022-05-10,"The guiding principle of peacebuilding over the past quarter century has been ""liberal peace"": the promotion of democracy, capitalism, and respect for human rights in an effort to prevent a reoccurrence of the nationalism, fascism, and economic collapse that led to World War II. This tactichas been relatively successful in reducing war between countries, but it has failed to produce lasting peace at the local level. The goals of peacebuilding have changed over time and place, but have always been built around intervention, with the goal of creating ""progress"" in post-conflictcountries.As Oliver P. Richmond argues in this book, the concept of peace connects the imperial era with the liberal era, and now, neoliberal eras of states and markets, and perhaps with the developing era of technology and mobility. But recent studies have shown that only a minority of modern peaceagreements survive for more than a few years. All of this begs the question of the legitimacy and effectiveness of the liberal peace agenda, particularly for scholars looking at the historical development, justifications, and tools for intervention.This book examines the development of the ""grand design"" and various subsequent attempts to develop a peaceful international order, and its implications for the current international peace architecture. Richmond examines six main theoretical-historical stages in this process, which have produced asubstantial, though fragile, international peace architecture, always entangled with, and hindered by, what might be described as a counter-peace framework. He contends that post-WWII liberal peace, which has aimed to balance liberty with regulation through law, democracy, human rights, and freetrade, has recently given way to a retrogressive, technologically driven neoliberal peace, which is more oriented towards free trade, counter-terrorism and insurgency, surveillance, and state security. The Grand Design provides a sweeping look at the troubled history of peacebuilding in order toconsider what the next-stage, ""post-liberal peace,"" might look like.",Political Science,321,N/A,0,en

Power to the People,Geoff Kaplan,University of Chicago Press,2013-05-15,"Though we think of the 1960s and the early ‘70s as a time of radical social, cultural, and political upheaval, we tend to picture the action as happening on campuses and in the streets. Yet the rise of the underground newspaper was equally daring and original. Thanks to advances in cheap offset printing, groups involved in antiwar, civil rights, and other social liberation issues began to spread their messages through provocatively designed newspapers and broadsheets. This vibrant new media was essential to the counterculture revolution as a whole—helping to motivate the masses and proliferate ideas. Power to the People presents more than 700 full-color images and excerpts from these astonishing publications, many of which have not been seen since they were first published almost fifty years ago. From the psychedelic pages of the Oracle, Haight-Ashbury’s paper of choice, to the fiery editorials of the Black Panther Party Paper, these papers were remarkable for their editors’ fervent belief in freedom of expression and their DIY philosophy. They were also extraordinary for their graphic innovations. Experimental typography and wildly inventive layouts reflect an alternative media culture as much informed by the space age, television, and socialism as it was by the great trinity of sex, drugs, and rock ‘n’ roll. Assembled by renowned graphic designer Geoff Kaplan, Power to the People pays homage in its layout to the radical press. Beyond its unparalleled images, Power to the People includes essays by Gwen Allen, Bob Ostertag, and Fred Turner, as well as a series of recollections edited by Pamela M. Lee, all of which comment on the critical impact of the alternative press in the social and popular movements of those turbulent years. Power to the People treats the design practices of that moment as activism in its own right that offers a vehement challenge to the dominance of official media and a critical form of self-representation. No other book surveys in such variety the highly innovative graphic design of the underground press, and certainly no other book captures the era with such an unmatched eye toward its aesthetic and look. Power to the People is not just a major compendium of art from the ’60s and ’70s—it showcases how the radical media graphically fashioned the image of a countercultural revolution that still resounds to this day.",Art,265,N/A,0,en

The Politics of the Artificial,Victor Margolin,University of Chicago Press,2018-01-11,"Emerging from the world of commercial art and product styling, design has now become completely integrated into human life. Its marks are all around us, from the chairs we sit on to the Web sites on our computer screens. One of the pioneers of design studies and still one of its most distinguished practitioners, Victor Margolin here offers a timely meditation on design and its study at the turn of the millennium and charts new directions for the future development of both fields. Divided into sections on the practice and study of design, the essays in The Politics of the Artificial cover such topics as design history, design research, design as a political tool, sustainable design, and the problems of design's relation to advanced technologies. Margolin also examines the work of key practitioners such as the matrix designer Ken Isaacs. Throughout the book Margolin demonstrates the underlying connections between the many ways of reflecting on and practicing design. He argues for the creation of an international, interdisciplinary field of design research and proposes a new ethical agenda for designers and researchers that encompasses the responsibility to users, the problems of sustainability, and the complicated questions of how to set boundaries for applying advanced technology to solve the problems of human life. Opinionated and erudite, Victor Margolin's The Politics of the Artificial breaks fresh ground in its call for a new approach to design research and practice.

The Culture of Nature in the History of Design,Kjetil Fallan,Routledge,2019-03-26,"The Culture of Nature in the History of Design confronts the dilemma caused by design’s pertinent yet precarious position in environmental discourse through interdisciplinary conversations about the design of nature and the nature of design. Demonstrating that the deep entanglements of design and nature have a deeper and broader history than contemporary discourse on sustainable design and ecological design might imply, this book presents case studies ranging from the eighteenth to the twenty-first century and from Singapore to Mexico. It gathers scholarship on a broad range of fields/practices, from urban planning, landscape architecture, and architecture, to engineering design, industrial design, furniture design and graphic design. From adobe architecture to the atomic bomb, from the bonsai tree to Biosphere 2, from pesticides to photovoltaics, from rust to recycling – the culture of nature permeates the history of design. As an activity and a profession always operating in the borderlands between human and non-human environments, design has always been part of the environmental problem, whilst also being an indispensable part of the solution. The book ventures into domains as diverse as design theory, research, pedagogy, politics, activism, organizations, exhibitions, and fiction and trade literature to explore how design is constantly making and unmaking the environment and, conversely, how the environment is both making and unmaking design. This book will be of great interest to a range of scholarly fields, from design education and design history to environmental policy and environmental history.",Design,275,N/A,0,en

Meeting,New York : Agathon Press,1986,"If at one time we thought that the movement to science would yield unification of the discipline, it is now apparent that there are many roads to science. Still, it is important for us to consider yet again what the appropriate goals are for our scientific enterprise. What works in theory building; induction and deduction; prediction and control; the search for useful principles to guide us examining these questions, we can build a better science. Political science has come so far as a discipline that different schools and scholars have different interpretations of science in the study of politics, and that diversity is important to maintain. Advances made in the study of political institutions and behavior are described in 12 essays from the 1983 annual meeting of the American Political Science Association. They do not employ any single approach to the study of the science of politics.

IUTAM Symposium on the Vibration Analysis of Structures with Uncertainties,"Alexander K. Belyaev, Robin S. Langley",Springer Science & Business Media,2010-12-02,"The Symposium was aimed at the theoretical and numerical problems involved in modelling the dynamic response of structures which have uncertain properties due to variability in the manufacturing and assembly process, with automotive and aerospace structures forming prime examples. It is well known that the difficulty in predicting the response statistics of such structures is immense, due to the complexity of the structure, the large number of variables which might be uncertain, and the inevitable lack of data regarding the statistical distribution of these variables. The Symposium participants presented the latest thinking in this very active research area, and novel techniques were presented covering the full frequency spectrum of low, mid, and high frequency vibration problems. It was demonstrated that for high frequency vibrations the response statistics can saturate and become independent of the detailed distribution of the uncertain system parameters. A number of presentations exploited this physical behaviour by using and extending methods originally developed in both phenomenological thermodynamics and in the fields of quantum mechanics and random matrix theory. For low frequency vibrations a number of presentations focussed on parametric uncertainty modelling (for example, probabilistic models, interval analysis, and fuzzy descriptions) and on methods of propagating this uncertainty through a large dynamic model in an effi cient way. At mid frequencies the problem is mixed, and various hybrid schemes were proposed. It is clear that a comprehensive solution to the problem of predicting the vibration response of uncertain structures across the whole frequency range requires expertise across a wide range of areas (including probabilistic and non-probabilistic methods, interval and info-gap analysis, statistical energy analysis, statistical thermodynamics, random wave approaches, and large scale computations) and this IUTAM symposium presented a unique opportunity to bring together outstanding international experts in these fields.",Technology & Engineering,471,N/A,0,en

Seismic Resistant Steel Structures,"Federico M. Mazzolani, Victor Gioncu",Springer,2014-05-04,"The catastrophic earthquakes of the last decades (Mexico City, 1985; Loma Prieta, 1989; Northridge, 1994; Kobe, 1995) have seriously undermined there putation of steel structures, which in the past represented the most suitable solution for seismic resistant structures. Even if in very few cases, the performance of steel joints and members was unexpectedly bad, showing that it was due to some lacks in the current design concept. As a consequence of the lessons learned from the above dramatic events, many progress has been recently achieved in the conception, design and construction, by introducing the new deals of the performance based design, including the differentiation of earthquaketypes and considering all factor influencing the steel structure behaviour under strong ground motions. In this scenario, the aim of the book is to transfer the most recent achievements into practical rules for a safe design of seismic resistant steel structures. The seven Chapters cover the basic principles and design criteria for seismic resistant steel structures, which are applied to the main structural typologies, like moment resistant frames, braced frames and composite structures with particular reference to connections and details.",Science,403,N/A,0,en

River Flow 2016,"George Constantinescu, Marcelo Garcia, Dan Hanes",CRC Press,2016-06-22,"Understanding and being able to predict fluvial processes is one of the biggest challenges for hydraulics and environmental engineers, hydrologists and other scientists interested in preserving and restoring the diverse functions of rivers. The interactions among flow, turbulence, vegetation, macroinvertebrates and other organisms, as well as the transport and retention of particulate matter, have important consequences on the ecological health of rivers. Managing rivers in an ecologically friendly way is a major component of sustainable engineering design, maintenance and restoration of ecological habitats. To address these challenges, a major focus of River Flow 2016 was to highlight the latest advances in experimental, computational and theoretical approaches that can be used to deepen our understanding and capacity to predict flow and the associated fluid-driven ecological processes, anthropogenic influences, sediment transport and morphodynamic processes. River Flow 2016 was organized under the auspices of the Committee for Fluvial Hydraulics of the International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research (IAHR). Since its first edition in 2002, the River Flow conference series has become the main international event focusing on river hydrodynamics, sediment transport, river engineering and restoration. Some of the highlights of the 8th International Conference on Fluvial Hydraulics were to focus on inter-disciplinary research involving, among others, ecological and biological aspects relevant to river flows and processes and to emphasize broader themes dealing with river sustainability. River Flow 2016 contains the contributions presented during the regular sessions covering the main conference themes and the special sessions focusing on specific hot topics of river flow research, and will be of interest to academics interested in hydraulics, hydrology and environmental engineering.",Technology & Engineering,2439,N/A,0,en

Hydrology and Water Supply for Pond Aquaculture,"Kyung H. Yoo, Claude E. Boyd",Springer Science & Business Media,1994-01-31,"In 1979, several graduate students in the Department of Fisheries and Allied Aquacultures at Auburn University met with one of the authors (CEB) and asked him to teach a new course on water supply for aqua culture. They felt that information on climatology, hydrology, water distribution systems, pumps, and wells would be valuable to them. Most of these students were planning to work in commercial aquaculture in the United States or abroad, and they thought that such a cdurse would better prepare them to plan aquaculture projects and to communicate with engineers, contractors, and other specialists who often become involved in the planning and construction phases of aquaculture en deavors. The course was developed, and after a few years it was decided that more effective presentation of some of the material could be made by an engineer. The other author (KHY) accepted the challenge, and three courses on the water supply aspects of aquaculture are now offered at Auburn University. A course providing background in hydrology is followed by courses on selected topics from water supply engineering. Most graduate programs in aquaculture at other universities will even tually include similar coursework, because students need a formal intro duction to this important, yet somewhat neglected, part of aquaculture. We have written this book to serve as a text for a course in water supply for aquaculture or for individual study. The book is divided into is concerned two parts.",Science,520,N/A,0,en

High Performance Control,"Teng-Tiow Tay, Iven Mareels, John B. Moore",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The engineering objective of high performance control using the tools of optimal control theory, robust control theory, and adaptive control theory is more achiev able now than ever before, and the need has never been greater. Of course, when we use the term high peiformance control we are thinking of achieving this in the real world with all its complexity, uncertainty and variability. Since we do not expect to always achieve our desires, a more complete title for this book could be ""Towards High Performance Control"". To illustrate our task, consider as an example a disk drive tracking system for a portable computer. The better the controller performance in the presence of eccen tricity uncertainties and external disturbances, such as vibrations when operated in a moving vehicle, the more tracks can be used on the disk and the more memory it has. Many systems today are control system limited and the quest is for high performance in the real world.",Mathematics,359,N/A,0,en
Design Charts for Open-channel Flow,United States. Federal Highway Administration,N/A,1979,"The design of a highway drainage channel to carry a given discharge is accomplished in two parts. The first part of the design involves the computation of a channel section which will carry the design discharge on the available slope. This chapter briefly discusses the principles of flow in open channels and the use of the Manning equation for computing the channel capacity. The second part of the design is the determination of the degree of protection required to prevent erosion in the drainage channel. This can be done by computing the velocity in the channel at the design discharge, using the Manning equation, and comparing the calculated velocity with that permissible for the type of channel lining used. A change in the type of channel lining will require a change in channel size unless both linings have the same roughness coefficient.",Channels (Hydraulic engineering),116,N/A,0,en

Intelligent Energy Field Manufacturing,Wenwu Zhang,CRC Press,2018-10-03,"Edited by prominent researchers and with contributions from experts in their individual areas, Intelligent Energy Field Manufacturing: Interdisciplinary Process Innovations explores a new philosophy of engineering. An in-depth introduction to Intelligent Energy Field Manufacturing (EFM), this book explores a fresh engineering methodology that not only integrates but goes beyond methodologies such as Design for Six Sigma, Lean Manufacturing, Concurrent Engineering, TRIZ, green and sustainable manufacturing, and more. This book gives a systematic introduction to classic non-mechanical manufacturing processes as well as offering big pictures of some technical frontiers in modern engineering. The book suggests that any manufacturing process is actually a process of injecting human intelligence into the interaction between material and the various energy fields in order to transfer the material into desired configurations. It discusses technological innovation, dynamic M-PIE flows, the generalities of energy fields, logic functional materials and intelligence, the open scheme of intelligent EFM implementation, and the principles of intelligent EFM. The book takes a highly interdisciplinary approach that includes research frontiers such as micro/nano fabrication, high strain rate processes, laser shock forming, materials science and engineering, bioengineering, etc., in addition to a detailed treatment of the so called ""non-traditional"" manufacturing processes, which covers waterjet machining, laser material processing, ultrasonic material processing, EDM/ECM, etc. Filled with illustrative pictures, figures, and tables that make technical materials more absorbable, the book cuts across multiple engineering disciplines. The majority of books in this area report the facts of proven knowledge, while the behind-the-scenes thinking is usually neglected. This book examines the big picture of manufacturing in depth before diving into the deta",Technology & Engineering,987,N/A,0,en

Moufang Loops and Groups with Triality are Essentially the Same Thing,J. I. Hall,American Mathematical Soc.,2019-09-05,"In 1925 Élie Cartan introduced the principal of triality specifically for the Lie groups of type D4, and in 1935 Ruth Moufang initiated the study of Moufang loops. The observation of the title in 1978 was made by Stephen Doro, who was in turn motivated by the work of George Glauberman from 1968. Here the author makes the statement precise in a categorical context. In fact the most obvious categories of Moufang loops and groups with triality are not equivalent, hence the need for the word “essentially.”",Mathematics,206,N/A,0,en

3rd International Castle Meeting on Coding Theory and Applications,"Joaquim Borges, Mercè Villanueva",Univ. Autònoma de Barcelona,2011-09-05,"In 1999, a conference called International Meeting on Coding Theory and Cryptography took place at Mota Castle in Castilia (Spain). The conference had great acceptance within the community of coding theory and cryptography researchers. At that moment, and also nowadays, there are not many international workshops about these topics, at least if we compare with other mathematical and engineering subjects of research. Therefore, the general desire was to continue with more Castle Meetings. However, the following conference did not take place until 2008. In that case, the conference was called II International Castle Meeting on Coding Theory and Applications allowing more topics related to coding theory apart from cryptography. Such conference took place at Mota Castle again and the number of participants was similar to the previous edition. The present edition of the conference, called III International Castle Meeting on Coding Theory and Applications has been held at Cardona Castle in Catalonia (Spain). The number of communications has increased and a number of selected papers will be published in a special issue of the journal Designs, Codes and Cryptography.

Set in 1954, Towles uses the story of two brothers to show that our personal journeys are never as linear or predictable as we might hope.” —Bill Gates “A real joyride . . . elegantly constructed and compulsively readable.” —NPR The bestselling author of A Gentleman in Moscow and Rules of Civility and master of absorbing, sophisticated fiction returns with a stylish and propulsive novel set in 1950s America In June, 1954, eighteen-year-old Emmett Watson is driven home to Nebraska by the warden of the juvenile work farm where he has just served fifteen months for involuntary manslaughter. His mother long gone, his father recently deceased, and the family farm foreclosed upon by the bank, Emmett's intention is to pick up his eight-year-old brother, Billy, and head to California where they can start their lives anew. But when the warden drives away, Emmett discovers that two friends from the work farm have hidden themselves in the trunk of the warden's car. Together, they have hatched an altogether different plan for Emmett's future, one that will take them all on a fateful journey in the opposite direction—to the City of New York. Spanning just ten days and told from multiple points of view, Towles's third novel will satisfy fans of his multi-layered literary styling while providing them an array of new and richly imagined settings, characters, and themes. “Once again, I was wowed by Towles’s writing—especially because The Lincoln Highway is so different from A Gentleman in Moscow in terms of setting, plot, and themes. Towles is not a one-trick pony. Like all the best storytellers, he has range. He takes inspiration from famous hero’s journeys, including The Iliad, The Odyssey, Hamlet, Huckleberry Finn, and Of Mice and Men. He seems to be saying that our personal journeys are never as linear or predictable as an interstate highway. But, he suggests, when something (or someone) tries to steer us off course, it is possible to take the wheel.” – Bill Gates",Fiction,593,N/A,0,en

Creating Q*bert and Other Classic Video Arcade Games,Warren Davis,Santa Monica Press,2022-01-11,"Creating Q*bert and Other Classic Video Arcade Games takes you inside the video arcade game industry during the classic decades of the 1980s and 1990s. Warren Davis, the creator of the groundbreaking Q*bert, worked as a member of the creative teams who developed some of the most popular video games of all time, including Joust 2, Mortal Kombat, NBA Jam, and Revolution X. In a witty and entertaining narrative, Davis shares insightful stories that offer a behind-the-scenes look at what it was like to work as a designer and programmer at the most influential and dominant video arcade game manufacturers of the era, including Gottlieb, Williams/Bally/Midway, and Premiere. Likewise, the talented artists, designers, creators, and programmers Davis has collaborated with over the years reads like a who’s who of video gaming history: Eugene Jarvis, Tim Skelly, Ed Boon, Jeff Lee, Dave Thiel, John Newcomer, George Petro, Jack Haegar, and Dennis Nordman, among many others. The impact Davis has had on the video arcade game industry is deep and varied. At Williams, Davis created and maintained the revolutionary digitizing system that allowed actors and other photo-realistic imagery to be utilized in such games as Mortal Kombat, T2, and NBA Jam. When Davis worked on the fabled Us vs. Them, it was the first time a video game integrated a live action story with arcade-style graphics. On the one-of-a-kind Exterminator, Davis developed a brand new video game hardware system, and created a unique joystick that sensed both omni-directional movement and rotation, a first at that time. For Revolution X, he created a display system that simulated a pseudo-3D environment on 2D hardware, as well as a tool for artists that facilitated the building of virtual worlds and the seamless integration of the artist’s work into game code. Whether you’re looking for insights into the Golden Age of Arcades, would like to learn how Davis first discovered his design and programming skills as a teenager working with a 1960s computer called a Monrobot XI, or want to get the inside scoop on what it was like to film the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame band Aerosmith for Revolution X, Davis’s memoir provides a backstage tour of the arcade and video game industry during its most definitive and influential period.",Games & Activities,241,N/A,0,en

The Removes,Tatjana Soli,Sarah Crichton Books,2018-06-12,"As the first wave of pioneers travel westward to settle the American frontier, two women discover their inner strength when their lives are irrevocably changed by the hardship of the wild west in The Removes, a historical novel from New York Times bestselling and award-winning author Tatjana Soli. Spanning the years of the first great settlement of the West, The Removes tells the intertwining stories of fifteen-year-old Anne Cummins, frontierswoman Libbie Custer, and Libbie’s husband, the Civil War hero George Armstrong Custer. When Anne survives a surprise attack on her family’s homestead, she is thrust into a difficult life she never anticipated—living among the Cheyenne as both a captive and, eventually, a member of the tribe. Libbie, too, is thrown into a brutal, unexpected life when she marries Custer. They move to the territories with the U.S. Army, where Libbie is challenged daily and her worldview expanded: the pampered daughter of a small-town judge, she transforms into a daring camp follower. But when what Anne and Libbie have come to know—self-reliance, freedom, danger—is suddenly altered through tragedy and loss, they realize how indelibly shaped they are by life on the treacherous, extraordinary American plains. With taut, suspenseful writing, Tatjana Soli tells the exhilarating stories of Libbie and Anne, who have grown like weeds into women unwilling to be restrained by the strictures governing nineteenth-century society. The Removes is a powerful, transporting novel about the addictive intensity and freedom of the American frontier.",Fiction,385,N/A,0,en

The Prodigal Hour,Will Entrekin,N/A,2011-07-01,"""""The Prodigal Hour, the audacious, genre-bending novel by Will Entrekin, is a Rubik's Cube of delights. Equal parts sci-fi, thriller, coming-of-age, and love story, the novel hurtles readers along Chance Sowin's intriguingly unpredictable journey--forward, backward, and inward. A thrilling head rush of a book."" -Elizabeth Eslami, author of Bone Worship: A Novel ""Chance Sowin hoped only for a new beginning."" On October 31, 2001, six weeks after escaping the World Trade Center attacks, Chance Sowin moves back home, hoping for familiarity and security. Instead, he interrupts a burglary as his father, Dennis, is shot and killed. What begins as a homicide investigation escalates when the Joint Terrorism Task Force arrrives. Where he hoped for solutions, Chance finds only more questions: who killed his father, and why? Was his father-a physicist at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study-working on dangerous research? Why did Dennis build a secret laboratory in his basement? Chance might not know the answers, but Cassie Lackesis, Dennis' research assistant, thinks she does. She isn't certain that Dennis discovered a way to time travel, but she knows who told her: Chance. Together with Cassie, Chance will go on a journey across time and space that will challenge his every notion of ideas like ""right"" and ""good."" One young man's desire to make a difference will become, instead, a race against time as he tries to prevent forces he could never understand from not just destroying the universe but rendering it nonexistent. When every action has a reaction, every force its counter, Chance will find that the truest measure of his character is not what he wants but what he will do when the prodigal hour returns.",Fiction,364,N/A,0,en

How Real Estate Developers Think,Peter Hendee Brown,University of Pennsylvania Press,2015-04-07,"Cities are always changing: streets, infrastructure, public spaces, and buildings are constantly being built, improved, demolished, and replaced. But even when a new project is designed to improve a community, neighborhood residents often find themselves at odds with the real estate developer who proposes it. Savvy developers are willing to work with residents to allay their concerns and gain public support, but at the same time, a real estate development is a business venture financed by private investors who take significant risks. In How Real Estate Developers Think, Peter Hendee Brown explains the interests, motives, and actions of real estate developers, using case studies to show how the basic principles of development remain the same everywhere even as practices vary based on climate, local culture, and geography. An understanding of what developers do and why they do it will help community members, elected officials, and others participate more productively in the development process in their own communities. Based on interviews with over a hundred people involved in the real estate development business in Chicago, Miami, Portland (Oregon), and the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, How Real Estate Developers Think considers developers from three different perspectives. Brown profiles the careers of individual developers to illustrate the character of the entrepreneur, considers the roles played by innovation, design, marketing, and sales in the production of real estate, and examines the risks and rewards that motivate developers as people. Ultimately, How Real Estate Developers Think portrays developers as creative visionaries who are able to imagine future possibilities for our cities and communities and shows that understanding them will lead to better outcomes for neighbors, communities, and cities.",Business & Economics,337,N/A,0,en

The Last Good Paradise,Tatjana Soli,St. Martin's Press,2015-02-10,"From Tatjana Soli, the bestselling author of The Lotus Eaters and The Forgetting Tree, comes a black comedy set on an island resort, where guests attempting to flee their troubles realize they can't escape who they are. On a small, unnamed coral atoll in the South Pacific, a group of troubled dreamers must face the possibility that the hopes they've labored after so single-mindedly might not lead them to the happiness they feel they were promised. Ann and Richard, an aspiring, Los Angeles power couple, are already sensing the cracks in their version of the American dream when their life unexpectedly implodes, leading them to brashly run away from home to a Robinson Crusoe idyll. Dex Cooper, lead singer of the rock band, Prospero, is facing his own slide from greatness, experimenting with artistic asceticism while accompanied by his sexy, young, and increasingly entrepreneurial muse, Wende. Loren, the French owner of the resort sauvage, has made his own Gauguin-like retreat from the world years before, only to find that the modern world has become impossible to disconnect from. Titi, descendent of Tahitian royalty, worker, and eventual inheritor of the resort, must fashion a vision of the island's future that includes its indigenous people, while her partner, Cooked, is torn between anarchy and lust. By turns funny and tragic, The Last Good Paradise explores our modern, complex and often, self-contradictory discontents, crafting an exhilarating and darkly satirical story about our need to connect in an increasingly networked but isolating world.",Fiction,318,3,1,en

The Manga Guide to Databases,"Mana Takahashi, Shoko Azuma, Co Ltd Trend",No Starch Press,2009-01-15,"Want to learn about databases without the tedium? With its unique combination of Japanese-style comics and serious educational content, The Manga Guide to Databases is just the book for you. Princess Ruruna is stressed out. With the king and queen away, she has to manage the Kingdom of Kod's humongous fruit-selling empire. Overseas departments, scads of inventory, conflicting prices, and so many customers! It's all such a confusing mess. But a mysterious book and a helpful fairy promise to solve her organizational problems—with the practical magic of databases. In The Manga Guide to Databases, Tico the fairy teaches the Princess how to simplify her data management. We follow along as they design a relational database, understand the entity-relationship model, perform basic database operations, and delve into more advanced topics. Once the Princess is familiar with transactions and basic SQL statements, she can keep her data timely and accurate for the entire kingdom. Finally, Tico explains ways to make the database more efficient and secure, and they discuss methods for concurrency and replication. Examples and exercises (with answer keys) help you learn, and an appendix of frequently used SQL statements gives the tools you need to create and maintain full-featured databases. (Of course, it wouldn't be a royal kingdom without some drama, so read on to find out who gets the girl—the arrogant prince or the humble servant.)

Personas - User Focused Design,Lene Nielsen,Springer,2019-02-08,"People relate to other people, not to simplified types or segments. This is the concept that underpins this book. Personas, a user centered design methodology, covers topics from interaction design within IT, through to issues surrounding product design, communication, and marketing. Project developers need to understand how users approach their products from the product’s infancy, and regardless of what the product might be. Developers should be able to describe the user of the product via vivid depictions, as if they – with their different attitudes, desires and habits – were already using the product. In doing so they can more clearly formulate how to turn the product's potential into reality. Based on 20 years’ experience in solving problems for businesses and 15 years of research, currently at the IT University of Copenhagen, Lene Nielsen is Denmark’s leading expert in the persona method. She has a PhD in personas and scenarios, and through her research and practical experiences has developed her own approach to the method – 10 Steps to Personas. This second edition of Personas – User Focused Design presents a step-by-step methodology of personas which will be of interest to developers of IT, communications solutions and innovative products.

Righting Software,Juval Löwy,Addison-Wesley Professional,2019-11-27,"Right Your Software and Transform Your Career Righting Software presents the proven, structured, and highly engineered approach to software design that renowned architect Juval Löwy has practiced and taught around the world. Although companies of every kind have successfully implemented his original design ideas across hundreds of systems, these insights have never before appeared in print. Based on first principles in software engineering and a comprehensive set of matching tools and techniques, Löwy’s methodology integrates system design and project design. First, he describes the primary area where many software architects fail and shows how to decompose a system into smaller building blocks or services, based on volatility. Next, he shows how to flow an effective project design from the system design; how to accurately calculate the project duration, cost, and risk; and how to devise multiple execution options. The method and principles in Righting Software apply regardless of your project and company size, technology, platform, or industry. Löwy starts the reader on a journey that addresses the critical challenges of software development today by righting software systems and projects as well as careers—and possibly the software industry as a whole. Software professionals, architects, project leads, or managers at any stage of their career will benefit greatly from this book, which provides guidance and knowledge that would otherwise take decades and many projects to acquire.

What We See When We Read,Peter Mendelsund,Vintage,2014-08-05,"A gorgeously unique, fully illustrated exploration into the phenomenology of reading—how we visualize images from reading works of literature, from one of our very best book jacket designers, himself a passionate reader. “A playful, illustrated treatise on how words give rise to mental images.” —The New York Times What do we see when we read? Did Tolstoy really describe Anna Karenina? Did Melville ever really tell us what, exactly, Ishmael looked like? The collection of fragmented images on a page—a graceful ear there, a stray curl, a hat positioned just so—and other clues and signifiers helps us to create an image of a character. But in fact our sense that we know a character intimately has little to do with our ability to concretely picture our beloved—or reviled—literary figures. In this remarkable work of nonfiction, Knopf's Associate Art Director Peter Mendelsund combines his profession, as an award-winning designer; his first career, as a classically trained pianist; and his first love, literature—he considers himself first and foremost as a reader—into what is sure to be one of the most provocative and unusual investigations into how we understand the act of reading.",Literary Criticism,450,N/A,0,en

New Statistics for Design Researchers,Martin Schmettow,Springer,2022-07-15,"Design Research uses scientific methods to evaluate designs and build design theories. This book starts with recognizable questions in Design Research, such as A/B testing, how users learn to operate a device and why computer-generated faces are eerie. Using a broad range of examples, efficient research designs are presented together with statistical models and many visualizations. With the tidy R approach, producing publication-ready statistical reports is straight-forward and even non-programmers can learn this in just one day. Hundreds of illustrations, tables, simulations and models are presented with full R code and data included. Using Bayesian linear models, multi-level models and generalized linear models, an extensive statistical framework is introduced, covering a huge variety of research situations and yet, building on only a handful of basic concepts. Unique solutions to recurring problems are presented, such as psychometric multi-level models, beta regression for rating scales and ExGaussian regression for response times. A “think-first” approach is promoted for model building, as much as the quantitative interpretation of results, stimulating readers to think about data generating processes, as well as rational decision making. New Statistics for Design Researchers: A Bayesian Workflow in Tidy R targets scientists, industrial researchers and students in a range of disciplines, such as Human Factors, Applied Psychology, Communication Science, Industrial Design, Computer Science and Social Robotics. Statistical concepts are introduced in a problem-oriented way and with minimal formalism. Included primers on R and Bayesian statistics provide entry point for all backgrounds.

The Design of Aircraft Landing Gear,Robert Kyle Schmidt,SAE International,2021-02-18,"The aircraft landing gear and its associated systems represent a compelling design challenge: simultaneously a system, a structure, and a machine, it supports the aircraft on the ground, absorbs landing and braking energy, permits maneuvering, and retracts to minimize aircraft drag. Yet, as it is not required during flight, it also represents dead weight and significant effort must be made to minimize its total mass. The Design of Aircraft Landing Gear, written by R. Kyle Schmidt, PE (B.A.Sc. - Mechanical Engineering, M.Sc. - Safety and Aircraft Accident Investigation, Chairman of the SAE A-5 Committee on Aircraft Landing Gear), is designed to guide the reader through the key principles of landing system design and to provide additional references when available. Many problems which must be confronted have already been addressed by others in the past, but the information is not known or shared, leading to the observation that there are few new problems, but many new people. The Design of Aircraft Landing Gear is intended to share much of the existing information and provide avenues for further exploration. The design of an aircraft and its associated systems, including the landing system, involves iterative loops as the impact of each modification to a system or component is evaluated against the whole. It is rare to find that the lightest possible landing gear represents the best solution for the aircraft: the lightest landing gear may require attachment structures which don't exist and which would require significant weight and compromise on the part of the airframe structure design. With those requirements and compromises in mind,The Design of Aircraft Landing Gear starts with the study of airfield compatibility, aircraft stability on the ground, the correct choice of tires, followed by discussion of brakes, wheels, and brake control systems. Various landing gear architectures are investigated together with the details of shock absorber designs. Retraction, kinematics, and mechanisms are studied as well as possible actuation approaches. Detailed information on the various hydraulic and electric services commonly found on aircraft, and system elements such as dressings, lighting, and steering are also reviewed. Detail design points, the process of analysis, and a review of the relevant requirements and regulations round out the book content. The Design of Aircraft Landing Gear is a landmark work in the industry, and a must-read for any engineer interested in updating specific skills and students preparing for an exciting career.",Technology & Engineering,1092,N/A,0,en

Subsequently touring to twenty-two museums across the country, where it was viewed by over half a million Americans, and then to eleven cities in Europe, the exhibition canonized such artists as Anni Albers, Sheila Hicks, Wharton Esherick, Wendell Castle, and George Nakashima, and introduced others who would go on to achieve widespread art-world acclaim, including Dale Chihuly, Michele Oka Doner, J. B. Blunk, and Ron Nagle. Objects: USA 2020 revisits this revolutionary exhibition and its accompanying catalog--which has become a bible of sorts to curators, gallerists, dealers, craftspeople, and artists--by pairing fifty participants from the original exhibition with fifty contemporary artists representing the next generation of practitioners to use--and upend--the traditional methods and materials of craft to create new forms of art. Published to coincide with an exhibition of the same title at the renowned gallery R & Company, and featuring essays by some of the foremost authorities on craft at the intersection of art, including Glenn Adamson, curator and former director of the Museum of Arts & Design; James Zemaitis, curator and former head of twentieth-century design at Sotheby's; and Lena Vigna, curator of exhibitions at the Racine Art Musuem; an interview with Paul J. Smith, the cocurator of Objects: USA; archival photographs of the original exhibition and important historical works; and lush full-color images of contemporary works, Objects: USA 2020 is an essential art historical reference that traces how craft was elevated to the status of museum-quality art, and sets its trajectory forward.",Art,232,N/A,0,en
Applied Qualitative Research Design,"Margaret R. Roller, Paul J. Lavrakas",Guilford Publications,2015-02-23,"This unique text provides a comprehensive framework for creating, managing, and interpreting qualitative research studies that yield valid and useful information. Examples of studies from a wide range of disciplines illustrate the strengths, limitations, and applications of the primary qualitative methods: in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, ethnography, content analysis, and case study and narrative research. Following a consistent format, chapters show students and researchers how to implement each method within a paradigm-neutral and flexible Total Quality Framework (TQF) comprising four interrelated components: Credibility, Analyzability, Transparency, and Usefulness. Unlike other texts that relegate quality issues to one or two chapters, detailed discussions of such crucial topics as construct validity, interresearcher reliability, researcher bias, and verification strategies are featured throughout. The book also addresses applications of the TQF to the writing, review, and evaluation of qualitative research proposals and manuscripts. Pedagogical Features *Summary tables that highlight important content, such as the application of a method to vulnerable or hard-to-reach populations. *Case studies that illustrate TQF standards in practice for each method. *Guidelines for effective documentation (via thick descriptions) of each type of study. *End-of-chapter discussion topics, exercises, and suggested further reading and Web resources. *Chapters open with a preview and close with a bulleted summary of key ideas. *Extensive glossary. 2021 Winner--American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) Book Award",Psychology,417,N/A,0,en

The Design of Experiments,R. Mead,Cambridge University Press,1990-07-26,"In all the experimental sciences, good design of experiments is crucial to the success of research. Well-planned experiments can provide a great deal of information efficiently and can be used to test several hypotheses simultaneously. This book is about the statistical principles of good experimental design and is intended for all applied statisticians and practising scientists engaged in the design, implementation and analysis of experiments. Professor Mead has written the book with the emphasis on the logical principles of statistical design and employs a minimum of mathematics. Throughout he assumes that the large-scale analysis of data will be performed by computers and he is thus able to devote more attention to discussions of how all of the available information can be used to extract the clearest answers to many questions. The principles are illustrated with a wide range of examples drawn from medicine, agriculture, industry and other disciplines. Numerous exercises are given to help the reader practise techniques and to appreciate the difference that good design of experiments can make to a scientific project.",Mathematics,640,N/A,0,en
Design of Observational Studies,Paul R. Rosenbaum,Springer Science & Business Media,2009-10-22,"An observational study is an empiric investigation of effects caused by treatments when randomized experimentation is unethical or infeasible. Observational studies are common in most fields that study the effects of treatments on people, including medicine, economics, epidemiology, education, psychology, political science and sociology. The quality and strength of evidence provided by an observational study is determined largely by its design. Design of Observational Studies is both an introduction to statistical inference in observational studies and a detailed discussion of the principles that guide the design of observational studies. Design of Observational Studies is divided into four parts. Chapters 2, 3, and 5 of Part I cover concisely, in about one hundred pages, many of the ideas discussed in Rosenbaum’s Observational Studies (also published by Springer) but in a less technical fashion. Part II discusses the practical aspects of using propensity scores and other tools to create a matched comparison that balances many covariates. Part II includes a chapter on matching in R. In Part III, the concept of design sensitivity is used to appraise the relative ability of competing designs to distinguish treatment effects from biases due to unmeasured covariates. Part IV discusses planning the analysis of an observational study, with particular reference to Sir Ronald Fisher’s striking advice for observational studies, ""make your theories elaborate.""

Heavy-Duty Wheeled Vehicles,"Boris Nikolaevich Belousov, Sergey D Popov",SAE International,2014-01-27,"Heavy-duty wheeled vehicles (HDWVs) are all-wheel-drive vehicles that carry 25 tons or more and have three or more axles. They transport heavy, bulky cargo such as raw minerals, timber, construction materials, pre-fabricated modules, weapons, combat vehicles, and more. HDWVs are used in a variety of industries (mining, logging, construction, energy) and are critical to a country’s economy and defense. These vehicles have unique development requirements due to their high loads, huge dimensions, and specific operating conditions. Hauling efficiencies can be improved by increasing vehicle load capacity; however capacities are influenced by legislation, road limits, and design. Designing HDWVs differs from other multi-purpose all-wheel-drive vehicles. The chassis must be custom-designed to suit the customer’s particular purpose. The number of axles is another variable, as well as which ones are driving and which are driven. Tires are also customizable. Translated by SAE from Russian, this book narrates the history of HDWVs and presents the theory and calculations required to design them. It summarizes results of the authors’ academic research and experience and presents innovative technical solutions used for electric and hydrostatic transmissions, steering systems, and active safety of these vehicles. The book consists of three parts. Part one covers HDWV design history and general design methods, including basic vehicle design, and evaluating HDWV use conditions. Part one also covers general operation requirements and consumer needs, and a brief analysis of structural components of existing HDWVs and prototypes. Part two outlines information needs for designing HDWVs. Part three reviews basic theory and calculation of innovative technical solutions, as well as special requirements for component parts. This comprehensive title provides the following information about HDWVs: • History of design and manufacture. • Manufacturers’ summary design data. • Background data on sample vehicles. • Component calculation examples. • Overview of motion theory, which is useful in design and placement of bulky cargo.",Technology & Engineering,579,N/A,0,en

Energy and Humanity,Jami Hossain,Cambridge Scholars Publishing,2019-10-29,"Sometime around three million years ago, the first hominid walked on this planet. In the time which has elapsed since then, the descendant of this biped has evolved to reach the top of the food chain. Furthermore, it has manipulated other lifeforms and Earth’s resources in a manner that makes these entirely subservient to only one species, homo sapiens. In a period less than 0.007% of Earth’s age, man has dramatically altered both the biosphere and the climate. This text argues that intelligent manipulation of ‘energy’ is at the heart of human supremacy. Energy is intertwined in an intricate manner with everything that happens around us. From the very beginning, nearly three million years ago, up until today, the human race has evolved and progressed by gaining mastery and control over energy. This book presents an insightful description of the evolution of human civilization from an energy perspective, showing that ‘energy’ is the vehicle that has catapulted the human race to a commanding position on Earth. From rudimentary Stone Age tools to classical physics, from animal power to the steam engine, and from relativity and quantum theory to geo-politics and climate change, drawing upon multiple disciplines, it weaves a fascinating story of the history of “energy” in human civilization. It also discusses the “dark side” of energy, exemplified by climate change, pollution, and deforestation, which is compelling modern human civilization to once again go into an energy transition mode, as well as those forms of energy which can counteract such forces: renewable and smart energy and their associated innovations.",Technology & Engineering,241,5,2,en

Chassis Design,"William F. Milliken, Douglas L. Milliken, Maurice Olley",Wiley-Blackwell,2002,"Maurice Olley, one of the great automotive design, research and development engineers of the 20th century, had a career that spanned two continents. Olley is perhaps best known for his systematic approach to ride and handling. His work was so comprehensive that many of the underlying concepts, test procedures, analysis, and evaluation techniques are still used in the auto industry today. Olley’s mathematical analyses cover design essentials in a physically understandable way. Thus they remain as useful today as when they were first developed. For example, they are easily programmed for study or routine use and for checking the results of more complex programs. Chassis Design – Principles and Analysis is based on Olley’s technical writings, and is the first complete presentation of his life’s work. This new book provides insight into the development of chassis technology and its practical application by a master. Many examples are worked out in the text and the analytical developments are underpinned by Olley’s years of design experience.

Holistic Sustainability Through Craft-Design Collaboration,Rebecca Reubens,Routledge,2019-05-07,"This book explores the intersection of craft, design and sustainability in the developing world. It argues that most sustainable design approaches and efforts fall short of implementing holistic sustainability, and in order to reach this goal, design must be underpinned by alternatives to the mainstream, technology-intensive, industrial design paradigm. Renewable materials such as bamboo, cork and hemp – which are abundantly available in the developing world – have the potential to be a viable resource base for sustainable development. Current sustainable design initiatives and approaches already recontextualize these materials using industrial techniques and technologies. However, these efforts fall short of impacting holistic sustainability and tend to focus on the ecological aspect. This book offers the development of one alternative to design for holistic sustainability, called the Rhizome Approach, which draws on existing sustainability praxis and craft. Holistic Sustainability Through Craft-Design Collaboration includes customizable tools which aim to empower designers to guide and evaluate their own designs. Through these tools, and the Rhizome Approach in general, the book aims to enable designers, and students of design, to move beyond green and sustainable design, to holistic sustainability design.",Business & Economics,277,N/A,0,en

Optimal Sensor Networks Scheduling in Identification of Distributed Parameter Systems,Maciej Patan,Springer,2012-02-23,"Sensor networks have recently come into prominence because they hold the potential to revolutionize a wide spectrum of both civilian and military applications. An ingenious characteristic of sensor networks is the distributed nature of data acquisition. Therefore they seem to be ideally prepared for the task of monitoring processes with spatio-temporal dynamics which constitute one of most general and important classes of systems in modelling of the real-world phenomena. It is clear that careful deployment and activation of sensor nodes are critical for collecting the most valuable information from the observed environment. Optimal Sensor Network Scheduling in Identification of Distributed Parameter Systems discusses the characteristic features of the sensor scheduling problem, analyzes classical and recent approaches, and proposes a wide range of original solutions, especially dedicated for networks with mobile and scanning nodes.

Type Inheritance and Relational Theory,C.J. Date,"""O'Reilly Media, Inc.""",2016-09-08,"Type inheritance is that phenomenon according to which we can say, for example, that every square is also a rectangle, and so properties that apply to rectangles in general apply to squares in particular. In other words, squares are a subtype of rectangles, and rectangles are a supertype of squares. Recognizing and acting upon such subtype / supertype relationships provides numerous benefits: Certainly it can help in data modeling, and it can also provide for code reuse in applications. For these reasons, many languages, including the standard database language SQL, have long supported such relationships. However, there doesn’t seem to be any consensus in the community at large on a formal, rigorous, and abstract model of inheritance. This book proposes such a model, one that enjoys several advantages over other approaches, not the least of which it is that it’s fully compatible with the well known relational model of data. Topics the model covers include: Both single and multiple inheritance Scalar, tuple, and relation inheritance Type lattices and union and intersection types Polymorphism and substitutability Compile time and run time binding All of these topics are described in detail in the book, with numerous illustrative examples, exercises, and answers. The book also discusses several alternative approaches. In particular, it includes a detailed discussion and analysis of inheritance as supported in the SQL standard.",Computers,674,N/A,0,en
Eco-Architecture VIII,"S. Hernández, P. Chias",WIT Press,2020-11-18,"New opportunities for solving the challenges of contemporary architecture occur as a result of advances in the design and new building technologies, as well as the development of new materials. Many of the changes are motivated by a drive towards eco-architecture, trying to harmonise architectural products with nature. Another important issue is the adaptation of the architectural design to the natural environment, learning from nature and traditional construction techniques. Contemporary architecture is at the threshold of a new stage of evolution, deeply influenced by the advances in information and computer systems and the development of new materials and products, as well as construction processes that will drastically change the industry. Never before in history have architects and engineers had such a range of new processes and products open to them. In spite of that, the construction industry lags behind all others in taking advantage of a wide variety of new technologies. This is understandable, due to the inherent complexity and uniqueness of each architectural project. Advances in computer and information systems, including robotics, offers the possibility of developing new architectural forms, construction products and building technologies which are just now starting to emerge. Changes have also taken place in the way modern society works and lives, due to the impact of modern technologies. Patterns of work have been disrupted and changed, affecting transportation and the home environment. The demand is for a new type of habitat that can respond to the changes and the consequent requirements in terms of the urban environment. This volume originates from the 8th International Conference on Harmonisation between Architecture and Nature and deals with topics such as building technologies, design by passive systems, design with nature, cultural sensitivity, life cycle assessment, resources and rehabilitation and many others including case studies from around the world.",Architecture,202,N/A,0,en

The most recent publications are by MacFadyen and Mac Fadyen (1986), Furnham and Lewis (1986), Lea et al. (1987) and Van Raaij et al. (1988). Why produce yet another book for this discipline? This question can be answered in various ways. In a sense, this book is the answer in itself. Its presentation of re search and theories is innovative in this field, at least to my knowledge. It attempts to structure the many theories emerging in the interdisci plinary science of economic psychology and to explain the background of the research. The second answer is pragmatic. In our introductory course of eco nomic psychology for economics students at Erasmus University Rot terdam we used several of the above mentioned books. Our experience with this material is that, when preparing our lectures, we had to ex plain many additional theories and experiments to our students. fur thermore, diagrams, figures and examples had to be culled from other sources or made by ourselves. It is not my intention to run down these publications since I think they provide an excellent treatment of a num ber of topics by specialists in economic psychology.

Inequality by Design,"Claude S. Fischer, Michael Hout, Martín Sánchez Jankowski, Samuel R. Lucas, Ann Swidler, Kim Voss",Princeton University Press,2020-11-10,"As debate rages over the widening and destructive gap between the rich and the rest of Americans, Claude Fischer and his colleagues present a comprehensive new treatment of inequality in America. They challenge arguments that expanding inequality is the natural, perhaps necessary, accompaniment of economic growth. They refute the claims of the incendiary bestseller The Bell Curve (1994) through a clear, rigorous re-analysis of the very data its authors, Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray, used to contend that inherited differences in intelligence explain inequality. Inequality by Design offers a powerful alternative explanation, stressing that economic fortune depends more on social circumstances than on IQ, which is itself a product of society. More critical yet, patterns of inequality must be explained by looking beyond the attributes of individuals to the structure of society. Social policies set the ""rules of the game"" within which individual abilities and efforts matter. And recent policies have, on the whole, widened the gap between the rich and the rest of Americans since the 1970s. Not only does the wealth of individuals' parents shape their chances for a good life, so do national policies ranging from labor laws to investments in education to tax deductions. The authors explore the ways that America--the most economically unequal society in the industrialized world--unevenly distributes rewards through regulation of the market, taxes, and government spending. It attacks the myth that inequality fosters economic growth, that reducing economic inequality requires enormous welfare expenditures, and that there is little we can do to alter the extent of inequality. It also attacks the injurious myth of innate racial inequality, presenting powerful evidence that racial differences in achievement are the consequences, not the causes, of social inequality. By refusing to blame inequality on an unchangeable human nature and an inexorable market--an excuse that leads to resignation and passivity--Inequality by Design shows how we can advance policies that widen opportunity for all.",Social Science,332,N/A,0,en

SuperDesign,Maria Cristina Didero,"The Monacelli Press, LLC",2017-10-31,"SuperDesign charts the Italian Radicals’ bold experimentation in modern design from its birth through its continued influence on design today. Radical Design was launched by art, architecture, and design students in Italy in the mid-1960s. What started as a youthful rally against the establishment and a rejection of design norms became a movement that brought together some of the most dynamic and avant-garde thinkers and makers across the country. Through enigmatic, confrontational, and clever furniture and objects—such as the iconic lip-shaped Bocca sofa, or the Cactus coat-rack in green foam—as well as more public innovations including discotheque interiors and subversive performances, the Radicals projected design’s new era as equal parts Pop Art, play, Surrealism, and futurism. Told through exclusive interviews, unreleased photographs, original drawings and artwork unearthed from personal archives, and newly commissioned photography of rarely seen works, SuperDesign explores this fervent period of design that played out against the era’s social and political turmoil. Featured designers include Archizoom Associati, Lapo Binazzi (UFO), Pietro Derossi (Gruppo Strum), Piero Gilardi, Ugo La Pietra, Gaetano Pesce, Gianni Pettena, Studio65, and Superstudio. The culmination of a decade of collecting and researching original examples of some of the most important and iconic works of the period, SuperDesign offers a unique new introduction to the legacy of the Italian Radicals.",Design,241,N/A,0,en

RTL Hardware Design Using VHDL,Pong P. Chu,John Wiley & Sons,2006-04-20,"The skills and guidance needed to master RTL hardware design This book teaches readers how to systematically design efficient, portable, and scalable Register Transfer Level (RTL) digital circuits using the VHDL hardware description language and synthesis software. Focusing on the module-level design, which is composed of functional units, routing circuit, and storage, the book illustrates the relationship between the VHDL constructs and the underlying hardware components, and shows how to develop codes that faithfully reflect the module-level design and can be synthesized into efficient gate-level implementation. Several unique features distinguish the book: * Coding style that shows a clear relationship between VHDL constructs and hardware components * Conceptual diagrams that illustrate the realization of VHDL codes * Emphasis on the code reuse * Practical examples that demonstrate and reinforce design concepts, procedures, and techniques * Two chapters on realizing sequential algorithms in hardware * Two chapters on scalable and parameterized designs and coding * One chapter covering the synchronization and interface between multiple clock domains Although the focus of the book is RTL synthesis, it also examines the synthesis task from the perspective of the overall development process. Readers learn good design practices and guidelines to ensure that an RTL design can accommodate future simulation, verification, and testing needs, and can be easily incorporated into a larger system or reused. Discussion is independent of technology and can be applied to both ASIC and FPGA devices. With a balanced presentation of fundamentals and practical examples, this is an excellent textbook for upper-level undergraduate or graduate courses in advanced digital logic. Engineers who need to make effective use of today's synthesis software and FPGA devices should also refer to this book.",Technology & Engineering,695,5,1,en

Go: A Kidd's Guide to Graphic Design,Chip Kidd,Workman Publishing,2013-10-08,"“An excellent introduction to graphic design through [the author’s] own excellent work. Anyone interested in the subject, including most practitioners, will find it delightful.”—Milton Glaser Kids love to express themselves, and are designers by nature—whether making posters for school, deciding what to hang in their rooms, or creating personalized notebook covers. Go, by the award-winning graphic designer Chip Kidd, is a stunning introduction to the ways in which a designer communicates his or her ideas to the world. It’s written and designed just for those curious kids, not to mention their savvy parents, who want to learn the secret of how to make things dynamic and interesting. Chip Kidd is “the closest thing to a rock star” in the design world (USA Today), and in Go he explains not just the elements of design, including form, line, color, scale, typography, and more, but most important, how to use those elements in creative ways. Like putting the word “go” on a stop sign, Go is all about shaking things up—and kids will love its playful spirit and belief that the world looks better when you look at it differently. He writes about scale: When a picture looks good small, don’t stop there—see how it looks when it’s really small. Or really big. He explains the difference between vertical lines and horizontal lines. The effect of cropping a picture to make it beautiful—or, cropping it even more to make it mysterious and compelling. How different colors signify different moods. The art of typography, including serifs and sans serifs, kerning and leading. The book ends with ten projects, including an invitation to share your designs at GoTheBook.com.",Design,161,N/A,0,en
Development and Evaluation of an Experimental Frazil Ice Measurement Instrument,Gee Tsang,"Burlington, Ont. : Inland Waters Directorate, Canada Centre for Inland Waters",1977,"Theoretical investigations show that the presence of frazil ice in water can be quantitatively measured by its effect on the conductivity and the permittivity of the water. At frequencies much lower than 10 7 Hz, the frazil ice effect on conductivity predominates, and at frequencies much higher than 10 7 Hz, the ice effect on permittivity is predominant. An experimental instrument based on the resistance (i.e. conductivity) principle has been constructed and tested. Experiments were performed in a cold room with frazil ice produced in a beaker. The experiments showed that the laboratory instrument could quantitatively sense the presence of ice. The detailed circuit of the experimental instrument is shown. Some modification of the circuit and the probe for improving the instrument are suggested as a consequence of the laboratory experiments and further theoretical investigations. The concentrations of frazil ice measured by the experimental instrument were by average about three times the concentration calculated theoretically. If the frazil ice crystals are assumed to have elongated spheroidal shapes with a length to breadth ratio of 10:1, the measured concentrations are about twice the calculated concentration. Further theoretical investigation is needed to explain this puzzle. The puzzle, however, is beneficial because it decreases the sensitivity of the instrument. This report describes phase I of an instrument development project. The design and production of and improved and manufacturable instrument will be phase II of the project.",Frazil ice,48,N/A,0,en

Thinking Design,S Balaram,SAGE Publications,2011-01-06,"Thinking Design looks at ‘design’ in its broadest sense and shows how design originates in ‘human need’ which is not only physical but also psychological, socio-cultural, ecological and spiritual. The book calls for broad-based, socially integrated designs with a large global vision that offer creative solutions to a variety of subjects rather than providing multiplicity of objects. Exploring the course taken by design during the time of Gandhi and in the following era, the author advocates the need for service - or process-oriented designs in contrast to product-oriented designs. A remarkable feature of the book is the way its narrative is enlivened with case studies detailing design inventions, interspersed with tales of Mullah Nasiruddin that provide a tongue-in-cheek take on aspects of design.",Art,285,N/A,0,en

Different Perspectives in Design Thinking,Yvonne Eriksson,CRC Press,2022-03-02,"Globalization and digitalization are buzz words in contemporary society. They affect both our private and our professional lives. Society has become more diverse with easier access to information and to virtual platforms that gives us opportunity to be in touch with colleagues, friends, family, etc. at any time. A complex environment is emerging wherein internet of things and big data are being integrated with products, production systems, healthcare, and daily activity and play an important part in decision making. This has an impact on future designs and the role of designers. Responsible designers with a holistic perspective are needed. The book highlights several aspects of design thinking such as Information Design and Critical Design. The meaning of culture, gender and disabilities are also discussed. The functions of Information Design are changing from ‘showing the way’, instruction manuals and graphic design. It will affect among others, healthcare technology, smart products and Industry 4.0. Design thinking perspective that includes users from the entire chain and from the producer to the end user of the product or service, is needed. This will also require gender and culture issues to be taken into consideration in designing products and services.

Toprovethe correctness of a program is to demonstrate, through impeccable mathematical techniques, that it has no bugs; to test a program is to run it with the exp- tation of discovering bugs. The two techniques seem contradictory: if you have proved your program, it is fruitless to comb it for bugs; and if you are testing it, that is surely a sign that you have given up on any hope of proving its corre- ness. Accordingly, proofs and tests have, since the onset of software engineering research,been pursuedby distinct communities using ratherdi?erent techniques and tools. And yet the development of both approaches leads to the discovery of common issues and to the realization that each may need the other. The emergence of model checking has been one of the ?rst signs that contradiction may yield to complementarity, but in the past few years an increasing number of research e?orts have encountered the need for combining proofs and tests, dropping earlier dogmatic views of incompatibility and taking instead the best of what each of these software engineering domains has to o?er.",Computers,179,N/A,0,en

User Interfaces for All,Constantine Stephanidis,CRC Press,2019-03-30,"User Interfaces for All is the first book dedicated to the issues of Universal Design and Universal Access in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Universal Design (or Design for All) is an inclusive and proactive approach seeking to accommodate diversity in the users and usage contexts of interactive products, applications, and services, starting from the design phase of the development life cycle. The ongoing paradigm shift toward a knowledge-intensive information society is already bringing about radical changes in the way people work and interact with each other and with information. The requirement for Universal Design stems from the growing impact of the fusion of the emerging technologies, and from the different dimensions of diversity, which are intrinsic to the information society. This book unfolds the various aspects of this ongoing evolution from a variety of viewpoints. It's a collection of 30 chapters written by leading international authorities, affiliated with academic, research, and industrial organizations, and non-market institutions.

Keyness in Texts,"Marina Bondi, Mike Scott",John Benjamins Publishing,2010-01-01,"This is corpus linguistics with a text linguistic focus. The volume concerns lexical inequality, the fact that some words and phrases share the quality of being key---and thereby reflect or promote important themes in some textual contexts, while others do not. The patterning of words which differ in their centrality to text meaning is of increasing interest to corpus linguistics. At the same time software resources are yielding increasingly more detailed ways of identifying and studying the linkages between key words and phrases in text databases. This volume brings together work from some of the leading researchers in this field. It presents thirteen studies organized in three sections, the first containing a series of studies exploring the nature of keyness itself, then a set of five studies looking at keyness in specific discourse contexts, and then three studies with an educational focus.

The book gives an overview of: the relevant ageing processes and hazards; how ageing processes are managed through the life cycle, including an overview of structural integrity management; how an engineer should go about assessing a structure that is to be operated beyond its original design life, and how ageing can be mitigated for safe and effective continued operation. Key Features: Provides an understanding of ageing processes and how these can be mitigated. Applies engineering methods to ensure that existing structures can be operated longer rather than decommissioned unduly prematurely. Helps engineers performing these tasks in both evaluating the existing structures and maintaining ageing structures in a safe manner. The book gives an updated summary of current practice and research on the topic of the management of ageing structures and pipelines in the life extension phase but also meets the needs of structural engineering students and practicing offshore and structural engineers in oil & gas and engineering companies. In addition, it should be of value to regulators of the offshore industry.",Technology & Engineering,214,N/A,0,en

The Maker Cookbook,"Cindy Wall, Lynn Pawloski",Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2014-08-28,"The Maker Movement is hot, and librarians are eager to participate. Even if you feel restricted by budget, staff, or space, this step-by-step guide will help you turn your library into a creativity center. The Maker Movement is sweeping the nation because it is creative and educational—and a lot of fun. Nonetheless, some librarians have hesitated to incorporate the movement into their programming because their libraries do not have dedicated makerspaces. If that describes you, then take heart. Written by librarians for librarians, this ""cookbook"" proves that every library is already a MakerPlace and provides you with recipes to make your library come alive with creativity. Easy-to-use, step-by-step guidance helps you create engaging K–8 programs in science and technology, arts and crafts, and home skills that are perfect for the library setting. The menu of ideas is broken into four types of programming. ""Appetizers"" add a taste of the Maker movement to existing library programs. ""Entrees"" present full programs for a lengthy one-day event or a short series. ""Side Dishes"" are programs you can use if you have limited staff, budget, space, or any combination of those. ""Desserts"" are low-tech programs, suitable for young children. Each ""recipe"" includes extensions, variations, and curriculum tie-ins that give you even more ways to present the program ideas, whether to a different audience or as part of other related activities. Programs that involve creating a ""Balloon Zip Line,"" a ""Zen Garden,"" or a ""Maker Marketplace"" will delight library users and generate activity and excitement in your library.",Language Arts & Disciplines,348,N/A,0,en

Research Design,Stephen Gorard,SAGE,2013-02-01,"Research design is of critical importance in social research, despite its relative neglect in many methods resources. Early consideration of design in relation to research questions leads to the elimination or diminution of threats to eventual research claims, by encouraging internal validity and substantially reducing the number of alternative explanations for any finite number of research ′observations′. This new book: discusses the nature of design; gives an introduction to design notation; offers a flexible approach to new designs; looks at a range of standard design models; and presents craft tips for real-life problems and compromises. Most importantly, it provides the rationale for preferring one design over another within any given context. Each section is illustrated with case studies of real work and concludes with suggested readings and topics for discussion in seminars and workshops, making it an ideal textbook for postgraduate research methods courses. Based on the author′s teaching on the ESRC Doctoral Training Centre ""Masters in Research Methods"" at the University of Birmingham, and his ongoing work for the ESRC Researcher Development Initiative, this is an essential text for postgraduate researchers and academics. There is no book like Research Design on the market that addresses all of these issues in an easy to comprehend style, for those who want to design research and make critical judgements about the designs of others.",Social Science,234,N/A,0,en

Design as Democratic Inquiry,Carl Disalvo,MIT Press,2022-02-08,"Through practices of collaborative imagination and making, or ""doing design otherwise,” design experiments can contribute to keeping local democracies vibrant. In this counterpoint to the grand narratives of design punditry, Carl DiSalvo presents what he calls “doing design otherwise.” Arguing that democracy requires constant renewal and care, he shows how designers can supply novel contributions to local democracy by drawing together theory and practice, making and reflection. The relentless pursuit of innovation, uncritical embrace of the new and novel, and treatment of all things as design problems, says DiSalvo, can lead to cultural imperialism. In Design as Democratic Inquiry, he recounts a series of projects that exemplify engaged design in practice. These experiments in practice-based research are grounded in collaborations with communities and institutions. The projects DiSalvo describes took place from 2014 to 2019 in Atlanta. Rather than presume that government, industry—or academia—should determine the outcome, the designers began with the recognition that the residents and local organizations were already creative and resourceful. DiSalvo uses the projects to show how design might work as a mode of inquiry. Resisting heroic stories of design and innovation, he argues for embracing design as fragile, contingent, partial, and compromised. In particular, he explores how design might be leveraged to facilitate a more diverse civic imagination. A fundamental tenet of design is that the world is made, and therefore it could be made differently. A key concept is that democracy requires constant renewal and care. Thus, designing becomes a way to care, together, for our collective future.",Design,235,N/A,0,en

Again we concentrate on two closely re lated aspects of the study of combinatorial designs: design construction and computer-aided study of designs. There are at least three classes of constructive problems in design theory. The first type of problem is the construction of a specific design. This might arise because that one particular case is an exception to a general rule, the last remaining case of a problem, or the smallest unknown case. A good example is the proof that there is no projective plane of parameter 10. In that case the computations involved were not different in kind from those which have been done by human brains without electronic assistance; they were merely longer. Computers have also been useful in the study of combinatorial spec trum problems: if a class of design has certain parameters, what is the set of values that the parameters can realize? In many cases, there is a recursive construction, so that the existence of a small number of ""starter"" designs leads to the construction of infinite classes of designs, and computers have proven very useful in finding ""starter"" designs.",Mathematics,370,N/A,0,en

My Radar Data Knows Its Things,Lytton Smith,N/A,2018,"Poetry. Lytton Smith's MY RADAR DATA KNOWS ITS THING, winner of the 2017 Foundlings Press Artist Residency and Chapbook Contest, is a deeply sensitive, wide-ranging, and lyrical exploration of human connection, technology, proximity, the past in the present, and the natural environment. ""With each poem that begins with his namesake's classic line, Lytton Smith's chapbook tests the limits of language just as it tests the limits of human relationships,"" the poet Anthony Caleshu writes.

Designs on Nature,Sheila Jasanoff,Princeton University Press,2011-06-27,"Biology and politics have converged today across much of the industrialized world. Debates about genetically modified organisms, cloning, stem cells, animal patenting, and new reproductive technologies crowd media headlines and policy agendas. Less noticed, but no less important, are the rifts that have appeared among leading Western nations about the right way to govern innovation in genetics and biotechnology. These significant differences in law and policy, and in ethical analysis, may in a globalizing world act as obstacles to free trade, scientific inquiry, and shared understandings of human dignity. In this magisterial look at some twenty-five years of scientific and social development, Sheila Jasanoff compares the politics and policy of the life sciences in Britain, Germany, the United States, and in the European Union as a whole. She shows how public and private actors in each setting evaluated new manifestations of biotechnology and tried to reassure themselves about their safety. Three main themes emerge. First, core concepts of democratic theory, such as citizenship, deliberation, and accountability, cannot be understood satisfactorily without taking on board the politics of science and technology. Second, in all three countries, policies for the life sciences have been incorporated into ""nation-building"" projects that seek to reimagine what the nation stands for. Third, political culture influences democratic politics, and it works through the institutionalized ways in which citizens understand and evaluate public knowledge. These three aspects of contemporary politics, Jasanoff argues, help account not only for policy divergences but also for the perceived legitimacy of state actions.",Political Science,391,N/A,0,en

Meaningful Stuff,Jonathan Chapman,MIT Press,2021-08-03,"An argument for a design philosophy of better, not more. Never have we wanted, owned, and wasted so much stuff. Our consumptive path through modern life leaves a wake of social and ecological destruction--sneakers worn only once, bicycles barely even ridden, and forgotten smartphones languishing in drawers. By what perverse alchemy do our newest, coolest things so readily transform into meaningless junk? In Meaningful Stuff, Jonathan Chapman investigates why we throw away things that still work, and shows how we can design products, services, and systems that last. Obsolescence is an economically driven design decision--a plan to hasten a product's functional or psychological undesirability. Many electronic devices, for example, are intentionally impossible to dismantle for repair or recycling, their brief use-career proceeding inexorably to a landfill. A sustainable design specialist who serves as a consultant to global businesses and governmental organizations, Chapman calls for the decoupling of economic activity from mindless material consumption and shows how to do it. Chapman shares his vision for an ""experience heavy, material light"" design sensibility. This vital and timely new design philosophy reveals how meaning emerges from designed encounters between people and things, explores ways to increase the quality and longevity of our relationships with objects and the systems behind them, and ultimately demonstrates why design can--and must--lead the transition to a sustainable future.",Design,235,N/A,0,en

e-Learning and the Science of Instruction,"Ruth C. Clark, Richard E. Mayer",John Wiley & Sons,2016-02-19,"The essential e-learning design manual, updated with the latest research, design principles, and examples e-Learning and the Science of Instruction is the ultimate handbook for evidence-based e-learning design. Since the first edition of this book, e-learning has grown to account for at least 40% of all training delivery media. However, digital courses often fail to reach their potential for learning effectiveness and efficiency. This guide provides research-based guidelines on how best to present content with text, graphics, and audio as well as the conditions under which those guidelines are most effective. This updated fourth edition describes the guidelines, psychology, and applications for ways to improve learning through personalization techniques, coherence, animations, and a new chapter on evidence-based game design. The chapter on the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning introduces three forms of cognitive load which are revisited throughout each chapter as the psychological basis for chapter principles. A new chapter on engagement in learning lays the groundwork for in-depth reviews of how to leverage worked examples, practice, online collaboration, and learner control to optimize learning. The updated instructor's materials include a syllabus, assignments, storyboard projects, and test items that you can adapt to your own course schedule and students. Co-authored by the most productive instructional research scientist in the world, Dr. Richard E. Mayer, this book distills copious e-learning research into a practical manual for improving learning through optimal design and delivery. Get up to date on the latest e-learning research Adopt best practices for communicating information effectively Use evidence-based techniques to engage your learners Replace popular instructional ideas, such as learning styles with evidence-based guidelines Apply evidence-based design techniques to optimize learning games e-Learning continues to grow as an alternative or adjunct to the classroom, and correspondingly, has become a focus among researchers in learning-related fields. New findings from research laboratories can inform the design and development of e-learning. However, much of this research published in technical journals is inaccessible to those who actually design e-learning material. By collecting the latest evidence into a single volume and translating the theoretical into the practical, e-Learning and the Science of Instruction has become an essential resource for consumers and designers of multimedia learning.",Business & Economics,507,N/A,0,en

Rhetoric and the Arts of Design,"David S. Kaufer, Brian S. Butler",Routledge,2013-11-26,"The design arts -- from the design of buildings and machines to software and interfaces -- are associated with types of knowledge and performance thought to be structured, modular, and systematic. Such arts have become increasingly prestigious in our technocratic society. Since Aristotle, the art of rhetoric was conceived as a loosely structured ""practical"" art thought to be limited in the extent to which it could mimic more precise subject matters. The art of rhetoric has been controversial since classical times, but its status has sunk even lower since the industrial revolution -- a point when civic cultures began to cede authority and control to the cultures of specialized experts. Many sympathizers of rhetoric have resisted its decline by calling for a civic art of public discourse to stand in opposition to a technocratic specialized discourse that has come, increasingly, to disenfranchise the ordinary citizen. This is the first book to question the rhetoric/technical knowledge split from a more fundamental perspective. To get some perspective on what is at stake in rhetoric's traditional classification as a ""practical"" art, the authors: * explore the distinction between practical and design arts; * enumerate the various criteria cited in the literature for qualifying a cluster of knowledge and performative skills to count as an art of design; * show how the knowledge and performative skills associated with the art of rhetoric meet the major requirements of design knowledge; * propose a general architecture of rhetorical design, one descriptive both of civic address and specialized academic argument; * turn to the Lincoln/Douglas debates to embody and provide some empirical support and illustration for their architecture; * demonstrate how Lincoln and Douglas can be thought of as expert designers whose rhetoric is highly structured and modular; and * explain how the rhetoric of both rhetorical agents can be represented in the layers and modules that one needs to display plans for buildings, software, or other design artifacts. These layers and modules are not just post hoc annotations of the debates; they also illuminate new and systematic ways for viewing the debates -- and by implication, other specimens of rhetoric -- in terms of strategies of artistic production. Kaufer and Butler conclude their presentation by citing some of the research and educational implications that follow from housing rhetoric within the family of design arts.",Language Arts & Disciplines,341,N/A,0,en

Gender Equality Results in ADB Projects,"Juliet Hunt, Kate Nethercott, Helen T.

The assessment of loans in Indonesia, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam found that positive gender equality results were achieved due to the implementation of gender action plans and provisions. Gender action plans were effective tools for ensuring that both women and men participated in and benefited from projects. Gender equality results and gender action plans contributed directly to achieving loan outcomes and improved project effectiveness in microfinance, rural water supply, urban environmental sanitation, health, education, multisectoral rural development, and infrastructure loans.

Facebook's privacy settings, which have outed gay teens to their conservative parents, are working exactly as designed. Their ""real names"" initiative, which makes it easier for stalkers to re-find their victims, is working exactly as designed. Twitter's toxicity and lack of civil discourse is working exactly as it's designed to work.The world is working exactly as designed. And it's not working very well. Which means we need to do a better job of designing it. Design is a craft with an amazing amount of power. The power to choose. The power to influence. As designers, we need to see ourselves as gatekeepers of what we are bringing into the world, and what we choose not to bring into the world. Design is a craft with responsibility. The responsibility to help create a better world for all.Design is also a craft with a lot of blood on its hands. Every cigarette ad is on us. Every gun is on us. Every ballot that a voter cannot understand is on us. Every time social network's interface allows a stalker to find their victim, that's on us. The monsters we unleash into the world will carry your name.This book will make you see that design is a political act. What we choose to design is a political act. Who we choose to work for is a political act. Who we choose to work with is a political act. And, most importantly, the people we've excluded from these decisions is the biggest (and stupidest) political act we've made as a society.If you're a designer, this book might make you angry.

Jensen, Ditte Bendix Lanng",Taylor & Francis,2016-10-04,"Contemporary society is marked and defined by the ways in which mobile goods, bodies, vehicles, objects, and data are organized, moved and staged. Against the background of the ‘mobilities turn’ this book articulates a new and emerging research field, namely that of ‘mobilities design’. The book revolves around the following research question: How are design decisions and interventions staging mobilities? It builds upon the ‘Staging Mobilities’ model (Jensen 2013) in an exploratory inquiry into the problems and potentials of the design of mobilities. The exchange value between mobilities and design research is twofold. To mobilities research this means getting closer to the ‘material’, and to engage in the creative, exploratory and experimental approaches of the design world which offer new potential for innovative research. Design research, on the other hand, might enter into a fruitful relationship with mobilities research, offering a relational and mobile design thinking and a valuable basis for design reflections around the ubiquitous structures, spaces and systems of mobilities.",Social Science,189,N/A,0,en

Design Roots,"Stuart Walker, Martyn Evans, Tom Cassidy, Amy Twigger Holroyd, Jeyon Jung",Bloomsbury Publishing,2018-02-08,"Design Roots provides a comprehensive review of culturally significant designs, products and practices which are rooted to particular communities through making tradition and a sense of place. Many rich traditional practices associated with community, tacit knowledge and culture are being rapidly lost due to globalisation and urbanisation. Yet they have much to offer for the future in terms of sustainability, identity, wellbeing and new opportunities in design. This book considers the creative roots, the place-based ecologies, and deep understandings of cultural significance, not only in terms of history and tradition but also in terms of locale, social interactions, innovation, and change for the sustainment of culturally significant material productions. Importantly, these are not locked in time by sentimentality and nostalgia but are evolving, innovative, and adaptive to new technologies and changing circumstances. Contributing authors explore the historical roots of culturally significant designs, products and practices, emerging directions, amateur endeavours, enterprise models, business opportunities and the changing role and contribution of design in the creation of material cultures of significance, meaning and value. An international perspective is provided through case studies and research from North and South America, Africa, Europe, Asia and Australasia, with examples including Aran jumper production in Northern Ireland, weaving in Thailand, Iranian housing design, Brazilian street design and digital crafting in the United Kingdom.",Design,611,5,1,en

Paul T. Frankl and Modern American Design,"Christopher Long, Long",Yale University Press,2007-01-01,"A comprehensive view of the life, work, and ideas of one of the creative giants of modern American design Arriving in the United States in 1914, Viennese-born Paul T. Frankl (1886-1958) brought with him an outsider's fresh perspective and an enthusiasm for forging a uniquely American design aesthetic. In the years between the two world wars he, more than any other designer, helped shape the distinctive look of American modernism. This authoritative book draws on an extensive collection of unpublished documents and family papers and photographs to provide the first full account of Frankl's life and ideas. The book also explores the history of modern American design and the extent of Frankl's influence on its trajectory. In the early 1920s, Frankl opened a New York City shop that became an epicenter of American modernism. Over the next decades, his work encompassed everything from individual pieces of furniture and decorative accessories to entire interiors, and his style continuously evolved, from early ""Skyscraper"" furniture to relaxed and casual designs favored by the Hollywood elite in the 1930s to manufactured pieces for the mass market in the 1950s. The book charts the impact of Frankl's ideas on merchants and consumers, on his fellow designers, and on the changing look of American homes and workplaces. With close to 170 illustrations, Paul T. Frankl and Modern American Design is an essential reference on 20th-century design.",Design,259,N/A,0,en

Research Anthology on Emerging Technologies and Ethical Implications in Human Enhancement,"Management Association, Information Resources",IGI Global,2020-12-18,"Along with the introduction of technology in nearly every facet of human life comes the question of the ethical side of using technology to improve the human condition, whether that be physically or mentally. The capabilities of human enhancement technologies have created a dual-sided approach to discussing human enhancement: the critical approach of attempting to reach human perfection and the ethics within that idea and the endless capabilities of technology that have greatly impacted the medical field. It is essential to discuss both aspects within these emerging technologies, whether as separate entities or as cohesive units. Ranging from disease detection and treatment to implants and prosthetics to robotics and genetic engineering, human enhancement technologies are widespread and multi-purposed. By going beyond the capabilities of human hands, these technologies have propelled modern medicine and healthcare to new levels that have allowed humans to face new treatments or assistive technologies not seen before. The Research Anthology on Emerging Technologies and Ethical Implications in Human Enhancement covers the primary technologies and tools being used in medicine and healthcare along with discussions on the ethics of enhancing the human body. Topics covered include prosthetics and implants, robotics, human disorders/diseases and treatments and smart technologies, along with law and theory.

What Can a Body Do?,Sara Hendren,Penguin,2020-08-18,"Named a Best Book of the Year by NPR and LitHub Winner of the 2021 Science in Society Journalism Book Prize A fascinating and provocative new way of looking at the things we use and the spaces we inhabit, and a call to imagine a better-designed world for us all. Furniture and tools, kitchens and campuses and city streets—nearly everything human beings make and use is assistive technology, meant to bridge the gap between body and world. Yet unless, or until, a misfit between our own body and the world is acute enough to be understood as disability, we may never stop to consider—or reconsider—the hidden assumptions on which our everyday environment is built. In a series of vivid stories drawn from the lived experience of disability and the ideas and innovations that have emerged from it—from cyborg arms to customizable cardboard chairs to deaf architecture—Sara Hendren invites us to rethink the things and settings we live with. What might assistance based on the body’s stunning capacity for adaptation—rather than a rigid insistence on “normalcy”—look like? Can we foster interdependent, not just independent, living? How do we creatively engineer public spaces that allow us all to navigate our common terrain? By rendering familiar objects and environments newly strange and wondrous, What Can a Body Do? helps us imagine a future that will better meet the extraordinary range of our collective needs and desires.",Design,242,N/A,0,en

Temporary and Tactical Urbanism,"Quentin Stevens, Kim Dovey",Taylor & Francis,2022-09-06,"Temporary and Tactical Urbanism examines a key set of urban design strategies that have emerged in the twenty-first century. Such projects range from guerrilla gardens and bike lanes to more formalised temporary beaches and swimming pools, parklets, pop-up plazas and buildings and container towns. These practices enable diverse forms of economic, social and artistic life that are usually repressed by the fixities of urban form and its management. This book takes a thematic approach to explore what the scope of this practice is, and understand why it has risen to prominence, how it works, who is involved, and what its implications are for the future of city design and planning. It critically examines the material, social, economic and political complexities that surround and enable these small, ephemeral urban interventions. It identifies their short-term and long-term implications for urban intensity, diversity, creativity and adaptability. The book's insights into temporary and tactical urbanism have particular relevance in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has highlighted both the need and the possibility of quickly transforming urban spaces worldwide.

The Three and a Half Minute Transaction,"Mitu Gulati, Robert E. Scott",University of Chicago Press,2013,"""Boilerplate language in contracts tends to stick around long after its origins and purpose have been forgotten. Usually there are no serious repercussions, but sometimes it can cause unexpected problems. Such was the case with the obscure pari passu clause in cross-border sovereign debt contracts, when a Belgian court's novel judicial interpretation in Elliott Associates v. Peru rattled international finance by forcing a defaulting sovereign - for one of the first times in the market's centuries-long history - to repay its foreign creditors despite their refusal to enter into a restructuring agreement. Though neither party wanted this outcome, the vast majority of contracts subsequently issued demonstrate virtually no attempt to clarify the imprecise language of the clause. Using this case as a launching pad to explore the broader issue of 'stickiness' of contract boilerplate, Mitu Gulati and Robert E. Scott have sifted through more than one thousand sovereign debt contracts - dating back to the nineteenth century - and interviewed hundreds of practitioners to show that the problem actually lies in the nature of the modern corporate law firm. The financial pressure on large firms to maintain a high volume of transactions contributes to an array of problems that deter innovation and that are largely hidden from the individual lawyer tasked with drafting contracts. With the near certainty of massive sovereign debt structuring in Europe, The Three and a Half Minute Transaction speaks to critical issues facing the industry and has broader implications for contract design that will ensure it remains relevant to our understanding of legal practice long after the debt crisis has subsided""--Unedited summary from book jacket.",Law,243,N/A,0,en

Introduction to the Theory of Error-Correcting Codes,Vera Pless,John Wiley & Sons,2011-10-24,"A complete introduction to the many mathematical tools used to solve practical problems in coding. Mathematicians have been fascinated with the theory of error-correcting codes since the publication of Shannon's classic papers fifty years ago. With the proliferation of communications systems, computers, and digital audio devices that employ error-correcting codes, the theory has taken on practical importance in the solution of coding problems. This solution process requires the use of a wide variety of mathematical tools and an understanding of how to find mathematical techniques to solve applied problems. Introduction to the Theory of Error-Correcting Codes, Third Edition demonstrates this process and prepares students to cope with coding problems. Like its predecessor, which was awarded a three-star rating by the Mathematical Association of America, this updated and expanded edition gives readers a firm grasp of the timeless fundamentals of coding as well as the latest theoretical advances. This new edition features: * A greater emphasis on nonlinear binary codes * An exciting new discussion on the relationship between codes and combinatorial games * Updated and expanded sections on the Vashamov-Gilbert bound, van Lint-Wilson bound, BCH codes, and Reed-Muller codes * Expanded and updated problem sets.

Rocket Surgery Made Easy,Steve Krug,New Riders,2009-12-08,"It's been known for years that usability testing can dramatically improve products. But with a typical price tag of $5,000 to $10,000 for a usability consultant to conduct each round of tests, it rarely happens. In this how-to companion to Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, Steve Krug spells out a streamlined approach to usability testing that anyone can easily apply to their own Web site, application, or other product. (As he said in Don't Make Me Think, ""It's not rocket surgery"".) Using practical advice, plenty of illustrations, and his trademark humor, Steve explains how to: Test any design, from a sketch on a napkin to a fully-functioning Web site or application Keep your focus on finding the most important problems (because no one has the time or resources to fix them all) Fix the problems that you find, using his ""The least you can do"" approach By paring the process of testing and fixing products down to its essentials (""A morning a month, that's all we ask""), Rocket Surgery makes it realistic for teams to test early and often, catching problems while it's still easy to fix them. Rocket Surgery Made Easy adds demonstration videos to the proven mix of clear writing, before-and-after examples, witty illustrations, and practical advice that made Don't Make Me Think so popular.",Computers,169,4,1,en

Widely heralded as a “masterful” (Washington Post) and “essential” (Slate) history of the modern American metropolis, Richard Rothstein’s The Color of Law offers “the most forceful argument ever published on how federal, state, and local governments gave rise to and reinforced neighborhood segregation” (William Julius Wilson). Exploding the myth of de facto segregation arising from private prejudice or the unintended consequences of economic forces, Rothstein describes how the American government systematically imposed residential segregation: with undisguised racial zoning; public housing that purposefully segregated previously mixed communities; subsidies for builders to create whites-only suburbs; tax exemptions for institutions that enforced segregation; and support for violent resistance to African Americans in white neighborhoods. A groundbreaking, “virtually indispensable” study that has already transformed our understanding of twentieth-century urban history (Chicago Daily Observer), The Color of Law forces us to face the obligation to remedy our unconstitutional past.",Social Science,243,N/A,0,en

Supreme,Aaron Bondaroff,N/A,2010,"The first monograph on the iconic independent New York street fashion label Supreme. In April 1994, Supreme opened its doors on Lafayette Street in downtown Manhattan and became the home of New York City skate culture. Challenging the dominance of the established Wes Coast skater scene and the new conservatism of 1990s New York, Supreme defined the aesthetic of an era of rebellious cool that reached from skaters to fashionistas and hip hop heads. Over the last sixteen years, the brand has stayed true to its roots while collaborating with some of the most groundbreaking artists and designers of its generation, and with stores in Los Angeles and Japan has become an international icon of independent counter-cultural style. This definitive monograph - with written contributions from contrasting arbiters of style, Aaron Bondaroff and Glenn O'Brien, and including an interview between founder James Jebbia and the artist KAWS - brings together the disparate elements of the brand's output, from legendary advertising campaigns to especially commissioned skateboard designs, photographs, and artworks, and a comprehensive index of their products to date. Including collaborations with Jeff Koons, Richard Prince, Damien Hirst, Public Enemy, Lou Reed, and Futura 2000 among many others, this richly illustrated book is a survey of sixteen years of contemporary street fashion and culture reflected in the pioneering work of one of New York's most influential independent labels.",Brand name products,314,N/A,0,en

Out of the blue, he's offered the ride on the odds-on Derby favorite, Knidos, who is owned by billionaire industrialist Simms Mulraven. But his hopes for a triumphant Derby week turn to ashes when he's offered half a million dollars to hold Knidos and set off a betting bonanza for criminal cartels around the world.And that's nothing to the choices he must make when Mulraven's idealistic young daughter Jessica demands he sacrifice what's left of his career, not to mention his life, to save Knidos from people who would ruin the great horse for their own financial gain.As the Derby draws near, the greatest spectacle in sports becomes a testing ground of Chris Englund's courage.

Learn to increase the effectiveness, conversion rates, and usability of your own design projects by finding the answers to questions such as: What grabs and holds attention on a page or screen? What makes memories stick? What is more important, peripheral or central vision? How can you predict the types of errors that people will make? What is the limit to someone’s social circle? How do you motivate people to continue on to (the next step? What line length for text is best? Are some fonts better than others?

Algorithms for Optimization,"Mykel J. Kochenderfer, Tim A. Wheeler",MIT Press,2019-03-12,"A comprehensive introduction to optimization with a focus on practical algorithms for the design of engineering systems. This book offers a comprehensive introduction to optimization with a focus on practical algorithms. The book approaches optimization from an engineering perspective, where the objective is to design a system that optimizes a set of metrics subject to constraints. Readers will learn about computational approaches for a range of challenges, including searching high-dimensional spaces, handling problems where there are multiple competing objectives, and accommodating uncertainty in the metrics. Figures, examples, and exercises convey the intuition behind the mathematical approaches. The text provides concrete implementations in the Julia programming language. Topics covered include derivatives and their generalization to multiple dimensions; local descent and first- and second-order methods that inform local descent; stochastic methods, which introduce randomness into the optimization process; linear constrained optimization, when both the objective function and the constraints are linear; surrogate models, probabilistic surrogate models, and using probabilistic surrogate models to guide optimization; optimization under uncertainty; uncertainty propagation; expression optimization; and multidisciplinary design optimization. Appendixes offer an introduction to the Julia language, test functions for evaluating algorithm performance, and mathematical concepts used in the derivation and analysis of the optimization methods discussed in the text. The book can be used by advanced undergraduates and graduate students in mathematics, statistics, computer science, any engineering field, (including electrical engineering and aerospace engineering), and operations research, and as a reference for professionals.",Computers,521,N/A,0,en

Salitore Amazd is an imperial adjudicator, an enforcer of the law and keeper of the peace across the vast, desert stretches of the Indrim Empire's southern reaches known as the Outlands. For Sali, the job means long days in the saddle, constant travel, and hours of rugged, wilderness beauty far from the intrigue and politicking of the empire's core. Until a trainload of convicted prisoners, led by a noble named Nirren, vanishes from a high-security engine in an unprecedented escape, leaving behind only bodies, confused survivors, and a public letter accusing Sali of being a co-conspirator ... as well as a fellow idealist in their forthcoming revolution. An accusation with no evidence, but more than enough to turn the public eye of the empire in his direction. Now forcibly partnered with Meelo Karn, a member of the imperial inquisition with her own ties to the convicts, it's up to both of them to track down Nirren and his gang before they engulf the Outlands in a political firestorm that burns it to the ground. Be it wild animals, unfriendly locals, or even encounters with the enigmatic, steam-driven Grey Knights ... Sali and Meelo have a call to deliver justice. And justice will be done.",,634,N/A,0,en

C++ Coding Standards,"Herb Sutter, Andrei Alexandrescu",Pearson Education,2004-10-25,"Consistent, high-quality coding standards improve software quality, reduce time-to-market, promote teamwork, eliminate time wasted on inconsequential matters, and simplify maintenance. Now, two of the world's most respected C++ experts distill the rich collective experience of the global C++ community into a set of coding standards that every developer and development team can understand and use as a basis for their own coding standards. The authors cover virtually every facet of C++ programming: design and coding style, functions, operators, class design, inheritance, construction/destruction, copying, assignment, namespaces, modules, templates, genericity, exceptions, STL containers and algorithms, and more. Each standard is described concisely, with practical examples. From type definition to error handling, this book presents C++ best practices, including some that have only recently been identified and standardized-techniques you may not know even if you've used C++ for years. Along the way, you'll find answers to questions like What's worth standardizing--and what isn't? What are the best ways to code for scalability? What are the elements of a rational error handling policy? How (and why) do you avoid unnecessary initialization, cyclic, and definitional dependencies? When (and how) should you use static and dynamic polymorphism together? How do you practice ""safe"" overriding? When should you provide a no-fail swap? Why and how should you prevent exceptions from propagating across module boundaries? Why shouldn't you write namespace declarations or directives in a header file? Why should you use STL vector and string instead of arrays? How do you choose the right STL search or sort algorithm? What rules should you follow to ensure type-safe code? Whether you're working alone or with others, C++ Coding Standards will help you write cleaner code--and write it faster, with fewer hassles and less frustration.",Computers,489,N/A,0,en

Theory and Application of Uniform Experimental Designs,"Kai-Tai Fang, Min-Qian Liu, Hong Qin, Yong-Dao Zhou",Springer,2018-10-02,"The book provides necessary knowledge for readers interested in developing the theory of uniform experimental design. It discusses measures of uniformity, various construction methods of uniform designs, modeling techniques, design and modeling for experiments with mixtures, and the usefulness of the uniformity in block, factorial and supersaturated designs. Experimental design is an important branch of statistics with a long history, and is extremely useful in multi-factor experiments. Involving rich methodologies and various designs, it has played a key role in industry, technology, sciences and various other fields. A design that chooses experimental points uniformly scattered on the domain is known as uniform experimental design, and uniform experimental design can be regarded as a fractional factorial design with model uncertainty, a space-filling design for computer experiments, a robust design against the model specification, and a supersaturated design and can be applied to experiments with mixtures.",Mathematics,312,N/A,0,en

Nostalgia is a form of resistant commemoration that can tell designers what users value about past designs, why they might feel excluded from the present, and what they wish to recover in the future.

Optimization of Large Structural Systems,George I. N. Rozvany,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-11-21,"G.I.N. Rozvany ASI Director, Professor of Structural Design, FB 10, Essen University, Essen, Germany Structural optimization deals with the optimal design of all systems that consist, at least partially, of solids and are subject to stresses and deformations. This inte grated discipline plays an increasingly important role in all branches of technology, including aerospace, structural, mechanical, civil and chemical engineering as well as energy generation and building technology. In fact, the design of most man made objects, ranging from space-ships and long-span bridges to tennis rackets and artificial organs, can be improved considerably if human intuition is enhanced by means of computer-aided, systematic decisions. In analysing highly complex structural systems in practice, discretization is un avoidable because closed-form analytical solutions are only available for relatively simple, idealized problems. To keep discretization errors to a minimum, it is de sirable to use a relatively large number of elements. Modern computer technology enables us to analyse systems with many thousand degrees of freedom. In the optimization of structural systems, however, most currently available methods are restricted to at most a few hundred variables or a few hundred active constraints.",Technology & Engineering,1201,N/A,0,en

Optimal Design,S. Silvey,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-03-09,"Prior to the 1970's a substantial literature had accumulated on the theory of optimal design, particularly of optimal linear regression design. To a certain extent the study of the subject had been piecemeal, different criteria of optimality having been studied separately. Also to a certain extent the topic was regarded as being largely of theoretical interest and as having little value for the practising statistician. However during this decade two significant developments occurred. It was observed that the various different optimality criteria had several mathematical properties in common; and general algorithms for constructing optimal design measures were developed. From the first of these there emerged a general theory of remarkable simplicity and the second at least raised the possibility that the theory would have more practical value. With respect to the second point there does remain a limiting factor as far as designs that are optimal for parameter estimation are concerned, and this is that the theory assumes that the model be collected is known a priori. This of course underlying data to is seldom the case in practice and it often happens that designs which are optimal for parameter estimation allow no possibility of model validation. For this reason the theory of design for parameter estimation may well have to be combined with a theory of model validation before its practical potential is fully realized. Nevertheless discussion in this monograph is limited to the theory of design optimal for parameter estimation.",Science,94,N/A,0,en
Governing by Design,Aggregate Architectural History Collaborative,University of Pittsburgh Pre,2012-04-29,"Governing by Design offers a unique perspective on twentieth-century architectural history. It disputes the primacy placed on individuals in the design and planning process and instead looks to the larger influences of politics, culture, economics, and globalization to uncover the roots of how our built environment evolves. In these chapters, historians offer their analysis on design as a vehicle for power and as a mediator of social currents. Power is defined through a variety of forms: modernization, obsolescence, technology, capital, ergonomics, biopolitics, and others. The chapters explore the diffusion of power through the establishment of norms and networks that frame human conduct, action, identity, and design. They follow design as it functions through the body, in the home, and at the state and international level. Overall, Aggregate views the intersection of architecture with the human need for what Foucault termed ""governmentality""—societal rules, structures, repetition, and protocols—as a way to provide security and tame risk. Here, the conjunction of power and the power of design reinforces governmentality and infuses a sense of social permanence despite the exceedingly fluid nature of societies and the disintegration of cultural memory in the modern era.",Architecture,302,N/A,0,en

Open Design Systems,A.R.M. Wolfert,IOS Press,2023-08-29,"Current systems design and decision management methodologies can be single-sided, ignoring or failing to capture the dynamic interplay between multi-stakeholder preferences (‘what they want’) and system performances (‘what they can’). In addition, these methodologies often contain fundamental modelling errors and do not provide single best-fit solutions. This leaves designers or decision-makers without unique answers to their problems. Above all, mainstream higher education primarily applies instructivist and research-based learning methods, and therefore does not adequately prepare students for designing solutions to future complex problems. This book introduces both a state-of-the-art participatory design methodology (Odesys), and a design-based learning concept (ODL), which together overcome the aforementioned issues. Odesys is a pure act of open design integration to confront conflicting socio-technical interests and is the key to unlocking these complexities to deliver socially responsible systems. Odesys’ design engine, the Preferendus, enables stakeholders to cooperatively identify their best-fit design synthesis. It employs a novel optimisation method that maximises the aggregated preferences, integrating sound mathematical and extended U-modelling via open technical-, social-, and purpose cycles. The art of ODL is a constructivist design-based and well-proven learning concept fostering students’ design capabilities to become open and persistent problem solvers. It is a reflective, creative, and engaged learning approach that opens human development and unlocks new knowledge and solutions. The author also introduces new management features such as the corporate social identifier (CSI), the ‘socio-eco’ threefold organization model and U-model based open loop management. Finally, the author places Odesys & ODL within the integrative context of empiricism, rationalism, spiritualism, and constructivism to unite the open design impulse. This book will be of interest to both academics and practitioners working in the field of complex systems design and managerial decision-making, and functions as a textbook on systems design and management for master students from diverse backgrounds. Prof.dr.ir. A.R.M. (Rogier) Wolfert has worked with R&D groups at various (inter)national universities and research institutes for the past 30 years. Since 2013, he has been professor of engineering asset management at Delft University of Technology.

Unitals in Projective Planes,"Susan Barwick, Gary Ebert",Springer Science & Business Media,2009-04-03,"This book is a monograph on unitals embedded in ?nite projective planes. Unitals are an interesting structure found in square order projective planes, and numerous research articles constructing and discussing these structures have appeared in print. More importantly, there still are many open pr- lems, and this remains a fruitful area for Ph.D. dissertations. Unitals play an important role in ?nite geometry as well as in related areas of mathematics. For example, unitals play a parallel role to Baer s- planes when considering extreme values for the size of a blocking set in a square order projective plane (see Section 2.3). Moreover, unitals meet the upper bound for the number of absolute points of any polarity in a square order projective plane (see Section 1.5). From an applications point of view, the linear codes arising from unitals have excellent technical properties (see 2 Section 6.4). The automorphism group of the classical unitalH =H(2,q ) is 2-transitive on the points ofH, and so unitals are of interest in group theory.

Fighting the Great War at Sea,Norman Friedman,Seaforth Publishing,2014-10-22,"The overriding image of the First World War is the bloody stalemate of the Western Front, but although much of the action did occur on land, the overall shape of the war _ even the inevitability of British participation _ arose out of its maritime character. It was essentially a struggle about access to worldwide resources, most clearly seen in the desperate German attempts to deal with the American industrial threat, which ultimately levered the United States into the war, and thus a consequence of British sea control.rn This radical new book concentrates on the way in which each side tried to use or deny the sea to the other, and in so doing it describes rapid wartime changes not only in ship and weapon technology but also in the way naval warfare was envisaged and fought. Combat produced many surprises: some, like the impact of the mine and torpedo, are familiar, but this book also brings to light many previously unexplored subjects, like creative new tactical practices and improved command and control.rn The contrast between expectation and reality had enormous consequences not only for the course of the war but also for the way navies developed afterwards.

Davis B. Bobrow and John S. Dryzek believe that now more than ever a clear understanding of the approaches available - the assumptions consciously or unconsciously adopted by their practitioners - is crucial to the practice of intellectually defensible and socially responsible analysis of public policy.Policy Analysis by Design examines the approaches to public policy taken by those who try to teach it, write about it, and influence it through major analysis. Bobrow and Dryzek systematically compare the five major contending analytical frames of reference: welfare economics, public choice, social structure, information processing, and political philosophy. The workings of each frame are illustrated by means of a common, if imaginary, policy case - air pollution in the hypothetical Smoke Valley.Bobrow and Dryzek discover that many important distinctions emerge among the major frames of reference, differences which should help to determine when to choose what approach. The authors conclude by suggesting how policy analysis should be conducted, and how policy analysts should be trained, in the face of such diversity.The concerns of Policy Analysis by Design are deeper and broader than most books in the field, breaking new ground. Bobrow and Dryzek make the case that policy analysts should balance their attention to technique with an understanding of the rationales underlying their interventions in policy processes. Policy Analysis by Design, based on this fundamental principle, should stimulate debate about basic choices that policy analysts must make.",Political Science,255,N/A,0,en

Functional Approach to Optimal Experimental Design,Viatcheslav B. Melas,Springer Science & Business Media,2006-04-20,"The present book is devoted to studying optimal experimental designs for a wide class of linear and nonlinear regression models. This class includes polynomial, trigonometrical, rational, and exponential models as well as many particular models used in ecology and microbiology. As the criteria of optimality, the well known D-, E-, and c-criteria are implemented. The main idea of the book is to study the dependence of optimal - signs on values of unknown parameters and on the bounds of the design interval. Such a study can be performed on the base of the Implicit Fu- tion Theorem, the classical result of functional analysis. The idea was ?rst introduced in the author’s paper (Melas, 1978) for nonlinear in parameters exponential models. Recently, it was developed for other models in a n- ber of works (Melas (1995, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2005), Dette, Melas (2002, 2003), Dette, Melas, Pepelyshev (2002, 2003, 2004b), and Dette, Melas, Biederman (2002)). Thepurposeofthepresentbookistobringtogethertheresultsobtained and to develop further underlying concepts and tools. The approach, m- tioned above, will be called the functional approach.

Model-Assisted Bayesian Designs for Dose Finding and Optimization,"Ying Yuan, Ruitao Lin, J. Jack Lee",CRC Press,2022-11-11,"Bayesian adaptive designs provide a critical approach to improve the efficiency and success of drug development that has been embraced by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This is particularly important for early phase trials as they form the basis for the development and success of subsequent phase II and III trials. The objective of this book is to describe the state-of-the-art model-assisted designs to facilitate and accelerate the use of novel adaptive designs for early phase clinical trials. Model-assisted designs possess avant-garde features where superiority meets simplicity. Model-assisted designs enjoy exceptional performance comparable to more complicated model-based adaptive designs, yet their decision rules often can be pre-tabulated and included in the protocol—making implementation as simple as conventional algorithm-based designs. An example is the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design, the first dose-finding design to receive the fit-for-purpose designation from the FDA. This designation underscores the regulatory agency's support of the use of the novel adaptive design to improve drug development. Features Represents the first book to provide comprehensive coverage of model-assisted designs for various types of dose-finding and optimization clinical trials Describes the up-to-date theory and practice for model-assisted designs Presents many practical challenges, issues, and solutions arising from early-phase clinical trials Illustrates with many real trial applications Offers numerous tips and guidance on designing dose finding and optimization trials Provides step-by-step illustrations of using software to design trials Develops a companion website (www.trialdesign.org) to provide freely available, easy-to-use software to assist learning and implementing model-assisted designs Written by internationally recognized research leaders who pioneered model-assisted designs from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, this book shows how model-assisted designs can greatly improve the efficiency and simplify the design, conduct, and optimization of early-phase dose-finding trials. It should therefore be a very useful practical reference for biostatisticians, clinicians working in clinical trials, and drug regulatory professionals, as well as graduate students of biostatistics. Novel model-assisted designs showcase the new KISS principle: Keep it simple and smart!",Medical,239,N/A,0,en

The Ecology of Human Development,Urie BRONFENBRENNER,Harvard University Press,2009-06-30,"Here is a book that challenges the very basis of the way psychologists have studied child development. According to Urie Bronfenbrenner, one of the world's foremost developmental psychologists, laboratory studies of the child's behavior sacrifice too much in order to gain experimental control and analytic rigor. Laboratory observations, he argues, too often lead to ""the science of the strange behavior of children in strange situations with strange adults for the briefest possible periods of time."" To understand the way children actually develop, Bronfenbrenner believes that it will be necessary to observe their behavior in natural settings, while they are interacting with familiar adults over prolonged periods of time. This book offers an important blueprint for constructing such a new and ecologically valid psychology of development. The blueprint includes a complete conceptual framework for analysing the layers of the environment that have a formative influence on the child. This framework is applied to a variety of settings in which children commonly develop, ranging from the pediatric ward to daycare, school, and various family configurations. The result is a rich set of hypotheses about the developmental consequences of various types of environments. Where current research bears on these hypotheses, Bronfenbrenner marshals the data to show how an ecological theory can be tested. Where no relevant data exist, he suggests new and interesting ecological experiments that might be undertaken to resolve current unknowns. Bronfenbrenner's groundbreaking program for reform in developmental psychology is certain to be controversial. His argument flies in the face of standard psychological procedures and challenges psychology to become more relevant to the ways in which children actually develop. It is a challenge psychology can ill-afford to ignore.",Psychology,349,N/A,0,en

Building Access,Aimi Hamraie,U of Minnesota Press,2017-11-01,"“All too often,” wrote disabled architect Ronald Mace, “designers don’t take the needs of disabled and elderly people into account.” Building Access investigates twentieth-century strategies for designing the world with disability in mind. Commonly understood in terms of curb cuts, automatic doors, Braille signs, and flexible kitchens, Universal Design purported to create a built environment for everyone, not only the average citizen. But who counts as “everyone,” Aimi Hamraie asks, and how can designers know? Blending technoscience studies and design history with critical disability, race, and feminist theories, Building Access interrogates the historical, cultural, and theoretical contexts for these questions, offering a groundbreaking critical history of Universal Design. Hamraie reveals that the twentieth-century shift from “design for the average” to “design for all” took place through liberal political, economic, and scientific structures concerned with defining the disabled user and designing in its name. Tracing the co-evolution of accessible design for disabled veterans, a radical disability maker movement, disability rights law, and strategies for diversifying the architecture profession, Hamraie shows that Universal Design was not just an approach to creating new products or spaces, but also a sustained, understated activist movement challenging dominant understandings of disability in architecture, medicine, and society. Illustrated with a wealth of rare archival materials, Building Access brings together scientific, social, and political histories in what is not only the pioneering critical account of Universal Design but also a deep engagement with the politics of knowing, making, and belonging in twentieth-century United States.",Architecture,479,N/A,0,en

First Czech Reader for Beginners,Lilie Hašek,Audiolego,2019-06-24,"The book consists of Beginner and Elementary courses with parallel Czech-English texts. The author maintains learners' motivation with funny stories about real life situations such as meeting people, studying, job searches, working etc. The method utilizes the natural human ability to remember words used in texts repeatedly and systematically. The second and the following chapters of the Beginner course have only about 30 new words each. Language text with a parallel translation has helped many to uncover their potential for learning multiple languages. Whether you are learning a language as a hobby or for a necessary purpose, you will find such books are supportive. It can usually take you from one to three months to finish a bilingual graded reader at beginner level (A1) and elementary level (A2). The amount of time depends on your previous experience with learning foreign languages and on your personal abilities. At this point you should be able to ask and answer simple questions with the following questioning words: What? Who? Where? When? Which? How many/much? As you improve and become more confident in your ability to use the new language, you can move on to the next reader level and continue your language-learning journey. The book is equipped with the audio tracks. The address of the home page of the book on the Internet, where audio files are available for listening and downloading, is listed at the beginning of the book on the copyright page.

Invisibility by Design,Gabriella Lukács,Duke University Press,2020-01-03,"In the wake of labor market deregulation during the 2000s, online content sharing and social networking platforms were promoted in Japan as new sites of work that were accessible to anyone. Enticed by the chance to build personally fulfilling careers, many young women entered Japan's digital economy by performing unpaid labor as photographers, net idols, bloggers, online traders, and cell phone novelists. While some women leveraged digital technology to create successful careers, most did not. In Invisibility by Design Gabriella Lukács traces how these women's unpaid labor became the engine of Japan's digital economy. Drawing on interviews with young women who strove to sculpt careers in the digital economy, Lukács shows how platform owners tapped unpaid labor to create innovative profit-generating practices without employing workers, thereby rendering women's labor invisible. By drawing out the ways in which labor precarity generates a demand for feminized affective labor, Lukács underscores the fallacy of the digital economy as a more democratic, egalitarian, and inclusive mode of production.",Social Science,147,N/A,0,en

Human Work Interaction Design: Designing for Human Work,"Torkil Clemmensen, Pedro Campos, Rikke Orngreen, Annelise Mark Pejtersen, William Wong",Springer,2006-12-31,"This book records the very first Working Conference of the newly established IFIP Working Group on Human-Work Interaction Design, which was hosted by the University of Madeira in 2006. The theme of the conference was on synthesizing work analysis and design sketching, with a particular focus on how to read design sketches within different approaches to analysis and design of human-work interaction. Authors were encouraged to submit papers about design sketches - for interfaces, for organizations of work etc. - that they themselves had worked on. During the conference, they presented the lessons they had learnt from the design and evaluation process, citing reasons for why the designs worked or why they did not work. Researchers, designers and analysts in this way confronted concrete design problems in complex work domains and used this unique opportunity to share their own design problems and solutions with the community. To successfully practice and do research within Human - Work Interaction Design requires a high level of personal skill, which the conference aimed at by confronting designers and work analysts and those whose research is both analysis and design. They were asked to collaborate in small groups about analysis and solutions to a common design problem.",Computers,254,N/A,0,en

Proceedings of the 2023 2nd International Conference on Public Culture and Social Services (PCSS 2023),"Youbin Chen, Shakila Yacob, Joanna Rak, Jia Li",Springer Nature,2023-11-28,"This is an open access book. 2023 2nd International Conference on Public Culture and Social Services (PCSS 2023) was held on August 11–13, 2023 in Qingdao, China Public culture is a cultural form formed to meet the common needs of society, where everyone can participate in culture, enjoy culture, and create culture. A good public culture can not only enhance the happiness of residents, but also cultivate one's character through moral cultivation. Moreover, it can improve the charm, vitality, self-confidence and cohesion of the city, and promote the cultural exchanges between the city and the outside world. The more developed the economy is, the more powerful the country is, the more it attaches importance to the construction of Urban culture. Public culture is the basic culture of a city and has far-reaching significance in shaping Urban culture. Social services refer to activities in the fields of education, medical and health care, elderly care, childcare, housekeeping, culture, tourism, sports, and other social sectors that rely on diverse entities to provide services to meet the multi-level and diverse needs of the people. They are related to the most direct and practical interests of the general public. There is an essential difference between social services and for-profit commercial services, as they are welfare services. PCSS explores how to make society develop better and people feel happier by discussing the relationship between public culture and social services. The specific content, activities, and services provided by public culture need to be adapted to the level of social development and supply capacity, and therefore are dynamically adjusted, up-to-date, and tailored to local conditions. Public culture involves a wide range of social undertakings, including ideology, culture, news and publishing, radio and television, as well as national fitness, popular science, and mass rule of law cultural activities. Social services belong to the basic public services provided by the government, which is the most prominent feature of public culture compared to other cultural types and forms, and also the theoretical basis for forming a policy system for public cultural services. Public culture and social services interact with each other, and to a certain extent, public culture determines the type of social services, which in turn affects the development of public culture.",Social Science,470,N/A,0,en

Research Design in the Social Sciences,"Graeme Blair, Alexander Coppock, Macartan Humphreys",Princeton University Press,2023-08-29,"""This book is a proposed supplementary text that guides social scientists and their students to fully characterize and assess the properties of research designs before they implement them. The book leads readers to answer questions like: - What questions is my study honestly well-equipped to answer? - How do I choose between gathering less data on more units versus more data on fewer units? - If I'm right, how likely is it that my study will change the mind of a committed skeptic? - How sensitive are my findings to my assumptions? These questions are surprisingly tricky to answer even for the most seasoned researchers. A major part of the trouble is that most scholars lack a definition of what constitutes a complete research design. The book will help researchers and students to decide on a method of assessment and then to measure the strength of that research design. The book applies this framework for common social science research designs. The book has four parts: (1) an introduction to the general framework to conceptualize design; (2) a design library of standard design types for researchers to draw from; (3) a set of research principles to guide readers with data gathering, question formation, and analysis; and (4) an extension of the broader use of the approach and framework for researchers, critiques and peer reviewers, and also for research funders. Each chapter is anchored by a narrative theoretical section that are enhanced by interactive R modules to illustrate design tradeoffs. In addition, each chapter includes a ""lab,"" demonstrating how to implement and learn about each design; and exercises that extend the lab using interactive assessment tools. The book can be used independently as a supplemental course book for graduate and advanced graduate students, but is also supported by an online set of R repositories that could be used in conjunction with the book, as well as a piece of web software that allows researchers to assess designs without using the statistical packages""--",Political Science,392,N/A,0,en

Designing Our Way to a Better World,Thomas Fisher,U of Minnesota Press,2016-05-01,"Envisioning what we need, when it doesn’t yet exist: this, Thomas Fisher tells us, is what design does. And if what we need now is a better world—functioning schools, working infrastructure, thriving cities—why not design one? Fisher shows how the principles of design apply to services and systems that seem to evolve naturally, systems whose failures sometimes seem as arbitrary and inevitable as the weather. But the “invisible” systems we depend on for our daily lives (in education, politics, economics, and public health) are designed every bit as much as the products we buy and the environments we inhabit—and are just as susceptible to creative reimagining. Designing Our Way to a Better World challenges the assumptions that have led to so much poor performance in the public and private realms: that our schools cannot teach creativity, that our governments cannot predict the disasters that befall us, that our health system will protect us from pandemics, that our politics will remain polarized, that our economy cannot avoid inequality, and that our industry cannot help but pollute the environment. Targeting these assumptions, Fisher's approach reveals the power of design to synthesize our knowledge about the world into greater wholes. In doing so, this book opens up possible futures—and better futures—than the unsustainable and inequitable one we now face.",Architecture,339,N/A,0,en

Applied Min-max Approach to Missile Guidance and Control,"Shaul Gutman, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics",AIAA (American Institute of Aeronautics & Astronautics),2005,"This book is concerned with dynamical systems under a large uncertainty, and uses a min-max approach to achieve worst-case design. The book consists of two parts. The first part deals with robust control. It begines by developing linear controls to achieve relative stability (pole clustering) under parameter uncertainty. Surprisingly, the largest robustness radius in the parameter space is sometimes discontinuous (fragile) with respect to the control parameters. Then, the book discusses the control of nonlinear uncertain systems under matching conditions. The second part uses differential games to develop optimal guidance for homing missiles against maneuvering targets. The target maneuver is bounded, but otherwise, arbitrary. Using miss distance as the cost, the book develops closed form guidance laws, as well as miss distance formulae. In this way, the control loop (autopilot) and the guidance loop are coupled. A parameter study reveals the basic difference between minimum phase (canards) and non minimum phase (tail control) missiles. It also shows the influence of the autopilot parameters on the miss distance.",History,328,N/A,0,en

Designing Fonts,"Chris Campe, Ulrike Rausch",N/A,2020,"Type design is often presented in either such detail-obsessed complexity that it is not welcoming to beginners, or it is so simplified with the help of apps and web services that the resulting fonts are virtually useless. This book is different. It shows readers how to design professional fonts - without having to find out all of type design's secrets first. Designing Fonts teaches the basics of type design from sketched letters to finished font, offering an uncomplicated but thorough introduction to type design. With easy-to-follow instructions, many examples and professional tips, readers will learn how to design unique typefaces tailor-made for their own projects or customer orders. This book has two parts. Part 1 explains the theoretical, creative and technical basics of type design and font production. Six chapters then cover everything from alphabet to font, showing readers how to find and develop typeface ideas, design matching letters, produce fonts and expand them with special functions. Part 2 comprises eight workshops that explore how to design and implement different kinds of typefaces, from decorative interlocking display fonts with alternative letters to well-developed headline fonts with multiple cuts and OpenType features.",Design,0,N/A,0,en

Visual Design,Jim Krause,New Riders,2014-09-16,"Visual Design speaks design, through design, to designers, presenting 95 core design principles with concise text and a touch of visual wit. Author of the bestselling Index series on design basics, Jim Krause uses a combination of Helvetica and Dingbats to teach a wide range of design topics (both conceptually and compositionally related) in a one-topic-per-spread format. Using humor, practical tips, and inspiring visual examples, Krause makes it clear how each of the 95 axioms of effective design are relevant and applicable across all forms of visuals: print, Web, and fine arts. In this book, you’ll learn how to: • Direct the eye through your designs using size relationships, color, visual pathways, and typographic hints • Design effective compositions through grids, frames, outlines, dynamic spacing, symmetry, asymmetry, shading, patterns, and textures • Fool the eye with shadows, depth, op-art, and visual subtraction • Understand how color works and how to use it effectively • See and use type by understanding type rules as well as when and how to break them Visual Design is the first title in the brand new New Riders Creative Core series, which aims to provide instruction on the fundamental concepts and techniques that all designers must master to become skilled professionals.",Art,241,N/A,0,en

Design And Truth,Robert Grudin,Yale University Press,2010-04-20,"“If good design tells the truth,” writes Robert Grudin in this path-breaking book on esthetics and authority, “poor design tells a lie, a lie usually related . . . to the getting or abusing of power.” From the ornate cathedrals of Renaissance Europe to the much-maligned Ford Edsel of the late 1950s, all products of human design communicate much more than their mere intended functions. Design holds both psychological and moral power over us, and these forces may be manipulated, however subtly, to surprising effect. In an argument that touches upon subjects as seemingly unrelated as the Japanese tea ceremony, Italian mannerist painting, and Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello plantation, Grudin turns his attention to the role of design in our daily lives, focusing especially on how political and economic powers impress themselves on us through the built environment. Although architects and designers will find valuable insights here, Grudin’s intended audience is not exclusively the trained expert but all those who use designs and live within them every day.",Design,228,N/A,0,en
Operative Design,Anthony di Mari,BIS Publishers,2013-07-01,"The core idea for this book is the use of operative verbs as tools for designing space. These operative verbs abstract the idea of spatial formation to its most basic terms, allowing for an objective approach to create the foundation for subjective spatial design. Examples of these verbs are expand, inflate, nest, wist, lift, embed, merge and many more. Together they form a visual dictionary decoding the syntax of spatial verbs. The verbs are illustrated with three-dimensional diagrams and pictures of designs which show the verbs 'in action'. This approach was devised, tested, and applied to architectural studio instruction by Anthony Di Mari and Nora Yoo while teaching at Harvard University's Career Discovery Program in Architecture in 2010. As instructors and as recent graduates, they saw a need for this kind of catalogue from both sides - as a reference manual applicable to design students in all stages of their studies, as well as a teaching tool for instructors to help students understand the strong spatial potential of abstract operations.",Architecture,144,N/A,0,en

Mechanism Design,Rakesh V.

This analysis provides an account of the underlying mathematics of mechanism design based on linear programming. Three advantages characterize the approach. The first is simplicity: arguments based on linear programming are both elementary and transparent. The second is unity: the machinery of linear programming provides a way to unify results from disparate areas of mechanism design. The third is reach: the technique offers the ability to solve problems that appear to be beyond solutions offered by traditional methods. No claim is made that the approach advocated should supplant traditional mathematical machinery. Rather, the approach represents an addition to the tools of the economic theorist who proposes to understand economic phenomena through the lens of mechanism design.",Business & Economics,185,N/A,0,en

Applications of Power Electronics,"Frede Blaabjerg, Tomislav Dragicevic, Pooya Davari",MDPI,2019-06-24,"Power electronics technology is still an emerging technology, and it has found its way into many applications, from renewable energy generation (i.e., wind power and solar power) to electrical vehicles (EVs), biomedical devices, and small appliances, such as laptop chargers. In the near future, electrical energy will be provided and handled by power electronics and consumed through power electronics; this not only will intensify the role of power electronics technology in power conversion processes, but also implies that power systems are undergoing a paradigm shift, from centralized distribution to distributed generation. Today, more than 1000 GW of renewable energy generation sources (photovoltaic (PV) and wind) have been installed, all of which are handled by power electronics technology. The main aim of this book is to highlight and address recent breakthroughs in the range of emerging applications in power electronics and in harmonic and electromagnetic interference (EMI) issues at device and system levels as discussed in ‎robust and reliable power electronics technologies, including fault prognosis and diagnosis technique stability of grid-connected converters and ‎smart control of power electronics in devices, microgrids, and at system levels.",Technology & Engineering,476,N/A,0,en
Contemporary Ideas on Ship Stability and Capsizing in Waves,"Marcelo Almeida Santos Neves, Vadim L. Belenky, Jean Otto de Kat, Kostas Spyrou, Naoya Umeda",Springer Science & Business Media,2011-07-03,"During the last decade significant progress has been made in the field of ship stability. Yet in spite of the progress made, numerous scientific and practical challenges still exist with regard to the accurate prediction of extreme motion and capsize dynamics for intact and damaged vessels, the probabilistic nature of extreme events, criteria that properly reflect the physics and operational safety of an intact or damaged vessel, and ways to provide relevant information on safe ship handling to ship operators. This book provides a comprehensive review of the above issues through the selection of representative papers presented at the unique series of international workshops and conferences on ship stability held between 2000 and 2009.

Science vs. Religion,Steve Fuller,John Wiley & Sons,2013-04-24,"For centuries, science and religion have been portrayed as diametrically opposed. In this provocative new book, Steve Fuller examines the apparent clash between science and religion by focusing on the heated debates about evolution and intelligent design theory. In so doing, he claims that science vs. religion is in fact a false dichotomy. For Fuller, supposedly intellectual disputes, such as those between creationist and evolutionist accounts of life, often disguise other institutionally driven conflicts, such as the struggle between State and Church to be the source of legitimate authority in society. Nowadays many conservative anti-science groups support intelligent design theory, but Fuller argues that the theory's theological roots are much more radical, based on the idea that humans were created to fathom the divine plan, perhaps even complete it. He goes on to examine the unique political circumstances in the United States that make the emergence of intelligent design theory so controversial, yet so persistent. Finally, he considers the long-term prognosis, arguing that the future remains very much undecided as society reopens the question of what it means to be human. This book will appeal to all readers intrigued by the debates about creationism, intelligent design and evolution, especially those looking for an intellectually exciting confrontation with the politics and promise of intelligent design theory.",Science,149,4,1,en

Intelligent Design and Religion as a Natural Phenomenon,John S. Wilkins,Routledge,2017-03-02,"Over the past decade a strident public debate has arisen about the nature and origin of religions. Controversies include how exactly religion evolved, whether by individual or group selection, if it is adaptive, and if not, whether and how it is a side effect of evolution. This volume focuses on the issue of naturalizing religion: on the ways in which cognitive science and social sciences have treated religion as a natural phenomenon. It questions whether religious behaviour, institutions, and experiences can be explained in natural terms. The editor brings together some of the best published work on the definition of 'religion', intelligent design and the evolution of religion.",Science,559,N/A,0,en

Combinatorics,Robin J. Wilson,Oxford University Press,2016,"How many possible sudoku puzzles are there? In the lottery, what is the chance that two winning balls have consecutive numbers? Who invented Pascal's triangle? (it was not Pascal) Combinatorics, the branch of mathematics concerned with selecting, arranging, and listing or counting collections of objects, works to answer all these questions. Dating back some 3000 years, and initially consisting mainly of the study of permutations and combinations, its scope has broadened to include topics such as graph theory, partitions of numbers, block designs, design of codes, and latin squares. In this Very Short Introduction Robin Wilson gives an overview of the field and its applications in mathematics and computer theory, considering problems from the shortest routes covering certain stops to the minimum number of colours needed to colour a map with different colours for neighbouring countries.

Design Rights,Christopher V. Carani,Kluwer Law International B.V.,2017-09-25,"Protection of industrial and other designs has developed as a distinct and important area of intellectual property law. This book, while providing a solid foundation on the law regarding the protection and enforcement of design rights, focuses on the ever-present, and always contentious, issue of functionality in the context of design rights. While there is considerable harmonization on the fundamental principle that design rights regard aesthetic appearance and not underlying technical function, courts and legislatures the world over have long struggled with determining whether to permit, and how to interpret the scope of, designs rights directed at products whose appearancemay, partially or completely, be the result of functional consideration. This detailed country-by-country analysis provides clarity, insight, and guidance on the legal issues and practical implications of functionality in key jurisdictions worldwide. This book was developed within the framework of the International Association for the Protection of Intellectual Property (AIPPI), a non-affiliated, non-profit organization dedicated to improving and promoting the protection of intellectual property at both national and international levels. The authors of the country chapters have been carefully selected based on their extensive experience and in-depth knowledge about design protection in their respective jurisdictions. Each chapter considers such issues and topics as the following: • availability of protection – granting authority, statutory requirements, drawing requirements, and disclaimers; • tests or approaches applied to determine whether a design right is ineligiblefor protection based on functionality grounds, including related policy considerations; • strategies employed to mount, and fend off, challenges to design rights based on functionality; • determination of a design right’s scope of protection, including the impact of any visual elements of the overall design having appearances that are non-novel and/or functional; • tests or approaches applied to determine whether a visual element of a design right is excluded from the overall scope of protection based on functionality grounds, including related policy considerations; • examples of how visual elements of a design right whose appearance is driven by function are treated in infringement and validity contexts. Each chapter includes case law examples, hypothetical fact patterns, and graphic images of designs to bring issues to life. An introductory chapter covers the basic tenets of design rights, terminology, and discussion of design rights in relation to other areas of intellectual property. As a comparative law study and a collection of contributions from around the world on an important and controversial field, this book proves to be of tremendous practical interest for the industry involved and for the public. Applicants for design protection, parties involved in or contemplating enforcement proceedings, and interested legal practitioners will benefit greatly from its thorough comparative analysis and guidance. It is also exceptionally valuable as a matchless and thorough resource for academics and researchers interested in the international harmonization of intellectual property law.",Law,891,N/A,0,en

In this seminal work, fully revised and updated, Norman gives us the first steps towards demanding a person-centered redesign of the machines we use every day. Humans have always worked with objects to extend our cognitive powers, from counting on our fingers to designing massive supercomputers. But advanced technology does more than merely assist with memory—the machines we create begin to shape how we think and, at times, even what we value. In THINGS THAT MAKE US SMART, Donald Norman explores the complex interaction between human thought and the technology it creates, arguing for the development of machines that fit our minds, rather than minds that must conform to the machine.",Design,349,N/A,0,en

Hidden Lessons,Mehreen Baig,Coronet,2021-09-16,"You're in at 7am, there until 7pm and marking into the late hours. You've got one student who's a full time carer, another who's pregnant, and a third who's just joined a gang. You haven't got enough textbooks to go around, and one of the parents just called you an 'extremist'. You've just gone through a devastating heartbreak and you have to teach Romeo and Juliet to 30 hormonal 14 year olds. Welcome to life as a teacher. This is a world that all of us know, but most of us have completely forgotten. It's a world where you're working 50 hour weeks, but you're still just a part-time teacher because the rest of the time you're a security guard, a nurse, a counsellor, or a friend. It's also a world where you spend all day with some of the most interesting people you know. And even when the lesson plan has been abandoned, you're still learning. Mehreen started teaching at 21, and by the time she left 10 years later she'd learnt a bit about teenagers and a lot about life. This is her story.",Education,335,N/A,0,en

"Notes on Decor, Etc.",Paul Fortune,Rizzoli Publications,2021-03-30,"Interior design legend Paul Fortune opens his design portfolio and shares his inimitable worldview in this monograph-cum-memoir. Arriving in Los Angeles from London during the 1970s, Paul Fortune gradually made his way as a graphic artist, art director of music videos, and even nightclub owner. But with the renovation of his own now legendary Laurel Canyon house in 1978, Fortune's career as an interior designer was born. Fortune Design Studio, based in Los Angeles, has been operating since 1982, enjoying the patronage of discerning clients worldwide, whose ranks include Marc Jacobs, Sofia Coppola, and David Fincher. Exhibiting a distinct style widely recognized for its integration of refinement with lived-in comfort, Fortune's designs are uniquely geared toward accommodating the history and material integrity of each chosen venture. In Notes on Décor, Etc., Fortune--a natural raconteur--not only documents his favorite of these timelessly elegant projects but also his life and times as a designer, an expatriate, and an Angeleno in a one-of-a-kind chronicle that Architectural Digest, in its 2018 AD 100 list, describes as, ""A tell-all monograph-cum-memoir detailing significant projects and stories from Fortune's peregrinations through the beau monde.""",Architecture,0,N/A,0,en

Design with Climate,Victor Olgyay,Princeton University Press,2015-09-01,"Architects today incorporate principles of sustainable design as a matter of necessity. But the challenge of unifying climate control and building functionality, of securing a managed environment within a natural setting—and combating the harsh forces of wind, water, and sun—presented a new set of obstacles to architects and engineers in the mid-twentieth century. First published in 1963, Design with Climate was one of the most pioneering books in the field and remains an important reference for practitioners, teachers, and students, over fifty years later. In this book, Victor Olgyay explores the impact of climate on shelter design, identifying four distinct climatic regions and explaining the effect of each on orientation, air movement, site, and materials. He derives principles from biology, engineering, meteorology, and physics, and demonstrates how an analytical approach to climate management can merge into a harmonious and aesthetically sound design concept. This updated edition contains four new essays that provide unique insights on issues of climate design, showing how Olgyay's concepts work in contemporary practice. Ken Yeang, John Reynolds, Victor W. Olgyay, and Donlyn Lyndon explore bioclimatic design, eco design, and rational regionalism, while paying homage to Olgyay’s impressive groundwork and contributions to the field of architecture.",Architecture,219,N/A,0,en

Living with Complexity,Donald A. Norman,MIT Press,2016-02-12,"Why we don't really want simplicity, and how we can learn to live with complexity. If only today's technology were simpler! It's the universal lament, but it's wrong. In this provocative and informative book, Don Norman writes that the complexity of our technology must mirror the complexity and richness of our lives. It's not complexity that's the problem, it's bad design. Bad design complicates things unnecessarily and confuses us. Good design can tame complexity. Norman gives us a crash course in the virtues of complexity. Designers have to produce things that tame complexity. But we too have to do our part: we have to take the time to learn the structure and practice the skills. This is how we mastered reading and writing, driving a car, and playing sports, and this is how we can master our complex tools. Complexity is good. Simplicity is misleading. The good life is complex, rich, and rewarding—but only if it is understandable, sensible, and meaningful.",Technology & Engineering,309,N/A,0,en

"Textiles, Identity and Innovation: Design the Future","Gianni Montagna, Cristina Carvalho",CRC Press,2018-10-03,"D_TEX presents itself as a starting point at a crossroads of ideas and debates around the complex universe of Textile Design in all its forms, manifestations and dimensions. The textile universe, allied to mankind since its beginnings, is increasingly far from being an area of exhausted possibilities, each moment proposing important innovations that need a presentation, discussion and maturation space that is comprehensive and above all inter- and transdisciplinary. Presently, the disciplinary areas where the textile area is present are increasing and important, such as fashion, home textiles, technical clothing and accessories, but also construction and health, among others, and can provide new possibilities and different disciplinary areas and allowing the production of new knowledge. D_TEX proposes to join the thinking of design, with technologies, tradition, techniques, and related areas, in a single space where ideas are combined with the technique and with the projectual and research capacity, thus providing for the creation of concepts, opinions, associations of ideas, links and connections that allow the conception of ideas, products and services. The interdisciplinary nature of design is a reality that fully reaches the textile material in its essence and its practical application, through the synergy and contamination by the different interventions that make up the multidisciplinary teams of research. The generic theme of D_TEX Textile Design Conference 2017, held at Lisbon School of Architecture of the University of Lisbon, Portugal on November 2-4, 2017, is Design the Future, starting from the crossroads of ideas and debates, a new starting point for the exploration of textile materials, their identities and innovations in all their dimensions.",Design,468,N/A,0,en

The third edition begins with a detailed review of digital circuits (combinatorial, sequential, state machines, and FPGAs), thus providing a self-contained single reference for the teaching of digital circuit design with VHDL. In its coverage of VHDL-2008, it makes a clear distinction between VHDL for synthesis and VHDL for simulation. The text offers complete VHDL codes in examples as well as simulation results and comments. The significantly expanded examples and exercises include many not previously published, with multiple physical demonstrations meant to inspire and motivate students. The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students in VHDL and digital circuit design, and can be used as a professional reference for VHDL practitioners.

Lolita - The Story of a Cover Girl,"John Bertram, Yuri Leving",Simon and Schuster,2013-07-19,"What should Lolita look like? The question has dogged book-cover designers since 1955, when Lolita was first published in a plain green wrapper. The heroine of Vladimir Nabokov's classic novel has often been shown as a teenage seductress in heart-shaped glasses--a deceptive image that misreads the book but has seeped deep into our cultural life, from fashion to film. Lolita - The Story of a Cover Girl: Vladimir Nabokov's Novel in Art and Design reconsiders the cover of Lolita. Eighty renowned graphic designers and illustrators (including Paula Scher, Jessica Hische, Jessica Helfand, and Peter Mendelsund) offer their own takes on the book's jacket, while graphic-design critics and Nabokov scholars survey more than half a century of Lolita covers. You'll also find thoughtful essays from such design luminaries as Mary Gaitskill, Debbie Millman, Michael Bierut, Peter Mendelsund, Jessica Helfand, Alice Twemlow, Johanna Drucker, Leland de la Durantaye, Ellen Pifer, and Stephen Blackwell. Through the lenses of design and literature, Lolita - The Story of a Cover Girl tells the strange design history of one of the most important novels of the 20th century--and offers a new way for thinking visually about difficult books. You'll never look at Lolita the same way again.",Literary Criticism,772,N/A,0,en

The Lazy Genius Way,Kendra Adachi,WaterBrook,2021-08-17,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Being a Lazy Genius isn't about doing more or doing less. It’s about doing what matters to you. “I could not be more excited about this book.”—Jenna Fischer, actor and cohost of the Office Ladies podcast The chorus of “shoulds” is loud. You should enjoy the moment, dream big, have it all, get up before the sun, track your water consumption, go on date nights, and be the best. Or maybe you should ignore what people think, live on dry shampoo, be a negligent PTA mom, have a dirty house, and claim your hot mess like a badge of honor. It’s so easy to feel overwhelmed by the mixed messages of what it means to live well. Kendra Adachi, the creator of the Lazy Genius movement, invites you to live well by your own definition and equips you to be a genius about what matters and lazy about what doesn’t. Everything from your morning routine to napping without guilt falls into place with Kendra’s thirteen Lazy Genius principles, including: • Decide once • Start small • Ask the Magic Question • Go in the right order • Schedule rest Discover a better way to approach your relationships, work, and piles of mail. Be who you are without the complication of everyone else’s “shoulds.” Do what matters, skip the rest, and be a person again.",Self-Help,241,N/A,0,en

It has become impossible for all to have the time and resources to find, appraise and interpret this evidence and incorporate it into healthcare decisions. Cochrane Reviews respond to this challenge by identifying, appraising and synthesizing research-based evidence and presenting it in a standardized format, published in The Cochrane Library (www.thecochranelibrary.com). The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions contains methodological guidance for the preparation and maintenance of Cochrane intervention reviews. Written in a clear and accessible format, it is the essential manual for all those preparing, maintaining and reading Cochrane reviews. Many of the principles and methods described here are appropriate for systematic reviews applied to other types of research and to systematic reviews of interventions undertaken by others.

Start with Why,Simon Sinek,Penguin,2011-12-27,"The inspirational bestseller that ignited a movement and asked us to find our WHY Discover the book that is captivating millions on TikTok and that served as the basis for one of the most popular TED Talks of all time—with more than 56 million views and counting. Over a decade ago, Simon Sinek started a movement that inspired millions to demand purpose at work, to ask what was the WHY of their organization. Since then, millions have been touched by the power of his ideas, and these ideas remain as relevant and timely as ever. START WITH WHY asks (and answers) the questions: why are some people and organizations more innovative, more influential, and more profitable than others? Why do some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike? Even among the successful, why are so few able to repeat their success over and over? People like Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and the Wright Brothers had little in common, but they all started with WHY. They realized that people won't truly buy into a product, service, movement, or idea until they understand the WHY behind it. START WITH WHY shows that the leaders who have had the greatest influence in the world all think, act and communicate the same way—and it's the opposite of what everyone else does. Sinek calls this powerful idea The Golden Circle, and it provides a framework upon which organizations can be built, movements can be led, and people can be inspired. And it all starts with WHY.",Business & Economics,257,4.5,2,en

Network Design with Applications to Transportation and Logistics,"Teodor Gabriel Crainic, Michel Gendreau, Bernard Gendron",Springer Nature,2021-07-16,"This book explores the methodological and application developments of network design in transportation and logistics. It identifies trends, challenges and research perspectives in network design for these areas. Network design is a major class of problems in operations research where network flow, combinatorial and mixed integer optimization meet. The analysis and planning of transportation and logistics systems continues to be one of the most important application areas of operations research. Networks provide the natural way of depicting such systems, so the optimal design and operation of networks is the main methodological area of operations research that is used for the analysis and planning of these systems. This book defines the current state of the art in the general area of network design, and then turns to its applications to transportation and logistics. New research challenges are addressed. Network Design with Applications to Transportation and Logistics is divided into three parts. Part I examines basic design problems including fixed-cost network design and parallel algorithms. After addressing the basics, Part II focuses on more advanced models. Chapters cover topics such as multi-facility network design, flow-constrained network design, and robust network design. Finally Part III is dedicated entirely to the potential application areas for network design. These areas range from rail networks, to city logistics, to energy transport.

Design for a Brain,W. Ashby,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-03-09,"THE book is not a treatise on aIl cerebral mechanisms but a pro poscd solution of a specific problem: the origin of the nervous system's unique ability to produce adaptive behaviour. The work has as basis the fact that the nervous system behaves adap tively and the hypothesis that it is essentiaIly mechanistic; it proceeds on the assumption that these two data are not irrecon cilable. It attempts to deduce from the observed facts what sort of a mechanism it must be that behaves so differently from any machinc made so far. Other proposed solutions have usuaIly left open the question whether so me different theory might not fit the facts equaIly weIl: I have attempted to deduce what is necessary, what properties the nervous system must have if it is to behave at once mechanisticaIly and adaptively. For the deduction to be rigorous, an adequately developed logic of mechanism is essential. Until recently, discussions of mechan ism were carried on almost entirely in terms of so me particular embodiment-the mechanical, the electronic, the neuronie, and so on. Those days are past. There now exists a weIl-developed logic of pure mechanism, rigorous as geometry, and likely to play the same fundamental part, in our understanding of the complex systems of biology, that geometry does in astronomy.

Engineering Design with Polymers and Composites,"James C. Gerdeen, PhD, PE, James C. Gerdeen, Harold W. Lord, Ronald A.L. Rorrer, PhD, PE, Ronald A.L. Rorrer",CRC Press,2005-11-01,"There are many books available on polymer chemistry, properties, and processing, but they do not focus on the practicalities of selecting and using them correctly in the design of structures. Engineering students require an understanding of polymers and composites as well as viscoelasticity, adhesion, damping applications, and tribology in order to successfully integrate these materials into their designs. Based on more than twenty years of classroom experience, Engineering Design with Polymers and Composites is the first textbook to unite these topics in a single source. The authors take a bottom-up functional approach rather than a top-down analytical approach to design. This unique perspective enables students to select the proper materials for the application rather than force the design to suit the materials. The text begins with an introduction to polymers and composites, including historical background. Detailed coverage of mechanical properties, viscoelastic behavior of polymers, composite materials, creep and fatigue failure, impact, and related properties follows. Discussion then turns to selection of materials, design applications of polymers, polymer processing, adhesion, tribology, and damping and isolation. Abundant examples, homework problems, tables, and illustrations reinforce the concepts. Accompanied by a CD-ROM containing materials databases, examples in Excel®, and a laminate analysis program, Engineering Design with Polymers and Composites builds a strong background in the underlying concepts necessary for engineering students to successfully incorporate polymers and composites into their designs.",Technology & Engineering,378,N/A,0,en

Animal Welfare in Animal Agriculture,"Wilson G. Pond, Fuller W. Bazer, Bernard E. Rollin",CRC Press,2011-11-23,"What constitutes animal welfare? With animals being used for companionship, service, research, food, fiber, and by-products, animal welfare is a topic of great interest and importance to society. As the world’s population continues to increase, a major challenge for society is the maintenance of a strong and viable food system, which is linked to the well-being and comfort of food animals. Animal Welfare in Animal Agriculture: Husbandry, Stewardship, and Sustainability in Animal Production explores the pressing issue of farm animal welfare in animal production systems in the United States and globally. A framework for open discussion on animal welfare, this multidisciplinary book brings together the perspectives of 40 highly qualified and recognized experts in their respective fields. Fourteen chapters address a range of topics that includes ethics, sociology, food safety, ecology, feed resources, biotechnology, government regulations, and sustainability, as well as animal comfort, health, and contributions to society. The book also offers a historical perspective on the growth of animal agriculture from family farms to industrial animal agriculture—and the impact this has had on society. Illustrating the diversity of viewpoints, the concept of animal welfare is defined from the perspectives of an ethicist and philosopher, a research scientist, a veterinarian, an industrialist, and an activist, as well as from the perspective of sustainability and product quality. Written primarily for students, but also highly relevant for professionals in varying fields of academia and industry, this timely book reveals important insights into animal welfare and animal agriculture. Unique in its depth, breadth, and balance, it underscores the need for dialogue on wide-ranging and often contentious issues related to animal production systems.",Medical,1140,N/A,0,en

At that time, tion of buildings against earthquake attack began in I was working on the development of energy-dissipating devices for the same purpose and had developed and tested a device that was even tually used in a stepping-bridge structure, this being a form of partial isolation. It became clear to me that in order to use these energy devices for the earthquake protection of buildings, it would be best to combine them with an isolation system which would give them the large displace ments needed to develop sufficient hysteresis. At this appropriate point in time, I was approached by Dr. C. J. Derham, then of the Malaysian Rubber Producers' Research Association (MRPRA), who asked if I was interested in looking at the possibility of conducting shaking table tests at the Earthquake Simulator Laboratory to see to what extent natural rubber bearings could be used to protect buildings from earthquakes. Very soon after this meeting, we were able to do such a test using a 20-ton model and hand-made isolators. The eady tests were very promising. Accordingly, a further set of tests was done with a more realistic five storey model weighing 40 tons with bearings that were commercially made.

Computational Methods for Optimal Design and Control,"J. Borggaard, John Burns, Scott Schreck",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This volume contains the proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Optimal Design and Control, held in Arlington, Virginia, 30 September-3 Octo ber, 1997. The First Workshop was held in Blacksburg, Virginia in 1994. The proceedings of that meeting also appeared in the Birkhauser series on Progress in Systems and Control Theory and may be obtained through Birkhauser. These workshops were sponsored by the Air Force Office of Scientific Re search through the Center for Optimal Design and Control (CODAC) at Vrrginia Tech. The meetings provided a forum for the exchange of new ideas and were designed to bring together diverse viewpoints and to highlight new applications. The primary goal of the workshops was to assess the current status of research and to analyze future directions in optimization based design and control. The present volume contains the technical papers presented at the Second Workshop. More than 65 participants from 6 countries attended the meeting and contributed to its success. It has long been recognized that many modern optimal design problems are best viewed as variational and optimal control problems. Indeed, the famous problem of determining the body of revolution that produces a minimum drag nose shape in hypersonic How was first proposed by Newton in 1686. Optimal control approaches to design can provide theoretical and computational insight into these problems. This volume contains a number of papers which deal with computational aspects of optimal control.",Technology & Engineering,467,N/A,0,en

Reusable Booster System,"National Research Council, Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences, Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board, Committee for the Reusable Booster System: Review and Assessment",National Academies Press,2013-01-10,"On June 15, 2011, the Air Force Space Command established a new vision, mission, and set of goals to ensure continued U.S. dominance in space and cyberspace mission areas. Subsequently, and in coordination with the Air Force Research Laboratory, the Space and Missile Systems Center, and the 14th and 24th Air Forces, the Air Force Space Command identified four long-term science and technology (S&T) challenges critical to meeting these goals. One of these challenges is to provide full-spectrum launch capability at dramatically lower cost, and a reusable booster system (RBS) has been proposed as an approach to meet this challenge. The Air Force Space Command asked the Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board of the National Research Council to conduct an independent review and assessment of the RBS concept prior to considering a continuation of RBS-related activities within the Air Force Research Laboratory portfolio and before initiating a more extensive RBS development program. The committee for the Reusable Booster System: Review and Assessment was formed in response to that request and charged with reviewing and assessing the criteria and assumptions used in the current RBS plans, the cost model methodologies used to fame [frame?] the RBS business case, and the technical maturity and development plans of key elements critical to RBS implementation. The committee consisted of experts not connected with current RBS activities who have significant expertise in launch vehicle design and operation, research and technology development and implementation, space system operations, and cost analysis. The committee solicited and received input on the Air Force launch requirements, the baseline RBS concept, cost models and assessment, and technology readiness. The committee also received input from industry associated with RBS concept, industry independent of the RBS concept, and propulsion system providers which is summarized in Reusable Booster System: Review and Assessment.",Science,115,N/A,0,en

Superconducting Materials for High Energy Colliders,Luisa Cifarelli,World Scientific,2001,"The ELOISATRON (ELN) Project aims at a future proton supercollider with 100-500 TeV energy per beam and 1034-1036 cm-2s-1 luminosity. While the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is being implemented at CERN, it is very timely to study the feasibility of the next generation of hadron colliders at the extreme limits of energy and luminosity. In this respect, the achievement of extremely high magnetic fields and the production of accelerating rf cavities with very low losses are a crucial point in the actual construction design of such a collider. The search for superconducting materials with suitable properties to be used in this field has gained a new impulse after the discovery of the so-called high temperature superconducting compounds (HTSCs) with superconducting critical temperatures higher than 100 K. Besides the critical temperatures, the transport performances of this class of compounds are still very far from allowing applications in extremely high energy colliders. On the other hand, in the last few years, the technological and scientific improvements obtained for both the HTSCs and the conventional superconducting materials are very promising.This book reviews the recent status of R&D on the rising generation of superconducting materials for accelerator magnets and cavities, and discusses novel aspects and ideas in this domain.",Science,234,N/A,0,en
Spatial Sampling with R,Dick J. Brus,CRC Press,2022-09-26,"Scientific research often starts with data collection. However, many researchers pay insufficient attention to this first step in their research. The author, researcher at Wageningen University and Research, often had to conclude that the data collected by fellow researchers were suboptimal, or in some cases even unsuitable for their aim. One reason is that sampling is frequently overlooked in statistics courses. Another reason is the lack of practical textbooks on sampling. Numerous books have been published on the statistical analysis and modelling of data using R, but to date no book has been published in this series on how these data can best be collected. This book fills this gap. Spatial Sampling with R presents an overview of sampling designs for spatial sample survey and monitoring. It shows how to implement the sampling designs and how to estimate (sub)population- and space-time parameters in R. Key features Describes classical, basic sampling designs for spatial survey, as well as recently developed, advanced sampling designs and estimators Presents probability sampling designs for estimating parameters for a (sub)population, as well as non-probability sampling designs for mapping Gives comprehensive overview of model-assisted estimators Covers Bayesian approach to sampling design Illustrates sampling designs with surveys of soil organic carbon, above-ground biomass, air temperature, opium poppy Explains integration of wall-to-wall data sets (e.g. remote sensing images) and sample data Data and R code available on github Exercises added making the book suitable as a textbook for students The target group of this book are researchers and practitioners of sample surveys, as well as students in environmental, ecological, agricultural science or any other science in which knowledge about a population of interest is collected through spatial sampling. This book helps to implement proper sampling designs, tailored to their problems at hand, so that valuable data are collected that can be used to answer the research questions.",Mathematics,549,N/A,0,en

The Design for Everything Manual,Henry W. Stoll,Createspace Independent Pub,2012-06-01,"This concise and readable manual is a useful resource for anyone interested in the design of engineered products and equipment. The Design for Everything Manual integrates a wide range of ""design for X"" topics such as user-centered design, efficient design, design for manufacture, and coordinated product and process design into a unified ""Design for Everything"" approach that is easily understood and used regardless of technical background or training. Over the years, a wealth of practical design knowledge has been learned about how to achieve good design. This knowledge is captured by four fundamental rules of good design: the rule of needs, the rule of clarity, the rule of simplicity, and the rule of safety. Good design is achieved by applying these rules in a systematic and disciplined manner to the critical choices that define the design. The manual is derived from notes that the author developed over many years of teaching a course on ""Design for X"" in the Master of Product Design and Development Program at Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois. ""Design for X"" (DFX for short) is a label applied to a large collection of design methods (e.g., Design for Assembly, Lean Design) and design guidelines that address particular design issues. The Design for Everything Manual focuses on the principles and practices that underlie the DFX methods rather than on the methods themselves. It covers the same material and addresses the same spectrum of concerns, but in a simpler and more integrated fashion. Design for Everything is a strategic design approach that is of value to those studying, teaching, and practicing design across a wide range of disciplines. Design and manufacturing executives, product managers and project managers, and other high-level decision makers can use the manual to quickly learn how to achieve good design. Experienced design engineers and industrial designers can use it as a handy reference. Business students and engineering students can use it as a practical guide for new product development courses and senior design projects. Manufacturing companies can use it to develop a ""common language"" and ""shared vision"" for good design. Ultimately, all designers can use it as a guiding light for achieving the elusive goal of ""doing it right the first time.""",Technology & Engineering,112,N/A,0,en

Design after Capitalism,Matthew Wizinsky,MIT Press,2022-03-15,"How design can transcend the logics, structures, and subjectivities of capitalism: a framework, theoretical grounding, and practical principles. The designed things, experiences, and symbols that we use to perceive, understand, and perform our everyday lives are much more than just props. They directly shape how we live. In Design after Capitalism, Matthew Wizinsky argues that the world of industrial capitalism that gave birth to modern design has been dramatically transformed. Design today needs to reorient itself toward deliberate transitions of everyday politics, social relations, and economies. Looking at design through the lens of political economy, Wizinsky calls for the field to transcend the logics, structures, and subjectivities of capitalism—to combine design entrepreneurship with social empowerment in order to facilitate new ways of producing those things, symbols, and experiences that make up everyday life. After analyzing the parallel histories of capitalism and design, Wizinsky offers some historical examples of anticapitalist, noncapitalist, and postcapitalist models of design practice. These range from the British Arts and Crafts movement of the nineteenth century to contemporary practices of growing furniture or biotextiles and automated forms of production. Drawing on insights from sociology, philosophy, economics, political science, history, environmental and sustainability studies, and critical theory—fields not usually seen as central to design—he lays out core principles for postcapitalist design; offers strategies for applying these principles to the three layers of project, practice, and discipline; and provides a set of practical guidelines for designers to use as a starting point. The work of postcapitalist design can start today, Wizinsky says—with the next project.",Design,347,N/A,0,en

Fragile by Design,"Charles W. Calomiris, Stephen Haber",Princeton University Press,2015-08-04,"Why stable banking systems are so rare Why are banking systems unstable in so many countries—but not in others? The United States has had twelve systemic banking crises since 1840, while Canada has had none. The banking systems of Mexico and Brazil have not only been crisis prone but have provided miniscule amounts of credit to business enterprises and households. Analyzing the political and banking history of the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Brazil through several centuries, Fragile by Design demonstrates that chronic banking crises and scarce credit are not accidents. Calomiris and Haber combine political history and economics to examine how coalitions of politicians, bankers, and other interest groups form, why they endure, and how they generate policies that determine who gets to be a banker, who has access to credit, and who pays for bank bailouts and rescues. Fragile by Design is a revealing exploration of the ways that politics inevitably intrudes into bank regulation.",Business & Economics,584,N/A,0,en

Powered by Design,Renée Stevens,"Rocky Nook, Inc.",2020-03-20,"<p>The design industry has evolved rapidly over the past decade. Effective and successful designers no longer need to just “make things,” they need to be curious thinkers who understand how to solve problems that have a true impact on the world we live in and how to show the power of designing for social good. Now more than ever, the graphic design industry needs a book that teaches the foundations and theories of design while simultaneously speaking to the topics of history, ethics, and accessibility in order to make designs that are the most effective for all people.</p> <p>In <i>Powered by Design</i>, educator, designer, and public speaker Renee Stevens brings a truly up to date and thoughtful approach to an introduction to graphic design. As Assistant Professor at the S.I. Newhouse School of Communication at Syracuse University, Stevens created this book to be at home equally in academia and outside of the school setting. With a conversational and approachable tone, Stevens’ book is for anyone who wants to gain a more practical understanding of what graphic design is today, and the power and potential it has: from students to novice graphic designers to anyone who wants to build a solid foundation of design skills so that they can work more effectively with professional designers. Stevens covers topics such as:</p> <ul>• Choosing the right typeface</ul> <ul>• Hierarchy and visual weight</ul> <ul>• Creating design systems</ul> <ul>• Balancing tension</ul> <ul>• Visualizing data</ul> <ul>• Understanding color and mood</ul> <ul>• Defining a story structure</ul> <ul>• User testing and critique</ul> <ul>• Immersive design (designing for all the senses)</ul> <ul>• Determining when a design is finished</ul> <ul>• How to make a living with design</ul> <p>Woven throughout is the crucial idea that you must embrace empathy in everything you design in order to create work that is the most inclusive. Design has the power and potential to make real impact in our everyday lives, and this book will show you how to do that starting with your first design experience.</p>",Art,344,N/A,0,en
The Art of Rube Goldberg,Rube Goldberg,Abrams,2013-11-12,"A “generously illustrated and well-designed appreciation” of the Pulitzer Prize–winning illustrator, with an introduction by New Yorker writer Adam Gopnik.(The New York Times) Cartoonist, humorist, sculptor, author, engineer, and inventor, Rube Goldberg wrote and illustrated nearly 50,000 cartoon in his seventy-two-year career. Goldberg (1883–1970) was the most famous cartoonist of his time, best known for his comical inventions, which were syndicated in daily newspapers throughout the world. Author Jennifer George celebrates all aspects of her grandfather’s career, from his very first published drawings in his high school newspaper and college yearbook to his iconic inventions, his comic strips and advertising work, and his later sculpture and Pulitzer Prize–winning political cartoons. Also included are essays from such writers and comic historians as Adam Gopnik, Al Jaffee, Carl Linich, Peter Meresca, Paul Tumey and Brian Walker, as well as rare photographs, letters, memorabilia, and patents, many reproduced here for the first time. Brilliantly designed and packaged to capture the inventiveness of Rube Goldberg’s work, The Art of Rube Goldberg is a coffee table book the whole family can enjoy. “Goldberg’s cartoons touch the edge of modern art.” —Adam Gopnik “There will likely never be another Rube Goldberg.

Software Design X-Rays,Adam Tornhill,Pragmatic Bookshelf,2018-03-08,"Are you working on a codebase where cost overruns, death marches, and heroic fights with legacy code monsters are the norm? Battle these adversaries with novel ways to identify and prioritize technical debt, based on behavioral data from how developers work with code. And that's just for starters. Because good code involves social design, as well as technical design, you can find surprising dependencies between people and code to resolve coordination bottlenecks among teams. Best of all, the techniques build on behavioral data that you already have: your version-control system. Join the fight for better code! Use statistics and data science to uncover both problematic code and the behavioral patterns of the developers who build your software. This combination gives you insights you can't get from the code alone. Use these insights to prioritize refactoring needs, measure their effect, find implicit dependencies between different modules, and automatically create knowledge maps of your system based on actual code contributions. In a radical, much-needed change from common practice, guide organizational decisions with objective data by measuring how well your development teams align with the software architecture. Discover a comprehensive set of practical analysis techniques based on version-control data, where each point is illustrated with a case study from a real-world codebase. Because the techniques are language neutral, you can apply them to your own code no matter what programming language you use. Guide organizational decisions with objective data by measuring how well your development teams align with the software architecture. Apply research findings from social psychology to software development, ensuring you get the tools you need to coach your organization towards better code. If you're an experienced programmer, software architect, or technical manager, you'll get a new perspective that will change how you work with code. What You Need: You don't have to install anything to follow along in the book. TThe case studies in the book use well-known open source projects hosted on GitHub. You'll use CodeScene, a free software analysis tool for open source projects, for the case studies. We also discuss alternative tooling options where they exist.",Computers,356,N/A,0,en
X: The Experience When Business Meets Design,Brian Solis,John Wiley & Sons,2015-10-13,"Welcome to a new era of business in which your brand is defined by those who experience it. Do you know how your customers experience your brand today? Do you know how they really feel? Do you know what they say when you re not around? In an always-on world where everyone is connected to information and also one another, customer experience is your brand. And, without defining experiences, brands become victim to whatever people feel and share. In his new book X: The Experience When Business Meets Design bestselling author Brian Solis shares why great products are no longer good enough to win with customers and why creative marketing and delightful customer service too are not enough to succeed. In X, he shares why the future of business is experiential and how to create and cultivate meaningful experiences. This isn’t your ordinary business book. The idea of a book was re-imagined for a digital meets analog world to be a relevant and sensational experience.

Queer X Design,Andy Campbell,Black Dog & Leventhal,2019-05-07,"The first-ever illustrated history of the iconic designs, symbols, and graphic art representing more than 5 decades of LGBTQ pride and activism. Beginning with pre-liberation and the years before the Stonewall uprising, spanning across the 1970s and 1980s and through to the new millennium, Queer X Design celebrates the inventive and subversive designs that have powered the resilient and ever-evolving LGBTQ movement. The diversity and inclusivity of these pages is as inspiring as it is important, both in terms of the objects represented as well as in the array of creators; from buttons worn to protest Anita Bryant, to the original 'The Future is Female' and 'Lavender Menace' t-shirt; from the logos of Pleasure Chest and GLAAD, to the poster for Cheryl Dunye's queer classic The Watermelon Woman; from Gilbert Baker's iconic rainbow flag, to the quite laments of the AIDS quilt and the impassioned rage conveyed in ACT-UP and Gran Fury ephemera. More than just an accessible history book, Queer X Design tells the story of queerness as something intangible, uplifting, and indestructible. Found among these pages is sorrow, loss, and struggle; an affective selection that queer designers and artists harnessed to bring about political and societal change. But here is also: joy, hope, love, and the enduring fight for free expression and representation. Queer X Design is the potent, inspiring, and colorful visual history of activism and pride.",Social Science,375,N/A,0,en

Architecture and the Senses in the Italian Renaissance,David Karmon,Cambridge University Press,2021-05-27,"This is the first study of Renaissance architecture as an immersive, multisensory experience that combines historical analysis with the evidence of first-hand accounts. Questioning the universalizing claims of contemporary architectural phenomenologists, David Karmon emphasizes the infinite variety of meanings produced through human interactions with the built environment. His book draws upon the close study of literary and visual sources to prove that early modern audiences paid sustained attention to the multisensory experience of the buildings and cities in which they lived. Through reconstructing the Renaissance understanding of the senses, we can better gauge how constant interaction with the built environment shaped daily practices and contributed to new forms of understanding. Architecture and the Senses in the Italian Renaissance offers a stimulating new approach to the study of Renaissance architecture and urbanism as a kind of 'experiential trigger' that shaped ways of both thinking and being in the world.",Art,503,N/A,0,en

Schaitkin's characters...are so intelligent and distinctive it feels not just easy, but necessary, to follow them. I devoured [it] in a day."" –Oyinkan Braithwaite, New York Times Book Review When you lose the person who is most essential to you, who do you become? Recommended by Entertainment Weekly, included in Good Morning America's 20 Books We're Excited for in 2020 & named as one of Vogue's Best Books to Read This Winter, Bustle's Most Anticipated Books of February 2020, and O Magazine's 14 of the Best Books to Read This February! Hailed as a “marvel of a book” and “brilliant and unflinching,” Alexis Schaitkin’s stunning debut, Saint X, is a haunting portrait of grief, obsession, and the bond between two sisters never truly given the chance to know one another. Claire is only seven years old when her college-age sister, Alison, disappears on the last night of their family vacation at a resort on the Caribbean island of Saint X. Several days later, Alison’s body is found in a remote spot on a nearby cay, and two local men–employees at the resort–are arrested. But the evidence is slim, the timeline against it, and the men are soon released. The story turns into national tabloid news, a lurid mystery that will go unsolved. For Claire and her parents, there is only the return home to broken lives. Years later, Claire is living and working in New York City when a brief but fateful encounter brings her together with Clive Richardson, one of the men originally suspected of murdering her sister. It is a moment that sets Claire on an obsessive pursuit of the truth–not only to find out what happened the night of Alison’s death but also to answer the elusive question: Who exactly was her sister? At seven, Claire had been barely old enough to know her: a beautiful, changeable, provocative girl of eighteen at a turbulent moment of identity formation. As Claire doggedly shadows Clive, hoping to gain his trust, waiting for the slip that will reveal the truth, an unlikely attachment develops between them, two people whose lives were forever marked by the same tragedy. For readers of Emma Cline’s The Girls and Lauren Groff’s Fates and Furies, Saint X is a flawlessly drawn and deeply moving story that culminates in an emotionally powerful ending.",Fiction,356,3,1,en
Design and Systems,"Arne Collen, Wojciech W. Gasparski",Transaction Publishers,N/A,"Praxiology starts from the point of view of effectiveness. It has three components: analysis of concepts involving purposive actions; critique of modes of action from the viewpoint of efficiency; and normative advisory aspects in recommendations for increasing human efficiency. The third volume of this series aims to make more visible to the English readership the importance of design throughout the many disciplines, professions, and arenas of human endeavor. Design is a pervasive part of our daily lives to such an extent that it goes largely unnoticed. It has become a near invisible aspect of our civilized existence. But when we stop for a moment to study an artifact, activity, group, and institution, or any entity or life process, we can begin to see and imagine the design, the designing, and the human designers who contributed to it. Design and Systems represents a set of contributions made to the methodological study of design.

Your Code as a Crime Scene,Adam Tornhill,Pragmatic Bookshelf,2015-03-30,"Jack the Ripper and legacy codebases have more in common than you'd think. Inspired by forensic psychology methods, you'll learn strategies to predict the future of your codebase, assess refactoring direction, and understand how your team influences the design. With its unique blend of forensic psychology and code analysis, this book arms you with the strategies you need, no matter what programming language you use. Software is a living entity that's constantly changing. To understand software systems, we need to know where they came from and how they evolved. By mining commit data and analyzing the history of your code, you can start fixes ahead of time to eliminate broken designs, maintenance issues, and team productivity bottlenecks. In this book, you'll learn forensic psychology techniques to successfully maintain your software. You'll create a geographic profile from your commit data to find hotspots, and apply temporal coupling concepts to uncover hidden relationships between unrelated areas in your code. You'll also measure the effectiveness of your code improvements. You'll learn how to apply these techniques on projects both large and small. For small projects, you'll get new insights into your design and how well the code fits your ideas. For large projects, you'll identify the good and the fragile parts. Large-scale development is also a social activity, and the team's dynamics influence code quality. That's why this book shows you how to uncover social biases when analyzing the evolution of your system. You'll use commit messages as eyewitness accounts to what is really happening in your code. Finally, you'll put it all together by tracking organizational problems in the code and finding out how to fix them. Come join the hunt for better code!

White (1917) [129] The history of classifying combinatorial objects is as old as the history of the objects themselves. In the mid-19th century, Kirkman, Steiner, and others became the fathers of modern combinatorics, and their work – on various objects, including (what became later known as) Steiner triple systems – led to several classi?cation results. Almost a century earlier, in 1782, Euler [180] published some results on classifying small Latin squares, but for the ?rst few steps in this direction one should actually go at least as far back as ancient Greece and the proof that there are exactly ?ve Platonic solids.

The optimality problems have been formulated in various models arising in the experimental designs and substantial progress has been made towards solving some of these. The subject has now reached a stage of completeness which calls for a self-contained monograph on this topic. The aim of this monograph is to present the state of the art and to focus on more recent advances in this rapidly developing area. We start with a discussion of statistical optimality criteria in Chapter One. Chapters Two and Three deal with optimal block designs. Row-column designs are dealt with in Chapter Four. In Chapter Five we deal with optimal designs with mixed effects models. Repeated measurement designs are considered in Chapter Six. Chapter Seven deals with some special situations and Weighing designs are dis cussed in Chapter Eight. We have endeavoured to include all the major developments that have taken place in the last three decades. The book should be of use to research workers in several areas including combinatorics as well as to the experimenters in diverse fields of applications.

This book presents the theory and methods of optimum experimental design, making them available through the use of SAS programs. Little previous statistical knowledge is assumed. The first part of the book stresses the importance of models in the analysis of data and introduces least squares fitting and simple optimum experimental designs. The second part presents a more detailed discussion of the general theory and of a wide variety of experiments. The book stresses the use of SAS to provide hands-on solutions for the construction of designs in both standard and non-standard situations. The mathematical theory of the designs is developed in parallel with their construction in SAS, so providing motivation for the development of the subject. Many chapters cover self-contained topics drawn from science, engineering and pharmaceutical investigations, such as response surface designs, blocking of experiments, designs for mixture experiments and for nonlinear and generalized linear models. Understanding is aided by the provision of ""SAS tasks"" after most chapters as well as by more traditional exercises and a fully supported website.

Information Science for Materials Discovery and Design,"Turab Lookman, Francis J. Alexander, Krishna Rajan",Springer,2015-12-12,"This book deals with an information-driven approach to plan materials discovery and design, iterative learning. The authors present contrasting but complementary approaches, such as those based on high throughput calculations, combinatorial experiments or data driven discovery, together with machine-learning methods. Similarly, statistical methods successfully applied in other fields, such as biosciences, are presented. The content spans from materials science to information science to reflect the cross-disciplinary nature of the field. A perspective is presented that offers a paradigm (codesign loop for materials design) to involve iteratively learning from experiments and calculations to develop materials with optimum properties. Such a loop requires the elements of incorporating domain materials knowledge, a database of descriptors (the genes), a surrogate or statistical model developed to predict a given property with uncertainties, performing adaptive experimental design to guide the next experiment or calculation and aspects of high throughput calculations as well as experiments. The book is about manufacturing with the aim to halving the time to discover and design new materials. Accelerating discovery relies on using large databases, computation, and mathematics in the material sciences in a manner similar to the way used to in the Human Genome Initiative. Novel approaches are therefore called to explore the enormous phase space presented by complex materials and processes. To achieve the desired performance gains, a predictive capability is needed to guide experiments and computations in the most fruitful directions by reducing not successful trials. Despite advances in computation and experimental techniques, generating vast arrays of data; without a clear way of linkage to models, the full value of data driven discovery cannot be realized.

Mathematical Statistics,"Aleksandr Petrovich Korostelev, Olga Korosteleva",American Mathematical Soc.,2011,"iPositive Give a man a fish, he eats for a day, but if you teach him to fish, you feed him for life. Such is the approach of iPositive. One day at the gym doesnt make a person fit for life; its a consistent dedication to getting the body in shape that eventually yields results. The lessons in iPositive work in much the same way: They challenge the reader to work to keep the mind in shape. The book is a powerful guide to personal happiness through positivity. Its concepts provide empowerment to overcome self-doubt, disbelief and inferiority complexes in order to transcend the negativity in life. iPositive is geared toward helping individuals become more focused on the things they most want in life, like happiness, love and success, or banish anchors that may be weighting them down, like stress, smoking or excess weight.

Surrogate-Based Modeling and Optimization,"Slawomir Koziel, Leifur Leifsson",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-06-06,"Contemporary engineering design is heavily based on computer simulations. Accurate, high-fidelity simulations are used not only for design verification but, even more importantly, to adjust parameters of the system to have it meet given performance requirements. Unfortunately, accurate simulations are often computationally very expensive with evaluation times as long as hours or even days per design, making design automation using conventional methods impractical. These and other problems can be alleviated by the development and employment of so-called surrogates that reliably represent the expensive, simulation-based model of the system or device of interest but they are much more reasonable and analytically tractable. This volume features surrogate-based modeling and optimization techniques, and their applications for solving difficult and computationally expensive engineering design problems. It begins by presenting the basic concepts and formulations of the surrogate-based modeling and optimization paradigm and then discusses relevant modeling techniques, optimization algorithms and design procedures, as well as state-of-the-art developments. The chapters are self-contained with basic concepts and formulations along with applications and examples. The book will be useful to researchers in engineering and mathematics, in particular those who employ computationally heavy simulations in their design work.",Mathematics,413,N/A,0,en

"Response Feature Technology for High-Frequency Electronics. Optimization, Modeling, and Design Automation","Anna Pietrenko-Dabrowska, Slawomir Koziel",Springer Nature,2023-10-16,"This book discusses response feature technology and its applications to modeling, optimization, and computer-aided design of high-frequency structures including antenna and microwave components. By exploring the specific structure of the system outputs, feature-based approaches facilitate simulation-driven design procedures, both in terms of improving their computational efficiency and reliability. These benefits are associated with the weakly nonlinear relationship between feature point coordinates and design variables, which—in the context of optimization—leads to inherent regularization of the objective functions. The book provides an overview of the subject, a definition and extraction of characteristic points, and feature-based design problem reformulation. It also outlines a number of numerical algorithms developed to handle local, global, and multi-criterial design, surrogate modeling, as well as uncertainty quantification. The discussed frameworks are extensively illustrated using examples of real microwave and antenna structures, along with numerous design cases. Introductory material on simulation-driven design, numerical optimization, as well as behavioral and physics-based surrogate modeling is also included.

Water Resources Systems Planning and Management,"Sharad K. Jain, V.P. Singh",Elsevier,2003-09-12,"This book is divided into four parts. The first part, Preliminaries, begins by introducing the basic theme of the book. It provides an overview of the current status of water resources utilization, the likely scenario of future demands, and advantages and disadvantages of systems techniques. An understanding of how the hydrological data are measured and processed is important before undertaking any analysis. The discussion is extended to emerging techniques, such as Remote Sensing, GIS, Artificial Neural Networks, and Expert Systems. The statistical tools for data analysis including commonly used probability distributions, parameter estimation, regression and correlation, frequency analysis, and time-series analysis are discussed in a separate chapter. Part 2 Decision Making, is a bouquet of techniques organized in 4 chapters. After discussing optimization and simulation, the techniques of economic analysis are covered. Recently, environmental and social aspects, and rehabilitation and resettlement of project-affected people have come to occupy a central stage in water resources management and any good book is incomplete unless these topics are adequately covered. The concept of rational decision making along with risk, reliability, and uncertainty aspects form subject matter of a chapter. With these analytical tools, the practitioner is well equipped to take a rational decision for water resources utilization. Part 3 deals with Water Resources Planning and Development. This part discusses the concepts of planning, the planning process, integrated planning, public involvement, and reservoir sizing.The last part focuses on Systems Operation and Management. After a resource is developed, it is essential to manage it in the best possible way. Many dams around the world are losing some storage capacity every year due to sedimentation and therefore, the assessment and management of reservoir sedimentation is described in details. No analysis of water resources systems is complete without consideration of water quality. A river basin is the natural unit in which water occurs. The final chapter discusses various issues related to holistic management of a river basin.",Science,883,4,2,en
Sub-structure Coupling for Dynamic Analysis,"Hector Jensen, Costas Papadimitriou",Springer,2019-03-26,"This book combines a model reduction technique with an efficient parametrization scheme for the purpose of solving a class of complex and computationally expensive simulation-based problems involving finite element models. These problems, which have a wide range of important applications in several engineering fields, include reliability analysis, structural dynamic simulation, sensitivity analysis, reliability-based design optimization, Bayesian model validation, uncertainty quantification and propagation, etc. The solution of this type of problems requires a large number of dynamic re-analyses. To cope with this difficulty, a model reduction technique known as substructure coupling for dynamic analysis is considered. While the use of reduced order models alleviates part of the computational effort, their repetitive generation during the simulation processes can be computational expensive due to the substantial computational overhead that arises at the substructure level. In this regard, an efficient finite element model parametrization scheme is considered. When the division of the structural model is guided by such a parametrization scheme, the generation of a small number of reduced order models is sufficient to run the large number of dynamic re-analyses. Thus, a drastic reduction in computational effort is achieved without compromising the accuracy of the results. The capabilities of the developed procedures are demonstrated in a number of simulation-based problems involving uncertainty.",Science,231,N/A,0,en

"Computational Optimization, Methods and Algorithms","Slawomir Koziel, Xin-She Yang",Springer Science & Business Media,2011-06-17,"Computational optimization is an important paradigm with a wide range of applications. In virtually all branches of engineering and industry, we almost always try to optimize something - whether to minimize the cost and energy consumption, or to maximize profits, outputs, performance and efficiency. In many cases, this search for optimality is challenging, either because of the high computational cost of evaluating objectives and constraints, or because of the nonlinearity, multimodality, discontinuity and uncertainty of the problem functions in the real-world systems. Another complication is that most problems are often NP-hard, that is, the solution time for finding the optimum increases exponentially with the problem size. The development of efficient algorithms and specialized techniques that address these difficulties is of primary importance for contemporary engineering, science and industry. This book consists of 12 self-contained chapters, contributed from worldwide experts who are working in these exciting areas. The book strives to review and discuss the latest developments concerning optimization and modelling with a focus on methods and algorithms for computational optimization. It also covers well-chosen, real-world applications in science, engineering and industry. Main topics include derivative-free optimization, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, surrogate-based methods, maximum simulated likelihood estimation, support vector machines, and metaheuristic algorithms. Application case studies include aerodynamic shape optimization, microwave engineering, black-box optimization, classification, economics, inventory optimization and structural optimization.

An Introduction to Structural Optimization,"Peter W. Christensen, A. Klarbring",Springer Science & Business Media,2008-10-14,"This book has grown out of lectures and courses given at Linköping University, Sweden, over a period of 15 years. It gives an introductory treatment of problems and methods of structural optimization. The three basic classes of geometrical - timization problems of mechanical structures, i. e. , size, shape and topology op- mization, are treated. The focus is on concrete numerical solution methods for d- crete and (?nite element) discretized linear elastic structures. The style is explicit and practical: mathematical proofs are provided when arguments can be kept e- mentary but are otherwise only cited, while implementation details are frequently provided. Moreover, since the text has an emphasis on geometrical design problems, where the design is represented by continuously varying—frequently very many— variables, so-called ?rst order methods are central to the treatment. These methods are based on sensitivity analysis, i. e. , on establishing ?rst order derivatives for - jectives and constraints. The classical ?rst order methods that we emphasize are CONLIN and MMA, which are based on explicit, convex and separable appro- mations. It should be remarked that the classical and frequently used so-called op- mality criteria method is also of this kind. It may also be noted in this context that zero order methods such as response surface methods, surrogate models, neural n- works, genetic algorithms, etc. , essentially apply to different types of problems than the ones treated here and should be presented elsewhere.",Technology & Engineering,214,5,1,en

Kota Cina: A Settlement in the Strait of Malacca,Kota Cina: A Settlement in the Strait of Malacca,Kepustakaan Populer Gramedia,2024-08-13,"From the time of its rediscovery in the early 1970s, the site of Kota Cina, on the shore of the Malacca Strait, in the present province of North Sumatra, Indonesia, appeared as one of the major old settlement sites in the region. This book represents the latest contribution to the accumulation of knowledge on the history of the site between the late eleventh and early fourteenth centuries CE. A first set of eighteen studies offers the main results of the archaeological research programme conducted from 2011 until 2018 by the École française d’Extrême-Orient in cooperation with the Pusat Penelitian Arkeologi Nasional Indonesia. It includes a contribution on structures, features and stratigraphies; studies devoted to the 227,000 finds uncovered during these excavations (earthenware, Chinese ceramics, glassware, metal, Chinese coins, lithic material, faunal remains, wood, worked organic finds, fruits and seeds), as well as a geomorphological and paleo-environmental contribution. A second set of studies presents the results of other surveys and excavations which shed additional light on the programme that constitutes the core of this book: two contributions devoted to Kota Cina itself, one devoted to the neighbouring site of Bulu Cina, and one devoted to recent excavations in the South Sumatra Province. A third set includes two studies which constitute reappraisals of two corpora (Hindu-Buddhist statuary from Kota Cina, contemporary Chinese written sources) allowing to apprehend the history of relations between Kota Cina in particular, and the Straits of Malacca more generally, with South Asia on the one hand, and China on the other hand, in the light of the most recent knowledge. The concluding chapter draws on all these contributions in an attempt to offer a synthesis of certain aspects related to the occupation of the Kota Cina site: morphology and spatial evolution of the settlement, dwelling features, space occupation, as well as domestic life and religious practices. Within this framework, an essay on the economic and political history of Kota Cina is proposed, from the emergence of the site until its abandonment, including its involvement in overseas trade routes, and hypotheses on its political status.",Social Science,941,N/A,0,en

Statistics for Spatial Data,Noel Cressie,John Wiley & Sons,2015-03-18,"The Wiley Classics Library consists of selected books that have been made more accessible to consumers in an effort to increase global appeal and general circulation. With these new unabridged softcover volumes, Wiley hopes to extend the lives of these works by making them available to future generations of statisticians, mathematicians, and scientists. Spatial statistics — analyzing spatial data through statistical models — has proven exceptionally versatile, encompassing problems ranging from the microscopic to the astronomic. However, for the scientist and engineer faced only with scattered and uneven treatments of the subject in the scientific literature, learning how to make practical use of spatial statistics in day-to-day analytical work is very difficult. Designed exclusively for scientists eager to tap into the enormous potential of this analytical tool and upgrade their range of technical skills, Statistics for Spatial Data is a comprehensive, single-source guide to both the theory and applied aspects of spatial statistical methods. The hard-cover edition was hailed by Mathematical Reviews as an ""excellent book which will become a basic reference."" This paper-back edition of the 1993 edition, is designed to meet the many technological challenges facing the scientist and engineer. Concentrating on the three areas of geostatistical data, lattice data, and point patterns, the book sheds light on the link between data and model, revealing how design, inference, and diagnostics are an outgrowth of that link. It then explores new methods to reveal just how spatial statistical models can be used to solve important problems in a host of areas in science and engineering. Discussion includes: Exploratory spatial data analysis Spectral theory for stationary processes Spatial scale Simulation methods for spatial processes Spatial bootstrapping Statistical image analysis and remote sensing Computational aspects of model fitting Application of models to disease mapping Designed to accommodate the practical needs of the professional, it features a unified and common notation for its subject as well as many detailed examples woven into the text, numerous illustrations (including graphs that illuminate the theory discussed) and over 1,000 references.

Chapter 1 continues with a description of the context of discrete choice experiments. Subsequently, the research problems and the objectives ofthis dissertation are discussed. The chapter concludes with an outline of the organization of this dissertation. 1. 1 Positioning of the Dissertation During this century, increasing globalization and technological progress has forced companies to undergo rapid and dramatic changes-for some a threat, for others it offers new opportunities. Companies have to survive in a Darwinian marketplace where the principle of natural selection applies. Marketplace success goes to those companies that are able to produce marketable value, Le. , products and services that others are willing to purchase (Kotler 1997). Every company must be engaged in new-product development to create the new products customers want because competitors will do their best to supply them. Besides offering competitive advantages, new products usually lead to sales growth and stability. As household incomes increase and consumers become more selective, fmns need to know how consumers respond to different features and appeals. Successful products and services begin with a thorough understanding of consumer needs and wants.

Digital Methods and Remote Sensing in Archaeology,"Maurizio Forte, Stefano Campana",Springer,2017-02-10,"​​This volume debuts the new scope of Remote Sensing, which was first defined as the analysis of data collected by sensors that were not in physical contact with the objects under investigation (using cameras, scanners, and radar systems operating from spaceborne or airborne platforms). A wider characterization is now possible: Remote Sensing can be any non-destructive approach to viewing the buried and nominally invisible evidence of past activity. Spaceborne and airborne sensors, now supplemented by laser scanning, are united using ground-based geophysical instruments and undersea remote sensing, as well as other non-invasive techniques such as surface collection or field-walking survey. Now, any method that enables observation of evidence on or beneath the surface of the earth, without impact on the surviving stratigraphy, is legitimately within the realm of Remote Sensing. ​The new interfaces and senses engaged in Remote Sensing appear throughout the book. On a philosophical level, this is about the landscapes and built environments that reveal history through place and time. It is about new perspectives—the views of history possible with Remote Sensing and fostered in part by immersive, interactive 3D and 4D environments discussed in this volume. These perspectives are both the result and the implementation of technological, cultural, and epistemological advances in record keeping, interpretation, and conceptualization. Methodology presented here builds on the current ease and speed in collecting data sets on the scale of the object, site, locality, and landscape. As this volume shows, many disciplines surrounding archaeology and related cultural studies are currently involved in Remote Sensing, and its relevance will only increase as the methodology expands.",Social Science,499,N/A,0,en
Simulation-driven Design Optimization And Modeling For Microwave Engineering,Qi-jun Zhang,World Scientific,2013-03-14,"Computer-aided full-wave electromagnetic (EM) analysis has been used in microwave engineering for the past decade. Initially, its main application area was design verification. Today, EM-simulation-driven optimization and design closure become increasingly important due to the complexity of microwave structures and increasing demands for accuracy. In many situations, theoretical models of microwave structures can only be used to yield the initial designs that need to be further fine-tuned to meet given performance requirements. In addition, EM-based design is a must for a growing number of microwave devices such as ultra-wideband (UWB) antennas, dielectric resonator antennas and substrate-integrated circuits. For circuits like these, no design-ready theoretical models are available, so design improvement can only be obtained through geometry adjustments based on repetitive, time-consuming simulations. On the other hand, various interactions between microwave devices and their environment, such as feeding structures and housing, must be taken into account, and this is only possible through full-wave EM analysis.Electromagnetic simulations can be highly accurate, but they tend to be computationally expensive. Therefore, practical design optimization methods have to be computationally efficient, so that the number of CPU-intensive high-fidelity EM simulations is reduced as much as possible during the design process. For the same reasons, techniques for creating fast yet accurate models of microwave structures become crucially important.In this edited book, the authors strive to review the state-of-the-art simulation-driven microwave design optimization and modeling. A group of international experts specialized in various aspects of microwave computer-aided design summarize and review a wide range of the latest developments and real-world applications. Topics include conventional and surrogate-based design optimization techniques, methods exploiting adjoint sensitivity, simulation-based tuning, space mapping, and several modeling methodologies, such as artificial neural networks and kriging. Applications and case studies include microwave filters, antennas, substrate integrated structures and various active components and circuits. The book also contains a few introductory chapters highlighting the fundamentals of optimization and modeling, gradient-based and derivative-free algorithms, metaheuristics, and surrogate-based optimization techniques, as well as finite difference and finite element methods./a",Technology & Engineering,526,N/A,0,en
Recording Science in the Digital Era,Cerys Willoughby,Royal Society of Chemistry,2019-07-15,"For most of the history of scientific endeavour, science has been recorded on paper. In this digital era, however, there is increasing pressure to abandon paper in favour of digital tools. Despite the benefits, there are barriers to the adoption of such tools, not least their usability. As the relentless development of technology changes the way we work, we need to ensure that the design of technology not only overcomes these barriers, but facilitates us as scientists and supports better practice within science. This book examines the importance of record-keeping in science, current record-keeping practices, and the role of technology for enabling the effective capture, reuse, sharing, and preservation of scientific data. Covering the essential areas of electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs) and digital tools for recording scientific data, including an overview of the current data management technology available and the benefits and pitfalls of using these technologies, this book is a useful tool for those interested in implementing digital data solutions within their research groups or departments. This book also provides insight into important factors to consider in the design of digital tools such as ELNs for those interested in producing their own tools. Finally, it looks at the role of current technology and then considers how that technology might develop in the future to better support scientists in their work, and in capturing and sharing the scientific record.",Computers,375,N/A,0,en

Theory of Factorial Design,Ching-Shui Cheng,CRC Press,2016-04-19,"Bringing together both new and old results, Theory of Factorial Design: Single- and Multi-Stratum Experiments provides a rigorous, systematic, and up-to-date treatment of the theoretical aspects of factorial design. To prepare readers for a general theory, the author first presents a unified treatment of several simple designs, including completely randomized designs, block designs, and row-column designs. As such, the book is accessible to readers with minimal exposure to experimental design. With exercises and numerous examples, it is suitable as a reference for researchers and as a textbook for advanced graduate students. In addition to traditional topics and a thorough discussion of the popular minimum aberration criterion, the book covers many topics and new results not found in existing books. These include results on the structures of two-level resolution IV designs, methods for constructing such designs beyond the familiar foldover method, the extension of minimum aberration to nonregular designs, the equivalence of generalized minimum aberration and minimum moment aberration, a Bayesian approach, and some results on nonregular designs. The book also presents a theory that provides a unifying framework for the design and analysis of factorial experiments with multiple strata (error terms) arising from complicated structures of the experimental units. This theory can be systematically applied to various structures of experimental units instead of treating each on a case-by-case basis.",Mathematics,403,N/A,0,en
Fuzzy Set Theory — and Its Applications,Hans-Jürgen Zimmermann,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-03-09,"Since its inception 20 years ago the theory of fuzzy sets has advanced in a variety of ways and in many disciplines. Applications of this theory can be found in artificial intelligence, computer science, control engineering, decision theory, expert systems, logic, management science, operations research, pattern recognition, robotics and others. Theoretical advances, too, have been made in many directions, and a gap has arisen between advanced theoretical topics and applications, which often use the theory at a rather elementary level. The primary goal of this book is to close this gap - to provide a textbook for courses in fuzzy set theory and a book that can be used as an introduction. This revised book updates the research agenda, with the chapters of possibility theory, fuzzy logic and approximate reasoning, expert systems and control, decision making and fuzzy set models in operations research being restructured and rewritten.

Performance-Driven Surrogate Modeling of High-Frequency Structures,"Slawomir Koziel, Anna Pietrenko-Dabrowska",Springer Nature,2020-02-19,"This book discusses surrogate modeling of high-frequency structures including antenna and microwave components. The focus is on constrained or performance-driven surrogates. The presented techniques aim at addressing the limitations of conventional modeling methods, pertinent to the issues of dimensionality and parameter ranges that need to be covered by the surrogate to ensure its design utility. Within performance-driven methodologies, mitigation of these problems is achieved through appropriate confinement of the model domain, focused on the regions promising from the point of view of the relevant design objectives. This enables the construction of reliable surrogates at a fraction of cost required by conventional methods, and to accomplish the modeling tasks where other techniques routinely fail. The book provides a broad selection of specific frameworks, extensively illustrated using examples of real-world microwave and antenna structures along with numerous design examples. Furthermore, the book contains introductory material on data-driven and physics-based surrogates. The book will be useful for the readers working in the area of high-frequency electronics, including microwave engineering, antenna design, microwave photonics, magnetism, especially those that utilize electromagnetic (EM) simulation models in their daily routines.

A Practical Introduction to Computer Architecture,Daniel Page,Springer Science & Business Media,2009-04-21,"It is a great pleasure to write a preface to this book. In my view, the content is unique in that it blends traditional teaching approaches with the use of mathematics and a mainstream Hardware Design Language (HDL) as formalisms to describe key concepts. The book keeps the “machine” separate from the “application” by strictly following a bottom-up approach: it starts with transistors and logic gates and only introduces assembly language programs once their execution by a processor is clearly de ned. Using a HDL, Verilog in this case, rather than static circuit diagrams is a big deviation from traditional books on computer architecture. Static circuit diagrams cannot be explored in a hands-on way like the corresponding Verilog model can. In order to understand why I consider this shift so important, one must consider how computer architecture, a subject that has been studied for more than 50 years, has evolved. In the pioneering days computers were constructed by hand. An entire computer could (just about) be described by drawing a circuit diagram. Initially, such d- grams consisted mostly of analogue components before later moving toward d- ital logic gates. The advent of digital electronics led to more complex cells, such as half-adders, ip- ops, and decoders being recognised as useful building blocks.",Computers,648,2,1,en

Simulation-Driven Design by Knowledge-Based Response Correction Techniques,"Slawomir Koziel, Leifur Leifsson",Springer,2016-05-13,"Focused on efficient simulation-driven multi-fidelity optimization techniques, this monograph on simulation-driven optimization covers simulations utilizing physics-based low-fidelity models, often based on coarse-discretization simulations or other types of simplified physics representations, such as analytical models. The methods presented in the book exploit as much as possible any knowledge about the system or device of interest embedded in the low-fidelity model with the purpose of reducing the computational overhead of the design process. Most of the techniques described in the book are of response correction type and can be split into parametric (usually based on analytical formulas) and non-parametric, i.e., not based on analytical formulas. The latter, while more complex in implementation, tend to be more efficient. The book presents a general formulation of response correction techniques as well as a number of specific methods, including those based on correcting the low-fidelity model response (output space mapping, manifold mapping, adaptive response correction and shape-preserving response prediction), as well as on suitable modification of design specifications. Detailed formulations, application examples and the discussion of advantages and disadvantages of these techniques are also included.

Supply Chain Disruptions,"Haresh Gurnani, Anuj Mehrotra, Saibal Ray",Springer Science & Business Media,2011-09-28,"One of the most critical issues facing supply chain managers in today’s globalized and highly uncertain business environments is how to deal proactively with disruptions that might affect the complicated supply networks characterizing modern enterprises. Supply Chain Disruptions: Theory and Practice of Managing Risk presents a state-of the-art perspective on this particular issue. Supply Chain Disruptions: Theory and Practice of Managing Risk demonstrates that effective management of supply disruptions necessitates both strategic and tactical measures – the former involving optimal design of supply networks; the latter involving inventory, finance and demand management. It shows that managers ought to use all available levers at their disposal throughout the supply network – like sourcing and pricing strategies, providing financial subsidies, encouraging information sharing and incentive alignment between supply chain partners – in order to tackle supply disruptions. The editors combine up-to-date academic research with the latest operational risk management practices used in industry to demonstrate how theoreticians and practitioners can learn from each other. As well as providing a wealth of knowledge for students and professors who are interested in pursuing research or teaching courses in the rapidly growing area of supply chain risk management, Supply Chain Disruptions: Theory and Practice of Managing Risk also acts as a ready reference for practitioners who are interested in understanding the theoretical underpinnings of effective supply disruption management techniques.",Technology & Engineering,339,N/A,0,en
Real-world Multi-objective System Engineering,"Nadia Nedjah, Luiza de Macedo Mourelle",Nova Publishers,2005,"Real-world engineering problems often require concurrent optimisation of several design objectives, which are conflicting in most of the cases. Such an optimisation is generally called multi-objective or multi-criterion optimisation. The area of research that applies evolutionary methodologies to multi-objective optimisation is of special and growing interest. It brings a solution to many yet-opened real-world problems and questions. Generally, multi-objective engineering problems have no single optimal design, but several solutions of equal efficiency allowing different trade-offs. The decision maker's preferences are normally used to select the most adequate design. Such preferences may be dictated before or after the optimisation takes place. They may also be introduced interactively at different levels of the optimisation process. Multi-objective optimisation methods can be subdivided into classical and evolutionary. The classical methods usually aim at a single solution while the evolutionary methods target a whole set of so-called Pareto-optimal solutions. of the evolutionary multi-objective optimisation research area and related new trends.

Harmony Search Algorithms for Structural Design Optimization,Zong Woo Geem,Springer,2009-09-30,"Various structures, such as buildings, bridges, and paved roads play an important role in our lives. However, these construction projects require large expenditures. Designing infrastructure cost-efficiently while satisfying all necessary design constraints is one of the most important and difficult tasks for a structural engineer. Traditionally, mathematical gradient-based optimization techniques have been applied to these designs. However, these gradient-based methods are not suitable for discrete design variables such as factory-made cross sectional area of structural members. Recently, researchers have turned their interest to phenomenon-mimicking optimization techniques because these techniques have proved able to efficiently handle discrete design variables. One of these techniques is harmony search, an algorithm developed from musical improvisation that has been applied to various structural design problems and has demonstrated cost-savings. This book gathers all the latest developments relating to the application of the harmony search algorithm in the structural design field in order for readers to efficiently understand the full spectrum of the algorithm’s potential and to easily apply the algorithm to their own structural problems. This book contains six chapters with the following subjects: standard harmony search algorithm and its applications by Lee; standard harmony search algorithm for steel frame design by Degertekin; adaptive harmony search algorithm and its applications by Saka and Hasançebi; harmony particle swarm algorithm and its applications by Li and Liu; hybrid algorithm of harmony search, particle swarm & ant colony for structural design by Kaveh and Talatahari; and parameter calibration of viscoelastic and damage functions by Mun and Geem.",Technology & Engineering,232,N/A,0,en
Surrogate Modeling For High-frequency Design: Recent Advances,"Slawomir Koziel, Anna Pietrenko-dabrowska",World Scientific,2022-03-04,"Contemporary high-frequency engineering design heavily relies on full-wave electromagnetic (EM) analysis. This is primarily due to its versatility and ability to account for phenomena that are important from the point of view of system performance. Unfortunately, versatility comes at the price of a high computational cost of accurate evaluation. Consequently, utilization of simulation models in the design processes is challenging although highly desirable. The aforementioned problems can be alleviated by means of surrogate modeling techniques, the most popular of which are data-driven models. Although a large variety of methods are available, they are all affected by the curse of dimensionality. This is especially pronounced in high-frequency electronics, where typical system responses are highly nonlinear. Construction of practically useful surrogates covering wide ranges of parameters and operating conditions is a considerable challenge.Surrogate Modeling for High-Frequency Design presents a selection of works representing recent advancements in surrogate modeling and their applications to high-frequency design. Some chapters provide a review of specific topics such as neural network modeling of microwave components, while others describe recent attempts to improve existing modeling methodologies.

Flower Flash,Lewis Miller,"The Monacelli Press, LLC",2021-11-02,"From Lewis Miller, the celebrated floral designer and ""Flower Bandit"" himself, an intimate and joyous behind-the-scenes look at his signature Flower Flashes as they introduced bright moments of natural beauty into the city when they were needed most. Before dawn one morning in October 2016, renowned New York-based floral designer Lewis Miller stealthily arranged hundreds of brightly colored dahlias, carnations, and mums into a psychedelic halo around the John Lennon memorial in Central Park. The spontaneous floral installation was Miller's gift to the city—an effort to spark joy during a difficult time. Nearly five years and more than ninety Flower Flashes later, these elaborate flower bombs—bursts of jubilant blooms in trash cans, over bus canopies, on construction sites and traffic medians—have brought moments of delight and wonder to countless New Yorkers and flower lovers everywhere, and earned Miller a following of dedicated fans and the nickname the ""Flower Bandit."" After New York City entered lockdown, Miller doubled down, creating Flower Flashes outside hospitals to express gratitude to frontline health workers and throughout the city to raise spirits. This gorgeous and poignant visual diary traces the phenomenon from the first, spontaneous Flower Flash to the even more profound installations of the pandemic through a kaleidoscopic collage of photos documenting the Flower Flashes, behind-the-scenes snapshots, Miller's inspiration material, fan contributions, and more.",Crafts & Hobbies,241,N/A,0,en

Distance-Regular Graphs,"Andries E. Brouwer, Arjeh M. Cohen, Arnold Neumaier",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Ever since the discovery of the five platonic solids in ancient times, the study of symmetry and regularity has been one of the most fascinating aspects of mathematics. Quite often the arithmetical regularity properties of an object imply its uniqueness and the existence of many symmetries. This interplay between regularity and symmetry properties of graphs is the theme of this book. Starting from very elementary regularity properties, the concept of a distance-regular graph arises naturally as a common setting for regular graphs which are extremal in one sense or another. Several other important regular combinatorial structures are then shown to be equivalent to special families of distance-regular graphs. Other subjects of more general interest, such as regularity and extremal properties in graphs, association schemes, representations of graphs in euclidean space, groups and geometries of Lie type, groups acting on graphs, and codes are covered independently. Many new results and proofs and more than 750 references increase the encyclopaedic value of this book.",Mathematics,513,N/A,0,en

Testing for Small-Delay Defects in Nanoscale CMOS Integrated Circuits,"Sandeep K. Goel, Krishnendu Chakrabarty",CRC Press,2017-12-19,"Advances in design methods and process technologies have resulted in a continuous increase in the complexity of integrated circuits (ICs). However, the increased complexity and nanometer-size features of modern ICs make them susceptible to manufacturing defects, as well as performance and quality issues. Testing for Small-Delay Defects in Nanoscale CMOS Integrated Circuits covers common problems in areas such as process variations, power supply noise, crosstalk, resistive opens/bridges, and design-for-manufacturing (DfM)-related rule violations. The book also addresses testing for small-delay defects (SDDs), which can cause immediate timing failures on both critical and non-critical paths in the circuit. Overviews semiconductor industry test challenges and the need for SDD testing, including basic concepts and introductory material Describes algorithmic solutions incorporated in commercial tools from Mentor Graphics Reviews SDD testing based on ""alternative methods"" that explores new metrics, top-off ATPG, and circuit topology-based solutions Highlights the advantages and disadvantages of a diverse set of metrics, and identifies scope for improvement Written from the triple viewpoint of university researchers, EDA tool developers, and chip designers and tool users, this book is the first of its kind to address all aspects of SDD testing from such a diverse perspective.

A Formal Theory of Commonsense Psychology,"Andrew S. Gordon, Jerry R. Hobbs",Cambridge University Press,2017-09-07,"Commonsense psychology refers to the implicit theories that we all use to make sense of people's behavior in terms of their beliefs, goals, plans, and emotions. These are also the theories we employ when we anthropomorphize complex machines and computers as if they had humanlike mental lives. In order to successfully cooperate and communicate with people, these theories will need to be represented explicitly in future artificial intelligence systems. This book provides a large-scale logical formalization of commonsense psychology in support of humanlike artificial intelligence. It uses formal logic to encode the deep lexical semantics of the full breadth of psychological words and phrases, providing fourteen hundred axioms of first-order logic organized into twenty-nine commonsense psychology theories and sixteen background theories. This in-depth exploration of human commonsense reasoning for artificial intelligence researchers, linguists, and cognitive and social psychologists will serve as a foundation for the development of humanlike artificial intelligence.",Computers,585,5,1,en

9 X 9 - a Method of Design,"Dietmar Eberle, Florian Aicher, Franziska Hauser",Birkhaüser,2018,"""An ideal design is site-specific, which is the only way architecture can create or connect with a specific sense of identity. This requires addressing the structural and local circumstances. This method handbook offers a playful way in which to systematically ascertain a complex framework and use it for your own design. The '9 x 9 method' takes all relevant factors and their alternate interaction into consideration: location, structure, shell, program, and materiality, all which, in a matrix with various intersections, produce exactly 9 'fields of action' for the design. The individual 'fields' are not only illustrated visually with meaningful and eidetic pictures, but are also discussed in texts by leading specialists.

Design Pedagogy,Mike Tovey,Routledge,2016-04-22,"Design Pedagogy explains why it is vital for design students that their education helps them construct a ’passport’ to enter the professional sphere. Recent research into design teaching has focused on its signature pedagogies, those elements which are particularly characteristic of the disciplines. Typically based on core design theory, enlivened by approaches imported to the area, such work has utility when it recognizes the visual language of designing, the media of representation used, and the practical realities of tackling design questions. Increasingly the 21st century sees these activities in a global context where the international language of the visual artefact is recognized. This book draws on recent work in these areas. It includes a number of chapters which are developed from work undertaken during the period of special funding for centres of teaching excellence in the UK up until 2010. Two of those in design have provided the basis for research and innovative developments reported on here. They have helped to enliven the environment for design pedagogy research in other establishments which are also included. Design students need support for the agile navigation through the design process. Learning experiences should develop students’ natural motivations and professionalise motivation to create a resilient, informed and sustainable capacity. This is the essence of ’transformative learning’. This collection explores how design education is, in itself, a passport to practice and showcases how some of the key developments in education use techniques related to collaboration, case studies and experience to motivate students, enable them to express their identity, reflect and learn.",Business & Economics,289,N/A,0,en

Vancouverism,Larry Beasley,On Point Press,2019-05-15,"Until the 1980s, Vancouver was a typical mid-sized North American city. But between Expo 86 and the Olympic Games in 2010, something extraordinary happened. This otherwise unremarkable city underwent a radical transformation that saw it emerge as an inspiring world-class metropolis celebrated for its livability, sustainability, and competitiveness. City-watchers everywhere took notice and wanted to learn more about this new model of urban growth, and the term “Vancouverism” was born. This book tells the story of Vancouverism and the urban planning philosophy and practice behind it. The author is a former chief planner of the City of Vancouver and was a key player at the heart of the action. Writing from an insider’s perspective, Larry Beasley traces the principles that inspired Vancouverism and the policy framework developed to implement it. The prologue, written by Vancouver journalist Frances Bula, outlines the political and urban history of Vancouver up until the 1980s. The text is also beautifully illustrated by the author with more than 200 colour photographs. Cities everywhere are asking the same question. Shall we shape change or will change shape us? This book shows how one city discovered positive answers, and it offers the principles, tools, and inspiration for others to follow.",Architecture,425,N/A,0,en

In 1946, Eva leaves behind the rubble of Berlin for the streets of New York City, stepping from the fiery aftermath of one war into another, far colder one, where power is more important than principles, and lies are more plentiful than the truth. Eva holds the key to a deadly secret: Project Bluebird -- a horrific experiment of the concentration camps, capable of tipping the balance of world power. Both the Americans and the Soviets want Bluebird, and it is something that neither should ever be allowed to possess. But Eva hasn't come to America for secrets or power. She hasn't even come for a new life. She has come to America for one thing: justice. And the Nazi that has escaped its net. Critically acclaimed author of The Light in Hidden Places Sharon Cameron weaves a taut and affecting thriller ripe with intrigue and romance in this alternately chilling and poignant portrait of the personal betrayals, terrifying injustices, and deadly secrets that seethe beneath the surface in the aftermath of World War II.",Young Adult Fiction,372,N/A,0,en

My Robot Gets Me,Carla Diana,Harvard Business Press,2021-03-30,"Your relationships with your ""smart"" products are about to get a lot more personal. Think how commonplace it is now for people to ask Siri for the weather forecast, deploy Roomba to clean their homes, or summon Alexa to turn on the lights. The ""smart home"" market will reach well over $100 billion in the next five years on the promise of products that are truly integrated with our cooking, cleaning, entertainment, security, and hygiene habits. But the reality is, these first-generation ""smart"" products aren't very smart—yet. We're clearly seeing only the tip of the iceberg in terms of capability and how such products can enhance our lives. How do we take it to the next level? In a word, design—and more specifically, social design. In this fascinating and instructive book, leading product design expert Carla Diana describes how new technology is allowing designers to humanize consumer products in delightfully subtle ways. Showcasing vivid examples of social design principles such as ""product presence,"" ""object expression,"" and ""interaction intelligence,"" we see how inventive uses of light, sound, and movement can evoke human responses to even the most mundane products. Diana offers clear guidelines and takeaways for conceptualizing, building, and optimizing products using such methods as bodystorming, scenario storyboarding, video prototyping, behavior charting, and more. My Robot Gets Me provides keen insights and practical advice to anyone interested or involved in the burgeoning smart marketplace, from product designers and developers to managers and venture capitalists.",Business & Economics,160,N/A,0,en

Preparing and Sustaining Social Justice Educators,"Annamarie Francois, Karen Hunter Quartz",Harvard Education Press,2022-10-18,"Preparing and Sustaining Social Justice Educators spotlights the challenging and necessary work of fostering social justice in schools. Integral to this work are the teachers and school leaders who enact the principles of social justice—racial equity, cultural inclusivity, and identity acceptance—daily in their classrooms. This volume makes the case that high-quality public education relies on the recruitment, professional development, and retention of educators ready to navigate complex systemic and structural inequities to best serve vulnerable student populations. Annamarie Francois and Karen Hunter Quartz, along with contributing scholars and practitioners, present an intersectional approach to educational justice. The approach is grounded in research about deeper learning, community development, and school reform. Throughout the book, the contributors detail professional activities proven to sustain social justice educators. They show, for example, how effective teacher coaching encourages educators to confront their explicit and implicit biases, to engage in critical conversations and self-reflection, and to assess teacher performance through a social justice lens. The book illustrates how professional learning collaborations promote diverse, antiracist, and socially responsible learning communities. Case studies at three university-partnered K–12 schools in Los Angeles demonstrate the benefits of these professional alliances and practices. Francois and Quartz acknowledge the difficulty of the social justice educator’s task, a challenge heightened by a K–12 teacher shortage, an undersupplied teacher pipeline, and school closures. Yet they keep their sights set on a just and equitable future, and in this work, they give educators the tools to build such a future.",Education,289,N/A,0,en

A Corpus of Roman Engraved Gemstones from British Sites,Martin Henig,Archaeopress Archaeology,1978,"'The primary purpose of an engraved gem or ring-bezel, cut in intaglio, was to make an impression upon some fictile material., which would be understood by the owner of the device, and by his associates, as a personal signature.' So began Martin Henig's original BAR Number 7 from 1978, in the British Series of British Archaeological Reports, a catalogue and study of over 1000 Roman engraved gemstones from the British Isles. Nearly 30 years later comes the third edition of this study, the new Preface to which concludes: 'Over the years I have thought more about gems in relation to other arts and have integrated glyptics into my book on The Art of Roman Britain (1995). Several papers I have written recently have attempted to use gems, like sculpture, painting and bronzes to elucidate general artistic problems. This should be obvious but how many art-historians seem to have the inclination to take gems seriously? At least interest in provincial glyptics seems greater today and that gives me grounds for hope Important studies are being conducted across the Empire ranging from Belgium . and Portugal ., toTurkey . andIsrael. It is for each new generation to reassess theevidence, in the case of our subjectwith the aid of new techniques, of computing on the one hand and scientific analysis of materials and cutting techniques on the other. In addition the fresh eye of youth is always invaluable. Someone else can often see what should have been obvious to one all the time. (Wolfson College, Oxford.

The Elements of User Experience,Jesse James Garrett,Pearson Education,2010-12-16,"From the moment it was published almost ten years ago, Elements of User Experience became a vital reference for web and interaction designers the world over, and has come to define the core principles of the practice. Now, in this updated, expanded, and full-color new edition, Jesse James Garrett has refined his thinking about the Web, going beyond the desktop to include information that also applies to the sudden proliferation of mobile devices and applications. Successful interaction design requires more than just creating clean code and sharp graphics. You must also fulfill your strategic objectives while meeting the needs of your users. Even the best content and the most sophisticated technology won't help you balance those goals without a cohesive, consistent user experience to support it. With so many issues involved—usability, brand identity, information architecture, interaction design— creating the user experience can be overwhelmingly complex. This new edition of The Elements of User Experience cuts through that complexity with clear explanations and vivid illustrations that focus on ideas rather than tools or techniques.

Constructed Ecologies,Margaret Grose,Routledge,2017-03-16,"Today, designers are shifting the practice of landscape architecture towards the need for a more complex understanding of ecological science. Constructed Ecologies presents ecology as critical theory for design, and provides major ideas for design that are supported with solid and imaginative science. In the questioning narrative of Constructed Ecologies, the author discards many old and tired theories in landscape architecture. With detailed documentation, she casts off the savannah theory, critiques the search for universals, reveals the needed role of designers in large-scale agriculture, abandons the overlay technique of McHarg, and introduces the ecological and urban health urgency of public night lighting. Margaret Grose presents wide-ranging new approaches and shows the importance of learning from science for design, of going beyond assumptions, of working in multiple rather than single issues, of disrupting linear design thinking, and of dealing with data. This book is written with a clear voice by an ecologist and landscape architect who has led design students into loving ecological science for the support it gives design.",Architecture,260,N/A,0,en
The Economics of Books and Reading,Samuel Cameron,Springer Nature,2022-11-14,"This book gives an overview of the key issues related to books and reading within the field of cultural economics and identifies additional lacunae in this area of research. The field of cultural economics is surprisingly short on research on the book market and on the activity of reading compared with other more recently invented media such as films and musical recordings. In addition, books and reading are strongly impacted by the disruptive innovations of digital technology and the use of online distribution platforms that fuel much of the research on the more recently invented cultural media. This book shows that the area of books and reading has had contributions in historically established areas of cultural economics and those currently exciting attention - chiefly with respect to digital disruption. Finally, it explains how books and reading are a fully developed rational addition model rather than something just based on the addition of past behaviour.

Algebraic Combinatorics,Chris Godsil,Routledge,2017-10-19,"This graduate level text is distinguished both by the range of topics and the novelty of the material it treats--more than half of the material in it has previously only appeared in research papers. The first half of this book introduces the characteristic and matchings polynomials of a graph. It is instructive to consider these polynomials together because they have a number of properties in common. The matchings polynomial has links with a number of problems in combinatorial enumeration, particularly some of the current work on the combinatorics of orthogonal polynomials. This connection is discussed at some length, and is also in part the stimulus for the inclusion of chapters on orthogonal polynomials and formal power series. Many of the properties of orthogonal polynomials are derived from properties of characteristic polynomials. The second half of the book introduces the theory of polynomial spaces, which provide easy access to a number of important results in design theory, coding theory and the theory of association schemes. This book should be of interest to second year graduate text/reference in mathematics.",Mathematics,381,N/A,0,en

Criteria and Methods of Structural Optimization,Andrzej M Brandt,Springer Science & Business Media,1987-06-30,"This book is intended to serve all those who are interested in structural opti mization, whether they work in this field or study it for other purposes. Rapid growth of interest in the cognitive aspects of optimization and the increas ing demands that the present day engineer has to meet in modern design have created the need of a monographic treatment of the subject. The vast number and wide range of structural optimization problems formulated and investigated in the last twenty years call for an attempt to sum up the pres ent state of knowledge in this domain and to outline the directions of its further development. The present authors undertook this task, hoping that the result would stimulate further work towards finding new methods and solutions and increasing the range of applications of the optimization methods to structural design. The immediate aim of the book is to present the basic criteria and methods of optimization and to provide a reference guide to the most important publications in the field. 'The book consists of fourteen chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the basic concepts, definitions and assumptions relating to structural optimization.

Introduction to Combinatorics,"Walter D. Wallis, John C. George",CRC Press,2016-12-12,"What Is Combinatorics Anyway? Broadly speaking, combinatorics is the branch of mathematics dealing with different ways of selecting objects from a set or arranging objects. It tries to answer two major kinds of questions, namely, counting questions: how many ways can a selection or arrangement be chosen with a particular set of properties; and structural questions: does there exist a selection or arrangement of objects with a particular set of properties? The authors have presented a text for students at all levels of preparation. For some, this will be the first course where the students see several real proofs. Others will have a good background in linear algebra, will have completed the calculus stream, and will have started abstract algebra. The text starts by briefly discussing several examples of typical combinatorial problems to give the reader a better idea of what the subject covers. The next chapters explore enumerative ideas and also probability. It then moves on to enumerative functions and the relations between them, and generating functions and recurrences., Important families of functions, or numbers and then theorems are presented. Brief introductions to computer algebra and group theory come next. Structures of particular interest in combinatorics: posets, graphs, codes, Latin squares, and experimental designs follow. The authors conclude with further discussion of the interaction between linear algebra and combinatorics. Features Two new chapters on probability and posets.

Basic Water and Wastewater Treatment,T H Y Tebbutt,Elsevier,2013-10-22,"Basic Water and Wastewater Treatment discusses the water cycle, flow measurement, physical treatment processes, chemical treatment processes, biological treatment process, and sludge handling and treatment. The book also describes the use of the BASIC computer program to calculate problems involving water pollutants. Flow measurements involve the use of a gauging structure, velocity measurements of a known cross-section, or dilution gauging. To evaluate, in quantitative terms, the effects of a certain pollutant discharged and received by a body of water, the investigator can employ a tool in chemical dilution gauging—the mass balance analysis. Many microorganisms, organic and inorganic compounds degrade in a natural process of self-purification; their decay can be modeled as an exponential function. One standard of water treatment facility or wastewater treatment plant cannot be built to deal with all the various components of water pollution.

Epistemology & Methodology I:,M. Bunge,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"In this Introduction we shall state the business of both descriptive and normative epistemology, and shall locate them in the map oflearning. This must be done because epistemology has been pronounced dead, and methodology nonexisting; and because, when acknowledged at all, they are often misplaced. 1. DESCRIPTIVE EPISTEMOLOGY The following problems are typical of classical epistemology: (i) What can we know? (ii) How do we know? (iii) What, if anything, does the subject contribute to his knowledge? (iv) What is truth? (v) How can we recognize truth? (vi) What is probable knowledge as opposed to certain knowledge? (vii) Is there a priori knowledge, and if so of what? (viii) How are knowledge and action related? (ix) How are knowledge and language related? (x) What is the status of concepts and propositions? In some guise or other all of these problems are still with us. To be sure, if construed as a demand for an inventory of knowledge the first problem is not a philosophical one any more than the question 'What is there?'. But it is a genuine philosophical problem if construed thus: 'What kinds of object are knowable-and which ones are not?' However, it is doubtful that philosophy can offer a correct answer to this problem without the help of science and technology. For example, only these disciplines can tell us whether man can know not only phenomena (appearances) but also noumena (things in themselves or self-existing objects).",Science,414,N/A,0,en
The Oxford Handbook of Hoarding and Acquiring,"Randy O. Frost, Gail Steketee",Oxford University Press,2013-12-06,"Hoarding involves the acquisition of and inability to discard large numbers of possessions that clutter the living area of the person collecting them. It becomes a disorder when the behavior causes significant distress or interferes with functioning. Hoarding can interfere with activities of daily living (such as being able to sit in chairs or sleep in a bed), work efficiency, family relationships, as well as health and safety. Hoarding behavior can range from mild to life-threatening. Epidemiological findings suggest that hoarding occurs in 2-6% of the adult population, making it two to three times more common than obsessive-compulsive disorder. The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) now includes Hoarding Disorder as a distinct disorder within the OCD and Related Anxiety Disorders section, creating a demand for information about it. The Oxford Handbook of Hoarding and Acquiring is the first volume to detail the empirical research on hoarding. Including contributions from all of the leading researchers in the field, this comprehensive volume is divided into four sections in addition to introductory and concluding chapters by the editors: Phenomenology, Epidemiology, and Diagnosis; Etiology; Assessment and Intervention; and Hoarding in Special Populations. The summaries of research and clinical interventions contained here clarify the emotional and behavioral features, diagnostic challenges, and nature of the treatment interventions for this new disorder. This handbook will be a critical resource for both practitioners and researchers, including psychiatrists, psychologists, neurologists, epidemiologists, social workers, occupational therapists, and other health and mental health professionals who encounter clients with hoarding problems in their practice and research.",Psychology,433,N/A,0,en

Digital System Design - Use of Microcontroller,"Shenouda Dawoud, R. Peplow",CRC Press,2022-09-01,"Embedded systems are today, widely deployed in just about every piece of machinery from toasters to spacecraft. Embedded system designers face many challenges. They are asked to produce increasingly complex systems using the latest technologies, but these technologies are changing faster than ever. They are asked to produce better quality designs with a shorter time-to-market. They are asked to implement increasingly complex functionality but more importantly to satisfy numerous other constraints. To achieve the current goals of design, the designer must be aware with such design constraints and more importantly, the factors that have a direct effect on them.One of the challenges facing embedded system designers is the selection of the optimum processor for the application in hand; single-purpose, general-purpose or application specific. Microcontrollers are one member of the family of the application specific processors.The book concentrates on the use of microcontroller as the embedded system?s processor, and how to use it in many embedded system applications. The book covers both the hardware and software aspects needed to design using microcontroller.The book is ideal for undergraduate students and also the engineers that are working in the field of digital system design.Contents• Preface;• Process design metrics;• A systems approach to digital system design;• Introduction to microcontrollers and microprocessors;• Instructions and Instruction sets;• Machine language and assembly language;• System memory; Timers, counters and watchdog timer;• Interfacing to local devices / peripherals;• Analogue data and the analogue I/O subsystem;• Multiprocessor communications;• Serial Communications and Network-based interfaces.",Technology & Engineering,570,N/A,0,en

"Contested Architectural Pasts and Futures of a Regional City, Geelong, Australia","Mirjana Lozanovska, Ursula de Jong",Cambridge Scholars Publishing,2024-10-03,"This collection of essays highlights current debates for cities undergoing urban renewal, focussing on regional cities as places that lead change. Like many regional cities, Geelong is grappling with the legacy of its industrial architectural heritage and identity. This in-depth study of the city of Geelong examines theories and realities - from the speculative to the mundane – critical to change pre-empted by deindustrialisation. While this book argues that architecture and the built environment are key to urban renewal, an intersectional perspective on Geelong as a place raises contested pasts and territories. This brings attention to the dispossession of First Nations people by British colonisers, as well as the exploitation of immigrant communities in industrial production. Informed by positions on design futures, decolonising and cultural urbanisms, adaptive re-use and the post-industrial city, the chapters in this book expand an interdisciplinary field relevant to scholars and practitioners in heritage and conservation, urban design, community engagement and place-making more generally.",Architecture,219,N/A,0,en

Traversing borders and languages, this volume offers a fresh approach to analyzing plays in production by some of the most widely-performed European playwrights, assessing how their work has revealed new meanings and theatrical possibilities as they move across the continent, building an unprecedented picture of the contemporary European repertoire. With chapters by leading scholars and contributions by the writers themselves, the chapters bring playwrights together to examine their work as part of a network and genealogy of writing, examining how these plays embody and interrogate the nature of contemporary Europe. Written for students and scholars of European theatre and playwriting, this book will leave the reader with an understanding of the shifting relationships between the subsidized and commercial, the alternative and the mainstream stage, and political stakes of playmaking in European theatre since 1989.",Performing Arts,389,N/A,0,en

The Islamic Design Module in Latin America,John F. Moffitt,McFarland,2004-07-15,"This study analyzes the distinctive look of Hispanic architecture. Its triangulate format, originated in Islamic Spain, was based on workshop techniques once used by journeyman designers and simple artisans. Spain was the only European transatlantic colonial power to have once been occupied by Islamic overlords. Spain's conquistadors took their traditional building methods to Latin America. Formal analyses of the facades of various Latin American churches reveal them to reiterate procedures worked out in Andalusia by Islamic builders in the ninth and tenth centuries. Though widely separated by time and place, both share a proportionate system determining abstract ratios; in both cases, this regulating format was derived from manipulations of the Pythagorean triangles. This ""trazado regulador"" is only expressed in ratios, with no numbers, and is illustrated here with 85 visual examples including measured drawings of Egyptian, Greek, Roman, and medieval European prototypes. Grounded in historical and physical data, the research is partially drawn from four practical builders' manuals: two seventeenth-century Spanish ones and two Mexican ones from ca. 1640 and 1800. In an appendix, Viollet-le-Duc (a major nineteenth-century architect) explains architectural proportionality and the design function of the Pythagorean Triangle.",Art,220,N/A,0,en

She said that the FGM concept, then largely unknown outside of Japan and a relatively few laboratories elsewhere, would be of great interest to everyone working in the materials field because of its potentially universal applicability. There was no book about FGMs in English at that time, although the number of research papers, review articles, and FGM conference proceedings had been increasing yearly. We discussed what the book should cover, and decided it should present a comprehensive description from basic theory to the most recent applications of FGMs. This would make it useful both as an introduction to FGMs for those simply curious about what this new materials field was all about, and also as a textbook for researchers, engineers, and graduate students in various material fields. The FGM Forum in Japan generously offered to support this publication program. is very difficult for an individual author to write a book that Because it covers such a wide range of various aspects of many different materials, I invited more than 30 eminent materials scientists throughout the world, who were associated with FGM research, to contribute selected topics.

Designed to Learn,Lindsay Portnoy,ASCD,2019-11-19,"Students become attentive, curious, and passionate about learning when they can see its relevance to their lives and when they're empowered to use that learning to solve problems that matter. Regardless of the subject or grade level you teach, you can infuse your instruction with the meaning students crave by implementing design thinking. Design thinking prompts students to consider: ""I've learned it. Now what am I going to do with it?"" In Designed to Learn, cognitive scientist and educator Lindsay Portnoy shares the amazing teaching and learning that take place in design thinking classrooms. To set the stage, she provides easy-to-implement strategies, classroom examples, and clear tools to scaffold the processes of inquiry, discovery, design, and reflection. Because formative assessment is crucial to the process, Portnoy includes sample assessments that measure student learning and ensure that learners take the lead in their own learning. As the author guides you through the five elements of design thinking (understand and empathize, identify and research, communicate to ideate, prototype and test, and iterate and reflect), you'll learn how to support students as they - Use the content you teach to solve a problem in their community or in the world around them. - Isolate a concern for their designed solution to address. - Communicate ideas and provide valid reasoning for potential solutions. - Prototype a solution and test it. - Revise their design for maximum impact and reflect on the process. Equipped with the strategies and supports in Designed to Learn, teachers will be able to ensure that learning in their classrooms is visible, student-centered, and measurable—by design.",Education,219,5,1,en

The contents of the book provide a sound foundation of game theory and mechanism design theory which clearly represent the “science” behind traditional as well as emerging economic applications for the society.The importance of the discipline of game theory has been recognized through numerous Nobel prizes in economic sciences being awarded to game theorists, including the 2005, 2007, and 2012 prizes. The book distills the marvelous contributions of these and other celebrated game theorists and presents it in a way that can be easily understood even by senior undergraduate students.A unique feature of the book is its detailed coverage of mechanism design which is the art of designing a game among strategic agents so that a social goal is realized in an equilibrium of the induced game. Another feature is a large number of illustrative examples that are representative of both classical and modern applications of game theory and mechanism design. The book also includes informative biographical sketches of game theory legends, and is specially customized to a general engineering audience.After a thorough reading of this book, readers would be able to apply game theory and mechanism design in a principled and mature way to solve relevant problems in computer science (esp, artificial intelligence/machine learning), computer engineering, operations research, industrial engineering and microeconomics.",Computers,533,N/A,0,en

Optimal Covariate Designs,"Premadhis Das, Ganesh Dutta, Nripes Kumar Mandal, Bikas Kumar Sinha",Springer,2015-07-23,"This book primarily addresses the optimality aspects of covariate designs. A covariate model is a combination of ANOVA and regression models. Optimal estimation of the parameters of the model using a suitable choice of designs is of great importance; as such choices allow experimenters to extract maximum information for the unknown model parameters. The main emphasis of this monograph is to start with an assumed covariate model in combination with some standard ANOVA set-ups such as CRD, RBD, BIBD, GDD, BTIBD, BPEBD, cross-over, multi-factor, split-plot and strip-plot designs, treatment control designs, etc. and discuss the nature and availability of optimal covariate designs. In some situations, optimal estimations of both ANOVA and the regression parameters are provided. Global optimality and D-optimality criteria are mainly used in selecting the design. The standard optimality results of both discrete and continuous set-ups have been adapted, and several novel combinatorial techniques have been applied for the construction of optimum designs using Hadamard matrices, the Kronecker product, Rao-Khatri product, mixed orthogonal arrays to name a few.",Computers,231,N/A,0,en

Boolean Reasoning,Frank Markham Brown,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This book is about the logic of Boolean equations. Such equations were central in the ""algebra of logic"" created in 1847 by Boole [12, 13] and devel oped by others, notably Schroder [178], in the remainder of the nineteenth century. Boolean equations are also the language by which digital circuits are described today. Logicians in the twentieth century have abandoned Boole's equation based logic in favor of the more powerful predicate calculus. As a result, digital engineers-and others who use Boole's language routinely-remain largely unaware of its utility as a medium for reasoning. The aim of this book, accordingly, is to is to present a systematic outline of the logic of Boolean equations, in the hope that Boole's methods may prove useful in solving present-day problems. Two Logical Languages Logic seeks to reduce reasoning to calculation. Two main languages have been developed to achieve that object: Boole's ""algebra of logic"" and the predicate calculus. Boole's approach was to represent classes (e. g. , happy creatures, things productive of pleasure) by symbols and to represent logical statements as equations to be solved. His formulation proved inadequate, however, to represent ordinary discourse. A number of nineteenth-century logicians, including Jevons [94], Poretsky [159], Schroder [178], Venn [210], and Whitehead [212, 213], sought an improved formulation based on ex tensions or modifications of Boole's algebra. These efforts met with only limited success.",Technology & Engineering,286,N/A,0,en

Leading Collaborative Architectural Practice,"Erin Carraher, Ryan E. Smith",John Wiley & Sons,2017-03-27,"The groundbreaking guide to modern leadership in architectural practice Leading Collaborative Architectural Practice is the leadership handbook for today's design and construction professionals. Endorsed by the American Institute of Architects, this book describes the collaborative approach to leadership that is becoming increasingly prevalent in modern practice; gone are the days of authoritative ""star"" architects— today's practice is a brand, and requires the full input of every member of the team. This book builds off of a two-year AIA research project to provide a blueprint for effective leadership: the ability, awareness, and commitment to lead project teams who work together to accomplish the project's goals. Both group and individual hands-on exercises help facilitate implementation, and extensive case studies show how these techniques have helped real-world firms build exemplary success through collaborative teamwork and leadership. Highly illustrated and accessible, this approach is presented from the practicing architect's point of view—but the universal principles and time-tested methods also provide clear guidance for owners, contractors, engineers, project managers, and students. Build a culture of collaboration, commitment, and interpersonal awareness Adopt effective leadership techniques at the team, project, or practice level Handle conflict and resolve communication issues using tested approaches Learn how real-world projects use effective leadership to drive success The last decade has seen a sea-change in architectural leadership. New practices no longer adopt the name and identity of a single person, but create their own identity that represents the collaborative work of the entire group. Shifts in technology and changing workplace norms have made top-down management structures irrelevant, so what does it now mean to lead?

Bayesian Designs for Phase I-II Clinical Trials,"Ying Yuan, Hoang Q. Nguyen, Peter F. Thall",CRC Press,2017-12-19,"Reliably optimizing a new treatment in humans is a critical first step in clinical evaluation since choosing a suboptimal dose or schedule may lead to failure in later trials. At the same time, if promising preclinical results do not translate into a real treatment advance, it is important to determine this quickly and terminate the clinical evaluation process to avoid wasting resources. Bayesian Designs for Phase I–II Clinical Trials describes how phase I–II designs can serve as a bridge or protective barrier between preclinical studies and large confirmatory clinical trials. It illustrates many of the severe drawbacks with conventional methods used for early-phase clinical trials and presents numerous Bayesian designs for human clinical trials of new experimental treatment regimes. Written by research leaders from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, this book shows how Bayesian designs for early-phase clinical trials can explore, refine, and optimize new experimental treatments. It emphasizes the importance of basing decisions on both efficacy and toxicity.",Mathematics,238,N/A,0,en

Group Sequential and Confirmatory Adaptive Designs in Clinical Trials,"Gernot Wassmer, Werner Brannath",Springer,2016-07-04,"This book provides an up-to-date review of the general principles of and techniques for confirmatory adaptive designs. Confirmatory adaptive designs are a generalization of group sequential designs. With these designs, interim analyses are performed in order to stop the trial prematurely under control of the Type I error rate. In adaptive designs, it is also permissible to perform a data-driven change of relevant aspects of the study design at interim stages. This includes, for example, a sample-size reassessment, a treatment-arm selection or a selection of a pre-specified sub-population. Essentially, this adaptive methodology was introduced in the 1990s. Since then, it has become popular and the object of intense discussion and still represents a rapidly growing field of statistical research. This book describes adaptive design methodology at an elementary level, while also considering designing and planning issues as well as methods for analyzing an adaptively planned trial. This includes estimation methods and methods for the determination of an overall p-value. Part I of the book provides the group sequential methods that are necessary for understanding and applying the adaptive design methodology supplied in Parts II and III of the book. The book contains many examples that illustrate use of the methods for practical application. The book is primarily written for applied statisticians from academia and industry who are interested in confirmatory adaptive designs. It is assumed that readers are familiar with the basic principles of descriptive statistics, parameter estimation and statistical testing. This book will also be suitable for an advanced statistical course for applied statisticians or clinicians with a sound statistical background.",Medical,310,N/A,0,en

Re-Covered Rose,Marco Sonzogni,John Benjamins Publishing,2011,"When a reader picks up a book, the essence of the text has been translated into the visual space of the cover. Using Umberto Eco's bestseller The Name of the Rose as a case study, this is the first study of book cover design as a form of intersemiotic translation based on the purposeful selection of visual signs to represent verbal signs. As an act of translation, the cover of a book ought to be an 'equivalent representation' of the text. But in the absence of any established interpretive criteria, how can equivalence between the visual and the verbal be determined and interpreted? Re-Covered Rose tackles this question in an original and creative way, laying the foundation for a new research trend in Translation Studies.

Optimisation of Manufacturing Processes,Mark Evans,CRC Press,2022,"Many engineering companies around the world are currently undergoing a quality control and improvement revolution that originally started in Japan many decades ago and this book provides a brief overview of this revolution. Robust design is a central component of the modern approach to quality improvement and is a phrase used to describe any engineering activity whose objective is to develop high quality products (and processes) at low cost. A key characteristic of robust design is the use of statistically planned (designed) experiments to identify those process variables that determine product quality. Robust design was developed in Japan by G. Taguchi in the early 1950s and its widespread use throughout Japanese industry is one of the main reasons why the country has emerged as a major producer of relatively cheap high quality products, especially in the automobile, home electronics and microprocessing sectors. Despite its early success in Japan, robust design remained virtually untried in the United States and Europe until the early 1980s. However, the realisation that quality is a vital ingredient required for success in today's highly global and competitive markets has since prompted Western companies to embrace the robust design concept. This book explores the planning, implementation and analysis of experiments designed both to improve existing manufacturing process and to create newer and better processes and products.",Technology & Engineering,246,N/A,0,en

Analysis of Digital Flight Control Systems with Flying Qualities Applications,"Richard F. Whitbeck, L. G. Hofmann",N/A,1978,"Revisitation and extension of classical sampled data approaches for the analysis of discretely controlled continuous systems is the focus of this report. A review of basic linear analysis topics required to support later developments is given. These topics include Laplace, z- and advanced z-transform facts; partial fraction expansion; data holds and the switch decomposition technique. Extension of switch decomposition for the vector signal case is given. The w'-domain is defined by a bilinear transformation of the z-domain. Properties of the w'-domain are developed. A new direct transform domain approach for analyzing two-rate sampled systems is developed This approach also applies for multi-rate sampled systems in restricted circumstances. Utility of this approach resides in its operator notation and conventions for manipulation in connection with vector block diagram algebra. This, in turn, expedites development of pulse transfer functions and of response recursion relations for multivariable, closed-loop systems. This is accomplished without resorting to the more complicated switch decomposition method. Multi-rate sampling analysis procedures are used to sharpen the concept of frequency response for discretely excited, continuous systems. Frequency response, in this case, pertains to steady-state responses at the input frequency and its positive aliases. All methods of analysis presented in this report are closed-form and exact in that no approximation is required in the mathematical development of any result.",Flight control,238,N/A,0,en

How to Save a Constitutional Democracy,"Tom Ginsburg, Aziz Z. Huq",University of Chicago Press,2018-10-05,"Democracies are in danger. Around the world, a rising wave of populist leaders threatens to erode the core structures of democratic self-rule. In the United States, the tenure of Donald Trump has seemed decisive turning point for many. What kind of president intimidates jurors, calls the news media the “enemy of the American people,” and seeks foreign assistance investigating domestic political rivals? Whatever one thinks of President Trump, many think the Constitution will safeguard us from lasting damage. But is that assumption justified? How to Save a Constitutional Democracy mounts an urgent argument that we can no longer afford to be complacent. Drawing on a rich array of other countries’ experiences with democratic backsliding, Tom Ginsburg and Aziz Z. Huq show how constitutional rules can both hinder and hasten the decline of democratic institutions. The checks and balances of the federal government, a robust civil society and media, and individual rights—such as those enshrined in the First Amendment—often fail as bulwarks against democratic decline. The sobering reality for the United States, Ginsburg and Huq contend, is that the Constitution’s design makes democratic erosion more, not less, likely. Its structural rigidity has had unforeseen consequence—leaving the presidency weakly regulated and empowering the Supreme Court conjure up doctrines that ultimately facilitate rather than inhibit rights violations. Even the bright spots in the Constitution—the First Amendment, for example—may have perverse consequences in the hands of a deft communicator who can degrade the public sphere by wielding hateful language banned in many other democracies. We—and the rest of the world—can do better. The authors conclude by laying out practical steps for how laws and constitutional design can play a more positive role in managing the risk of democratic decline.",Law,306,N/A,0,en

Introduction to Digital Filters,Julius Orion Smith,Julius Smith,2007,"A digital filter can be pictured as a ""black box"" that accepts a sequence of numbers and emits a new sequence of numbers. In digital audio signal processing applications, such number sequences usually represent sounds. For example, digital filters are used to implement graphic equalizers and other digital audio effects. This book is a gentle introduction to digital filters, including mathematical theory, illustrative examples, some audio applications, and useful software starting points. The theory treatment begins at the high-school level, and covers fundamental concepts in linear systems theory and digital filter analysis. Various ""small"" digital filters are analyzed as examples, particularly those commonly used in audio applications. Matlab programming examples are emphasized for illustrating the use and development of digital filters in practice.",Digital electronics,481,5,1,en

"Gen Z, Explained","Roberta Katz, Sarah Ogilvie, Jane Shaw, Linda Woodhead",University of Chicago Press,2022-10-26,"An optimistic and nuanced portrait of a generation that has much to teach us about how to live and collaborate in our digital world. Born since the mid-1990s, members of Generation Z comprise the first generation never to know the world without the internet, and the most diverse generation yet. As Gen Z starts to emerge into adulthood and enter the workforce, what do we really know about them? And what can we learn from them? Gen Z, Explained is the authoritative portrait of this significant generation. It draws on extensive interviews that display this generation’s candor, surveys that explore their views and attitudes, and a vast database of their astonishingly inventive lexicon to build a comprehensive picture of their values, daily lives, and outlook. Gen Z emerges here as an extraordinarily thoughtful, promising, and perceptive generation that is sounding a warning to their elders about the world around them—a warning of a complexity and depth the “OK Boomer” phenomenon can only suggest. ​ Much of the existing literature about Gen Z has been highly judgmental. In contrast, this book provides a deep and nuanced understanding of a generation facing a future of enormous challenges, from climate change to civil unrest. What’s more, they are facing this future head-on, relying on themselves and their peers to work collaboratively to solve these problems. As Gen Z, Explained shows, this group of young people is as compassionate and imaginative as any that has come before, and understanding the way they tackle problems may enable us to envision new kinds of solutions. This portrait of Gen Z is ultimately an optimistic one, suggesting they have something to teach all of us about how to live and thrive in this digital world.",History,275,N/A,0,en

The Bauhaus,Magdalena Droste,N/A,2015,"In a fleeting fourteen year period, sandwiched between two world wars, Germany's Bauhaus school of art and design changed the face of modernity. With utopian ideals for the future, the school developed a pioneering fusion of fine art, craftsmanship, and technology to be applied across painting, sculpture, design, architecture, film, photography, textiles, ceramics, theatre, and installation. As much an intense personal community as a publicly minded collective, the Bauhaus was first founded by Walter Gropius (1883-1969), and counted Josef and Anni Albers, Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Oskar Schlemmer, Gunta St lzl, Marianne Brandt and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe among its members. Between its three successive locations in Weimar, Dessau and Berlin, the school fostered charismatic and creative exchange between teachers and students, all varied in their artistic styles and preferences, but united in their idealism and their interest in a ""total"" work of art across different practices and media.
