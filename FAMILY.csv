How to Be a Family,Dan Kois,Hachette UK,2019-09-17,"In this ""refreshingly relatable"" (Outside) memoir, perfect for the self-isolating family, Slate editor Dan Kois sets out with his family on a journey around the world to change their lives together. What happens when one frustrated dad turns his kids' lives upside down in search of a new way to be a family? Dan Kois and his wife always did their best for their kids. Busy professionals living in the D.C. suburbs, they scheduled their children's time wisely, and when they weren't arguing over screen time, the Kois family-Dan, his wife Alia, and their two pre-teen daughters-could each be found searching for their own happiness. But aren't families supposed to achieve happiness together? In this eye-opening, heartwarming, and very funny family memoir, the fractious, loving Kois' go in search of other places on the map that might offer them the chance to live away from home-but closer together. Over a year the family lands in New Zealand, the Netherlands, Costa Rica, and small-town Kansas. The goal? To get out of their rut of busyness and distractedness and to see how other families live outside the East Coast parenting bubble. HOW TO BE A FAMILY brings readers along as the Kois girls-witty, solitary, extremely online Lyra and goofy, sensitive, social butterfly Harper-like through the Kiwi bush, ride bikes to a Dutch school in the pouring rain, battle iguanas in their Costa Rican kitchen, and learn to love a town where everyone knows your name. Meanwhile, Dan interviews neighbors, public officials, and scholars to learn why each of these places work the way they do. Will this trip change the Kois family's lives? Or do families take their problems and conflicts with them wherever we go? A journalistic memoir filled with heart, empathy, and lots of whining, HOW TO BE A FAMILY will make readers dream about the amazing adventures their own families might take.",Family & Relationships,323,N/A,0,en

A Family Is a Family Is a Family,Sara O'Leary,Groundwood Books,2022-01-04,"When a teacher asks her class to think about what makes their families special, the answers are all different, but the same in one important way ... When a teacher asks the children in her class to think about what makes their families special, the answers are all different in many ways -- but the same in the one way that matters most of all. One child is worried that her family is just too different to explain, but listens as her classmates talk about what makes their families special. One is raised by a grandmother, and another has two dads. One has many stepsiblings, and another has a new baby in the family. As her classmates describe who they live with and who loves them -- family of every shape, size and every kind of relation -- the child realizes that as long as her family is full of caring people, it is special. A warm and whimsical look at many types of families, written by award-winning author Sara O'Leary, with quirky and sweet illustrations by Qin Leng.

A Family of Readers,"Martha V. Parravano, Roger Sutton",Candlewick Press,2012-10-09,"Two of the most trusted reviewers in the field join with top authors, illustrators, and critics in a definitive guide to choosing books for children—and nurturing their love of reading. A FAMILY OF READERS is the definitive resource for parents interested in enriching the reading lives of their children. It’s divided into four sections: 1. Reading to Them: Choosing and sharing board books and picture books with babies and very young children. 2. Reading with Them: Launching the new reader with easy readers and chapter books. 3. Reading on Their Own: Exploring what children read—and how they read—by genre and gender. 4. Leaving Them Alone: Respecting the reading privacy of the young adult. Roger Sutton knows how and why children read. He must, as the editor in chief of THE HORN BOOK, which since 1924 has been America’s best source for reviews of books for young readers. But for many parents, selecting books for their children can make them feel lost. Now, in this essential resource, Roger Sutton and Martha V. Parravano, executive editor at the magazine, offer thoughtful essays that consider how books are read to (and then by) young people. They invite such leading authors and artists as Maurice Sendak, Katherine Paterson, Margaret Mahy, and Jon Scieszka, as well as a selection of top critics, to add their voices about the genres they know best. The result is an indispensable readers’ companion to everything from wordless board books to the most complex and daring young adult novels.",Literary Criticism,357,N/A,0,en

Behold the Mystery,Mark Hart,The Word Among Us Press,2014-03-01,"As Catholics, the Mass should be a mountaintop experience for us. Often, though, we go through the motions at Mass without an appreciation for what has really happened. Popular speaker and author Mark Hart helps Catholics move beyond the repetition and ritual to see the Mass for what it really is: a heavenly banquet, a wedding feast, in which heaven and earth meet. In his engaging style, Hart guides readers toward a deeper understanding of the Mass—its roots in the Jewish Sabbath, its sacrificial character, and its signs and symbols. As we are told to “go in peace,” he inspires us to see the Mass as a place to be nourished so that we can further Christ’s mission in the world. In the last part of the book, Hart provides pithy answers to frequently asked questions, such as “Why can’t I leave right after Communion?” or “Why did the words change?” Finally, Hart offers ten things we can do to get more out of Mass.",Religion,120,N/A,0,en

In our current culture, people are riddled with pressures to perform and ashamed when they do not measure up. We often view our relationship with God through the same lens of performance pressure, trying to merit God's favor. This is a dangerous way to walk with God and a miserable way to live life's journey! ""Scandalous Grace"" gives a fresh and insightful perspective from Paul's letter to the Ephesian Church. As you journey, through these pages, you will discover God isn't finished with you once He has forgiven you. He cleanses you, and then He carries you to completion. Grace grants the true disciple of Christ endless freedom! Freedom is not the lack of challenge or even chains in your life. You may still be in some chains yet experiencing the liberating power of God's grace. Journey slowly through this book and bask in the scandalous grace of God. Your enemy can't steal your freedom because your freedom doesn't come from your enemy, your freedom comes froth Christ! This is ""Scandalous Grace.""

While this has role of women as caregivers has been documented, the actual impact on the lives of women has remained largely unstudied. In this volume, the authors examine caregiving as a central feminist issue, looking at its impact on women socially, personally, and economically. The authors review how changing family structures, the changing economy and workforce, and the changing health care demands of needy adults have impacted on women′s lives. They critique existing public and private policies, demonstrating a need for fundamental structural changes in social institutions and attitudes to improve the lives of women. Finally, they propose a social model of care that is oriented toward gender justice--recognition of the work of caring and its impact upon women socially, personally, and economically.

The SAGE Encyclopedia of Contemporary Early Childhood Education,"Donna Couchenour, J. Kent Chrisman",SAGE Publications,2016-03-15,"The general public often views early childhood education as either simply “babysitting” or as preparation for later learning. Of course, both viewpoints are simplistic. Deep understanding of child development, best educational practices based on development, emergent curriculum, cultural competence and applications of family systems are necessary for high-quality early education. Highly effective early childhood education is rare in that it requires collaboration and transitions among a variety of systems for children from birth through eight years of age. The SAGE Encyclopedia of Contemporary Early Childhood Education presents in three comprehensive volumes advanced research, accurate practical applications of research, historical foundations and key facts from the field of contemporary early childhood education. Through approximately 425 entries, this work includes all areas of child development – physical, cognitive, language, social, emotional, aesthetic – as well as comprehensive review of best educational practices with young children, effective preparation for early childhood professionals and policy making practices, and addresses such questions as: · How is the field of early childhood education defined? · What are the roots of this field of study? · How is the history of early childhood education similar to yet different from the study of public education? · What are the major influences on understandings of best practices in early childhood education?",Education,3270,N/A,0,en

Friends,Robin Dunbar,Hachette UK,2021-03-04,"'Fascinating...In essence, the number and quality of our friendships may have a bigger influence on our happiness, health and mortality risk than anything else in life save for giving up smoking' Guardian, Book of the Day Friends matter to us, and they matter more than we think. The single most surprising fact to emerge out of the medical literature over the last decade or so has been that the number and quality of the friendships we have has a bigger influence on our happiness, health and even mortality risk than anything else except giving up smoking. Robin Dunbar is the world-renowned psychologist and author who famously discovered Dunbar's number: how our capacity for friendship is limited to around 150 people. In Friends, he looks at friendship in the round, at the way different types of friendship and family relationships intersect, or at the complex of psychological and behavioural mechanisms that underpin friendships and make them possible - and just how complicated the business of making and keeping friends actually is. Mixing insights from scientific research with first person experiences and culture, Friends explores and integrates knowledge from disciplines ranging from psychology and anthropology to neuroscience and genetics in a single magical weave that allows us to peer into the incredible complexity of the social world in which we are all so deeply embedded. Working at the coalface of the subject at both research and personal levels, Robin Dunbar has written the definitive book on how and why we are friends.",Psychology,409,N/A,0,en

From Truth and truth,Francis Etheredge,Cambridge Scholars Publishing,2016-04-26,"What emerges in this second book of the trilogy is that the very “ground” and content of experience is richer than what can be reduced to a particular account of it. As such, dialogue develops from the “natural” diversity of what is “of” faith and what is “of” reason. Neither faith nor reason, however, originates “from” experience; rather, both are “witnessed” in experience. In other words, taking up questions about the nature of man, whether philosophically, psychologically or in terms of social structures, manifests both a variety of points of departure and, at the same time, the manifold conversations that are possible in the “field of culture”.Focusing particularly on the work of St. John Paul II, the first essay examines the answer of reason and the answer of faith to the same question: What is man? Conversion, too, entails an “unexpected” relationship to natural truth, which, in its own way, is both adequate and inadequate to salvation. Communication, as it were, runs throughout these essays; however, in particular, there is a need to enrich our human understanding of the process of “coming to ourselves” with the insights of spiritual discernment. Axiomatically, however, it is possible to say that just as we come to exist through a relationship to others, so our healing and holiness are manifest through our relationship to others in the “Other”. Furthermore, while it is ultimately true that we exist as individually rooted in the social structure of our origin and the times in which we live, we need to critically participate in the dialogue which identifies our common “reality” and not live our lives covered in “psycho-social” labels of one kind or another.As a whole, then, there is an incomparable range and depth to “dialogue”. Indeed, given the many critical situations in the world, it is increasingly indispensable and essential that humanity choose the incredible wealth of dialogue in contrast to the possibility of a “polarised” and “conflictual” structure between people and peoples.",Philosophy,295,N/A,0,en

Rice Plus,Susan H. Lee,Routledge,2006-02-14,"This book explores the economic coping practices of rural widows in the aftermath of the Cambodian civil war. War produces a preponderance of widows, often young widows with small children in their care. Rural widows must feed their families and educate their children despite rural poverty and the lack of opportunities for women. The economics of widowhood is therefore a significant social problem in less developed countries. The widows' predominant economic plan was to combine rice cultivation with an assortment of microenterprises, a ""rice plus"" strategy. Many widows were unable to grow enough rice on their land to feed their families. They filled the hunger gap by raising cash through microenterprises to purchase additional rice. Gender work roles were both permeable and persistent, allowing a flexible sexual division of labor in the short run but maintaining traditional roles in the long run. Most widows called on relatives or exchanged transplanting labor for male plowing services, although a few women took up the plow themselves. The study also explores widows' access to key economic resources such as land, credit, and education. War decimated widows' family support networks, including the loss of children, their social security. The study concludes that Cambodia's gender arrangement offered many economic options to widows but also devalued their labor in a cultural structure of inequality. Gender, poverty, and war interacted to reduce widows' financial resources, accounting for their economic vulnerability.",Social Science,183,N/A,0,en

Morality and the Human Goods,Alfonso Gómez-Lobo,Georgetown University Press,2001-12-18,"A concise and accessible introduction to natural law ethics, this book introduces readers to the mainstream tradition of Western moral philosophy. Building on philosophers from Plato through Aquinas to John Finnis, Alfonso Gómez-Lobo links morality to the protection of basic human goods — life, family, friendship, work and play, the experience of beauty, knowledge, and integrity — elements essential to a flourishing, happy human life. Gómez-Lobo begins with a discussion of Plato's Crito as an introduction to the practice of moral philosophy, showing that it requires that its participants treat each other as equals and offer rational arguments to persuade each other. He then puts forth a general principle for practical rationality: one should pursue what is good and avoid what is bad. The human goods form the basis for moral norms that provide a standard by which actions can be evaluated: do they support or harm the human goods? He argues that moral norms should be understood as a system of rules whose rationale is the protection and enhancement of human goods. A moral norm that does not enjoin the preservation or enhancement of a specific good is unjustifiable. Shifting to a case study approach, Gómez-Lobo applies these principles to a discussion of abortion and euthanasia. The book ends with a brief treatment of rival positions, including utilitarianism and libertarianism, and of conscience as our ultimate moral guide. Written as an introductory text for students of ethics and natural law, Morality and the Human Goods makes arguments consistent with Catholic teaching but is not based on theological considerations. The work falls squarely within the field of philosophical ethics and will be of interest to readers of any background.",Philosophy,161,N/A,0,en

Transnational Cinema and Ideology,Milja Radovic,Routledge,2014-06-13,"Increasingly, as the production, distribution and audience of films cross national boundaries, film scholars have begun to think in terms of ‘transnational’ rather than national cinema. This book is positioned within the emerging field of transnational cinema, and offers a groundbreaking study of the relationship between transnational cinema and ideology. The book focuses in particular on the complex ways in which religion, identity and cultural myths interact in specific cinematic representations of ideology. Author Milja Radovic approaches the selected films as national, regional products, and then moves on to comparative analysis and discussion of their transnational aspects. This book also addresses the question of whether transnationalism reinforces the nation or not; one of the possible answers to this question may be given through the exploration of the cinema of national states and its transnational aspects. Radovic illustrates the ways in which these issues, represented and framed by films, are transmitted beyond their nation-state borders and local ideologies in which they originated – and questions whether therefore one can have an understanding of transnational cinema as a platform for political dialogue.",Religion,179,N/A,0,en

What Is a Family?,"Mary Elizabeth Berry, Marcia Yonemoto",Univ of California Press,2019-09-17,"A free open access ebook is available upon publication. Learn more at www.luminosoa.org. What Is a Family? explores the histories of diverse households during the Tokugawa period in Japan (1603–1868). The households studied here differ in locale and in status—from samurai to outcaste, peasant to merchant—but what unites them is life within the social order of the Tokugawa shogunate. The circumstances and choices that made one household unlike another were framed, then as now, by prevailing laws, norms, and controls on resources. These factors led the majority to form stem families, which are a focus of this volume. The essays in this book draw on rich sources—population registers, legal documents, personal archives, and popular literature—to combine accounts of collective practices (such as the adoption of heirs) with intimate portraits of individual actors (such as a murderous wife). They highlight the variety and adaptability of households that, while shaped by a shared social order, do not conform to any stereotypical version of a Japanese family.",History,290,N/A,0,en

Blume,John Wiley & Sons,2006-03-31,"A complete and accessible resource for working with couples and families Becoming a Family Counselor sets a new standard for family therapy texts. Working from a broad historical orientation, it focuses on the common themes that reappear across various theoretical approaches and connects family practice with individual approaches. Crossing boundaries of generation, gender, race, and culture, this useful introduction presents current thinking related to today's practice issues. The text begins with an overview of couple and family counseling, emphasizing the diversity and unity in the field. The development of the field is examined, from its roots in the nineteenth century through its identity crisis in the 1980s. Subsequent chapters lay out an integrated approach to contemporary family research, theory, and therapy; core chapters focus on understanding the contributions of behavioral, organizational, narrative, emotional, and spiritual perspectives. The last section of the book offers practical chapters on conducting family therapy in organizational contexts that often define the client in individual terms.

A Sociology of Family Life,"Deborah Chambers, Pablo Gracia",John Wiley & Sons,2021-11-30,"Family relations are undergoing dramatic changes globally and locally. At the same time, certain features of family life endure. This popular book, now in a fully updated second edition, presents a comprehensive assessment of recent research on 'family', parenting, childhood and interpersonal ties. A Sociology of Family Life queries assumptions about a disintegration of 'the family' by revealing a remarkable persistence of commitment and reciprocity across cultures, within new as well as traditional family forms. Yet, while new kinds of intimate relationships such as 'friends as family' and LGBTQ+ intimacies become commonplace, such personal relationships can still be difficult to negotiate in the face of wider structural norms. With a focus on factors such as class, gender, race, ethnicity and sexuality, this new edition highlights inequalities that influence and curb families and personal life transnationally. Alongside substantial new material on cultural and digital transformations, the book features extensive updates on issues ranging from demography, migration, ageing and government policies to reproductive technologies, employment and care. With a global focus, and blending theory with real-life examples, this insightful and engaging book will remain indispensable to students across the social sciences.",Social Science,204,N/A,0,en

Parenting in Stepfamilies,Gladys Lan Tak Lam-Chan,Routledge,2018-08-13,"First published in 1999, this book contains the findings of an exploratory study using in-depth interviews on parenting and the dynamics of Hong Kong Chinese stepfamilies. The stepfamily is a topic which is in lack of local research in Hong Kong, but is an emerging family structure which has increasing need for professional intervention. This study began as a result of the researcher’s concern about the soaring number of divorces and broken families in Hong Kong and her curiosity to uncover the untold stories of stepfamilies. The literature review, presentation and thematic analysis of the findings of this study will increase the readers knowledge and understanding of stepfamilies in contexts which are different from Western societies. This book unveils the perceptions and life experiences of the stepmothers, social workers and teachers attitudes towards stepfamilies and the parenting behaviours of stepfamilies in Hong Kong. The author has reflectively analyzed the complex interplay between the social attitudes, cultural stereotyping of stepfamilies influenced by Chinese traditional values, aspirations towards marriage and marital relationships, parental expectations and parent-child relationships, ideology and policy issues affecting professional intervention.",Social Science,240,N/A,0,en

Harmonic Wave Systems: Partial Differential Equations of the Helmholtz Decomposition,Victor A. Miroshnikov,"Scientific Research Publishing, Inc. USA",2017-12-15,"Harmonic Wave Systems is the first textbook about the computational method of Decomposition in Invariant Structures (DIS) that generalizes the analytical methods of separation of variables, undetermined coefficients, asymptotic expansions, and series expansions. In recent years, there has been a boom in publications on propagation of nonlinear waves described by a fascinating list of partial differential equations (PDEs). The vast majority of wave problems are reducible to one-dimensional ones in propagation variables. However, a list of publications with two- and three-dimensional applications of the DIS method is brief. The book offers a comprehensive and rigorous treatment of the DIS method in two and three dimensions using the PDE approach to the Helmholtz decomposition that provides the most general background for mathematical modelling of harmonic waves in fluid dynamics, electrodynamics, heat transfer, and other numerous areas of science and engineering, which are dealing with propagation and interaction of N internal waves.",Science,460,N/A,0,en
Families at Play,"Sinem Siyahhan, Elisabeth Gee",MIT Press,2018-02-02,"How family video game play promotes intergenerational communication, connection, and learning. Video games have a bad reputation in the mainstream media. They are blamed for encouraging social isolation, promoting violence, and creating tensions between parents and children. In this book, Sinem Siyahhan and Elisabeth Gee offer another view. They show that video games can be a tool for connection, not isolation, creating opportunities for families to communicate and learn together. Like smartphones, Skype, and social media, games help families stay connected. Siyahhan and Gee offer examples: One family treats video game playing as a regular and valued activity, and bonds over Halo. A father tries to pass on his enthusiasm for Star Wars by playing Lego Star Wars with his young son. Families express their feelings and share their experiences and understanding of the world through playing video games like The Sims, Civilization, and Minecraft. Some video games are designed specifically to support family conversations around such real-world issues and sensitive topics as bullying and peer pressure. Siyahhan and Gee draw on a decade of research to look at how learning and teaching take place when families play video games together. With video games, they argue, the parents are not necessarily the teachers and experts; all family members can be both teachers and learners. They suggest video games can help families form, develop, and sustain their learning culture as well as develop skills that are valued in the twenty-first century workplace. Educators and game designers should take note.",Education,213,N/A,0,en

In THE BUSINESS OF HAPPINESS Ted uses these six traits to demonstrate the correlation between happiness and success and uses them to create a blueprint for constructing a life of real, valued happiness and joy in the work you do. THE BUSINESS OF HAPPINESS is the book is for any business person who is looking for 'success' - whether it be making more money, having more clout, being more powerful, more effective or more confident. By following Ted's advice, you can be more successful, and happier in your job so that the 'daily grind' is no longer quite such a grind.",Business & Economics,320,N/A,0,en

How to Drink Like a Mobster,Albert W. A. Schmid,Indiana University Press,2018-09-01,"From John Dillinger's Gin Fizz to Al Capone's Templeton Rye, mobsters loved their liquor—as well as the millions that bootlegging and speakeasies made them during the Prohibition. In a time when any giggle juice could land you in the hoosegow, mobsters had their own ways of making sure the gin mill never ran dry and the drinks kept flowing. And big screen blockbusters like The Godfather, GoodFellas, and Scarface and small screen hits like The Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire ensure that our obsession with mobsters won't run dry, either. Mixology expert Albert W. A. Schmid shows how you can recreate the allure of the gangster bar life with step-by-step instructions on how to set up the best Prohibition-style bar and pour the drinks to match. Recipes include mob favorites like the Machete, the Paralyzer, Greyhound (Salty Dog), Say Hello to My Little Friend, and Angel Face, as well as classics like the Gimlet, Kamikaze, and Bee's Knees. How to Drink Like a Mobster also includes profiles of the most notorious mobsters' connections to the booze business, along with tips to stay under the radar in any speakeasy: always have at least one or more aliases ready, pay with cash, don't draw attention to yourself, and in the case of a raid, drink the evidence as fast as you can!",Cooking,85,N/A,0,en

The Impact of Racism on African American Families,Professor Paul C Rosenblatt,"Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.",2014-02-28,"In spite of the existence of statistics and numerical data on various aspects of African American life, including housing, earnings, assets, unemployment, household violence, teen pregnancy and encounters with the criminal justice system, social science literature on how racism affects the everyday interactions of African American families is limited. How does racism come home to and affect African American families? If a father in an African American family is denied employment on the basis of his race or a wife is demeaned at work by racist slurs, how is their family life affected? Given the lack of social science literature responding to these questions, this volume turns to an alternative source in order to address them: literature. Engaging with novels written by African American authors, it explores their rich depictions of African American family life, showing how these can contribute to our sociological knowledge and making the case for the novel as an object and source of social research. As such, it will appeal to scholars and students of the sociology of the family, race and ethnicity, cultural studies and literature.",Social Science,193,N/A,0,en

Family Life,Akhil Sharma,Faber & Faber,2014-04-29,"Ajay, eight years old, spends his afternoons playing cricket in the streets of Delhi with his brother Birju, four years older. They are about to leave for shiny new life in America. Ajay anticipates, breathlessly, a world of jet-packs and chewing-gum. This promised land of impossible riches and dazzling new technology is also a land that views Ajay with suspicion and hostility; one where he must rely on his big brother to tackle classroom bullies. Birju, confident, popular, is the repository of the family's hopes, and he spends every waking minute studying for the exams that will mean entry to the Bronx High School of Science, and reflected glory for them all. When a terrible accident makes a mockery of that dream, the family splinters. The boys' mother restlessly seeks the help of pundits from the temple, while their father retreats into silent despair - and the bottle. Now Ajay must find the strength of character to navigate this brave new American world, and the sorrows at home, on his own terms. By turns blackly funny, touching, raw and devastating, Family Life is a vivid and wrenching portrait of sibling relationships and the impact of tragedy on one family from a boy's eye view.",Fiction,174,N/A,0,en

An American Family,Khizr Khan,Hachette UK,2017-10-24,"'Khan's aspirational memoir reminds us all why Americans should welcome newcomers from all lands' Kirkus Reviews In fewer than three hundred words, Khizr Khan electrified viewers around the world when he took the stage at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. And when he offered to lend Donald Trump his own much-read and dog-eared pocket Constitution, his gesture perfectly encapsulated the feelings of millions. But who was that man, standing beside his wife, extolling the promises and virtues of the U.S. Constitution? In this urgent and timeless immigrant story, we learn that Khizr Khan has been many things. He was the oldest of ten children born to farmers in Pakistan, and a curious and thoughtful boy who listened rapt as his grandfather recited Rumi beneath the moonlight. He was a university student who read the Declaration of Independence and was awestruck by what might be possible in life. He was a hopeful suitor, trying to win the heart of a woman far out of his league. He was a brilliant and diligent young family man who worked two jobs to save enough money to put himself through Harvard Law School. He was a loving father who tragically lost his son, an Army captain killed while protecting his base camp in Iraq. He was and is a patriot, and a fierce advocate for the rights, dignities and values enshrined in the American system. An American Family shows us who Khizr Khan and millions of other American immigrants are, and why-especially in these tumultuous times-we must not be afraid to step forward for what we believe in when it matters most.",Biography & Autobiography,243,N/A,0,en

Reasonable Children,Michael S. Pritchard,N/A,1996,"The public outcry for a return to moral education in our schools has raised more dust than it's dispelled. Building upon his provocative ideas in On Becoming Responsible, Michael Pritchard clears the air with a sensible plan for promoting our children's moral education through the teaching of reasonableness. Pritchard contends that children have a definite but frequently untapped capacity for reasonableness and that schools in a democratic society must make the nurturing of that capacity one of their primary aims, as fundamental to learning as the development of reading, writing, and math skills. Reasonableness itself, he shows, can be best cultivated through the practice of philosophical inquiry within a classroom community. In such an environment, children learn to work together, to listen to one another, to build on one another's ideas, to probe assumptions and different perspectives, and ultimately to think for themselves. Advocating approaches to moral education that avoid mindless indoctrination and timid relativism, Pritchard neither preaches nor hides behind abstractions. He makes liberal use of actual classroom dialogues to illustrate children's remarkable capacity to engage in reasonable conversation about moral concepts involving fairness, cheating, loyalty, truthtelling, lying, making and keeping promises, obedience, character, and responsibility. He also links such discussions to fundamental concerns over law and moral authority, the roles of teachers and parents, and the relationship between church and state. Pritchard draws broadly and deeply from the fields of philosophy and psychology, as well as from his own extensive personal experience working with children and teachers. The result is a rich and insightful work that provides real hope for the future of our children and their moral education.",Education,224,N/A,0,en

The Ash Family,Molly Dektar,Simon & Schuster,2019-04-09,"When a young woman leaves her family—and the civilized world—to join an off-the-grid community headed by an enigmatic leader, she discovers that belonging comes with a deadly cost, in this lush and searing debut novel. At nineteen, Berie encounters a seductive and mysterious man at a bus station near her home in North Carolina. Shut off from the people around her, she finds herself compelled by his promise of a new life. He ferries her into a place of order and chaos: the Ash Family farm. There, she joins an intentional community living off the fertile land of the mountains, bound together by high ideals and through relationships she can’t untangle. Berie—now renamed Harmony—renounces her old life and settles into her new one on the farm. She begins to make friends. And then they start to disappear. Thrilling and profound, The Ash Family explores what we will sacrifice in the search for happiness, and the beautiful and grotesque power of the human spirit as it seeks its ultimate place of belonging.",Fiction,352,N/A,0,en
My Family and Other Animals,Gerald Durrell,Penguin Books Limited,2011-04-07,"'What we all need,' said Larry, 'is sunshine . . . a country where we can grow.' 'Yes, dear, that would be nice,' agreed Mother, not really listening. 'I had a letter from George this morning - he says Corfu's wonderful. Why don't we pack up and go to Greece?' 'Very well, dear, if you like,' said Mother unguardedly. Escaping the ills of the British climate, the Durrell family - acne-ridden Margo, gun-toting Leslie, bookworm Lawrence and budding naturalist Gerry, along with their long-suffering mother and Roger the dog - take off for the island of Corfu. But the Durrells find that, reluctantly, they must share their various villas with a menagerie of local fauna - among them scorpions, geckos, toads, bats and butterflies.

Family Estrangement,Kylie Agllias,Routledge,2016-10-04,"Family estrangement is larger than conflict and more complicated than betrayal. It is entwined in contradictory beliefs, values, behaviours and goals and is the result of at least one member of the family considering reconciliation impossible and/or undesirable. The cessation of familial relations, whether that involves rejection or deciding to leave, can be an inordinately traumatising experience. Whilst data suggests that around 1 in 12 people are estranged from at least one family member this topic is rarely discussed or researched. Based on the author’s in-depth research and exploration of the topic of estrangement, Family Estrangement: A Matter of Perspective captures the unique lived experiences of both estrangee and estranger. Offering multiple perspectives drawn from academic and popular literature as well as case studies, the book contextualises its chapters within current theoretical understandings of family relationships and estrangement, including Loss and Grief theories, Attachment Theory and Bowen Family Systems Theory. Practice sections provide estranged readers and professionals with a structured approach to exploring the various aspects of estrangement within a family and to help them identify resilience, strengths and strategies which individuals may harness as they attempt to live with estrangement. Written with the aim to provide guidance in understanding estrangement in context, this book is suitable for estranged family members and all professionals who encounter and work with people affected by estrangement, including social workers, counsellors, psychologists, allied health professionals, doctors, nurses and legal professions.",Social Science,254,N/A,0,en

Labor Relations,John W. Budd,McGraw-Hill/Irwin,2005,"Labor Relations: Striking a Balance, 1st Edition, by John Budd presents labor relations as a system for striking a balance between the employment relationship goals of efficiency, equity, and voice, and between the rights of labor and management. Budd's Labor Relations broadens the narrow process focus of existing labor relations texts by placing the discussion of contemporary U.S. processes into the context of underlying themes - what are the goals of labor relations, are those goals being fulfilled, and are reforms needed. This textbook replaces the tired paradigm of ""labor relations equals detailed work rules"" with the dynamic paradigm of ""labor relations equals balancing workplace goals and rights."" Labor law, union organizing, bargaining, dispute resolution, and contract administration are central topics, but these processes are not presented as self-evidently good. These topics are placed in the broader context of the goals of the employment relationship, conflicting rights, and the environment of the 21st Century. This broader context serves to make labor relations more engaging and relevant to students. It also allows instructors to raise important ""big picture"" ideas while covering the applied business functions and strategies of the existing processes..",Business & Economics,172,N/A,0,en
Just Like Family,Andrea Laurent-Simpson,NYU Press,2021-07-13,"Winner, 2023 Animals and Society's Distinguished Book Award, presented by the American Sociological Association The rise and increasingly important role of companion animals in our families From homemade meals for our dogs to high-end feline veterinary care, pets are a growing multi-billion-dollar industry in the United States. In Just Like Family, Andrea Laurent-Simpson explores the expanding role of animals in what she calls “the multi-species family,” providing a window into a world where almost 95 percent of adults who share their homes with dogs and cats identify—and ultimately treat—their animal companions as legitimate members of their families. With an insightful eye, Laurent-Simpson examines why and how these animals have increasingly become an important part of our households. She highlights their various roles in our lives, including as siblings to our existing children, as animal children themselves, and in some cases, even as grandchildren, particularly as fertility rates decline and a growing number of younger couples choose to live a childfree lifestyle. Ultimately, Laurent-Simpson highlights how animals—and their place in our lives—have changed the structure of the American family in surprising ways. Just Like Family provides a fascinating inside look at our complex relationships with our beloved animal companions in the twenty-first century.",Social Science,306,N/A,0,en

We Are Family,Susan Golombok,Scribe Publications,2020-07-02,"Our understanding of what makes a family has undergone a revolution in the last few decades, from same-sex parenthood to surrogacy, donor conception, and IVF. But what has the impact been on children? In We Are Family, Professor Susan Golombok visits lesbian mothers, gay fathers, single parents, donor conception parents, co-parents, trans parents, surrogates, and donors, and, more importantly, their children, to find out if they are as well-adjusted, happy, and emotionally stable as children from traditional nuclear families. And she discovers that the answer is yes — and sometimes even more so. Susan’s work at the Centre for Family Research at Cambridge proves that any family set-up can provide a loving, secure home for a child — although, the children from these families will often face prejudiced attitudes from others. Since the 1970s, when she was first drawn to this area of research after reading about lesbian mothers whose children were being removed from their care, Susan has worked tirelessly to challenge outdated attitudes and prevent families being split up for no good reason. This book tells the stories of those families — their struggles and their triumphs — while celebrating love and family in all its wonderful variations.",Family & Relationships,293,N/A,0,en

My Two Moms,Zach Wahls,Penguin,2012-04-26,"A resounding testament to individuality and the power of family in all forms from the young man who “lit up the Internet” (Ellen DeGeneres) On January 31, 2011, Zach Wahls addressed the Iowa House Judiciary Committee in a public forum regarding full marriage equality. The nineteen-year-old son of a same-sex couple, Wahls proudly proclaimed, “The sexual orientation of my parents has had zero effect on the content of my character.” Hours later, his speech was posted on YouTube, where it went viral, quickly receiving more than two million views. By the end of the week, everyone knew his name and wanted to hear more from the boy with two moms. Same-sex marriage will be a major—possibly the defining—issue in this year’s election cycle, and Wahls speaks to that, but also to a broader issue. Sure, he’s handsome and athletic, an environmental engineering student, and an Eagle Scout. Yet, growing up with two moms, he knows what it’s like to feel different and to fear being made fun of or worse. In the inspirational spirit of It Gets Better edited by Dan Savage and Terry Miller, My Two Moms also delivers a reassuring message to same-sex couples, their kids, and anyone who’s ever felt like an outsider: “You are not alone.”",Biography & Autobiography,215,4.5,4,en

Bradshaw On: The Family,John Bradshaw,Simon and Schuster,2010-01-01,"Based on the public television series of the same name, Bradshaw On: The Family is John Bradshaw's seminal work on the dynamics of families that has sold more than a million copies since its original publication in 1988. Within its pages, you will discover the cause of emotionally impaired families. You will learn how unhealthy rules of behavior are passed down from parents to children, and the destructive effect this process has on our society. Using the latest family research and recovery material in this new edition, Bradshaw also explores the individual in both a family and societal setting. He shows you ways to escape the tyranny of family-reinforced behavior traps--from addiction and co-dependency to loss of will and denial--and demonstrates how to make conscious choices that will transform your life and the lives of your loved ones. He helps you heal yourself and then, using what you have learned helps you heal your family. Finally, Bradshaw extends this idea to our society: by returning yourself and your family to emotional health, you can heal the world in which you live. He helps you reenvision societal conflicts from the perspective of a global family, and shares with you the power of deep democracy: how the choices you make every day can affect--and improve--your world.",Family & Relationships,400,N/A,0,en

Random Family,Adrian Nicole LeBlanc,Simon and Schuster,2012-10-23,"Selected as One of the Best Books of the 21st Century by The New York Times Set amid the havoc of the War on Drugs, this New York Times bestseller is an ""astonishingly intimate"" (New York magazine) chronicle of one family’s triumphs and trials in the South Bronx of the 1990s. “Unmatched in depth and power and grace. A profound, achingly beautiful work of narrative nonfiction…The standard-bearer of embedded reportage.” —Matthew Desmond, author of Evicted In her classic bestseller, journalist Adrian Nicole LeBlanc immerses readers in the world of one family with roots in the Bronx, New York. In 1989, LeBlanc approached Jessica, a young mother whose encounter with the carceral state is about to forever change the direction of her life. This meeting redirected LeBlanc’s reporting, taking her past the perennial stories of crime and violence into the community of women and children who bear the brunt of the insidious violence of poverty. Her book bears witness to the teetering highs and devastating lows in the daily lives of Jessica, her family, and her expanding circle of friends. Set at the height of the War on Drugs, Random Family is a love story—an ode to the families that form us and the families we create for ourselves. Charting the tumultuous struggle of hope against deprivation over three generations, LeBlanc slips behind the statistics and comes back with a riveting, haunting, and distinctly American true story.",Biography & Autobiography,436,N/A,0,en
"Sleep, It Does a Family Good",Archibald D. Hart,Tyndale House Pub,2010,"People today are sleep-deprived, and nowhere are the negative effects felt more acutely than in families. Most parents realize that their families aren’t getting enough sleep, though they likely don’t understand how serious the problem is and need help finding a solution. In this book, renowned psychologist and best-selling author Arch Hart explores why sleep is so important, what happens when family members are chronically sleep deprived, and how families can start developing healthy sleep habits.",Family & Relationships,231,N/A,0,en
Understanding Family Change and Variation,"Jennifer A. Johnson-Hanks, Christine A. Bachrach, S. Philip Morgan, Hans-Peter Kohler",Springer Science & Business Media,2011-08-27,"Fertility rates vary considerably across and within societies, and over time. Over the last three decades, social demographers have made remarkable progress in documenting these axes of variation, but theoretical models to explain family change and variation have lagged behind. At the same time, our sister disciplines—from cultural anthropology to social psychology to cognitive science and beyond—have made dramatic strides in understanding how social action works, and how bodies, brains, cultural contexts, and structural conditions are coordinated in that process. Understanding Family Change and Variation: Toward a Theory of Conjunctural Action argues that social demography must be reintegrated into the core of theory and research about the processes and mechanisms of social action, and proposes a framework through which that reintegration can occur. This framework posits that material and schematic structures profoundly shape the occurrence, frequency, and context of the vital events that constitute the object of social demography. Fertility and family behaviors are best understood as a function not just of individual traits, but of the structured contexts in which behavior occurs. This approach upends many assumptions in social demography, encouraging demographers to embrace the endogeneity of social life and to move beyond fruitless debates of structure versus culture, of agency versus structure, or of biology versus society.",Social Science,195,N/A,0,en

Hidden Valley Road,Robert Kolker,Hachette UK,2020-04-09,"12 children. 6 of them diagnosed with schizophrenia. Science's greatest hope in understanding the disease. ___________ *ONE OF BARACK OBAMA'S FAVOURITE BOOKS OF 2020* *TIME 100 Must-Read Books Of 2020 Pick* *New York Times bestseller* *Selected as Oprah's Book Club Pick* 'Startlingly intimate' - The Sunday Times 'Grippingly told and brilliantly reported' - Mail on Sunday 'Unforgettable' - The Times For fans of Educated, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks and Three Identical Strangers Don and Mimi Galvin seemed to be living the American dream. After World War II, Don's work with the Air Force brought them to Colorado, where their twelve children perfectly spanned the baby boom: the oldest born in 1945, the youngest in 1965. In those years, there was an established script for a family like the Galvins - aspiration, hard work, upward mobility, domestic harmony - and they worked hard to play their parts. But behind the scenes was a different story: psychological breakdown, sudden shocking violence, hidden abuse. By the mid-1970s, six of the ten Galvin boys, one after the other, were diagnosed as schizophrenic. How could all this happen to one family? What took place inside the house on Hidden Valley Road was so extraordinary that the Galvins became one of the first families to be studied by the National Institutes of Mental Health. Their story offers a shadow history of the science of schizophrenia, from the era of institutionalization, lobotomy, and the schizophrenogenic mother, to the search for genetic markers for the disease, always amidst profound disagreements about the nature of the illness itself. And unbeknownst to the Galvins, samples of their DNA informed decades of genetic research that continues today, offering paths to treatment, prediction, and even eradication of the disease for future generations. With clarity and compassion, bestselling and award-winning author Robert Kolker uncovers one family's unforgettable legacy of suffering, love and hope. 'An extraordinary case study and tour de force of reporting' - Sylvia Nasar, author of A Beautiful Mind 'This book tore my heart out. It is a revelation-about the history of mental health treatment, about trauma, foremost about family-and a more-than-worthy follow-up to Robert Kolker's brilliant Lost Girls' -Megan Abbott, Edgar Award-winning author of Dare Me and Give Me Your Hand 'Hidden Valley Road contains everything: scientific intrigue, meticulous reporting, startling revelations, and, most of all, a profound sense of humanity.

One of the twentieth century’s enduring works, One Hundred Years of Solitude is a widely beloved and acclaimed novel known throughout the world and the ultimate achievement in a Nobel Prize–winning career. The novel tells the story of the rise and fall of the mythical town of Macondo through the history of the Buendía family.

"""Nihna Nas Al-bahar - We are the People of the River.""","Cornelia Kleinitz, Claudia Näser",N/A,2012,"In 2008, a 170 km stretch of the Middle Nile valley was flooded by the reservoir of the newly constructed Merowe Dam at the Fourth Cataract. This large dam project led to the displacement of some 70,000 people, who lost their homeland, their way of life and much of their cultural heritage. Most of those affected were small-scale riverine farmers belonging to the Manasir and the Shaiqiyya of Amri and Hamdab. Although large-scale archaeological rescue campaigns were undertaken along the projected reservoir in anticipation of the flooding, the scientific community paid little attention to the living heritage of the present inhabitants of the Fourth Cataract region. As a rare testimony to the affected people, the volume edited by Cornelia Kleinitz and Claudia Naser collects the work of ethnographers, social geographers, architects and archaeologists among local communities at the Fourth Cataract, and, in one case, in a prospective resettlement area. The contributions focus on traditional architecture, agricultural production and ways of life - including gender aspects - in this remote and highly specific cultural landscape before resettlement, investigate the process of forced resettlement and its consequences for the affected communities, and outline a political history and a critical ethnography of archaeological salvage in the context of dam building in the Middle Nile valley and the area of the Merowe Dam, respectively. Evaluating the conditions of dam construction, the salvage of cultural heritage and the fate of the affected people from several perspectives, the papers of this volume contribute to the critical discussion of the benefits and costs of major infrastructural development projects in Africa and beyond.",History,324,N/A,0,en

Like One of the Family,Alice Childress,Beacon Press,2017-01-24,"Recommended by Entertainment Weekly The hilarious, uncompromising novel about African American domestic workers—from a trailblazer in Black women’s literature and now featuring a foreword by Roxane Gay First published in Paul Robeson’s newspaper, Freedom, and composed of a series of conversations between Mildred, a black domestic, and her friend Marge, Like One of the Family is a wry, incisive portrait of working women in Harlem in the 1950s. Rippling with satire and humor, Mildred’s outspoken accounts vividly capture her white employers’ complacency and condescension—and their startled reactions to a maid who speaks her mind and refuses to exchange dignity for pay. Upon publication the book sparked a critique of working conditions, laying the groundwork for the contemporary domestic worker movement. Although she was critically praised, Childress’s uncompromising politics and unflinching depictions of racism, classism, and sexism relegated her to the fringe of American literature. Like One of the Family has been long overlooked, but this new edition, featuring a foreword by best-selling author Roxane Gay, will introduce Childress to a new generation.",Fiction,266,N/A,0,en

The Man Who Loved Children,Christina Stead,Open Road Media,2012-10-23,"“This crazy, gorgeous family novel” written at the end of the Great Depression “is one of the great literary achievements of the twentieth century” (Jonathan Franzen, The New York Times). First published in 1940, The Man Who Loved Children was rediscovered in 1965 thanks to the poet Randall Jarrell’s eloquent introduction (included in this ebook edition), which compares Christina Stead to Leo Tolstoy. Today, it stands as a masterpiece of dysfunctional family life. In a country crippled by the Great Depression, Sam and Henny Pollit have too much—too much contempt for one another, too many children, too much strain under endless obligation. Flush with ego and chilling charisma, Sam torments and manipulates his children in an esoteric world of his own imagining. Henny looks on desperately, all too aware of the madness at the root of her husband’s behavior. And Louie, the damaged, precocious adolescent girl at the center of their clashes, is the “ugly duckling” whose struggle will transfix contemporary readers. Named one of the best novels of the twentieth century by Newsweek, Stead’s semiautobiographical work reads like a Depression-era The Glass Castle. In the New York Times, Jonathan Franzen wrote of this classic, “I carry it in my head the way I carry childhood memories; the scenes are of such precise horror and comedy that I feel I didn’t read the book so much as live it.”",Fiction,731,N/A,0,en

Energy and Humanity,Jami Hossain,Cambridge Scholars Publishing,2019-10-29,"Sometime around three million years ago, the first hominid walked on this planet. In the time which has elapsed since then, the descendant of this biped has evolved to reach the top of the food chain. Furthermore, it has manipulated other lifeforms and Earth’s resources in a manner that makes these entirely subservient to only one species, homo sapiens. In a period less than 0.007% of Earth’s age, man has dramatically altered both the biosphere and the climate. This text argues that intelligent manipulation of ‘energy’ is at the heart of human supremacy. Energy is intertwined in an intricate manner with everything that happens around us. From the very beginning, nearly three million years ago, up until today, the human race has evolved and progressed by gaining mastery and control over energy. This book presents an insightful description of the evolution of human civilization from an energy perspective, showing that ‘energy’ is the vehicle that has catapulted the human race to a commanding position on Earth. From rudimentary Stone Age tools to classical physics, from animal power to the steam engine, and from relativity and quantum theory to geo-politics and climate change, drawing upon multiple disciplines, it weaves a fascinating story of the history of “energy” in human civilization. It also discusses the “dark side” of energy, exemplified by climate change, pollution, and deforestation, which is compelling modern human civilization to once again go into an energy transition mode, as well as those forms of energy which can counteract such forces: renewable and smart energy and their associated innovations.",Technology & Engineering,241,5,2,en

Abelian Groups,László Fuchs,Springer,2015-12-12,"Written by one of the subject’s foremost experts, this book focuses on the central developments and modern methods of the advanced theory of abelian groups, while remaining accessible, as an introduction and reference, to the non-specialist. It provides a coherent source for results scattered throughout the research literature with lots of new proofs. The presentation highlights major trends that have radically changed the modern character of the subject, in particular, the use of homological methods in the structure theory of various classes of abelian groups, and the use of advanced set-theoretical methods in the study of un decidability problems. The treatment of the latter trend includes Shelah’s seminal work on the un decidability in ZFC of Whitehead’s Problem; while the treatment of the former trend includes an extensive (but non-exhaustive) study of p-groups, torsion-free groups, mixed groups and important classes of groups arising from ring theory. To prepare the reader to tackle these topics, the book reviews the fundamentals of abelian group theory and provides some background material from category theory, set theory, topology and homological algebra. An abundance of exercises are included to test the reader’s comprehension, and to explore noteworthy extensions and related sidelines of the main topics.

The BALB/c Mouse,Michael Potter,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The mouse was first used in immunological research by Paul Ehrlich in 1891 in an extraordinary series of experiments on the maternal transfer of antitoxic immunity. A short 22 years later in 1913 Halsey Bagg acquired a stock of albino mice from a commercial dealer and used them in a series of experiments on learning. Because he was interested in the genetics of intelligence, Halsey Bagg began breeding a pedigreed line of these mice that were subsequently named for him - Bagg Albino. Though Halsey Bagg is not credited with initiating the inbred strains of mice, his stock curiously has played an indisputably important role. Bagg Albinos were progenitors of the present day BALB/c family of sublines - the subject of this book. They were also used as one of the parents in the development of inbred strains A, CBA and C3H, three other very famous strains. Today the BALB/c mouse is among the five most widely used inbred strains in biomedical research and a particular favorite in immunology and infectious disease research. The hallmark of the BALB/c response to so many kinds of infections is susceptibility and sometimes an exaggerated susceptibility, but this paradoxically is not associated with immunodeficiency as BALB/c is an excellent responder to immuni zation. These characteristics have made the BALB/c mouse a model for identifying genes that determine susceptibility to infectious and neoplastic diseases. In 1985 the laboratory BALB/c mouse became 72 years old. The current filial generations are somewhere around 350 generations [MURPHY].",Medical,261,N/A,0,en
Aseneth's Transformation,Kirsten Marie Hartvigsen,Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG,2018-12-17,"The story of Joseph and Aseneth is a fascinating expansion of the narrative in Genesis of Joseph in Egypt, and in particular, of his marriage to the daughter of an Egyptian priest. This study examines the portrayal of Aseneth’s transformation in the text, focusing on three perspectives. How did Aseneth’s encounter with Joseph and her subsequent transformation affect various aspects of her identity in the narrative? In what ways do the portrayals of Aseneth, her transformation, and her abode relate to select metaphors and other symbolic features depicted in the Septuagint, the Hebrew Bible, and the Pseudepigrapha? And, how do the ritualized components through which Aseneth’s transformation occurred function in the narrative, and why are they perceived as effective? In order to shed light on these facets of Joseph and Aseneth, the author draws on the contemporary approaches of intersectionality, conceptual blending, intertextual blending, and the cognitive theory of rituals, using these theoretical frameworks to explore and illuminate the complexity of Aseneth’s transformation.",Religion,309,N/A,0,en

Hypoparathyroidism,"Maria Luisa Brandi, Edward Meigs Brown",Springer,2015-02-24,"Hypoparathyroidism, a condition in which insufficient parathyroid hormone (PTH) is produced to maintain normocalcemia is associated with a variety of acute and chronic symptoms and complications due to hypocalcemia. Replacement therapy utilizing PTH has long been awaited, and this book is new and very timely as it coincides with the publication of results on the role of the PTH molecule in the pharmacological management of this disorder. This advance is sparking renewed interest in hypoparathyroidism, which is attributable to neck surgery in most cases and to inherited disorders in a minority. Hypoparathyroidism has been written by acknowledged experts in the field and provides essential, up-to-date information on the pathology, diagnosis, and treatment of the condition. It opens by addressing in detail the anatomy and physiology of the parathyroids and describing the epidemiology and clinical presentation of hypoparathyroidism. The full range of hypoparathyroid disorders are then discussed, including the various genetic forms, postoperative hypoparathyroidism, and other forms of acquired hypoparathyroidism. Individual chapters focus on refractory disease, the impact of the condition on bone, and the management of acute hypocalcemia. Both conventional treatment for hypoparathyroidism and the novel replacement therapy with PTH peptides are then thoroughly examined. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is also extensively discussed, with information on the various forms, differential diagnosis, and genetic testing.

Manis Valuations and Prüfer Extensions II,"Manfred Knebusch, Tobias Kaiser",Springer,2014-03-20,"This volume is a sequel to “Manis Valuation and Prüfer Extensions I,” LNM1791. The Prüfer extensions of a commutative ring A are roughly those commutative ring extensions R / A, where commutative algebra is governed by Manis valuations on R with integral values on A. These valuations then turn out to belong to the particularly amenable subclass of PM (=Prüfer-Manis) valuations. While in Volume I Prüfer extensions in general and individual PM valuations were studied, now the focus is on families of PM valuations. One highlight is the presentation of a very general and deep approximation theorem for PM valuations, going back to Joachim Gräter’s work in 1980, a far-reaching extension of the classical weak approximation theorem in arithmetic. Another highlight is a theory of so called “Kronecker extensions,” where PM valuations are put to use in arbitrary commutative ring extensions in a way that ultimately goes back to the work of Leopold Kronecker.",Mathematics,202,N/A,0,en

The Divergence Theorem and Sets of Finite Perimeter,Washek F. Pfeffer,CRC Press,2012-04-12,"This book is devoted to a detailed development of the divergence theorem. The framework is that of Lebesgue integration — no generalized Riemann integrals of Henstock–Kurzweil variety are involved. In Part I the divergence theorem is established by a combinatorial argument involving dyadic cubes. Only elementary properties of the Lebesgue integral and Hausdorff measures are used. The resulting integration by parts is sufficiently general for many applications. As an example, it is applied to removable singularities of Cauchy–Riemann, Laplace, and minimal surface equations. The sets of finite perimeter are introduced in Part II. Both the geometric and analytic points of view are presented. The equivalence of these viewpoints is obtained via the functions of bounded variation. These functions are studied in a self-contained manner with no references to Sobolev’s spaces. The coarea theorem provides a link between the sets of finite perimeter and functions of bounded variation. The general divergence theorem for bounded vector fields is proved in Part III. The proof consists of adapting the combinatorial argument of Part I to sets of finite perimeter. The unbounded vector fields and mean divergence are also discussed. The final chapter contains a characterization of the distributions that are equal to the flux of a continuous vector field.",Mathematics,261,N/A,0,en

Wealth Accumulation Made Simple and Easy,Esau Williamson,"Christian Faith Publishing, Inc.",2023-04-21,"Wealth accumulation is a mindset. It has little to do with where you live or work or even how much money you make. It's what you do with what you make! The United States is known as the land of opportunities. Even though the opportunities are here, many Americans are not able to participate in the growth of this great nation. Most Americans need but lack a simple but complete financial plan.

The Role of Structural Fiscal Policy on Female Labor Force Participation in OECD Countries,"Miyoko Asai, Qiaoe Chen, Mr. Jiro Honda, Xingwei Hu, Qianqian Zhang",International Monetary Fund,2023-09-08,"This paper examines the role of structural fiscal policies to promote female labor force participation and reduce gender gaps in labor markets in 26 OECD countries from 2000 to 2019. As both female labor force participation and many explanatory/control variables clearly exhibit non-stationarity (potentially leading to spurious regression results), we employ a panel vector error-correction model, in contrast with most previous empirical studies on this matter. Our analyses confirm statistically significant positive impacts of government spending on (1) early childcare and education, (2) active labor market programs, and (3) unemployment benefits, all of which would help encourage women to enter the labor force, while (4) an increase in relative tax rate on second earner could have negative impact on female labor force participation.",Business & Economics,51,N/A,0,en

DNA Polymerases,Ulrich Hübscher,World Scientific,2010,"Maintenance of the information embedded in the genomic DNA sequence is essential for life. DNA polymerases play pivotal roles in the complex processes that maintain genetic integrity. Besides their tasks in vivo, DNA polymerases are the workhorses in numerous biotechnology applications such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cDNA cloning, genome sequencing, nucleic acids-based diagnostics and in techniques to analyze ancient and otherwise damaged DNA. Moreover, some diseases are related to DNA polymerase defects, and chemotherapy through inhibition of DNA polymerases is used to fight HIV, Herpes and Hepatitis B and C infections. We have recently witnessed the discovery of an abundance of novel DNA polymerases in viruses, bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes with specialized properties whose physiological functions are only beginning to be understood. This book summarizes the current knowledge of these fascinating enzymes. It is intended for a wide audience from basic scientists, to diagnostic laboratories and to clinicians who seek a better understanding of these fascinating enzymes.",Medical,338,N/A,0,en

"Information, Incentives, and Education Policy",Derek A. Neal,Harvard University Press,2018-05-14,"How do we ensure that waste and inefficiency do not undermine the mission of publicly funded schools? Derek Neal writes that economists must analyze education policy in the same way they analyze other procurement problems. Insights from research on incentives and contracts in the private sector point to new approaches that could induce publicly funded educators to provide excellent education, even though taxpayers and parents cannot monitor what happens in the classroom. Information, Incentives, and Education Policy introduces readers to what economists know—and do not know—about the logjams created by misinformation and disincentives in education. Examining a range of policy agendas, from assessment-based accountability and centralized school assignments to charter schools and voucher systems, Neal demonstrates where these programs have been successful, where they have failed, and why. The details clearly matter: there is no quick-and-easy fix for education policy. By combining elements from various approaches, economists can help policy makers design optimal reforms. Information, Incentives, and Education Policy is organized to show readers how standard tools from economics research on information and incentives speak directly to some of the most crucial issues in education today. In addition to providing an overview of the pluses and minuses of particular programs, each chapter includes a series of exercises that allow students of economics to work through the mathematics for themselves or with an instructor’s assistance. For those who wish to master the models and tools that economists of education should use in their work, there is no better resource available.",Education,167,N/A,0,en

Uniquely focussing on how to integrate science as well as theory into clinical practice, the book provides an overview of science from multiple domains and ties it to family systems theory through the key framework of autonomy and adaptation. Drawing on research from genetics, physiology, emotion regulation, attachment, and triangulation, chapters demonstrate how a comprehensive science-informed theory of family systems can be applied to a range of problematic family patterns. The text also explores self-of-the-therapist work and considers how autonomy and attachment are connected to systems of power, privilege, and oppression. Supported throughout by practical case examples, as well as questions for consideration, chapter summaries, and resource lists to further engage the reader, The Science of Family Systems Theory is an essential textbook for marriage and family therapy students as well as mental health professionals working with families.",Psychology,191,N/A,0,en

Family Honor,Robert B. Parker,Penguin,2000-11-01,"A blazingly original novel from the undisputed dean of American crime fiction, featuring a sharp, tough, sexy new P.I., Sunny Randall. Sunny Randall is a Boston P.I. and former cop, a college graduate, an aspiring painter, a divorcée, and the owner of a miniature bull terrier named Rosie. Hired by a wealthy family to locate their teenage daughter, Sunny is tested by the parents’ preconceived notion of what a detective should be. With the help of underworld contacts she tracks down the runaway Millicent, who has turned to prostitution, rescues her from a vicious pimp, and finds herself, at thirty-four, the unlikely custodian of a difficult teenager when the girl refuses to return to her family. But Millicent’s problems are rooted in much larger crimes than running away, and Sunny, now playing the role of bodyguard, is caught in a shooting war with some very serious mobsters. She turns for help to her ex-husband, Richie, himself the son of a mob family, and to her dearest friend, Spike, a flamboyant and dangerous gay man. Heading this unlikely alliance, Sunny must solve at least one murder, resolve a criminal conspiracy that reaches to the top of state government, and bring Millicent back into functional young womanhood.",Fiction,298,N/A,0,en

Well suited as a theory for program construction, it makes possible the expression of both specifications and programs within the same formalism. Furthermore, the proof rules can be used to derive a correct program from a specification as well as to verify that a given program has a certain property. This book contains a thorough introduction to type theory, with information on polymorphic sets, subsets, monomorphic sets, and a full set of helpful examples.",Computers,240,N/A,0,en

Siberian Exile,Julija Sukys,University of Nebraska Press,2019-12-01,"2018 Book Prize from the Association for the Advancement of Baltic Studies 2018 Vine Award for Canadian Jewish Literature in Nonfiction from the Koffler Centre of the Arts in Toronto When Julija Šukys was a child, her paternal grandfather, Anthony, rarely smiled, and her grandmother, Ona, spoke only in her native Lithuanian. But they still taught Šukys her family’s story: that of a proud people forced from their homeland when the soldiers came. In mid-June 1941 three Red Army soldiers arrested Ona and sent her east to Siberia, where she spent seventeen years working on a collective farm. It was all a mistake, the family maintained. Some seventy years after these events, Šukys sat down to write about her grandparents and their survival of a twenty-five-year forced separation and subsequent reunion. Piecing the story together from letters, oral histories, audio recordings, and KGB documents, her research soon revealed a Holocaust-era secret—a family connection to the killing of seven hundred Jews in a small Lithuanian border town. According to KGB documents, the man in charge when those massacres took place was Anthony, Ona’s husband. In Siberian Exile Šukys weaves together the two narratives: the story of Ona, noble exile and innocent victim, and that of Anthony, accused war criminal. She examines the stories that communities tell themselves and considers what happens when the stories we’ve been told all our lives suddenly and irrevocably change, and how forgiveness operates across generations and the barriers of life and death.",Biography & Autobiography,194,N/A,0,en

Women and the Family,"Beth Hess, Marvin B Sussman",Routledge,2014-06-17,"Despite the pervasive changes that have taken place in women’s lives in the past twenty-five years--increased participation in the labor force, the attainment of higher levels of education, and higher salaries--comparable changes in the division of family labor and in the roles of men have lagged considerably. In this timely book, the editors and other experts in feminism and family studies examine the effects of two decades of influence by the women’s movement on sex roles and child rearing. While applauding some positive changes, the contributors point to powerful forces of resistance to equality between the sexes, especially “the question of family”--the fear of depriving children of maternal attachment and the belief that working mothers are placing their own interests above those of other family members--as an issue that, until fully addressed, prevents genuine equality between the sexes.",Law,265,N/A,0,en

Drawing from his own extensive experience, new primary research, and examples from a wide range of family businesses, Paisner offers practical recommendations for handling conflict, establishing professional management structures, setting strategic goals, making the most of outside directors, preparing heirs to take the reins, proactively setting tax and estate priorities, and making wise selling decisions.",Business & Economics,240,N/A,0,en

The Family in Greek History,Cynthia B. Patterson,Harvard University Press,2009-07-01,"The family, Cynthia Patterson demonstrates, played a key role in the political changes that mark the history of ancient Greece. From the archaic society portrayed in Homer and Hesiod to the Hellenistic age, the private world of the family and household was integral with and essential to the civic realm. Early Greek society was rooted not in clans but in individual households, and a man's or woman's place in the larger community was determined by relationships within those households. The development of the city-state did not result in loss of the family's power and authority, Patterson argues; rather, the protection of household relationships was an important element of early public law. The interaction of civic and family concerns in classical Athens is neatly articulated by the examples of marriage and adultery laws. In law courts and in theater performances, violation of marital relationships was presented as a public danger, the adulterer as a sexual thief. This is an understanding that fits the Athenian concept of the city as the highest form of family. The suppression of the cities with the ascendancy of Alexander's empire led to a new resolution of the relationship between public and private authority: the concept of a community of households, which is clearly exemplified in Menander's plays. Undercutting common interpretations of Greek experience as evolving from clan to patriarchal state, Patterson's insightful analysis sheds new light on the role of men and women in Greek culture.",History,296,N/A,0,en

It captures the diversities and challenges of contemporary families and provides a culture and region-specific overview of how families adapt and change generationally. The book explores the paradigms of understanding family life in India through illustrations which trace patterns of family formations in the context of large-scale social, economic and media-driven changes. Besides discussing the ongoing debates on the sociology of family, the chapters in this volume also look at diverse families experiencing poverty, conflict and displacement and demystifies families with members having a disability or non-normative sexual orientation.

Second Thoughts,Stephen B Shepard,N/A,2021-01-04,"It seems natural, at a certain age, to look back more than forward, to reflect on your life, to search for meaning among the mundane. So it is that I'm having second thoughts -- not necessarily good or bad -- but a retrospection that might yield insights derived from lifelong experience. At best, I seek something approaching wisdom, a word we often invoke as an antidote to the physical frailties of aging. The risk is that such reflection is little more than romanticized sentiment that glamourizes the ordinary. I hope, instead, for something more: New understanding about the family of my boyhood. Greater meaning about today's journalism as it copes with profound change. New thoughts about the Jewishness I once rejected. Renewed pleasure in re-reading fiction that matters. And deep understanding of male friendship, including the death of an old friend. We can't re-play our lives, as if editing an old movie. Perhaps we can benefit from an honest quest for second thoughts. Here's mine.",,248,N/A,0,en

The Code was first published in 1926, and a new edition of the code has been published every six years since 1934. The 2012 edition of the Code incorporates laws enacted through the One Hundred Twelfth Congress, Second Session, the last of which was signed by the President on January 15, 2013. It does not include laws of the One Hundred Thirteenth Congress, First Session, enacted between January 2, 2013, the date it convened, and January 15, 2013. By statutory authority this edition may be cited ""U.S.C. 2012 ed."" As adopted in 1926, the Code established prima facie the general and permanent laws of the United States. The underlying statutes reprinted in the Code remained in effect and controlled over the Code in case of any discrepancy. In 1947, Congress began enacting individual titles of the Code into positive law. When a title is enacted into positive law, the underlying statutes are repealed and the title then becomes legal evidence of the law. Currently, 26 of the 51 titles in the Code have been so enacted. These are identified in the table of titles near the beginning of each volume. The Law Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives continues to prepare legislation pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 285b to enact the remainder of the Code, on a title-by-title basis, into positive law. The 2012 edition of the Code was prepared and published under the supervision of Ralph V. Seep, Law Revision Counsel.

"Cyclic Coverings, Calabi-Yau Manifolds and Complex Multiplication",Christian Rohde,Springer Science & Business Media,2009-04-28,"The main goal of this book is the construction of families of Calabi-Yau 3-manifolds with dense sets of complex multiplication fibers. The new families are determined by combining and generalizing two methods. Firstly, the method of E. Viehweg and K. Zuo, who have constructed a deformation of the Fermat quintic with a dense set of CM fibers by a tower of cyclic coverings. Using this method, new families of K3 surfaces with dense sets of CM fibers and involutions are obtained. Secondly, the construction method of the Borcea-Voisin mirror family, which in the case of the author's examples yields families of Calabi-Yau 3-manifolds with dense sets of CM fibers, is also utilized. Moreover fibers with complex multiplication of these new families are also determined. This book was written for young mathematicians, physicists and also for experts who are interested in complex multiplication and varieties with complex multiplication. The reader is introduced to generic Mumford-Tate groups and Shimura data, which are among the main tools used here. The generic Mumford-Tate groups of families of cyclic covers of the projective line are computed for a broad range of examples.",Mathematics,234,N/A,0,en
Nonlinear Computational Geometry,"Ioannis Z. Emiris, Frank Sottile, Thorsten Theobald",Springer Science & Business Media,2009-10-28,"An original motivation for algebraic geometry was to understand curves and surfaces in three dimensions. Recent theoretical and technological advances in areas such as robotics, computer vision, computer-aided geometric design and molecular biology, together with the increased availability of computational resources, have brought these original questions once more into the forefront of research. One particular challenge is to combine applicable methods from algebraic geometry with proven techniques from piecewise-linear computational geometry (such as Voronoi diagrams and hyperplane arrangements) to develop tools for treating curved objects. These research efforts may be summarized under the term nonlinear computational geometry. This volume grew out of an IMA workshop on Nonlinear Computational Geometry in May/June 2007 (organized by I.Z. Emiris, R. Goldman, F. Sottile, T. Theobald) which gathered leading experts in this emerging field. The research and expository articles in the volume are intended to provide an overview of nonlinear computational geometry. Since the topic involves computational geometry, algebraic geometry, and geometric modeling, the volume has contributions from all of these areas. By addressing a broad range of issues from purely theoretical and algorithmic problems, to implementation and practical applications this volume conveys the spirit of the IMA workshop.",Mathematics,244,N/A,0,en
Generations,Alexandra Walsham,Oxford University Press,2023-01-19,"Generations injects fresh energy into tired debates about England's plural and protracted Reformations by adopting the fertile concept of generation as its analytical framework. It demonstrates that the tumultuous religious developments that stretched across the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries not merely transformed the generations that experienced them, but were also forged and created by them. The book investigates how age and ancestry were implicated in the theological and cultural upheavals of the era and how these, in turn, reconfigured the relationship between memory, history, and time. It explores the manifold ways in which the Reformations shaped the horizontal relationships that early modern people formed with their siblings, kin, and peers, as well as the vertical ones that tied them to their dead ancestors and their future heirs. Generations highlights the vital part that families bound by blood and by faith played in shaping these events, as well as in mediating our knowledge of the religious past and in the making of its archive. Drawing on a rich array of evidence, it provides poignant glimpses into how people navigated the profound challenges that the English Reformations posed in everyday life.",England,566,N/A,0,en

Methods for Social Theory,"Jan Ch.

Taking as its point of departure the distinction between the research process and the reporting process – between clarifying one’s ideas to oneself and writing to express these ideas clearly to others – this volume concentrates on writing when theorizing as a way of thinking, emphasizing the series of relations that exist between ontology, epistemology and rhetoric upon which successful theoretical writing depends. Richly illustrated with practical examples, the book is divided into two parts, the first of which presents techniques for theorizing based upon visualized and logical connections of ideas, concepts and empirical patterns in both free and systematic ways, and the second part providing techniques for structuring and presenting arguments in essays, papers, articles or books.As such, Methods for Social Theory offers a toolbox for the development and presentation of social thought, which will prove essential for students and teachers across the social sciences.",Social Science,185,N/A,0,en

This led to the introduction of wide classes of Banach spaces known as JB∗-triples and JBW∗-triples whose geometry has been thoroughly studied by several outstanding mathematicians in the late 1980s. The book presents a good example of fruitful interaction between different branches of mathematics, making it attractive for mathematicians interested in various fields such as algebra, differential geometry and, of course, complex and functional analysis.",Education,577,N/A,0,en

Handbook of Teichmüller Theory,Athanase Papadopoulos,European Mathematical Society,2007,"The Teichmuller space of a surface was introduced by O. Teichmuller in the 1930s. It is a basic tool in the study of Riemann's moduli spaces and the mapping class groups. These objects are fundamental in several fields of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, number theory, topology, geometry, and dynamics. The original setting of Teichmuller theory is complex analysis. The work of Thurston in the 1970s brought techniques of hyperbolic geometry to the study of Teichmuller space and its asymptotic geometry. Teichmuller spaces are also studied from the point of view of the representation theory of the fundamental group of the surface in a Lie group $G$, most notably $G=\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ and $G=\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})$. In the 1980s, there evolved an essentially combinatorial treatment of the Teichmuller and moduli spaces involving techniques and ideas from high-energy physics, namely from string theory. The current research interests include the quantization of Teichmuller space, the Weil-Petersson symplectic and Poisson geometry of this space as well as gauge-theoretic extensions of these structures. The quantization theories can lead to new invariants of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. The purpose of this handbook is to give a panorama of some of the most important aspects of Teichmuller theory. The handbook should be useful to specialists in the field, to graduate students, and more generally to mathematicians who want to learn about the subject. All the chapters are self-contained and have a pedagogical character. They are written by leading experts in the subject.",Mathematics,812,N/A,0,en

Valuing Children,Nancy Folbre,Harvard University Press,2010-03-15,"Nancy Folbre challenges the conventional economist's assumption that parents have children for the same reason that they acquire pets--primarily for the pleasure of their company. Children become the workers and taxpayers of the next generation, and ""investments"" in them offer a significant payback to other participants in the economy. Yet parents, especially mothers, pay most of the costs. The high price of childrearing pushes many families into poverty, often with adverse consequences for children themselves. Parents spend time as well as money on children. Yet most estimates of the ""cost"" of children ignore the value of this time. Folbre provides a startlingly high but entirely credible estimate of the value of parental time per child by asking what it would cost to purchase a comparable substitute for it. She also emphasizes the need for better accounting of public expenditure on children over the life cycle and describes the need to rethink the very structure and logic of the welfare state. A new institutional structure could promote more cooperative, sustainable, and efficient commitments to the next generation.",Business & Economics,246,N/A,0,en

Family and Civilization,Carle C. Zimmerman,Simon and Schuster,2023-05-02,"In Family and Civilization, the distinguished Harvard sociologist Carle Zimmerman demonstrates the close and causal connections between the rise and fall of different types of families and the rise and fall of civilizations, particularly ancient Greece and Rome, medieval and modern Europe, and the United States. Zimmerman traces the evolution of family structure from tribes and clans to extended and large nuclear families to the smaller, often broken families of today. And he shows the consequences of each structure for bearing and rearing of children, for religion, law, and everyday life, and for the fate of civilization itself. Originally published in 1947, this compelling analysis predicted many of today's controversies and trends concerning youth violence and depression, abortion, and homosexuality, the demographic collapse of the West, and the displacement of peoples.

Moduli Spaces of Riemann Surfaces,"Benson Farb, Richard Hain, Eduard Looijenga",American Mathematical Soc.,2013-08-16,"Mapping class groups and moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces were the topics of the Graduate Summer School at the 2011 IAS/Park City Mathematics Institute. This book presents the nine different lecture series comprising the summer school, covering a selection of topics of current interest. The introductory courses treat mapping class groups and Teichmüller theory. The more advanced courses cover intersection theory on moduli spaces, the dynamics of polygonal billiards and moduli spaces, the stable cohomology of mapping class groups, the structure of Torelli groups, and arithmetic mapping class groups. The courses consist of a set of intensive short lectures offered by leaders in the field, designed to introduce students to exciting, current research in mathematics. These lectures do not duplicate standard courses available elsewhere. The book should be a valuable resource for graduate students and researchers interested in the topology, geometry and dynamics of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces and related topics.

My Family for the War,Anne C. Voorhoeve,Penguin,2012-02-16,"Winner of the Mildred L. Batchelder medal for most oustanding children's book in translation. Escaping Nazi Germany on the kindertransport changes one girl's life forever At the start of World War II, ten-year-old Franziska Mangold is torn from her family when she boards the kindertransport in Berlin, the train that secretly took nearly 10,000 children out of Nazi territory to safety in England. Taken in by strangers who soon become more like family than her real parents, Frances (as she is now known) courageously pieces together a new life for herself because she doesn't know when or if she'll see her true family again. Against the backdrop of war-torn London, Frances struggles with questions of identity, family, and love, and these experiences shape her into a dauntless, charming young woman. Originally published in Germany, Anne Voorhoeve's award-winning novel is filled with humor, danger, and romance.",Young Adult Fiction,378,N/A,0,en

The Gilded Age,Eleanor Dwight,Universe Publishing(NY),1996,"""The Gilded Age tells the fascinating story of a dynamic era in America, from the 1870s to the early years of the twentieth century, when enormous fortunes were made and lost overnight. This dazzling book provides a glimpse into the period that has left us a legacy of art and architecture derived from European culture. Excerpts from the writings of America's brilliant author Edith Wharton and her contemporaries including Henry James and Mark Twain, coupled with beautiful reproductions of paintings by John Singer Sargent, William Merritt Chase, Maurice Brazil Prendergast, and others, make this a charming souvenir of the time. The writers' critical and amusing descriptions of the competitive building of mansions, art collecting, and social rituals provide a lively commentary of a time in which such fascinating personalities as J.P. Morgan, Isabella Stewart Gardner, and Mrs. Caroline Schermerhorn Astor played an important role.",Art,88,N/A,0,en

No Fear,Tony Perkins,WaterBrook,2015-09-08,"This book heralds a new generation of Christians who are more than bold…they are fearless! No Fear draws you inside the stories of young, ordinary believers who, despite incredible opposition, courageously stand up for God’s truth. Tony Perkins pairs each story with a biblical example and gives practical ideas for building a “no fear” perspective every day. Today, followers of Jesus Christ face more opposition to their beliefs than any generation in American history. Yet even in such a hostile cultural and political environment, it is an exciting time to stand firm in the faith. You have been chosen to live in this important hour, and reading these stories will inspire you to the same kind of courage. So what are you waiting for? “Tony Perkins has discovered a new generation of young people who love following God more than the crowd...You will discover there is still hope for America and the world after reading their stories in No Fear!” —Todd Starnes, Fox News Channel “No Fear...is a must-read book that will inspire a courageous heart in tomorrow’s movers and shakers. —Dana Loesch, nationally syndicated radio host, author, host BlazeTV “As the world continues to spiral into an anti-Christian age, it’s important to empower our young people with the strength and conviction to hold fast to the teachings of Christ, and No Fear does just that.” —Dr. Jack Graham, Senior Pastor, Prestonwood Baptist Church Includes discussion questions after each chapter.",Religion,210,N/A,0,en

The Scurlock Studio and Black Washington,Paul Gardullo,Smithsonian Books,2009-01-07,"Nearly a century's worth of Scurlock photographs combine to form a searing portrait of black Washington in all its guises—its challenges and its victories, its dignity and its determination. Beginning in the early twentieth century and continuing into the 1990s, Addison Scurlock, followed by his sons, Robert and George, used their cameras to document and celebrate a community unique in the world, and a stronghold in the history and culture of the nation's capital. Through photographs of formal weddings, elegant cotillions, ballet studios, and quiet family life, the Scurlocks revealed a world in which the black middle class refused to be defined or held captive by discrimination. From its home on the vibrant U Street corridor, the Scurlock Studio gave us indelible images of leaders and luminaries, of high society and working class, of Washingtonians at work and at play. In photograph after photograph, the Scurlocks captured an optimism and resiliency seldom seen in mainstream depictions of segregated society. Luminaries such as Duke Ellington, Ralph Bunche, Mary McLeod Bethune, Alain Locke, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Lois Mailou Jones testify to the intellectual and cultural vibrancy that was unique to Washington and an inspiration to the nation. Photographs of a Peoples Drugstore protest and Marian Anderson's Easter morning concert at the Lincoln Memorial remind us that the struggle for equality in black Washington began long before the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Offering a rich lens into our past, The Scurlock Studio and Black Washington is a powerful trigger of personal and historical memory.",Biography & Autobiography,232,N/A,0,en

Family First,Phil McGraw,Simon and Schuster,2013-01-29,"Do you feel that your family is not what it used to be, or what it has the potential to be? Do you worry that the parenting decisions you're making today may be scarring your child for life? Do you sometimes feel you are in a tug-of-war with the world over who will shape your child's values and beliefs? With Family First: Your Step-by-Step Plan for Creating a Phenomenal Family, Dr. Phil offers a new classic on family life—and gives parents real answers and a plan for being the most positive and effective parents possible. Starting right now, you can begin to make realistic choices and take day-to-day actions that can make your family phenomenal. You must decide that you will lead your family with strength and love and that peace and joy are not just for the people next door or on TV. They're for your family. In Family First, Dr. Phil gives it to parents straight: even in this fast-paced world your family should be the center of your life and your child's life. Parenting is the most important and noble act you will ever undertake, yet American families are threatened like never before from the inside as well as the outside—many of us fight too much, don't get involved enough in our children's lives, or get bogged down in life's daily struggles instead of keeping our eye on the big picture of our family's well-being. Dr. Phil has been working with families for over twenty-five years to help them repair the fissures that have fractured their home lives. In Family First, he provides a proven action plan to help parents determine the strengths and weaknesses of their parenting style. His seven tools for purposeful parenting cover the most important elements for any parent: parenting for success—for the purpose of raising cooperative, caring, and competent children. Exercises, scripts, assessments, solutions for specific problems, and precise directions for implementing the steps you need to take are all included in this landmark work. Dr. Phil shows parents how to make changes now—how to put a stop to your children's tantrums; talk to them about peer pressure or self-esteem; instill values like integrity, honesty, and respect for other people; and bring order back to your house. If you want your child to have a happy, fulfilled life, you must open your eyes to the crucial role you play in his or her development. Most importantly, Dr. Phil's new book offers you and your family hope—for a phenomenal home life now, and a productive, fulfilling future for your children. As Dr. Phil says, you are not just raising children, you are also raising adults, and everything you do today impacts what kind of adult your child will become. You are building the future.",Family & Relationships,308,N/A,0,en

What Is Parenthood?,"Linda C. McClain, Daniel Cere",NYU Press,2013-01-14,"Extraordinary changes in patterns of family life—and family law—have dramatically altered the boundaries of parenthood and opened up numerous questions and debates. What is parenthood and why does it matter? How should society define, regulate, and support it? Is parenthood separable from marriage—or couplehood—when society seeks to foster children’s well-being? What is the better model of parenthood from the perspective of child outcomes? Intense disagreements over the definition and future of marriage often rest upon conflicting convictions about parenthood. What Is Parenthood? asks bold and direct questions about parenthood in contemporary society, and it brings together a stellar interdisciplinary group of scholars with widely varying perspectives to investigate them. Editors Linda C. McClain and Daniel Cere facilitate a dynamic conversation between scholars from several disciplines about competing models of parenthood and a sweeping array of topics, including single parenthood, adoption, donor-created families, gay and lesbian parents, transnational parenthood, parentchild attachment, and gender difference and parenthood.",Law,400,N/A,0,en

Model Theory and Algebraic Geometry,Elisabeth Bouscaren,Springer Science & Business Media,1998,"This introduction to the recent exciting developments in the applications of model theory to algebraic geometry, illustrated by E. Hrushovski's model-theoretic proof of the geometric Mordell-Lang Conjecture starts from very basic background and works up to the detailed exposition of Hrushovski's proof, explaining the necessary tools and results from stability theory on the way. The first chapter is an informal introduction to model theory itself, making the book accessible (with a little effort) to readers with no previous knowledge of model theory. The authors have collaborated closely to achieve a coherent and self- contained presentation, whereby the completeness of exposition of the chapters varies according to the existence of other good references, but comments and examples are always provided to give the reader some intuitive understanding of the subject.",Mathematics,223,N/A,0,en
Holomorphic Functions and Integral Representations in Several Complex Variables,R. Michael Range,Springer Science & Business Media,1998-06-26,"The subject of this book is Complex Analysis in Several Variables. This text begins at an elementary level with standard local results, followed by a thorough discussion of the various fundamental concepts of ""complex convexity"" related to the remarkable extension properties of holomorphic functions in more than one variable. It then continues with a comprehensive introduction to integral representations, and concludes with complete proofs of substantial global results on domains of holomorphy and on strictly pseudoconvex domains inC"", including, for example, C. Fefferman's famous Mapping Theorem. The most important new feature of this book is the systematic inclusion of many of the developments of the last 20 years which centered around integral representations and estimates for the Cauchy-Riemann equations. In particu lar, integral representations are the principal tool used to develop the global theory, in contrast to many earlier books on the subject which involved methods from commutative algebra and sheaf theory, and/or partial differ ential equations. I believe that this approach offers several advantages: (1) it uses the several variable version of tools familiar to the analyst in one complex variable, and therefore helps to bridge the often perceived gap between com plex analysis in one and in several variables; (2) it leads quite directly to deep global results without introducing a lot of new machinery; and (3) concrete integral representations lend themselves to estimations, therefore opening the door to applications not accessible by the earlier methods.",Mathematics,424,N/A,0,en

SIMPLE TRICKS & TIPS IN CHEMISTRY PART-2 (For Class 12),Dr. Monica Bhandari,Booksclinic Publishing,2021-11-24,"A STRATEGIC BOOK THAT GIVES YOU A SURE SHOT COMPETITIVE EDGE § Competitive exams test the conceptual knowledge of students along with time management skills. However, several students generally do not get the expected rank/score despite knowing all the concepts. § It is an irony that students spend several precious hours and parents spend huge money running from one coaching institute to another, but nobody guides them on time management right from the beginning, and when students attend crash courses (about 1-2 months before competitive exam), they hardly have any time to master these skills. § The author of this book strongly believes that with proper and timely strategic guidance on time management, every student can achieve well in Competitive Exams. § This book has the strength to cover the entire syllabus in 10 days. For fast track coverage of the entire course/ online coaching, students can contact the author at monicabhandari.books@gmail.com. § This book encompasses 10 chapters. Each chapter starts with a quick review of the important concepts followed by shortcuts, tips & tricks. The strategic manner in which topics are inter-linked in this book will help in building a strong conceptual clarity among the students. For illustration, questions from previous years papers of JEE and NEET with accurate & shortest possible solutions are provided along with each topic. The questions are based on the author’s interactions with students who had appeared in the aforementioned competitive exams in the past years. Solving the carefully handpicked questions given in this book, students will find themselves at ease with the Chemistry paper in any Competitive as well as Board examination. This book will enable the students with advanced abilities to attempt maximum number of questions accurately within the stipulated time. § Remember! Practice is the key to success. So, practice more and more questions on each and every topic from a good question bank. § And here's the last but not the least and the most important tip - revise all your incorrectly attempted questions repeatedly and bookmark important questions so that you gain perfection in attempting questions having similar concept or trick.

In Quest of Humane Development,"Byasdeb Dasgupta, Prasenjit Sarkhel, Archita Ghosh, Bishakha Ghosh",Springer Nature,2022-05-13,"This book presents a multidimensional perspective on the interlinkage between human development, community characteristics and public service delivery with special reference to India. The chapters in the book analyze the influence of public service delivery on human development from neo-classical as well as Marxian point of view. Thus, the expositions in the book provides a balanced mix of macro and micro approaches in the study of development. The analytical discussions are supplemented by case studies and empirical estimates so as to demonstrate the applicability of the theory and the theoretical discourse about human development, community network and the success and failures of critical public services in the Indian context. The methodology followed in the chapters involves critical survey of existing literature, case studies, field survey and use of econometric techniques as well as statistical tools of index construction. While contributors are primarily scholars from neo-classical economics discipline, some are intellectuals from the field of political economy and development studies. Given the wide array of development perspectives, this book is of interest not only to students and researcher of development economics, social science and management, but also a valuable reading for development practitioners and policy makers, who would be interested in understanding how community and public institutions interact to determine access to health, education and social security services that shapes the wellbeing of disadvantaged populations. The lessons and implications are extremely pertinent to other emerging economies, in particular those in South Asia.",Business & Economics,275,N/A,0,en

Stochastic Analysis,Shigeo Kusuoka,Springer Nature,2020-10-20,"This book is intended for university seniors and graduate students majoring in probability theory or mathematical finance. In the first chapter, results in probability theory are reviewed. Then, it follows a discussion of discrete-time martingales, continuous time square integrable martingales (particularly, continuous martingales of continuous paths), stochastic integrations with respect to continuous local martingales, and stochastic differential equations driven by Brownian motions. In the final chapter, applications to mathematical finance are given. The preliminary knowledge needed by the reader is linear algebra and measure theory. Rigorous proofs are provided for theorems, propositions, and lemmas. In this book, the definition of conditional expectations is slightly different than what is usually found in other textbooks. For the Doob–Meyer decomposition theorem, only square integrable submartingales are considered, and only elementary facts of the square integrable functions are used in the proof. In stochastic differential equations, the Euler–Maruyama approximation is used mainly to prove the uniqueness of martingale problems and the smoothness of solutions of stochastic differential equations.",Mathematics,225,N/A,0,en

Perspectives on Noncommutative Geometry,Masoud Khalkhali,American Mathematical Soc.,2011,"This volume represents the proceedings of the Noncommutative Geometry Workshop that was held as part of the thematic program on operator algebras at the Fields Institute in May 2008. Pioneered by Alain Connes starting in the late 1970s, noncommutative geometry was originally inspired by global analysis, topology, operator algebras, and quantum physics. Its main applications were to settle some long-standing conjectures, such as the Novikov conjecture and the Baum-Connes conjecture. Next came the impact of spectral geometry and the way the spectrum of a geometric operator, like the Laplacian, holds information about the geometry and topology of a manifold, as in the celebrated Weyl law. This has now been vastly generalized through Connes' notion of spectral triples. Finally, recent years have witnessed the impact of number theory, algebraic geometry and the theory of motives, and quantum field theory on noncommutative geometry. Almost all of these aspects are touched upon with new results in the papers of this volume. This book is intended for graduate students and researchers in both mathematics and theoretical physics who are interested in noncommutative geometry and its applications.",Mathematics,176,N/A,0,en

Covering a geographical space that ranges from Scandinavia to Spain and from England to Hungary, the chapters in this volume apply a transregional perspective to a vast array of topics, such as the history of theological discussion, knowledge transfer, pastoral care, visual allegory, ecclesiastical organization, confessional relations, religious exile, and university politics. The volume starts by showing in a first part how transfer and exchange beyond territorial circumscriptions or proto-national identifications shaped many sixteenth-century reformations. The second part of this volume is devoted to the acceleration of cultural transfer that resulted from the newly-invented printing press, by translation as well as transmission of texts and images. The third and final part of this volume examines the importance of mobility and migration in causing transregional reformations. Focusing on the process of 'crossing borders' in peripheries and borderlands, all chapters contribute to the de-centering of religious reform in early modern Europe. Rather than princes and urban governments steering religion, the early modern reformations emerge as events shaped by authors and translators, publishers and booksellers, students and professors, exiles and refugees, and clergy and (female) members of religious orders crossing borders in Europe, a continent composed of fractured states and regions.",Religion,379,N/A,0,en

Integral and Measure,Vigirdas Mackevicius,John Wiley & Sons,2014-10-06,"This book is devoted to integration, one of the two main operations in calculus. In Part 1, the definition of the integral of a one-variable function is different (not essentially, but rather methodically) from traditional definitions of Riemann or Lebesgue integrals. Such an approach allows us, on the one hand, to quickly develop the practical skills of integration as well as, on the other hand, in Part 2, to pass naturally to the more general Lebesgue integral. Based on the latter, in Part 2, the author develops a theory of integration for functions of several variables. In Part 3, within the same methodological scheme, the author presents the elements of theory of integration in an abstract space equipped with a measure; we cannot do without this in functional analysis, probability theory, etc. The majority of chapters are complemented with problems, mostly of the theoretical type. The book is mainly devoted to students of mathematics and related specialities.

"Trends in Mathematical, Information and Data Sciences","Narayanaswamy Balakrishnan, María Ángeles Gil, Nirian Martín, Domingo Morales, María del Carmen Pardo",Springer Nature,2022-06-27,"This book involves ideas/results from the topics of mathematical, information, and data sciences, in connection with the main research interests of Professor Pardo that can be summarized as Information Theory with Applications to Statistical Inference. This book is a tribute to Professor Leandro Pardo, who has chaired the Department of Statistics and OR of the Complutense University in Madrid, and he has been also President of the Spanish Society of Statistics and Operations Research. In this way, the contributions have been structured into three parts, which often overlap to a greater or lesser extent, namely Trends in Mathematical Sciences (Part I) Trends in Information Sciences (Part II) Trends in Data Sciences (Part III) The contributions gathered in this book have offered either new developments from a theoretical and/or computational and/or applied point of view, or reviews of recent literature of outstanding developments. They have been applied through nice examples in climatology, chemistry, economics, engineering, geology, health sciences, physics, pandemics, and socioeconomic indicators. Consequently, the intended audience of this book is mainly statisticians, mathematicians, computer scientists, and so on, but users of these disciplines as well as experts in the involved applications may certainly find this book a very interesting read.",Technology & Engineering,450,N/A,0,en

The Bourgeoisie in 18th-Century France,Elinor Barber,Princeton University Press,2015-12-08,"By delving into the religious, economic, social, and political attitudes and practices of the French bourgeoisie in the 18th century, Mrs. Barber dispels the idea that they were a revolutionary class bent on the destruction of the ancien régime. Instead, she reveals that only slowly and partially did they become antagonistic to the established society. Her particular attention is given to bourgeois feelings about, and chances for, social mobility. The book provides fresh insights into a familiar period, both in the wealth of information about the bourgeois class and in the use of sociological methods in a historical study. As an excellent example of a new and increasingly fruitful approach to history, it will interest both the historian and the social scientist. Originally published in 1955. The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions.

Family-Peer Relationships,"Ross D. Parke, Gary W.

Considerable work in the past had focused on family issues or peer relationships, but these systems had typically been considered separately. This volume bridges the gap across these two important socialization contexts and provides insights into the processes that account for the links across the systems – the ways in which the relationships between these systems shift across development. In addition, the variations in the links between family and peers are illustrated by cross-cultural work, studies of abused children, and research on the impact of maternal depression. In short, the volume provides not only a convenient overview of recent progress at the time but lays out an agenda for future research.",Psychology,473,2,1,en

Working With Families in Medical Settings,Alison M. Heru,Routledge,2013-08-21,"Working With Families in Medical Settings provides mental-health professionals with the tools they need to figure out what patients and families want and how, within the constraints imposed by 21st-century healthcare setting, to best give them the care they need. Psychiatrists and other clinicians who work in medical settings know that working with a patient with a chronic illness usually entails work with that patient’s family as well as with other medical professionals. Some families need education; others have specific difficulties or dysfunctions that require skilled assessment and intervention. It is up to the clinician to find productive ways to work with common themes in family life: expressed emotion, levels of resilience, life-cycle issues, and adaptation to illness, among others. Enter Working With Families in Medical Settings, which shines a spotlight on the major issues professional caregivers face and shows them how to structure an effective intervention in all kinds of settings. Psychiatrists, particularly those in psychosomatic medicine, and other clinicians who work with the medically ill will find Working With Families in Medical Settings to be an essential resource and guide to productive relationships with patients and their families.",Psychology,337,N/A,0,en

Career and Family,Claudia Goldin,Princeton University Press,2023-05-09,"In this book, the author builds on decades of complex research to examine the gender pay gap and the unequal distribution of labor between couples in the home. The author argues that although public and private discourse has brought these concerns to light, the actions taken - such as a single company slapped on the wrist or a few progressive leaders going on paternity leave - are the economic equivalent of tossing a band-aid to someone with cancer. These solutions, the author writes, treat the symptoms and not the disease of gender inequality in the workplace and economy. Here, the author points to data that reveals how the pay gap widens further down the line in women's careers, about 10 to 15 years out, as opposed to those beginning careers after college. She examines five distinct groups of women over the course of the twentieth century: cohorts of women who differ in terms of career, job, marriage, and children, in approximated years of graduation - 1900s, 1920s, 1950s, 1970s, and 1990s - based on various demographic, labor force, and occupational outcomes. The book argues that our entire economy is trapped in an old way of doing business; work structures have not adapted as more women enter the workforce. Gender equality in pay and equity in home and childcare labor are flip sides of the same issue, and the author frames both in the context of a serious empirical exploration that has not yet been put in a long-run historical context. This book offers a deep look into census data, rich information about individual college graduates over their lifetimes, and various records and sources of material to offer a new model to restructure the home and school systems that contribute to the gender pay gap and the quest for both family and career. --",Business & Economics,344,N/A,0,en

Religion and Families,"Loren D. Marks, David C. Dollahite",Routledge,2016-10-04,"This is the first multidisciplinary text to address the growing scholarly connection between religion and family life. The latest literature from family studies, psychology, sociology, and religion is reviewed along with narratives drawn from interviews with 200 racially, religiously, and regionally diverse families which bring the concepts to life. Written in a thought-provoking, accessible, and sometimes humorous style by two of the leading researchers in the field, the book reflects the authors’ firsthand experience in teaching today’s students about religion’s impact on families. Prior to writing the book, the authors read the sacred texts of many faiths, interviewed religious leaders, and attended religious services for a wide array of faiths. The result is an accurate and engaging account of why and how families are impacted by their religion. The pedagogical features of the text include boldfaced key terms defined in the glossary, text boxes, chapter conclusions, summary points, and review questions. Religion and Families: Examines several denominations within Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. Reviews findings from racially and ethnically diverse families, from traditional and diverse family forms, and examines gender and life-course issues. Addresses the impact of one’s religious involvement on longevity, divorce rates, and parenting styles. Considers demographic, family-, couple-, and individual-level data that relate to prayer and other sacred practices. Presents a balanced treatment of the latest research and a new model for studying family and religion. Explores the ""whys,"" ""hows,"" and processes at work in the religion-family connection. The book opens with a discussion of why religion and family connections matter. Chapter 2 defines religion and presents a new conceptualization of religion. Empirical research connections between religion and marriage, divorce, family, and parent-child relationships are explored in chapters 3 through 6. The interface between religion and the family in Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are reviewed in chapters 7, 8, and 9. Chapter 10 explores the unique challenges that religion presents for diverse family forms. Prayer as a coping mechanism for life’s challenges such as death and disability are explored in chapter 11. Chapter 12 examines forgiveness in the context of marriages and families. The book concludes with a review of the book’s most important themes and findings. Intended as a text for undergraduate courses in family and religion, the psychology or sociology of the family, the psychology or sociology of religion, pastoral/biblical counseling, or family and youth ministry, taught in human development and family studies, psychology, sociology, religion, social work, pastoral counseling, and sometimes philosophy.

Multiple family therapy is a special type of group practice that involves the members of several families meeting together with a professional to work on common family concerns. Rosemary Cassano, acclaimed for her qualitative research on multiple family group therapy, has produced an exciting volume that reflects the diversity of client populations and patterns and processes in these groups. Social Work With Multi-Family Groups reveals to the professional what actually goes on in the process of group interactions and practitioner interventions. In this state-of-the-art volume, social workers set forth a specific and careful definition of multiple family practice and examine the successful use of multi-family groups with families with child-labeled problems, institutionalized elderly suffering from physical and cognitive impairments and their family members, patients with life-threatening illness and their families, and several other support groups. Each of the practical examples illustrates how professionals can design helping systems for their clients that combine both professional and peer help and activate the help that is embedded in each client’s own family.",Family & Relationships,122,N/A,0,en

Research Foundations of Human Development and Family Science,Kathleen D. Dyer,Routledge,2022-02-21,"Human Development and Family Science (HDFS) is an interdisciplinary and applied field that draws from developmental science, family science, and other social sciences. Research Foundations of Human Development and Family Science is a textbook that provides an introduction to the diverse scientific research methods that form the foundation of scholarship and practice in HDFS. In Part I, Kathleen D. Dyer explores science. She distinguishes empirical scientific research from common sense and from knowledge gained from personal experience. This section also includes a discussion of the strategies used by pseudoscience to exploit the well-deserved credibility of science, providing relevant examples. Part II examines systematic empiricism through sampling and measurement. HDFS scholars use a wide array of measurement tools, including self-report (interviews, questionnaires, and self-report tasks), observations (participant, naturalistic, and structured), objective tests, physiological measures, and several types of archival records. Part III introduces the use of study design to achieve falsifiability in scientific research, including an overview of various orientations to time used in research as well as four different study designs: qualitative, prevalence, correlational, and experimental. Finally, Part IV addresses the public verifiability of science, including how scientific consensus is developed, the use of literature reviews to identify convergence of evidence, and how scientific literacy translates into evidence-based professional practice. Illustrated throughout with studies foundational to the discipline as examples of the strategies described in the text, Research Foundations for Human Development and Family Science is a comprehensive, accessible core textbook for undergraduate research methods classes in HDFS. It introduces the discipline of HDFS and challenges students to understand the limitations of common sense and the threat of pseudoscience for those work professionally with children and families.",Psychology,262,N/A,0,en

Family Changes,"Azmaira H Maker Ph D, Azmaira H. Maker",N/A,2015-05-28,"""Divorce"" is a big word...especially for little kids. It's hard for young children to understand what the word means, let alone how it will impact their lives--and it's hard for us, as grown-ups, to explain it to them in terms they can fully comprehend. Nonetheless, when a child is involved in a family divorce or separation, it is crucial that he or she understands and embraces the changes... and this book will help you explain the transitions to your child. Family Changes is a delightfully informative children's book that tackles a complicated topic in compassionate, child-friendly terms. Ideal for young minds aged four through eight, it features a colorful cast of fuzzy characters led by a young bunny named Zoey, who is struggling with her parents' divorce and is riddled by important questions and feelings your child is likely to encounter. In addition to the heartfelt story at its core, Family Changes also offers parents, therapists, teachers, and caregivers valuable information on how to ease children through this significant life change. A comprehensive note to parents and a list of essential child-focused questions are provided to guide the adult and child, and are certain to be an asset to both children and adults involved in the divorce/separation process.",Children of divorced parents,34,N/A,0,en

Family Constellations,"Joy Manne, Ph.D.",North Atlantic Books,2012-11-06,"The first-ever user-friendly guide on Family Constellations—a powerful group therapy method that uses family history as an avenue for understanding and resolving conflicts of the present Mapping out a “family constellation,” explains Dr. Joy Manné, encompasses exploring previous powerful life events from accidents to adoptions and accessing the deepest dynamics in that family system. This process helps us recognize and then resolve deeply seated family patterns. For example, in order to understand a person’s inability to trust, the family history of betrayal must be uncovered and released. These insights replace resentment with respect, pain with understanding. In this book, Dr. Manné uses the knowledge gained from her own practice as well as her educational experiences with Bert Hellinger—the founder of Family Constellations therapy—to clearly describe this unique therapeutic method. Most Family Constellation sessions are carried out in a group setting, with the facilitator first seeking clarity regarding the issue or problem the client has come to work out. Representatives are then chosen from among the group and the constellation is set up and worked in until it comes to resolution. This may be followed by a closing ritual and advice about how to integrate what the constellation has revealed. Through the use of real-life examples of Family Constellations, Dr. Manné makes this increasingly popular practice understandable and relatable.",Family & Relationships,81,N/A,0,en

K-theory,Michael Atiyah,CRC Press,2018-03-05,"These notes are based on the course of lectures I gave at Harvard in the fall of 1964. They constitute a self-contained account of vector bundles and K-theory assuming only the rudiments of point-set topology and linear algebra. One of the features of the treatment is that no use is made of ordinary homology or cohomology theory. In fact, rational cohomology is defined in terms of K-theory.The theory is taken as far as the solution of the Hopf invariant problem and a start is mode on the J-homomorphism. In addition to the lecture notes proper, two papers of mine published since 1964 have been reproduced at the end. The first, dealing with operations, is a natural supplement to the material in Chapter III. It provides an alternative approach to operations which is less slick but more fundamental than the Grothendieck method of Chapter III, and it relates operations and filtration. Actually, the lectures deal with compact spaces, not cell-complexes, and so the skeleton-filtration does not figure in the notes. The second paper provides a new approach to K-theory and so fills an obvious gap in the lecture notes.",Mathematics,181,N/A,0,en

However, relatively little has been written about prayer in John’s Farewell Discourse in particular.

Basic Set Theory,Azriel Levy,Courier Corporation,2012-06-11,"Although this book deals with basic set theory (in general, it stops short of areas where model-theoretic methods are used) on a rather advanced level, it does it at an unhurried pace. This enables the author to pay close attention to interesting and important aspects of the topic that might otherwise be skipped over. Written for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students, the book is divided into two parts. The first covers pure set theory, including the basic notions, order and well-foundedness, cardinal numbers, the ordinals, and the axiom of choice and some of its consequences. The second part deals with applications and advanced topics, among them a review of point set topology, the real spaces, Boolean algebras, and infinite combinatorics and large cardinals. A helpful appendix deals with eliminability and conservation theorems, while numerous exercises supply additional information on the subject matter and help students test their grasp of the material. 1979 edition. 20 figures.",Mathematics,418,N/A,0,en
Convergence Structures and Applications to Functional Analysis,"R. Beattie, Heinz-Peter Butzmann",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-03-14,"This text offers a rigorous introduction into the theory and methods of convergence spaces and gives concrete applications to the problems of functional analysis. While there are a few books dealing with convergence spaces and a great many on functional analysis, there are none with this particular focus. The book demonstrates the applicability of convergence structures to functional analysis. Highlighted here is the role of continuous convergence, a convergence structure particularly appropriate to function spaces. It is shown to provide an excellent dual structure for both topological groups and topological vector spaces. Readers will find the text rich in examples. Of interest, as well, are the many filter and ultrafilter proofs which often provide a fresh perspective on a well-known result. Audience: This text will be of interest to researchers in functional analysis, analysis and topology as well as anyone already working with convergence spaces. It is appropriate for senior undergraduate or graduate level students with some background in analysis and topology.",Mathematics,272,N/A,0,en

Doing Therapy with Intercultural Couples,Sunita Noronha,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2022-04-28,"Marital concord between couples from different racial and ethnic backgrounds is an issue that needs serious attention to bridge the vast chasms. America welcomes people from all over the world. People of all religions and ethnic backgrounds come here to study and migrants arrive here to work. Interracial marriages are common but the radically different background of each couple can create discords and prove to be bumps on the highway of conjugal life. This can have serious repercussions on the offspring and on the couple and their lives as well. This book seeks to investigate how cultural realities can be addressed within intercultural premarital couples counseling. Using a cultural focus approach couples' stories around their particular culture and relationship were analyzed. Themes related to relationship, family and social ties, and parenting bi-cultural and bi-racial children were examined. Issues of religious and social influence, money, race, ethnicity, extended family, immigration, and biases in family of origin, are explored as are roles and responsibilities, communication, respect, trust, and gender-stereotyping. The book adopts a pastoral theological approach in working towards a deeper understanding of premarital relationships of partners who represent cultural difference and diversity. In conclusion recommendations to therapists and care givers for counseling intercultural couples are made.",Psychology,203,N/A,0,en
Restoring Power to Parents and Places,Richard S. Kordesh,iUniverse,2011-11-04,"To progress successfully through all of their stages of development, children need to grow up in good communities. Good communities do not occur without viable, productive families. In Restoring Power to Parents and Places, author Richard Kordesh makes a compelling call for the productive familys renewal and provides creative steps for parents, professionals, and policymakers to take to strengthen communities around all children. Kordeshs experiences as a planner, professor, and father, have taught him that productive families are vitally important to the creation of good communities around children. He details historically, and with contemporary examples, the forces in our society that place stresses on families in all sectors. Restoring Power to Parents and Places presents a pointed critique of economic and political forces that have harmed families, but it also offers practical suggestions for action by parents, community leaders, community development and planning professionals, and governments at the local, state, and federal levels.

Replicating And Repairing The Genome: From Basic Mechanisms To Modern Genetic Technologies,Kenneth N Kreuzer,World Scientific,2020-03-16,"Replicating and Repairing the Genome provides a concise overview of the fields of DNA replication and repair. The book is particularly appropriate for graduate students and advanced undergraduates, and scientists entering the field or working in related fields. The breadth of information regarding DNA replication and repair is vast and often difficult to absorb, with terminology that differs between experimental systems and with complex interconnections of these processes with other cellular pathways. This book provides simple conceptual descriptions of replication and repair pathways using mostly generic protein names, laying out the logic for how the pathways function and highlighting fascinating aspects of the underlying biochemical mechanisms and biology. The book incorporates extensive and informative diagrams and figures, as well as descriptions of a number of carefully chosen experiments that had major influences in the field.The process of DNA replication is explained progressively by starting with the system of a simple bacterial virus that uses only a few proteins, followed by the well-understood bacterial (E coli) system, and then culminating with the more complex eukaryotic systems. In the second half of the book, individual chapters cover key areas of DNA repair — postreplication repair of mismatches and incorporated ribonucleotides, direct damage reversal, excision repair, and DNA break repair, as well as the related areas of DNA damage tolerance (including translesion DNA polymerases) and DNA damage responses. The book closes with chapters that describe the huge impact of DNA replication and repair on aspects of human health and on modern biotechnology.",Science,438,N/A,0,en
Challenges of Discourse Processing,Patrick Saint-Dizier,Cambridge Scholars Publishing,2014-03-17,"Discourse analysis remains an unresolved challenge in Computational Linguistics, in spite of the numerous theoretical works that have been developed in the past two decades. This situation is mainly due to the complexity of discourse constructions whose recognition often involves language analysis associated with domain knowledge and reasoning. Technical documents, such as procedures, requirements, and product manuals, must be relatively constrained in terms of language diversity and complexity: the goal is to make sure that users can efficiently and accurately understand these documents. For that purpose, these documents often follow authoring guidelines. These constraints make it possible to develop an accurate discourse analysis of technical documents which can be used to model their contents and to improve their overall quality. This book shows that linguistic analysis and natural language processing methods can efficiently be used to automatically recognize the discourse structures of technical documents, independently of the industrial sector and activity that is considered. Furthermore, the book presents well-founded and concrete solutions, which can be deployed in industrial contexts for various types of applications. This book begins with a presentation of the different types of technical texts. Their structure is then developed in conjunction with a survey of a number of authoring guidelines developed in the industry. The TextCoop platform and the Dislog language, designed for discourse analysis, are then presented with a large number of concrete examples, allowing readers to develop their own applications. The book concludes with an in-depth investigation of the structure of procedures and requirements.",Reference,185,N/A,0,en

Michael Kerr (who worked with Bowen for many years) and Bowen propose that the enormously complex task of evaluating a clinical family can be orderly when it is grounded in family systems theory. Using family diagrams and case studies, the book is devoted to an elegant explication of Bowen theory, which analyzes multigenerational family relationships and conceptualizes the family as an emotional unit or as a network of interlocking relationships, not only among the family members, but also among biological, psychological, and sociological processes. Bowen’s persistent inquiry and devotion to family observation, in spite of obstacles and frustrations, have resulted in a theory that has radically changed our ways of looking at all behavior.",Psychology,420,N/A,0,en

The aim of the conference was to encourage fruitful and active collaboration between researchers working in the diverse areas of system theory. It was also the hope of the organizers that mathematicians participating in the conference might become interested in the purely mathematical problems being raised by systems theory as a result of their participation. The success of the conference is to be measured by the extent to which these aims were fulfilled. Besides the formal programme of lectures recorded in this volume, many informal seminars were held.

Family Life in The Middle Ages,Linda E. Mitchell,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2007-08-30,"Mitchell takes a regional approach in exploring the lives of families in the Middle Ages. Starting with the late Roman families the first five chapters explore the roles of family members defined by tradition and law, what constituted a legal marriage and a family, to whom the children belonged, and who was included in the extended family. The remaining chapters delve into daily family life - homes of various social classes and the division of labor, both maintaining the home and family-based labor such as agriculture, banking, manufacturing of goods, and mercantile activity. Religious cultures of the medieval world varied but all often included oblation of children to monasteries, religious ceremonies for life stages, and family obligations in the religious culture. Birth, death and inheritance all affected the family and new families were often formed from previous generations and defunct family lines. Non-traditional families included family structures advocated by heretical groups - the Cathars and the Beguines, families created without marriage - concubinage relationships, and those that developed as a result of social and environmental stresses - the Black Death, war, and natural disasters. Perfect for students studying the Middle Ages and medieval life, this work provides a clear and engaging narrative on the day-to-day lives of the family. Reference resources include a timeline, sources for further reading, photographs and an index. Volumes in the Family Life Through History series focus on the day-to-day lives and roles of families. The roles of all family members are defined and information on daily family life, the role of the family in society, and the ever-changing definition of the term family' are discussed. Discussion of the nuclear family, single parent homes, foster and adoptive families, stepfamilies, and gay and lesbian families are included where appropriate. Topics such as meal planning, homes, entertainment and celebrations, are discussed along with larger social issues that originate in the home like domestic violence, child abuse and neglect, and divorce.

Strong family and low fertility:a paradox?,"Gianpiero Dalla Zuanna, Giuseppe A. Micheli",Springer Science & Business Media,2004-09-28,"This book is the first one to be devoted to the analysis and interpretation of the lowest low fertility in the Southern part of Europe. It presents a comparative viewpoint and enables the readers to understand the peculiarities of a demographic situation that has characterized a vast part of Europe over the past three decades. The book places a particular emphasis on the cultural keywords, i.e. the connection between strong family ties and fertility. The observation of the European geography of the strong family and that of low fertility at the end of the twentieth century renders surprising coincidences. It is no simple task to clarify the behavioural processes underlying this geographical correspondence. This volume contains two different possible interpretations, which, though departing from similar premises, lead to quite distinct conclusions. This volume is of interest to demographers and social scientists, as well as to (doctoral) students of demography and social science.",Computers,188,N/A,0,en

Magic Trash,J. H. Shapiro,Charlesbridge,2015-01-06,"Vacant lots. Abandoned houses. Trash--lots of trash. Heidelberg Street was in trouble! Tyree Guyton loved his childhood home--that's where his grandpa Sam taught him to ""paint the world."" So he wanted to wake people up... to make them see Detroit's crumbling communities. Paintbrush in hand, Tyree cast his artistic spell, transforming everyday junk into magic trash. Soon local kids and families joined Tyree in rebuilding their neighborhood, discovering the healing power of art along the way. This picture book biography of Tyree Guyton, an urban environmental artist, shows how he transformed his decaying, crime-ridden neighborhood into the Heidelberg Project, an interactive sculpture park. The story spans from Tyree's childhood in 1950s Detroit to his early efforts to heal his community through art in the 1980s. Tyree's awards include Michigan Artist of the Year and International Artist. MAGIC TRASH offers strong themes of working together, the power of art, and the importance of inspiring community--especially kids--to affect action. The Heidelberg Project is internationally recognized for providing arts education to children and adults and for the ongoing development of several houses on Heidelberg Street. Not only does the Heidelberg Project prove that when a community works together it can rebuild itself, but it also addresses the issues of recycling, environmentalism, and community on a global level.",Juvenile Nonfiction,35,N/A,0,en

Behavioral Approaches to Chronic Disease in Adolescence,William O'Donohue,Springer Science & Business Media,2009-06-12,"Adolescence is typically fraught with problems, even under optimal conditions. And when chronic illness is added to the picture, medical and related social issues can complicate, and even disrupt, the course of development. The first text geared toward the integrated care setting, Behavioral Approaches to Chronic Disease in Adolescence offers clinicians an evidence-based guide to helping their young clients manage their chronic conditions and treating the psychosocial effects—from school problems and stigma to noncompliance and depression—that frequently follow diagnosis. Expert contributors present up-to-date information on epidemiology, symptoms, comorbid psychosocial problems, and treatment options for a variety of common illnesses, arranged to foster effective interventions for adolescents and efficient collaboration with other care providers in the team. Coverage is comprehensive, authoritative, and accessible, ensuring best practice while respecting each client’s individuality: Empirically-based treatment guidelines for illnesses commonly found in youth, including Type 1 and 2 diabetes, asthma, cancer, obesity, and chronic pain.

Mastering R,"Andrea M. Lazzari, Paula S. McDonough",N/A,2020,"""""R"" is one of the most frequently misarticulated sounds in English (Hegde, 2019; Shriberg, 2009). SLPs may devote a significant amount of therapy hours addressing remediation of /r/. The repetitive nature of articulation practice can cause both the student/client and therapist to lose the high level of interest and energy needed to remain focused on targeted, repeated practice that assures generalization of correct sound production. Mastering R: Advanced Articulation Exercises provides SLPs and their students/clients with a wealth of opportunities for practicing the production of /r/ in various contexts to promote generalization. Hodson & Paden (1991) recommend planning remediation to take advantage of the tendency to generalize. Mastering R is intended as a generalization resource to be used after initial instruction in the production of /r/ in isolation, syllables and single words. Mastering R presents novel stimulus items incorporating contemporary topics, references and vocabulary, interesting facts and trivia, and humor, suitable for use with students/clients in grades 4 and above. We have found the use of more engaging and interesting stimulus items tends to increase interest and participation, hopefully increasing the potential for positive therapy outcomes""--",Articulation disorders,0,N/A,0,en

The Tech-Wise Family,Andy Crouch,Baker Books,2017-04-18,"Making conscientious choices about technology in our families is more than just using internet filters and determining screen time limits for our children. It's about developing wisdom, character, and courage in the way we use digital media rather than accepting technology's promises of ease, instant gratification, and the world's knowledge at our fingertips. And it's definitely not just about the kids. Drawing on in-depth original research from the Barna Group, Andy Crouch shows readers that the choices we make about technology have consequences we may never have considered. He takes readers beyond the typical questions of what, where, and when and instead challenges them to answer provocative questions like, Who do we want to be as a family? and How does our use of a particular technology move us closer or farther away from that goal? Anyone who has felt their family relationships suffer or their time slip away amid technology's distractions will find in this book a path forward to reclaiming their real life in a world of devices.",Religion,202,N/A,0,en

Reshaping the Work-Family Debate,Joan C. Williams,Harvard University Press,2011-02-01,"The United States has the most family-hostile public policy in the developed world. Despite what is often reported, new mothers don’t “opt out” of work. They are pushed out by discriminating and inflexible workplaces. Today’s workplaces continue to idealize the worker who has someone other than parents caring for their children. Conventional wisdom attributes women’s decision to leave work to their maternal traits and desires. In this thought-provoking book, Joan Williams shows why that view is misguided and how workplace practice disadvantages men—both those who seek to avoid the breadwinner role and those who embrace it—as well as women. Faced with masculine norms that define the workplace, women must play the tomboy or the femme. Both paths result in a gender bias that is exacerbated when the two groups end up pitted against each other. And although work-family issues long have been seen strictly through a gender lens, we ignore class at our peril. The dysfunctional relationship between the professional-managerial class and the white working class must be addressed before real reform can take root. Contesting the idea that women need to negotiate better within the family, and redefining the notion of success in the workplace, Williams reinvigorates the work-family debate and offers the first steps to making life manageable for all American families.",Religion,304,N/A,0,en

Complete Family Wealth,"James E. Hughes, Jr., Susan E. Massenzio, Keith Whitaker",John Wiley & Sons,2017-11-20,"What matters most in managing the family enterprise Complete Family Wealth is a comprehensive resource for growing, maintaining, and managing wealth across generations. A successor to the classic Family Wealth, now in its 20th year, this book provides updated and expanded guidance to change the way you think about your wealth and legacy. This team of expert authors—who brought the field not only Family Wealth but also Family the Compact, The Cycle of the Gift, The Voice of the Rising Generation, and Family Trusts—ground Complete Family Wealth in a clear account of the “five capitals”: human, intellectual, social, spiritual, and financial.

When Marriages Fail,"Craig Everett, Robert E Lee",Routledge,2014-01-14,"Leading experts reveal systemic and integrative approaches to family therapy When Marriages Fail: Systemic Family Therapy Interventions and Issues presents several leading experts in the field discussing the full spectrum of clinical interventions and family therapy for troubled and divorcing families. This comprehensive resource presents a broad overview of the literature that provides a foundation for the entire field, then narrows its focus to clearly review clinical assessment models and the special issues that may be factors in conflicted families. Therapists, psychologists, counselors, and social workers learn cutting-edge recommendations for policies protecting the well-being of children involved in divorce, plus practical, specific systemic treatment interventions that are illustrated with case studies. When Marriages Fail is separated into three logically organized sections. Part one provides a helpful overview of the field’s evolving literature as it stands now and gives tools to therapists and their clients to explore their internal and dyadic processes in considering whether or not to divorce. The second part presents two systemic models that explore the dynamics of conflicted couples moving toward divorce and considers specific family circumstances that affect the entire divorce process, such as family violence, disclosure of gender orientation, and the unhappiness of the family’s children. Part three discusses in detail specific and practical treatment interventions, considering factors involved when diverse families separate, divorce, and remarry. The text also provides a fitting tribute to William C. Nichols, a pioneer of marital and family therapy. Topics in When Marriages Fail include: the therapist’s choices in helping couples process their own choices an ecosystemic look at the rights of children in divorce interventions for mourning, adulterous triangles, incongruent goals, cultural differences, or family of origin disclosing gay or lesbian orientation in marriage domestic violence issues children’s trauma in the parental break-up family therapy interventions through three systemic stages of divorce remarriage of the first spouse in post-divorce families trauma of the betrayed spouse parent loss and serial relationships gay divorces and more! With Forewords by Douglas Sprenkle and Augustus Y. Napier as well as several international contributors who shed light on how this compelling subject is addressed outside of the United States, When Marriages Fail is an invaluable source of the latest knowledge and interventions for family therapists, counselors, social workers, and psychologists.",Family & Relationships,297,N/A,0,en

Economic Restructuring and Family Well-Being in Rural America,"Kristin E. Smith, Ann R. Tickamyer",Penn State Press,2011-01-01,"Rural areas have been hit hard by economic restructuring. Traditionally male jobs with good pay and benefits (such as in manufacturing) have declined dramatically, only to be replaced with low-paying service-oriented jobs&—jobs that do not offer benefits or wages sufficient to raise a family. Concurrently, rural areas have experienced changes in family life, namely an increase in women&’s labor force participation, a decline in married-couple families, and a rise in cohabitation and single-parent families. How have rural families coped with these social and economic changes? Economic Restructuring and Family Well-Being in Rural America documents the intertwined changes in employment and family and explores the outcomes for family well-being in rural America. Here a multidisciplinary group of scholars examines the impacts of economic restructuring on rural Americans and provides policy recommendations for addressing the challenges they face.

Period Mappings with Applications to Symplectic Complex Spaces,Tim Kirschner,Springer,2015-09-15,"Extending Griffiths’ classical theory of period mappings for compact Kähler manifolds, this book develops and applies a theory of period mappings of “Hodge-de Rham type” for families of open complex manifolds. The text consists of three parts. The first part develops the theory. The second part investigates the degeneration behavior of the relative Frölicher spectral sequence associated to a submersive morphism of complex manifolds. The third part applies the preceding material to the study of irreducible symplectic complex spaces. The latter notion generalizes the idea of an irreducible symplectic manifold, dubbed an irreducible hyperkähler manifold in differential geometry, to possibly singular spaces. The three parts of the work are of independent interest, but intertwine nicely.",Mathematics,295,N/A,0,en

Family Feuds,Eileen Hunt Botting,State University of New York Press,2012-02-01,"Family Feuds is the first sustained comparative study of the place of the family in the political thought of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Edmund Burke, and Mary Wollstonecraft. Eileen Hunt Botting argues that Wollstonecraft recognized both Rousseau's and Burke's influential stature in late eighteenth-century debates about the family. Wollstonecraft critically identified them as philosophical and political partners in the defense of the patriarchal structure of the family, yet she used Rousseau's conceptions of childhood education and maternal empowerment and Burke's understanding of the family as the affective basis for political socialization as a theoretical foundation for her own egalitarian vision of the family. It is this ideal of the egalitarian family, Botting contends, that is one of the most important yet least appreciated legacies of Enlightenment political thought.",Social Science,268,N/A,0,en

Along the way, we also learn to always...always, be careful of what you wish for. Jessie wished for a sister and her Dad made it happen. When she was introduced to her new step-family she had no idea things were about to get ugly. Kimberly, the stepsister, starts a feud with Jessie that lasts well over thirty years. While Connie, the stepmother, plays a role so severe she eventually becomes known as the 'Redheaded Step-Monster from H-E-Double Hockey Sticks'. As the family expands to include more siblings, the physical and mental abuse Jessie is subjected to becomes almost intolerable.

Familial Fitness,Sandra M. Sufian,University of Chicago Press,2022-01-21,"The first social history of disability and difference in American adoption, from the Progressive Era to the end of the twentieth century. Disability and child welfare, together and apart, are major concerns in American society. Today, about 125,000 children in foster care are eligible and waiting for adoption, and while many children wait more than two years to be adopted, children with disabilities wait even longer. In Familial Fitness, Sandra M. Sufian uncovers how disability operates as a fundamental category in the making of the American family, tracing major shifts in policy, practice, and attitudes about the adoptability of disabled children over the course of the twentieth century. Chronicling the long, complex history of disability, Familial Fitness explores how notions and practices of adoption have—and haven’t—accommodated disability, and how the language of risk enters into that complicated relationship. We see how the field of adoption moved from widely excluding children with disabilities in the early twentieth century to partially including them at its close. As Sufian traces this historical process, she examines the forces that shaped, and continue to shape, access to the social institution of family and invites readers to rethink the meaning of family itself.",History,390,N/A,0,en

Family and Familia in Roman Law and Life,Jane F. Gardner,Clarendon Press,1998-05-14,"Roman families were infinitely diverse, but the basis of Roman civil law was the familia, a strictly-defined group consisting of a head, paterfamilias, and his descendants in the male line. Recent work on the Roman family mainly ignores the familia, in favour of examining such matters as emotional relationships within families, the practical effects of control by a paterfamilias, and demographic factors producing families which did not fit the familia-pattern. This book investigates the interrelationship between family and familia, especially how families exploited the legal rules for their own ends, and disrupted the familia, by use of emancipation (release from patria potestas) and adoption. It also traces legal responses to the effects of demographic factors, which gave increased importance to maternal connections, and to social, such as the difficulties for ex-slaves in conforming to the familia-pattern. The familia as a legal institution remained virtually unchanged; nevertheless Roman family law underwent substantial changes, to meet the needs and desires of Roman society.",History,317,4,1,en

"Family: The Good ""F"" Word",Troy Dunn,Bird Street Books,2014-04-21,"Troy Dunn shares his tested and proven tools for repairing a broken family. He believes that whether you are just feeling a little stagnant in your home life or are already at your wit’s end, there are clear steps to restore joy, connectedness and unity within your family or partnerships. This book focuses on recognizing both personal and family needs, how to break old patterns to improve individual happiness, as well as happiness within a partnership and within the family unit as a whole. Dunn explains that although we can’t necessarily fix our given family, we owe it to ourselves to fix the family we have or are founding. His Life Changing Action Plan (LCA) includes four steps to determine what is wrong with your relationship, embrace the idea of change in a long-lasting way, repair damage and rebuild one’s marriage or relationship, and provide empowerment and tools to permanently stabilize a family. Also dissected, diagnosed and given rules for remedy are 10 Relationship Roadblocks, including the biggest taboos of all: money and sex!

Family Relationships and Delinquent Behavior,Francis Ivan Nye,Praeger,1973-10-05,"Speaking openly of their ideas about race, these nine and ten year-olds show they have internalized the prevailing western mindset—whatever their own ethnicity. And this mindset is racist. Research has long been needed into what children themselves think about cultural diversity and about efforts to counter racism in their schools. Here is the empirical, child-centered research that tells educators what they need to know. It was conducted with a sample of Year 5 pupils in two predominantly white and two diverse schools which were themselves involved in the research process. The book is suffused with their vibrant, profound and original voices and their often surprising ideas. The children's views are accompanied by the researcher's sociologically informed close observation of school life and the views and practice of the teachers, and the book concludes with the important implications she identifies for policy and practice in schools. It's Not Just About Black and White, Missis an enlightening and enjoyable read for primary teachers and trainees and offers grounded information for policy makers and school managers.",Family & Relationships,192,N/A,0,en

Published in three massive volumes in French between 1971 and 1972, and five volumes in English translation between 1981 and 1993, Jean-Paul Sartre's classic study of Gustave Flaubert is now available to readers in English for the first time in a more digestible abridged edition. For Sartre, understanding how Flaubert became Flaubert-how he came to be the person who penned Madame Bovary-helps us understand the very nature of the modern self. Sartre devoted a decade at the end of his life to crafting this exhaustive work and it serves as a summary of his committed philosophy. Compiled by renowned Sartre scholar Joseph S. Catalano, this abridgment retains the brilliance of the sprawling original and reveals how we are still haunted by the nihilism of the imaginary that was beautifully captured by Sartre""--",Biography & Autobiography,299,N/A,0,en

The Blank Slate,Steven Pinker,Penguin UK,2003-06-05,"'A passionate defence of the enduring power of human nature ... both life-affirming and deeply satisfying' Daily Telegraph Recently many people have assumed that we are blank slates shaped by our environment. But this denies the heart of our being: human nature. Violence is not just a product of society; male and female minds are different; the genes we give our children shape them more than our parenting practices. To acknowledge our innate abilities, Pinker shows, is not to condone inequality, but to understand the very foundations of humanity.

The Secrets of Happy Families,Bruce Feiler,Hachette UK,2013-08-01,"Bestselling author and New York Times family columnist Bruce Feiler found himself squeezed between caring for ageing parents and raising his children. So he set out on a three-year journey to find the smartest ideas and the most cutting-edge research about families of all varieties, novel solutions to make his own family happier. Instead of the usual psychologists and family 'experts', he sought out the most creative minds - from Silicon Valley to the set of Modern Family, from top negotiators to the army - and asked them what team-building exercises and problem-solving techniques they use. Feiler then tested these ideas with his wife and kids. The result is a fun, completely original look at how families can draw closer together. Felier's life-changing discoveries include a radical plan to reshape your family in twenty minutes a week, Warren Buffett's guide for setting an allowance, and the Harvard handbook for resolving conflict. The Secrets of Happy Families is a timely, counterintuitive book that answers the questions countless parents are asking: how do we manage the chaos of our lives? How do we teach our kids values? How do we make our family happier? Written in a charming, accessible style, The Secrets of Happy Families is smart, funny and fresh, and will forever change how your family lives every day.",Family & Relationships,205,N/A,0,en
Family in Buddhism,Liz Wilson,SUNY Press,2013-08-01,"A wide-ranging exploration of Buddhism and family in Asiafrom biological families to families created in monasteries. The Buddha left his home and family and enjoined his followers to go forth and become homeless. With a traditionally celibate clergy, Asian Buddhism is often regarded as a world-renouncing religion inimical to family life. This edited volume counters this view, showing how Asian Buddhists in a wide range of historical and geographical circumstances relate as kin to their biological families and to the religious families they join. Using contemporary and historical case studies as well as textual examples, contributors explore how Asian Buddhists invoke family ties in the intentional communities they create and use them to establish religious authority and guard religious privilege. The language of family and lineage emerges as central to a variety of South and East Asian Buddhist contexts. With an interdisciplinary, Pan-Asian approach, Family in Buddhism challenges received wisdom in religious studies and offers new ways to think about family and society.",Religion,300,N/A,0,en

Advancing Family Theories,James M. White,SAGE Publications,2004-09-07,"""Making a strong case for the importance of theory in social science, the author argues that theories on the family would assist understanding across cultural contexts and variations."" —Savithri Subramanian, CONTRIBUTIONS TO INDIAN SOCIOLOGY ""A perfect companion text for graduate courses on family theories. It is refreshing to have a single author pull no punches in articulating a viewpoint on where we have gone astray in family theory and how we can find our way again. Jim White has accomplished the nearly impossible mission of being informative, balanced, clear, and provocative at the same time.""-William J. Doherty, University of Minnesota ""Professor White has written a ′must-read′ book for anyone interested in family theory. This well-written and timely text . . . tackles difficult topics head on, offering pragmatic solutions and nicely nuanced insights. Advancing Family Theories is exactly the sort of book that lends itself well to both the classroom and more specialized theoretical and empirical work."" -Jay Teachman, Western Washington University How can the study of families be scientific? What is the difference between postmodern and positivistic approaches? What is the role of models and metaphors in constructing our theoretical knowledge? In Advancing Family Theories, author James M. White addresses such difficult questions that have been longstanding issues within the field of family studies and examines these matters from a social science perspective. Advancing Family Theories explores two contemporary theories of the family-rational choice theory and transition theory. These diametrically different approaches illuminate what differing theories reveal about families. The book also discusses how meta-theories can assist in building and refining theory and offers insight on the ""understanding versus explanation"" debate. Advancing Family Theories gives students a precise notion of what a theory is and how theories work in research. The book not only looks at philosophical realms but also examines particular substantive theory to explain and predict family behaviors. Key Features Uses a theme of ""models and metaphors"" to unite what often seems to be conflicting approaches to theory and context Allows readers to view differing research as theoretical and complementary rather than competitive and exclusive Shows how to develop thesis research questions and how to identify theory relevant to substantive research interests Advancing Family Theories is designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses on family theory, research, and methods. It is an excellent supplement to Family Theories, Third Edition (SAGE, 2008), or is effective on its own. The book helps students with the task of taking abstract and very general theories and reducing them to a level of specific research models and hypotheses.",Family & Relationships,217,N/A,0,en

American Values,"Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.",HarperCollins,2018-05-15,"With rich detail, compelling honesty, and a storyteller’s gift, RFK Jr. describes his life growing up Kennedy in a tumultuous time in history that eerily echoes the issues of nuclear confrontation, religion, race, and inequality that we confront today. “With emotion and striking detail, RFK Jr. recalls both the private joys and very public pain of his childhood.”— Independent Catholic News In this powerful book that combines the best aspects of memoir and political history, the third child of Attorney General Robert Kennedy and nephew of JFK takes us on an intimate journey through his life, including watershed moments in the history of our nation. Stories of his grandparents Joseph and Rose set the stage for their nine remarkable children, among them three U.S. senators—Teddy, Bobby, and Jack—one of whom went on to become attorney general, and the other, the president of the United States. We meet Allen Dulles and J. Edgar Hoover, two men whose agencies posed the principal threats to American democracy and values. We live through the Cuban Missile Crisis, when insubordinate spies and belligerent generals in the Pentagon and Moscow brought the world to the cliff edge of nuclear war. At Hickory Hill in Virginia, where RFK Jr. grew up, we encounter the celebrities who gathered at the second most famous address in Washington, members of what would later become known as America’s Camelot. Through his father’s role as attorney general we get an insider’s look as growing tensions over civil rights led to pitched battles in the streets and 16,000 federal troops were called in to enforce desegregation at Ole Miss. We see growing pressure to fight wars in Southeast Asia to stop communism. We relive the assassination of JFK, RFK’s run for the presidency that was cut short by his own death, and the aftermath of those murders on the Kennedy family. RFK Jr. also shares his own experiences, not just with historical events and the movers who shaped them but also with his mother and father, with his own struggles with addiction, and with the ways he eventually made peace with both his Kennedy legacy and his own demons. A lyrically written book that provides insight, hope, and steady wisdom for Americans as they wrestle, as never before, with questions about America’s role in history and the world and what it means to be American.",Biography & Autobiography,533,N/A,0,en

Joshua's Family,Joseph F. Girzone,Image,2007-05-15,"This engaging prequel to Joseph Girzone’s bestselling series, which has sold more than 5 million books in the United States, describes Joshua’s early years and the first inklings of his destiny as a messenger of love in a troubled world. Millions of readers around the world have followed the story of the gentle woodcarver and carpenter who was first introduced in 1983 in Joseph Girzone’s beloved parable, Joshua. In JOSHUA’S FAMILY, Girzone travels back in time, painting a captivating portrait of the mother and father who nurtured Joshua and of the friends and neighbors who viewed the unusually precocious child with an uneasy balance of wonder and skepticism. Joshua’s extraordinary nature and mysterious gifts come to light even as he participates in the ordinary routines of small-town life: his gentleness and loving spirit imbue his interactions with contemporaries and adults alike. As he grows from child to adolescent, Joshua gradually awakens to the knowledge that he has been placed on earth for a special reason. Leaving the comforts of family and a familiar world, he moves to the outskirts of a distant town, where he will begin to teach others how the powers of love, tolerance, and understanding can heal the divisions in the human family and bring everlasting peace to the world. This is the book so many have been waiting for, and its powerful message is a much-needed antidote to the difficulties in today’s world.",Fiction,226,N/A,0,en

"The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State",Friedrich Engels,Verso Books,2021-08-17,"In this provocative and now-classic work, Friedrich Engels explores the interrelated development of the family and the state from ancient society to the Victorian era. Drawing on new anthropological theories of his time, Engels argued that matriarchal communal societies had been overthrown by class society and its emphasis on private, not communal, property and monogamous, rather than polygamous, sexual organization. This historical development, Engels argued, constituted ""the world-historic defeat of the female sex."" A masterclass in the application of materialist thought to history and anthropology, and touching on love, monogamy, property, and the development of the human, this landmark work is still foundational in Marxist and socialist feminist theory.",Political Science,290,N/A,0,en

The Canadian Family in Crisis,John F. Conway,James Lorimer &amp; Company,2003-08,"In this book, sociology professor John F. Conway looks at families past, present and future and examines the changing nature of family. Figures from the first decade of the new milennium tell us that one marriage in two may well end in divorce. Conway considers the implications of divorce, the impact of social changes on men, women and children, and suggests how these issues might be better addressed through family policy. The new edition addresses the harsh new reality facing Canadian families, especially those most vulnerable as a result of the crisis of the family.

Farm (and Other F Words),Sarah K Mock,N/A,2021-04-26,"We love The American Farmer. We trust them to grow our food, to be part of children's nursery rhymes, to provide the economic backbone of rural communities, and to embody a version of the American dream. At the same time, we know that ""corporate farms"" are disrupting the agrarian way of life that we so admire, and that we've got to do something to stop it. So what's our plan for saving the farms we love? In Farm (and Other F Words), Sarah K Mock dismantles misconceptions about American farms and discovers what makes small family farms work, or why they don't. While exploring the intersection of farming and wealth, Mock offers an alternative perspective on American agricultural history, and outlines a path to a more equitable food system moving forward. Calling for change, Farm (and Other F Words) tackles questions like: Do farmers really get paid not to farm? Are ""big corporate farms"" the future? How much good has the food movement done for small family farmers? Ultimately, Mock suggests a solution without putting the onus for change on struggling consumers and reminds us that, ""the future of American agriculture is not yet decided.""",,268,5,1,en

Feeding the Family,Marjorie L. DeVault,University of Chicago Press,1991,"Housework—often trivialized or simply overlooked in public discourse—contributes in a complex and essential way to the form that families and societies assume. In this innovative study, Marjorie L. DeVault explores the implications of ""feeding the family"" from the perspective of those who do that work. Along the way, DeVault offers a new vocabulary for discussing nurturance as a basis of group life and sociability. Drawing from interviews conducted in 1982-83 in a diverse group of American households, DeVault reveals the effort and skill behind the ""invisible"" work of shopping, cooking, and serving meals. She then shows how this work can become oppressive for women, drawing them into social relations that construct and maintain their subordinate position in household life.",Family & Relationships,288,N/A,0,en

Exploring Formalisation,Clara Löh,Springer Nature,2022-09-24,"This primer on mathematics formalisation provides a rapid, hands-on introduction to proof verification in Lean. After a quick introduction to Lean, the basic techniques of human-readable formalisation are introduced, illustrated by simple examples on maps, induction and real numbers. Subsequently, typical design options are discussed and brought to life through worked examples in the setting of simplicial complexes (a higher-dimensional generalisation of graph theory). Finally, the book demonstrates how current research in algebraic and geometric topology can be formalised by means of suitable abstraction layers. Informed by the author's recent teaching and research experience, this book allows students and researchers to quickly get started with formalising and checking their proofs. The core material of the book is accessible to mathematics students with basic programming skills. For the final chapter, familiarity with elementary category theory and algebraic topology is recommended.",Mathematics,152,N/A,0,en

"Periodic Orbits, Stability and Resonances",G.E.O. Giacaglia,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The subjects of resonance and stability are closely related to the problem of evolution of the solar system. It is a physically involving problem and the methods available to mathematics today seem unsatisfactory to produce pure non linear ways of attack. The linearization process in both subjects is clearly of doubtful significance, so that, even if very restrictive, numerical solutions are still the best and more valuable sources of informations. It is quite possible that we know now very little more of the entire problem that was known to Poincare, with the advantage that we can now compute much faster and with much more precision. We feel that the papers collected in this Symposium have contributed a step forward to the comprehension of Resonance, Periodic Orbits and Stability. In a field like this, it would be a surprise if one had gone a long way toward that comprehension, during the short time of two weeks. But we are sure that the joint efforts of all the scientists involved has produced and will produce a measurable acceleration in the process. If this is true it will be a great satisfaction to us that this has happened in Brasil. The Southern Hemisphere in America has now begun to participate actively in the Astro nomical Society and for this, we are grateful to everyone who has helped.",Science,540,N/A,0,en
Soft Computing in Measurement and Information Acquisition,"Leonid Reznik, Vladik Kreinovich",Springer Science & Business Media,2003-05-09,"The vigorous development of the internet and other information technologies have significantly expanded the amount and variety of sources of information available on decision making. This book presents the current trends of soft computing applications to the fields of measurements and information acquisition. Main topics are the production and presentation of information including multimedia, virtual environment, and computer animation as well as the improvement of decisions made on the basis of this information in various applications ranging from engineering to business. In order to make high-quality decisions, one has to fuse information of different kinds from a variety of sources with differing degrees of reliability and uncertainty. The necessity to use intelligent methodologies in the analysis of such systems is demonstrated as well as the inspiring relation of computational intelligence to its natural counterpart. This book includes several contributions demonstrating a further movement towards the interdisciplinary collaboration of the biological and computer sciences with examples from biology and robotics.",Business & Economics,312,N/A,0,en

Graph and Network Theory,"Michael A. Henning, Jan H. van Vuuren",Springer Nature,2022-06-03,"This textbook covers a diversity of topics in graph and network theory, both from a theoretical standpoint, and from an applied modelling point of view. Mathematica® is used to demonstrate much of the modelling aspects. Graph theory and model building tools are developed in tandem with effective techniques for solving practical problems via computer implementation. The book is designed with three primary readerships in mind. Individual syllabi or suggested sequences for study are provided for each of three student audiences: mathematics, applied mathematics/operations research, and computer science. In addition to the visual appeal of each page, the text contains an abundance of gems. Most chapters open with real-life problem descriptions which serve as motivation for the theoretical development of the subject matter. Each chapter concludes with three different sets of exercises. The first set of exercises are standard and geared toward the more mathematically inclined reader. Many of these are routine exercises, designed to test understanding of the material in the text, but some are more challenging. The second set of exercises is earmarked for the computer technologically savvy reader and offer computer exercises using Mathematica. The final set consists of larger projects aimed at equipping those readers with backgrounds in the applied sciences to apply the necessary skills learned in the chapter in the context of real-world problem solving. Additionally, each chapter offers biographical notes as well as pictures of graph theorists and mathematicians who have contributed significantly to the development of the results documented in the chapter. These notes are meant to bring the topics covered to life, allowing the reader to associate faces with some of the important discoveries and results presented. In total, approximately 100 biographical notes are presented throughout the book. The material in this book has been organized into three distinct parts, each with a different focus. The first part is devoted to topics in network optimization, with a focus on basic notions in algorithmic complexity and the computation of optimal paths, shortest spanning trees, maximum flows and minimum-cost flows in networks, as well as the solution of network location problems. The second part is devoted to a variety of classical problems in graph theory, including problems related to matchings, edge and vertex traversal, connectivity, planarity, edge and vertex coloring, and orientations of graphs. Finally, the focus in the third part is on modern areas of study in graph theory, covering graph domination, Ramsey theory, extremal graph theory, graph enumeration, and application of the probabilistic method.",Business & Economics,782,N/A,0,en

Kay,CRC Press,2011-06-24,"Designed for mathematics majors and other students who intend to teach mathematics at the secondary school level, College Geometry: A Unified Development unifies the three classical geometries within an axiomatic framework. The author develops the axioms to include Euclidean, elliptic, and hyperbolic geometry, showing how geometry has real and far-reaching implications. He approaches every topic as a fresh, new concept and carefully defines and explains geometric principles. The book begins with elementary ideas about points, lines, and distance, gradually introducing more advanced concepts such as congruent triangles and geometric inequalities. At the core of the text, the author simultaneously develops the classical formulas for spherical and hyperbolic geometry within the axiomatic framework. He explains how the trigonometry of the right triangle, including the Pythagorean theorem, is developed for classical non-Euclidean geometries. Previously accessible only to advanced or graduate students, this material is presented at an elementary level. The book also explores other important concepts of modern geometry, including affine transformations and circular inversion. Through clear explanations and numerous examples and problems, this text shows step-by-step how fundamental geometric ideas are connected to advanced geometry. It represents the first step toward future study of Riemannian geometry, Einstein’s relativity, and theories of cosmology.",Mathematics,655,N/A,0,en

Host-Parasite Cellular and Molecular Interactions in Protozoal Infections,"K.-P. Chang, David Snary",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-06-29,"Tropical diseases such as leishmaniasis, malaria. trypanosomiasis, toxoplasmosis and amebiasis continue to plague the world, resulting in considerable morbidity and mortality, especially in the third world countries. These diseases are caused by a group of protozoa which have, over the years, undergone evolutionary adaptation to live often intracellularly in a parasitic way of life. So well-adapted have they become that they recognize the right hosts or cells to parasitize, yet at the same time they escape recognition and destruction by the host immune system. The mechanisms of such recognition and the escape of recognition are governed largely by host-parasite surface membrane interactions at the cellular and molecular level. Unique molecules produced by unusual pathways of these parasites have also been discovered and found to play important roles in their survival in the host. Understanding these mechanisms and pathways is essential not only to formulate a rational strategy for chemo- and immuno-prophylaxis and -therapy but also to unravel the mystery of biological evolution in symbiosis and parasitism. In the advent of our knowledge on the molecular biology and biochemistry of parasite membrane and other molecules, it is opportune to examine and discuss their possible roles in host-parasite recognition and interaction in a comparative approach. To highlight the recent advances of this area in various host-parasite systems, a NATO advanced Research Workshop was held from September 27 to October 1, 1986 at Hotel Villa del Mare, Acquafredda di Maratea, Italy.",Science,426,N/A,0,en

Production Scheduling,Rodrigo Righi,BoD – Books on Demand,2012-01-11,"Generally speaking, scheduling is the procedure of mapping a set of tasks or jobs (studied objects) to a set of target resources efficiently. More specifically, as a part of a larger planning and scheduling process, production scheduling is essential for the proper functioning of a manufacturing enterprise. This book presents ten chapters divided into five sections. Section 1 discusses rescheduling strategies, policies, and methods for production scheduling. Section 2 presents two chapters about flow shop scheduling. Section 3 describes heuristic and metaheuristic methods for treating the scheduling problem in an efficient manner. In addition, two test cases are presented in Section 4. The first uses simulation, while the second shows a real implementation of a production scheduling system. Finally, Section 5 presents some modeling strategies for building production scheduling systems. This book will be of interest to those working in the decision-making branches of production, in various operational research areas, as well as computational methods design.

Topics in Algebraic Graph Theory,"Lowell W. Beineke, Robin J. Wilson, Peter J. Cameron",Cambridge University Press,2004-10-04,"The rapidly expanding area of algebraic graph theory uses two different branches of algebra to explore various aspects of graph theory: linear algebra (for spectral theory) and group theory (for studying graph symmetry). These areas have links with other areas of mathematics, such as logic and harmonic analysis, and are increasingly being used in such areas as computer networks where symmetry is an important feature. Other books cover portions of this material, but this book is unusual in covering both of these aspects and there are no other books with such a wide scope. Peter J. Cameron, internationally recognized for his substantial contributions to the area, served as academic consultant for this volume, and the result is ten expository chapters written by acknowledged international experts in the field.

Asymptotics for Associated Random Variables,Paulo Eduardo Oliveira,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-01-13,"The book concerns the notion of association in probability and statistics. Association and some other positive dependence notions were introduced in 1966 and 1967 but received little attention from the probabilistic and statistics community. The interest in these dependence notions increased in the last 15 to 20 years, and many asymptotic results were proved and improved. Despite this increased interest, characterizations and results remained essentially scattered in the literature published in different journals. The goal of this book is to bring together the bulk of these results, presenting the theory in a unified way, explaining relations and implications of the results. It will present basic definitions and characterizations, followed by a collection of relevant inequalities. These are then applied to characterize almost sure and weak convergence of sequences of associated variables. It will also cover applications of positive dependence to the characterization of asymptotic results in nonparametric statistics. The book is directed towards researchers in probability and statistics, with particular emphasis on people interested in nonparametric methods. It will also be of interest to graduate students in those areas. The book could also be used as a reference on association in a course covering dependent variables and their asymptotics. As prerequisite, readers should have knowledge of basic probability on the reals and on metric spaces. Some acquaintance with the asymptotics of random functions, such us empirical processes and partial sums processes, is useful but not essential.",Mathematics,198,N/A,0,en
Fatou Type Theorems,F. Di Biase,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"A basic principle governing the boundary behaviour of holomorphic func tions (and harmonic functions) is this: Under certain growth conditions, for almost every point in the boundary of the domain, these functions ad mit a boundary limit, if we approach the bounda-ry point within certain approach regions. For example, for bounded harmonic functions in the open unit disc, the natural approach regions are nontangential triangles with one vertex in the boundary point, and entirely contained in the disc [Fat06]. In fact, these natural approach regions are optimal, in the sense that convergence will fail if we approach the boundary inside larger regions, having a higher order of contact with the boundary. The first theorem of this sort is due to J. E. Littlewood [Lit27], who proved that if we replace a nontangential region with the rotates of any fixed tangential curve, then convergence fails. In 1984, A. Nagel and E. M. Stein proved that in Euclidean half spaces (and the unit disc) there are in effect regions of convergence that are not nontangential: These larger approach regions contain tangential sequences (as opposed to tangential curves). The phenomenon discovered by Nagel and Stein indicates that the boundary behaviour of ho)omor phic functions (and harmonic functions), in theorems of Fatou type, is regulated by a second principle, which predicts the existence of regions of convergence that are sequentially larger than the natural ones.",Mathematics,158,N/A,0,en

Special Topics in Mathematics for Computer Scientists,Ernst-Erich Doberkat,Springer,2015-11-16,"This textbook addresses the mathematical description of sets, categories, topologies and measures, as part of the basis for advanced areas in theoretical computer science like semantics, programming languages, probabilistic process algebras, modal and dynamic logics and Markov transition systems. Using motivations, rigorous definitions, proofs and various examples, the author systematically introduces the Axiom of Choice, explains Banach-Mazur games and the Axiom of Determinacy, discusses the basic constructions of sets and the interplay of coalgebras and Kripke models for modal logics with an emphasis on Kleisli categories, monads and probabilistic systems. The text further shows various ways of defining topologies, building on selected topics like uniform spaces, Gödel’s Completeness Theorem and topological systems. Finally, measurability, general integration, Borel sets and measures on Polish spaces, as well as the coalgebraic side of Markov transition kernels along with applications to probabilistic interpretations of modal logics are presented. Special emphasis is given to the integration of (co-)algebraic and measure-theoretic structures, a fairly new and exciting field, which is demonstrated through the interpretation of game logics. Readers familiar with basic mathematical structures like groups, Boolean algebras and elementary calculus including mathematical induction will discover a wealth of useful research tools. Throughout the book, exercises offer additional information, and case studies give examples of how the techniques can be applied in diverse areas of theoretical computer science and logics.

Easy Women,Debra A. Castillo,U of Minnesota Press,1998,"Addresses the topic of prostitution and ""easy women"" in Mexican literature. The figure of the prostitute or sexually liberated woman not only permeates Mexican folk songs and popular movies but stands at the crossroads of its national literary culture. In Easy Women, Debra A. Castillo focuses on the prostitute, or the woman perceived as such, in order to ask why this character exerts such a hold on the Mexican imagination. Combining early twentieth-century novels, current best-selling pulp fiction, and testimonial narratives, Castillo explores how Mexican writers have positioned the ""easy woman"" in their works. In each example the transgressive woman -- marked by an active sexuality -- serves a crucial narrative function, one that both promotes and challenges myths about women on the continuum of sexual promiscuity.

Besides thorough revisions, more emphasis was put on reordering the topics according to a category-theoretical view. This allows the mathematical results to be stated, proved, and understood in a much easier and elegant way. From the reviews of the Russian edition: ""The main accent is shifted to the application . . . in geometrical optics, thermostatics and control theory, and not to the Hamiltonian mechanics only. . . . To make the book fairly self-contained, full details of basic definitions and all proofs are included. In this way, the majority of the text can be read without the prerequisite of a course in geometry. The excellent collection of examples illustrates the relatively hard and highly abstract mathematical theory and its hidden difficulties. . . . The book can rise real interest for specialists . . . .

The Absolute Galois Group of a Semi-Local Field,"Dan Haran, Moshe Jarden",Springer Nature,2021-11-19,"This book is devoted to the structure of the absolute Galois groups of certain algebraic extensions of the field of rational numbers. Its main result, a theorem proved by the authors and Florian Pop in 2012, describes the absolute Galois group of distinguished semi-local algebraic (and other) extensions of the rational numbers as free products of the free profinite group on countably many generators and local Galois groups. This is an instance of a positive answer to the generalized inverse problem of Galois theory. Adopting both an arithmetic and probabilistic approach, the book carefully sets out the preliminary material needed to prove the main theorem and its supporting results. In addition, it includes a description of Melnikov's construction of free products of profinite groups and, for the first time in book form, an account of a generalization of the theory of free products of profinite groups and their subgroups. The book will be of interest to researchers in field arithmetic, Galois theory and profinite groups.",Mathematics,147,N/A,0,en
Condensing Multivalued Maps and Semilinear Differential Inclusions in Banach Spaces,"Mikhail Kamenskii, Valeri Obukhovskii, Pietro Zecca",Walter de Gruyter,2001,"The theory of set-valued maps and of differential inclusion is developed in recent years both as a field of his own and as an approach to control theory. The book deals with the theory of semilinear differential inclusions in infinite dimensional spaces. In this setting, problems of interest to applications do not suppose neither convexity of the map or compactness of the multi-operators. These assumption implies the development of the theory of measure of noncompactness and the construction of a degree theory for condensing mapping. Of particular interest is the approach to the case when the linear part is a generator of a condensing, strongly continuous semigroup. In this context, the existence of solutions for the Cauchy and periodic problems are proved as well as the topological properties of the solution sets.

The Ergodic Theory of Lattice Subgroups (AM-172),"Alexander Gorodnik, Amos Nevo",Princeton University Press,2009-09-21,"The results established in this book constitute a new departure in ergodic theory and a significant expansion of its scope. Traditional ergodic theorems focused on amenable groups, and relied on the existence of an asymptotically invariant sequence in the group, the resulting maximal inequalities based on covering arguments, and the transference principle. Here, Alexander Gorodnik and Amos Nevo develop a systematic general approach to the proof of ergodic theorems for a large class of non-amenable locally compact groups and their lattice subgroups. Simple general conditions on the spectral theory of the group and the regularity of the averaging sets are formulated, which suffice to guarantee convergence to the ergodic mean. In particular, this approach gives a complete solution to the problem of establishing mean and pointwise ergodic theorems for the natural averages on semisimple algebraic groups and on their discrete lattice subgroups. Furthermore, an explicit quantitative rate of convergence to the ergodic mean is established in many cases. The topic of this volume lies at the intersection of several mathematical fields of fundamental importance. These include ergodic theory and dynamics of non-amenable groups, harmonic analysis on semisimple algebraic groups and their homogeneous spaces, quantitative non-Euclidean lattice point counting problems and their application to number theory, as well as equidistribution and non-commutative Diophantine approximation. Many examples and applications are provided in the text, demonstrating the usefulness of the results established.",Mathematics,136,N/A,0,en

Daughter of Family G,Ami McKay,Knopf Canada,2019-09-24,"Weaving together family history, genetic discovery, and scenes from her life, Ami McKay tells the compelling, true-science story of her own family's unsettling legacy of hereditary cancer while exploring the challenges that come from carrying the mutation that not only killed many people you loved, but might also kill you. The story of Ami McKay's connection to a genetic disorder called Lynch syndrome begins over seventy years before she was born and long before scientists discovered DNA. In 1895 her great-great aunt, Pauline Gross, a seamstress in Ann Arbor, Michigan, confided to a pathology professor at the local university that she expected to die young, like so many others in her family. Rather than dismiss her fears, the pathologist chose to enlist Pauline in the careful tracking of those in her family tree who had died of cancer. Pauline's premonition proved true--she died at 46--but because of her efforts, her family (who the pathologist dubbed 'Family G') would become the longest and most detailed cancer genealogy ever studied in the world. A century after Pauline's confession, researchers would identify the genetic mutation responsible for the family's woes. Now known as Lynch syndrome, the genetic condition predisposes its carriers to several types of cancer, including colorectal, endometrial, ovarian and pancreatic. In 2001, as a young mother with two sons and a keen interest in survival, Ami McKay was among the first to be tested for Lynch syndrome. She had a feeling she'd test positive: her mother's side of the family was riddled with early deaths and her own mother was being treated for the disease. When the test proved her fears true, she began living in ""an unsettling state between wellness and cancer,"" and she's been there ever since. Intimate, candid, and probing, her genetic memoir tells a fascinating story, teasing out the many ways to live with the hand you are dealt.",Biography & Autobiography,322,N/A,0,en

Criminal and Civil Investigation Handbook,Joseph J. Grau,N/A,1981,"The text covers the legal authority, procedures, and latest techniques for public and private investigations of criminal, civil, and regulatory cases. Its scope includes legal and operational information on police investigative units; case management procedures; and techniques for uncovering law violations ranging from street crimes to organized and corporate crimes, including insurance fraud, terrorist acts, corruption, drug smuggling, and many more. The book introduces basic investigative principles and defines the legal authority of police, security officers, and regulatory and insurance investigators. More than 60 experts (FBI agents, detectives, law professors, security managers, and others) contributed to the text. Chapters outline stop-and-frisk and search-and-seizure laws (as well as others that must be understood to bring a case to conviction) and explain the roles of the grand jury and the investigator in court and process serving. Police procedures at the scene of the crime and afterwards, and the detective division's organization and operations are explained (including forensic and intelligence operations). Contributors suggest techniques for obtaining information from individuals (including informants) through interviews and interrogations, polygraph and media investigations, hypnosis, and genealogy. Chapters discuss investigations of specific business crimes involving computers, unions, nursing homes and other Medicaid providers, credit cards, prescription drugs, and insurance frauds. The text also describes investigations of sexual assaults, homicide, extortion, art thefts, drug operations, and hostage taking. A model case management plan, a checklist for investigative notetaking, information sources and sample contact letters, and eyewitness identification methods are included, as well as discussions of 'sting' operations, time of death determinations, investigations of environmental problems (such as chemical fires), and other specific working aids.",Reference,1116,N/A,0,en

Before My Time,Ami McKay,National Geographic Books,2021-03-30,"NATIONAL BESTSELLER WINNER OF THE ROBBIE ROBERTSON DARTMOUTH BOOK AWARD and the EVELYN RICHARDSON NON-FICTION AWARD Previously published as Daughter of Family G Weaving together touching scenes from her family history and her own life, Ami McKay's intimate and captivating memoir captures what it means to live fully even when you know your life may be cut short. In 1895, Ami McKay's great-great aunt, a dressmaker named Pauline Gross, confided to a medical professor that she expected to die young, like many in her family before her. With her help, that doctor launched a family study that eventually led to the identification of the genetic mutation now known as Lynch syndrome, which predisposes its carriers to several types of cancer. In 2001, Ami was among the first to be tested for the syndrome. And now she's written the captivating story of how she, like her mother before her, learned to carry on with joy, with hope, and with a bold hunger for life in the face of an uncertain future. Ami writes of her childhood, ""I listened to the women in my family tell stories of the past . . . sitting around the kitchen table with my mother, sometimes laughing until they cried, sometimes sobbing through words of grief. They spoke of relatives who lived before I was born—people who came from nothing, who faced great hardship, who died too young. The women in those tales stared down death, looked after the sick, and conversed with fate. They spread the truth through story, even when others didn't wish to hear it. This is how I learned that stories have power—to make sense of the world, to give voice to dreams, to nurture hope and banish fear.""",Biography & Autobiography,0,N/A,0,en

The Third Edition of Family Stress Management continues its original commitment to recognize both the external and internal contexts in which distressed families find themselves. With its hallmark Contextual Model of Family Stress (CMFS), the Third Edition provides practitioners and researchers with a useful framework to understand and help distressed individuals, couples, and families. The example of a universal stressor—a death in the family—highlights cultural differences in ways of coping.

Handbook of Family Theories,"Mark A. Fine, Frank D. Fincham",Routledge,2013-03-05,"Organized by content areas rather than by theory, this comprehensive, accessible handbook helps readers gain greater insight into how key theories have impacted today’s family research. Most competing books, organized by theory, do not provide a strong sense of the links between theory and research. Using the 2000 and 2010 decade-in-review issues of the Journal of Marriage and Family as a resource, the book addresses the most important topics impacting family studies research today. The introductory chapter, written by the editors, provides an overview of the role family theories have had on the field. This chapter is followed by 23 others on family-related content areas written by renowned scholars in the field. The book is organized around the most important domains in the field: parenting and parent-child relationships, romantic relationships, conflict and aggression, structural variation and transitions, demographic variations, and families and extra-familial institutions. Each of the contributors describes how theory has been used to generate new knowledge in the field and suggests future directions for how theory may be used to extend our knowledge base. The book helps readers acquire a working knowledge of the key family science theories, findings, and issues and understand how researchers make use of these theories in their empirical efforts. To maximize accessibility, each of the renowned contributors addresses a common set of issues in their chapter: • Introduction to the content area • Review of the key topics, issues, and findings • A description of each of the major theories used to study that particular content area • Limitations of the theories • Suggestions for better use of the theories and/or new theoretical advances • Conclusions about future theoretical developments. An ideal text for graduate and/or advanced undergraduate family theories courses, this book’s unique organization also lends itself to use in content-based family studies/science courses taught in family studies, human development, psychology, sociology, communication, education, and nursing. Due to its comprehensive and current approach, the book also appeals to scholars and researchers in these areas.",Psychology,514,N/A,0,en
Family Health,"John T. Pardeck, Francis K. O. Yuen",Bloomsbury Publishing USA,1999-05-30,"The profession of social work has, since its inception, stressed the importance of the family system in practice and policy development. Even though the family has always been central to effective social work practice, the framing of the family system from a holistic health perspective is new to the field. This collection develops a family health perspective that will facilitate effective social work practice and policy development. Family health is an emerging practice orientation within the field of social work. A family health orientation practice utilizes a holistic approach that examines family strength and stress inside and outside the family system. How families perceive these conditions and their ability to adapt and change will greatly determine how concerns are managed by the family system. A critical role of the social work practitioner is to help families deal with these pressures at both the micro and macro levels. The family health perspective examined in this collection deals with assessment and intervention through a family health approach; research and evaluation on family health; family health and cultural diversity; family health and social policy; and social service delivery through a family health approach.",Social Science,206,N/A,0,en

Space in Weak Propositional Proof Systems,Ilario Bonacina,Springer,2018-01-11,"This book considers logical proof systems from the point of view of their space complexity. After an introduction to propositional proof complexity the author structures the book into three main parts. Part I contains two chapters on resolution, one containing results already known in the literature before this work and one focused on space in resolution, and the author then moves on to polynomial calculus and its space complexity with a focus on the combinatorial technique to prove monomial space lower bounds. The first chapter in Part II addresses the proof complexity and space complexity of the pigeon principles. Then there is an interlude on a new type of game, defined on bipartite graphs, essentially independent from the rest of the book, collecting some results on graph theory.

"Surnames, DNA, and Family History","George Redmonds, Turi King, David Hey",OUP Oxford,2011-08-25,"This book combines linguistic and historical approaches with the latest techniques of DNA analysis and shows the insights these offer for every kind of genealogical research. It focuses on British names, tracing their origins to different parts of the British Isles and Europe and revealing how names often remain concentrated in the districts where they first became established centuries ago. In the process the book casts fresh light on the ancient peopling of the British Isles. The authors consider why some names die out while others spread across the globe. They use recent advances in DNA testing to investigate whether particular surnames have single, dual, or multiple origins, and to find out if the various forms of a single name have a common origin. They show how information from DNA can be combined with historical evidence and techniques to distinguish between individuals with the same name and different names with similar spellings, and to identifty the name of the same individual or family spelt in various ways in different times and places. The final chapter of this paperback edition, looking at the use of genetics in historical research, has been updated to include new work on the DNA of Richard III.",Language Arts & Disciplines,417,N/A,0,en
T&T Clark Companion to Nonconformity,Robert Pope,A&C Black,2013-11-21,"Protestant Nonconformity, the umbrella term for Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Baptists, Methodists and Unitarians, belongs specifically to the religious history of England and Wales. Initially the result of both unwillingness to submit to the State's interference in Christian life and a dissatisfaction with the progress of reform in the English Church, Nonconformity has been primarily motivated by theological concern, ecclesial polity, devotion and the nurture of godliness among the members of the church. Alongside such churchly interests, Nonconformity has also made a profound contribution to debates about the role of the State, to family life and education, culture in general, trade and industry, the development of philanthropy and charity, and the development of pacifism. In this volume, for the first time, Nonconformity and the breadth of its activity come under the expert scrutiny of a host of recognised scholars. The result is a detailed and fascinating account of a movement in church history that, while currently in decline, has made an indelible mark on social, political, economic and religious life of the two nations.",Religion,791,N/A,0,en

In this book Barbara H. Fiese, a clinical and developmental psychologist, examines how the practices of diverse family routines and the meanings created through rituals have evolved to meet the demands of today’s busy families. She discusses and integrates various research literatures and draws on her own studies to show how family routines and rituals influence physical and mental health, translate cultural values, and may even be used therapeutically. Looking at a range of family activities from bedtime stories to special holiday meals, Fiese relates such occasions to significant issues including parenting competence, child adjustment, and relational well-being. She concludes by underscoring the importance of flexible approaches to family time to promote healthier families and communities.",Family & Relationships,184,N/A,0,en

A Comparison of Genetic Algorithms and Other Machine Learning Systems on a Complex Classification Task from Common Disease Research,Clare Bates Congdon,N/A,1995,"Abstract: ""The thesis project is an investigation of some well- known machine learning systems and evaluates their utility when applied to a classification task from the field of human genetics. This common- disease research task, an inquiry into genetic and biochemical factors and their association with a family history of coronary artery disease (CAD), is more complex than many pursued in machine learning research, due to interactions and the inherent noise in the dataset. The task also differs from most pursued in machine learning research because there is a desire to explain the dataset with a small number of rules, even at the expense of accuracy, so that they will be more accessible to medical researchers who are unaccustomed to dealing with disjunctive explanations of data. Furthermore, there is assymetry in the task in that good explanations of the positive examples is of more importance than good explanations of the negative examples. The primary machine learning approach investigated in this research is genetic algorithms (GA's); decision trees, Autoclass, and Cobweb are also included. The GA performed the best in terms of descriptive ability with the common-disease research task, although decision trees also demonstrated certain strengths. Autoclass and Cobweb were recognized from the onset as being inappropriate for the needs of common-disease researchers (because both systems are unsupervised learners that create probabilistic structures), but were included for their interest in the machine learning community; these systems did not perform as well as GA's and decision trees in terms of their ability to describe the data. In terms of predictive accuracy, all systems performed poorly, and the differences between any two of the three best systems is not significant. When positive and negative examples are considered separately, the GA does significantly better than the other systems in predicting positive examples and significantly worse in predicting negative examples. The thesis illustrates that the investigation of 'real' problems from researchers in other fields can lead machine learning researchers to challenge their systems in ways they may not otherwise have considered, and may lead these researchers to a symbiotic relationship that benefits multiple research communities.""",Genetic algorithms,452,N/A,0,en

Salt and Hypertension,"Rainer Rettig, Detlev Ganten, Friedrich C. Luft",Springer,1988-12-20,"Controversy regarding the wisdom of a high salt intake has been with us for 5000 years. In the Nei Ching, the oldest of the extant medical writings, the Yellow Emperor observed, ""Hence, if too much salt is in the food, the pulse hardens, tears make their appearance, and the complexion changes"". At about the same period in history, Job asked the question, ""Can that which is unsavory be eaten without salt?"" It is not apparent whether or not the Almighty provided a clear answer. The connection between dietary salt intake and hypertension was appreciated following the observations of AMBARD, BEAUJARD, VOLLHARD, ALLEN, and others. However, DAHL emphasized this relationship, as demonstrated by his epidemiological observations, his studies in human subjects, and his development of a genetically mediated form of salt-sensitive hypertension in rats. DAHL and his followers argued that hypertension was a disease of acculturation, or even of self-abuse. Undaunted by skeptics such as PICKERING, they suggested that if Western man would merely curtail his intake of the granular condiment, hypertension would not develop and blood pressure would not increase with age. Bucolic native societies were given as examples where such cardiovascular bliss was readily attained.",Medical,396,N/A,0,en

Concepts and Definitions of Family for the 21st Century,"Barbara H Settles, Suzanne Steinmetz",Routledge,2013-05-13,"Explore the breakdown of the universal family form into new living arrangements and the political and social implications of how they influence the definition of family today! Concepts and Definitions of Family for the 21st Century views families from a US perspective and from many different cultures and societies. You will examine the family as it has evolved from the 1950s traditional family to today’s family structures. The controversial question, “What is family?” is thoroughly examined as it has become an increasingly important social policy concern because of the recent change in the traditional family. Scholars and researchers in family studies and sociology will be intrigued by these thought-provoking articles that analyze the definition of the family from a multitude of perspectives. Concepts and Definitions of Family for the 21st Century looks at family in terms of its social construction, variations and the diversity in families, among others. You will examine the negative implications of using the term “The Family” as it implies “The Nuclear Family,” which many powerful lobbies (politics, morality, religion) claim to support and revere. You will also explore family ideology and identity from many different social and cultural contexts. Some of the family issues you will explore in Concepts and Definitions of Family for the 21st Century include: marrying, procreating, and divorcing in a traditional Jewish family redefining western families by taking into consideration the legal factors, history, tradition and the continued expansion of the definition of family in the US addressing family issues in Lithuania, a country amidst many political changes challenging and complicating the definition of family with stepfamilies exploring the question “What are families after divorce?” examining multicultural motives for marriage and how these motives effect courting behavior in Lithuania defining families through caregiving patterns Concepts and Definitions of Family for the 21st Century goes in-depth to broaden and interpret the meaning of family in today’s society. Through the exploration of legal implications, professional and personal needs this text takes into account the large variety of groups that have close living relationships. Concepts and Definitions of Family for the 21st Century will assist you in answering the difficult and complex question “What is family?”",Medical,250,N/A,0,en

Harris and Emberley established themselves as the purveyors of reader-friendly, straightforward information on human sexuality for readers as young as seven. Here they successfully tackle the big questions . . . for even younger kids."" — The Horn Book (starred review) Young children are curious about almost everything, especially their bodies. And young children are not afraid to ask questions. What makes me a girl? What makes me a boy? Why are some parts of girls' and boys' bodies the same and why are some parts different? How was I made? Where do babies come from? Is it true that a stork brings babies to mommies and daddies?

At least 17.7 million individuals in the United States are caregivers of an older adult with a health or functional limitation. The nation's family caregivers provide the lion's share of long-term care for our older adult population. They are also central to older adults' access to and receipt of health care and community-based social services. Yet the need to recognize and support caregivers is among the least appreciated challenges facing the aging U.S. population. Families Caring for an Aging America examines the prevalence and nature of family caregiving of older adults and the available evidence on the effectiveness of programs, supports, and other interventions designed to support family caregivers.

Authors Javad H. Kashani and Wesley D. Allan discuss different types of intrafamilial violence and the effects of each on youngsters. The book then takes up the phenomenon from a cross-cultural perspective, exploring family violence in non-Western contexts.

A Family of Women,"Jane H. Pease, William H. Pease",UNC Press Books,2017-10-10,"The often-stereotyped belles and matrons of the nineteenth-century South emerge as diverse personalities in this compelling account of three generations of women from a South Carolina family whose fate rose and fell with the fortunes of the state. Through vivid, interwoven life stories, the book offers a unique perspective on how these women conducted their lives, shared personal triumphs and defeats, endured the deprivations and despair of civil war, and experienced a social revolution. A Family of Women focuses on the female descendants of Louise Gibert Pettigrew (later changed to Petigru), who rose from upcountry obscurity to privileged prominence in Charleston and on low country plantations, where they variously flourished as belles, managed large households, shocked society with their unconventionality, educated their children, endured troubled marriages, and maintained close family ties. Using the letters, diaries, novels, and memoirs of the Petigru women and the material culture surrounding them, the authors weave a complex story of women well worth knowing.",History,458,N/A,0,en

Discovering The Family I Never Knew,Lee Brand,Lee Brand,2022-10-11,"This is a fictional story inspired by real people and real events. Take an exciting journey with Jeffrey Madison and his exploration into his family history and the dramatic and unexpected outcome. In 1964, Jeffrey lost his father Jack Madison in a tragic airplane crash when he was only 15 years old. Years later, a chance visit to Butte Montana raised questions about his father and his grandfather Arthur Madison and kindled an obsessive drive to uncover the truth about their lives. This story was a revelation about the family history he never knew. His father grew up in the Great Depression and was a lonely, troubled child with an alcoholic mother and a distant father. For nearly 24 years, his grandfather worked in the dangerous lead and copper mines in Oklahoma and Montana. He was able to overcome adversity and re-make himself. The story reveals the powerful connection between generations in a family and its significant influence on our own lives. It is a parable on the enduring value of family and friendships.",Biography & Autobiography,397,N/A,0,en

Family Upheaval,Mikkel Rytter,Berghahn Books,2013-06-01,"Pakistani migrant families in Denmark find themselves in a specific ethno-national, post-9/11 environment where Muslim immigrants are subjected to processes of non-recognition, exclusion and securitization. This ethnographic study explores how, why, and at what costs notions of relatedness, identity, and belonging are being renegotiated within local families and transnational kinship networks. Each entry point concerns the destructive–productive constitution of family life, where neglected responsibilities, obligations, and trust lead not only to broken relationships, but also, and inevitably, to the innovative creation of new ones. By connecting the micro-politics of the migrant family with the macro-politics of the nation state and global conjunctures in general, the book argues that securitization and suspicion—launched in the name of “integration”—escalate internal community dynamics and processes of family upheaval in unpredicted ways.",Social Science,250,N/A,0,en
"Family, Self, and Society","Philip A. Cowan, Dorothy Field, Donald A. Hansen, Arlene Skolnick, Guy E. Swanson",Routledge,2014-05-22,"Any agenda for family research in the 1990s must take seriously a contextual approach to the study of family relationships. The editors and contributors to this volume believe that the richness in family studies over the next decade will come from considering the diversity of family forms -- different ethnic groups and cultures, different stages of family life, as well as different historical cohorts. Their goal is to make more explicit how we think about families in order to study them and understand them. To illustrate the need for diversity in family studies, examples are presented from new and old families, majority and minority families, American and Japanese families, and intact and divorcing families. This variety is intended to push the limits of current thinking, not only for researchers but also for all who are struggling to live with and work with families in a time when family life is valued but fragmented and relatively unsupported by society's institutions. Students and researchers interested in family development from the viewpoint of any of the social sciences will find this book of value.",Psychology,569,N/A,0,en

Biotic Homogenization,"Julie L. Lockwood, Michael L. McKinney",Springer Science & Business Media,2011-06-28,"Biological homogenization is the dominant process shaping the future global biosphere. As global transportation becomes faster and more frequent, it is inevitable that biotic intermixing will increase. Unique local biotas will become extinct only to be replaced by already widespread biotas that can tolerate human activities. This process is affecting all aspects of our world: language, economies, and ecosystems alike. The ultimate outcome is the loss of uniqueness and the growth of uniformity.

The Demography of Transforming Families,Robert Schoen,Springer Nature,2023-08-23,"This book provides an up-to-date survey on the nature, causes, and patterns of family change. The traditional nuclear family has been replaced by a multiplicity of other forms, as widespread cohabitation, high levels of divorce and union dissolution, rising childlessness, and far below replacement fertility have emerged to an extent never before seen. Theoretical perspectives on this “Second Demographic Transition” are presented, highlighting the dramatic changes in gender roles. New methodological strategies for assessing family dynamics are presented, from multistate models of marriage and divorce combined with fertility to improved techniques for combining census and survey data on the family to a new approach for disentangling age, period, and cohort effects. While the volume emphasizes Western nations, insightful case studies range from analyzing family complexity in cohorts of parents and children in the UK to the impact of interpartner violence on family formation, to the emergence of a “gender war” in South Korea. By providing new insights into where we are today and how we got here, the book will be of value to all those interested in the contemporary family.

Social Work with Children and Their Families,Christopher G. Petr,"Oxford University Press, USA",2004,"An extensively revised version of the first edition, this text focuses on the practical foundational knowledge required to practice social work effectively in the complex and fast-changing world of services to children and their families. The core organizing framework consists of eight pragmatic perspectives: combating adultcentrism, family-centered practice, the strengths perspective, respect for diversity and difference, the least restrictive alternative, ecological perspective, organization and financing, and achieving outcomes. Unlike most texts that focus either on direct practice or on policy, Petr's revised volume integrates current policy-including recent reform efforts-with ""best practices."" The student thus gains a deep appreciation for how direct social work practice is linked to, and even guided by, contemporary policy initiatives and the values that underscore those initiatives. Two new chapters are devoted specifically to the fields of child welfare and children's mental health, providing an overview of the laws, policies, practices, and terminology pertaining to each setting. The next eight chapters focus on each pragmatic perspective and its relevance to child welfare and children's mental health. The in-depth case studies that comprise the concluding two chapters illustrate how typical client situations can be successfully addressed within the context of the pragmatic perspectives. Packed with case studies, specific practice instruction, chapter summaries, and suggested learning activities, this book prepares students and practitioners to think and act professionally in ways that are consistent with current laws, values, policies, and reform efforts in the field.",Language Arts & Disciplines,338,N/A,0,en

Each chapter also is a showcase of how scholars pair up with mental health practitioners to create a work that weaves together contextual and individual qualities to inform an understanding of the help-seeker and the intervention.

Nominal and Pronominal Address in Jamaica and Trinidad,Matthias Klumm,John Benjamins Publishing Company,2021-09-15,"This book examines the various patterns of nominal and pronominal address used in Jamaica and Trinidad, the two most populous islands of the English-speaking Caribbean. Given that the Anglo-Caribbean context has so far been largely neglected in address research, this study aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the linguistic means Jamaicans and Trinidadians have at their disposal and make use of to address each other. A particular focus will be on variation in the speakers’ address behaviour with regard to their sex, age, social class, ethnicity, and regional background. The study draws both on data from a self-compiled corpus of postcolonial Jamaican and Trinidadian literary works, and on questionnaire and interview data collected during fieldwork.

Bipolar is a serious illness that requires an integrated approach to solving the enigma. This is an informal guide that pulls no punches and talks about everything from sexual promiscuity to manic spending to delusions of grandeur. Over twenty years, I have learned to lessen its power over my existence. It can become less of an illness and, over time, more of an opportunity. We need to look at bipolar in new ways to get different results. Having a reassuring friend who’s been there makes the difference. I teach many basic, easy to learn approaches. A recent test reader, who was in the mire of illness, described the book as a bridge out: she returns to The Bipolar Guide to review the principles that helped her to live. I strive in this book to take alternative approaches to work through the negative illness traits to plug into the gift side. I have been through the highs and the lows of manic-depression and have embraced the advantages, and continue to live an enhanced life.

Why We Need the Church to Become More Like Jesus,Joseph H. Hellerman,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2017-11-09,"Many of us long to experience the fullness of God and his purpose for our lives. Not a whole lot of us ever do. The reason is that we have departed in some significant ways from the biblical view of Christian life and growth. The New Testament highlights the communal, missional, and eschatological aspects of our walk with God. We grow in our faith as individual Christians to the degree that we are (a) deeply rooted relationally in a local church community that is (b) passionately playing its part in God's grand story of Creation, Fall, Redemption, and Restoration, and (c) intently anticipating the summing of all things in Christ when Jesus returns. In recent decades, American evangelicals have traded away community, outreach, and the Bible's teaching about eternity future for the pursuit of individual religious experience in the here-and-now. Why We Need the Church to Become More Like Jesus traces this departure from biblical Christianity through recent decades of popular evangelical trends and reminds us that faith centered on community, mission, and the story line of Scripture remains the key to the spiritual formation of the individual Christian.",Religion,188,N/A,0,en

The Parent-Child Dance,"Ronald A. Kotkin, Aubrey H. Fine",Simon and Schuster,2015-06-16,"A unique manual to raising a child—for parents everywhere—using the metaphor of dance to provide expert, comforting advice. Having children and raising a family should be the greatest joy in one’s life, but it is a role that requires tremendous responsibility and patience. As parents, our job is to provide a strong foundation for our children, so that they can eventually grow up to become self-sufficient adults. However, just like everything in life, all children are different, some requiring more support than others and to varying degrees over time. Parenting is like a dance between parent and child. The more seamless the movements, the more graceful the interaction. When a parent takes the lead or decides to share, over time with practice, the dance can be smooth and effortless. Nevertheless, when the child is unintentionally allowed to take the lead, the parent-child dance may appear more rocky and unstable. This often occurs when the parent is unclear and at odds with their role. The ensuing battle for the lead may cause disharmony in the relationship and the dance. Parenting is a lifelong commitment that takes patience, thoughtfulness, and skill. The Parent-Child Dance is designed to explain the concept of the dance and act as a catalyst for encouraging parents to begin their journey in making positive changes in their child’s life. Parents will recognize the scenarios and gain insight through humorous examples and step-by-step strategies to avoid disharmony.",Family & Relationships,302,N/A,0,en

The Intimate Way of Zen,James Ishmael Ford,Shambhala Publications,2024-07-23,"An intimate mystery encompasses you and tugs upon your heart—what does it mean to follow that tug across the arc of a spiritual life? Reflecting out of more than fifty years of practice in Zen Buddhism, Unitarian Universalism, and other contemplative traditions, James Ishmael Ford invites us into a journey through life's mysteries and the stages of spiritual development. Lightly structured by the archetypal Buddhist oxherding images, Ford’s exploration is rooted in the Zen way while being deeply enriched by various strains of world mysticism. The book, sprinkled with insights and quotes from Buddhist, Daoist, and Christian traditions, serves as a map and a companion to spiritual seekers or pilgrims—whether within one religious tradition or cobbling together a way of one’s own. “Here is the most natural of all natural experiences,” writes Ford. “In the midst of our suffering, our longing, our desperation, we capture a glimpse. Something touches us. And with that, if we are lucky and really notice some movement of some spirit within us, we turn our attention to the intimate way.”",Philosophy,297,N/A,0,en

Addiction Therapy and Treatment,"Larry Fritzlan, LMFT, Avis Rumney, LMFT",McFarland,2023-01-17,"Addiction is a national mental and medical health crisis, responsible for untold costs to society and severe suffering to innumerable people. Yet addiction treatment, as it is now practiced, fails half the time. The current treatment approach has changed little in the last 80 years and is a hodgepodge of often shady treatment approaches. This book presents a radically different addiction treatment paradigm, based on science, evidence and best practices, and has a success rate approaching 100% when followed closely. This model should profoundly upend the current addiction treatment industry. Nearly every addict lives in a social system--a family, workplace or community--that enables and supports, often unconsciously, the addict's addiction. Instead of the current addict-focused approach, this model extends treatment to the entire support system, starting treatment with the concerned family members. This model also proposes a single provider, the family recovery therapist, who manages treatment for the addict and the family from the first phone call through the first year of continuous sobriety. This book offers simple recommendations to both addiction treatment providers and family members impacted by this disease. It serves as a beacon of hope for families.",Psychology,340,N/A,0,en

The Power of Witnessing,"Nancy R. Goodman, Marilyn B. Meyers",Routledge,2012-08-21,"Witnessing comes in as many forms as the trauma that gives birth to it. The Holocaust, undeniably one of the greatest traumatic events in recent human history, still resonates into the twenty-first century. The echoes that haunt those who survived continue to reach their children and others who did not share the experience directly. In what ways is this massive trauma processed and understood, both for survivors and future generations? The answer, as deftly illustrated by Nancy Goodman and Marilyn Meyers, lies in the power of witnessing: the act of acknowledging that trauma took place, coupled with the desire to share that knowledge with others to build a space in which to reveal, confront, and symbolize it. As the contributors to this book demonstrate, testimonial writing and memoir, artwork, poetry, documentary, theater, and even the simple recollection of a memory are ways that honor and serve as forms of witnessing. Each chapter is a fusion of narrative and metaphor that exists as evidence of the living mind that emerges amid the dead spaces produced by mass trauma, creating a revelatory, transformational space for the terror of knowing and the possibility for affirmation of hope, courage, and endurance in the face of almost unspeakable evil. Additionally, the power of witnessing is extended from the Holocaust to contemporary instances of mass trauma and to psychoanalytic treatments, proving its efficacy in the dyadic relationship of everyday practice for both patient and analyst. The Holocaust is not an easy subject to approach, but the intimate and personal stories included here add up to an act of witnessing in and of itself, combining the past and the present and placing the trauma in the realm of knowing, sharing, and understanding.

Irish Children's Literature and Culture,"Keith O'Sullivan, Valerie Coghlan",Routledge,2011-03-17,"What constitutes a ‘national literature’ is rarely straightforward, and it is especially complex when discussing writing for young people in an Irish context. Until recently, there was only a slight body of work that could be classified as ‘Irish children’s literature’ (whatever the parameters) in comparison with Ireland’s contribution to adult literature in the twentieth century. This volume looks critically at Irish writing for children from the 1980s to the present, examining the work of many writers and illustrators and engaging with all the major forms and genres. Topics include the gothic, the speculative, picturebooks, poetry, post-colonial discourse, identity and ethnicity, and globalization. Modern Irish children’s literature is also contextualized in relation to Irish mythology and earlier writings, thereby demonstrating the complexity of this fascinating area. The contributors, who are leading experts in their fields, examine a range of texts in relation to contemporary literary and cultural theory, and also in relation to writing for adults, thereby inviting a consideration of how well writing for a young audience can compare with writing for an adult one. This groundbreaking work is essential reading for all interested in Irish literature, childhood, and children’s literature.",Literary Criticism,214,N/A,0,en

Amplifying the Curriculum,"Aída Walqui, George C. Bunch",Teachers College Press,2019,"This book presents an ambitious model for how educators can design high-quality, challenging, and supportive learning opportunities for English Learners and other students identified to be in need of language and literacy support. Starting with the premise that conceptual, analytic, and language practices develop simultaneously as students engage in disciplinary learning, the authors argue for instruction that amplifies—rather than simplifies—expectations, concepts, texts, and learning tasks. The authors offer clear guidance for designing lessons and units and provide examples that demonstrate the approach in various subject areas, including math, science, English, and social studies. This practical resource will guide teachers through the coherent design of tasks, lessons, and units of study that invite English Learners (and all students) to engage in productive, meaningful, and intellectually engaging activity. “This book offers the most detailed guide available for designing instruction for students categorized as ELLs.

Marriage and Modernization,Don S. Browning,Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing,2003-03-20,"The processes of modernization and globalization promise more wealth and health for many people. But they are also a threat to the stability and quality of marriage and family life. This new book -- at once sobering and constructive -- looks at the impact of these processes on marriage and asks what Christianity, in cooperation with other religions, can do to strengthen married life today. Among the deleterious effects of modernization and globalization on marriage are a worldwide drift of men away from the responsibility of parenthood and the tendency of mothers too readily to take on the task of childrearing alone. After looking at recent research on these and other problems, Don Browning suggests that the cure for modern marital disruption entails reforming and reconstructing the institution of marriage while also nurturing relevant forms of social support. Yet the effort to initiate a ""world marriage revival"" requires a complex cultural work, and Browning explores the key contributions that the religions of the world must make for such an effort to be successful.",Family & Relationships,276,N/A,0,en
Asian American Sexual Politics,Rosalind S. Chou,Rowman & Littlefield,2012,"Asian American Sexual Politics explores the topics of beauty, self-esteem, and sexual attraction among Asian Americans. The book draws on sixty in-depth interviews to show how constructions of Asian American gender and sexuality tend to reinforce the social and political dominance for whites, particularly white males, even in the supposed ""post-racial"" United States. Drawing on established scholarship on the intersection of race, gender, and sexuality, Asian American Sexual Politics shows how power dynamics shape the lives of young Asian Americans today. Asian American women are often constructed as hyper-sexual docile bodies, while Asian American men are often racially ""castrated."" The book's interview excerpts show the range of frames through which Asian Americans approach the world, as well as the counter-frames they construct. In the final chapter, author Rosalind S. Chou offers strategies for countering racialized and sexualized oppression. This provocative book shows how persistent racism affects Asian American body image, self-esteem, and intimate relationships.",Social Science,216,N/A,0,en

"I Hurt, Therefore I Am",Jon Garate,Xlibris Corporation,2007-12-28,"Back in the early 1600s, Rene Descartes, the father of modern philosophy was struggling with the meaning of life, and wondering if he really existed, or if he was just some kind of awareness fl oating around in the universe. He fi nally resolved that he really did exist. His proof was stated, I think, therefore I am. Too bad for him there werent any old time cowboys around yet, or they could have saved him all that soul searching. Very early in the life of a cowboy, as he picks himself up out of a pile of rocks after being bucked off his horse, he knows for absolute certain of his existence. In the words of author and old time cowboy, Jon Garate, I HURT, THEREFORE I AM. Who would ever believe that growing up as a wild cowboy in the Old West would nurture the developing mind of a self-made philosopher?

Here's the Deal,Kellyanne Conway,Simon and Schuster,2022-05-24,"Among the Trump era’s savviest insiders, one name stands especially tall: Kellyanne. As a highly respected pollster for corporate and Republican clients and a frequent television talk show guest, Kellyanne Conway had already established herself as one of the brightest lights on the national political scene when Donald Trump asked her to run his presidential campaign. She agreed, delivering him to the White House, becoming the first woman in American history to manage a winning presidential campaign, and changing the American landscape forever. Who she is, how she did it, and who tried to stop her is a fascinating story of personal triumph and political intrigue that has never been told…until now. In Here’s The Deal, Kellyanne takes you on a journey all the way to the White House and beyond with her trademark sharp wit, raw honesty, and level eye. It’s all here: what it’s like to be dissected on national television. How to outsmart the media mob. How to outclass the crazy critics. How to survive and succeed male-dominated industries. What happens when the perils of social media really hit home. And what happens when the divisions across the country start playing out in one’s own family. In this open and vulnerable account, Kellyanne turns the camera on herself. What she has to share—about our politics, about the media, about her time in the White House, and about her personal journey—is an astonishing glimpse of visibility and vulnerability, of professional and personal highs and lows, and ultimately, of triumph.",Biography & Autobiography,512,N/A,0,en

The stories document a journey of a growing intimacy with God and discovery that there can be a life of abundant peace and joy after a life-changing disappointment when we surrender our will to God and allow him to be our shepherd. For those who have been fortunate enough to not have experienced deep pain and loss, it is hoped that the pages will help you to strengthen your faith or be used as a tool to help others. The pages of this book represent a collection of inspirational stories, some which are considered more than coincidental events that document the development of personal faith and relationship with God. These were experienced during emotionally painful and life-changing events. The bird itself came as a message or symbol of hope and peace one evening after crying out to God.

Legalizing LGBT Families,"Amanda K. Baumle, D'Lane R. Compton",NYU Press,2017-11,"In-depth interviews examine the role of the law in the lives of LGBT parents The decision to have a child is seldom a simple one, often fraught with complexities regarding emotional readiness, finances, marital status, and compatibility with life and career goals. Rarely, though, do individuals consider the role of the law in facilitating or inhibiting their ability to have a child or to parent. For LGBT individuals, however, parenting is saturated with legality - including the initial decision of whether to have a child, how to have a child, whether one's relationship with their child will be recognized, and everyday acts of parenting. Through interviews with 137 LGBT parents, Amanda K. Baumle and D'Lane R. Compton examine the role of the law in the lives of LGBT parents and how individuals use the law when making decisions about family formation or parenting. Baumle and Compton explore the ways in which LGBT parents participate in the process of constructing legality through accepting, modifying, or rejecting legal meanings about their families. They conclude that legality is constructed through a complex interplay of legal context, social networks, individual characteristics, and familial desires. Ultimately, the stories of LGBT parents in this book reflect a rich and varied relationship between the law, the state, and the private family goals of individuals.",Family & Relationships,309,N/A,0,en

The narration of the cases also offers reader tips about good practices among the Asian families such as effective family governance mechanism, development of innovation and entrepreneurial mindsets across generations, importance of family culture.

While mobile communication diffuses through Asia at a blistering pace, families in the region are also experiencing significant changes in light of unprecedented economic growth, globalisation, urbanisation and demographic shifts. Asia is therefore at the crossroads of technological transformation and social change.

Straight to the Point,Julie Leibrich,Otago University Press,1993,"""Based on interviews with randomly selected former offenders, this book takes a fresh look at the course and nature of crime. It cuts across theorising, trying to understand what people actually experience, why they do what they do, and to get a picture of successful change."" ""As the Justice Department's Centennial Fellow, Dr Leibrich tracked down fifty offenders who had been sentenced to supervision in 1987 and not reoffended three years later. She asked them why not. The people who participated in the interviews did so because they wanted to, and their stories make this a moving piece of research."" ""The author soon found that 'going straight' was 'curved' - that the people she interviewed did not fall into such neat categories as 'straight' and 'crooked'. Her methodology (which she describes in detail in the appendices) needed to grapple with the many subtleties of her material and drew on different kinds of research strategies, utilising their strengths. In an exciting account of her approach to problem-solving on the basis of trial and error, and intuition, the reader gains insight into the personal experience of the research process, the pitfalls and highlights, the frustration and anxiety of data collection - 'Will I find Trinity? Is the guy I'm going to meet really okay? Do I include people who have reoffended? Does my write-up reflect people's real experience?' The result, this book, is tight and rigorous in its analysis, but does justice to the richness and warmth of the data, valuing the words and actions of the people who participated in the study.""--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Normal Family,Chrysta Bilton,Hachette UK,2022-07-12,"This riveting, nuanced memoir about unforgettable individuals thrown together by chance and DNA tells a story of nature, nurture, and coming to terms with one's true inheritance. What is a “normal family,” and how do you go about making one? Chrysta Bilton’s magnetic, larger-than-life mother, Debra, yearned to have a child, but as a single gay woman in 1980s California, she had few options. Until one day, while getting her hair done in a Beverly Hills salon, she met a man and instantly knew he was the one she’d been looking for. Beautiful, athletic, artistic, and from a well-to-do family, Jeffrey Harrison appeared to be Debra’s ideal sperm donor. A verbal agreement, a couple of thousand in cash, and a few squirts of a turkey baster later, and Chrysta was conceived. Over the years, Jeffrey would make regular appearances at the family home, which grew to include Chrysta’s baby sister. But how much did Debra really know about the man she’d chosen to father her daughters? And as a single mother torn between ferocious independence and abject dependence—on other women, alcohol, drugs, and the adrenaline of get-rich-quick schemes—what secrets of her own was she keeping? It wasn’t until Chrysta was a young adult that she discovered just how much her parents had hidden from their daughters—and each other—including a shocking revelation with far-reaching consequences not only for Debra, Chrysta, and her sister, but for dozens and possibly hundreds of unsuspecting families across the country. After a lifetime of longing for a “normal family,” can Chrysta face the reality of her own, in all its complexity? Bringing us into the fold of a deeply dysfunctional yet fiercely loving clan that is anything but “normal,” this emotional roller coaster of a memoir will make you cry, laugh, and rethink the meaning of family.

Family Instructions for the Yan Clan and Other Works by Yan Zhitui (531–590s),Xiaofei Tian,Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG,2021-03-08,"Yan Zhitui (531–590s) was a courtier and cultural luminary who lived a colourful life during one of the most chaotic periods, known as the Northern and Southern Dynasties, in Chinese history. Beginning his career in the southern Liang court, he was taken captive to the north after the Liang capital fell, and served several northern dynasties. Today he remains one of the best-known medieval writers for his book-length “family instructions” (jiaxun), the earliest surviving and the most influential of its kind. Completed in his last years, the work resembles a long letter addressed to his sons, in which he discusses a wide range of topics from family relations and remarriage to religious faith, philology, cultural arts, and codes of conduct in public and private life. It is filled with vivid details of contemporary social life, and with the author’s keen observations of the mores of north and south China. This is a new, complete translation into English, with critical notes and introduction, and based on recent scholarship, of Yan Zhitui’s Family Instructions, and of all of his extant literary works, including his self-annotated poetic autobiography and a never-before-translated fragmentary rhapsody, as well as of his biographies in dynastic histories.",Literary Criticism,630,N/A,0,en

In contrast to that individually oriented approach, this volume explores the importance of family-oriented approaches to informed consent for medical treatment and clinical research. It draws on both East Asian moral resources as well as a critical response to the ways in which the practice of informed consent has developed in the United States",Philosophy,281,N/A,0,en

Neoliberal Morality in Singapore,Youyenn Teo,Routledge,2013-11-11,"Using the case study of Singapore, this book examines the production of a set of institutionalized relationships and ethical meanings that link citizens to each other and the state. It looks at how questions of culture and morality are resolved, and how state-society relations are established that render paradoxes and inequalities acceptable, and form the basis of a national political culture. The Singapore government has put in place a number of policies to encourage marriage and boost fertility that has attracted much attention, and are often taken as evidence that the Singapore state is a social engineer. The book argues that these policies have largely failed to reverse demographic trends, and reveals that the effects of the policies are far more interesting and significant. As Singaporeans negotiate various rules and regulations, they form a set of ties to each other and to the state. These institutionalized relationships and shared meanings, referred to as neoliberal morality, render particular ideals about family natural. Based on extensive field work, the book is a useful contribution to studies on Asian Culture and Society, Globalisation, as well as Development Studies.",Political Science,214,N/A,0,en

"Memory, Family, and Self",Giovanni Ciappelli,BRILL,2014-04-10,"The family book, a kind of diary written by and about the family for its various members, was established by scholars as a genre in Italy in the 1980s. Although initially regarded as an Italian genre, the family book can also be found in other parts of Europe. Nevertheless, the genre can be traced back to Florence, where it first emerged and consequently flourished with the lavish production of such documents. This abundance springs from the social structure of the city, where such texts were essential for establishing and cultivating the basis for the social promotion of Florentine families. This book presents a reconstruction of the evolution and persistency of Tuscan family books, as well as a study of several aspects of social history, including: reading and private libraries, domestic devotion, and the memory of historical events. Starting with the Renaissance, the investigation then broadens to the 17th-18th centuries and considers other forms of memory, such as private diaries and autobiographies. A final section is dedicated to the issue of memory in the egodocuments of early modern Europe. This book was translated by Susan Amanda George.",History,321,N/A,0,en

Todays parents are challenged by the need to invent their own parenting style. This can only happen from within, based on our personal values and boundaries. Jesper Juul puts it very clearly: The love we feel for our children and our partners does not in itself have any value. It has no value at all until it is converted into loving behavior. Each chapter focuses on the values that form a solid platform on which to build a family: Equal dignity, Integrity, Authenticity and Responsibility. This makes family life more meaningful and parents avoid living frantically from conflict to conflict, desperately searching for quick solutions and trying to adapt to the most popular parenting technique of the day.

The Family Office,"William I. Woodson, Edward V. Marshall",Columbia University Press,2021-08-10,"Family offices are private organizations that assume the daily administration and management of a wealthy family’s personal and financial affairs. Historically, these repositories of great wealth were shrouded in secrecy, their activities conducted behind closed doors. Recently, family offices have acquired a considerably higher public profile: they represent a mere 7 percent of the world’s ultra-high-net-worth population—yet control a staggering 50 percent of the wealth. As only a select few families now hold a disproportionate amount of global wealth, there are significant social implications to how such assets are managed and used. This book provides an insider’s view for anyone looking to understand family offices and how to best serve and advise them. The veteran practitioners William I. Woodson and Edward V. Marshall offer a thorough guide to family offices: why wealthy families create them, what they do, and how to manage them effectively. They present these insights through a series of problem-based learning cases that follow a single family’s journey from the time of a significant liquidity event; through the creation, staffing, and management of their family office; and on to its succession. Each case study is supported by detailed background reference material. The cases and background materials are drawn from the authors’ practical knowledge, network of industry experts, and experience advising family offices large and small. They shed light on the unique issues that ultrawealthy families face and the solutions they adopt to address them throughout the life cycle of a family office. This book is the definitive resource for practitioners and students, as well as family principals, advisers, service providers, and all others who engage with the world of family offices.",Business & Economics,335,N/A,0,en
Family Multinationals,"Christina Lubinski, Jeffrey Fear, Paloma Fernández Pérez",Routledge,2013-07-18,"In contrast to widespread assessments that family enterprises lack sufficient resources and capabilities to go global, many family companies are competing successfully in an increasingly globalized business environment. Worldwide, a large number of thriving multinationals are still family-owned and/or under family control. While there is abundant literature on the phenomenon of globalization from many different disciplines, neither the literature on multinationals nor the growing field of family business studies have systematically investigated family multinationals yet. This volume is one of the first to deal explicitly with family multinationals and the role of the family in internationalization. It situates itself at the crossroads of internationalization studies on the one hand and family business research on the other. Why do families continue to play such a large role in some of the most prominent firms in emerging and mature economies? How did they manage to maintain ownership control, yet divest of unrelated business ventures? How did they internationalize yet maintain control? This book identifies the idiosyncratic strategies and structures of family multinationals in different countries and at different points in time. A comparative historical and case study approach allows us to explore the role of the family through the firms’ various internationalization pathways and understand long-term developments and path dependencies.",Business & Economics,311,N/A,0,en
Economics of the Family,"Martin Browning, Pierre-André Chiappori, Yoram Weiss",Cambridge University Press,2014-06-05,"The family is a complex decision unit in which partners with potentially different objectives make consumption, work and fertility decisions. Couples marry and divorce partly based on their ability to coordinate these activities, which in turn depends on how well they are matched. This book provides a comprehensive, modern and self-contained account of the research in the growing area of family economics. The first half of the book develops several alternative models of family decision making. Particular attention is paid to the collective model and its testable implications. The second half discusses household formation and dissolution and who marries whom. Matching models with and without frictions are analyzed and the important role of within-family transfers is explained. The implications for marriage, divorce and fertility are discussed.

In this book, she conducts a comparative analysis of two pairs of intercultural and two pairs of intracultural films, each chapter highlighting a different dimension of remakes, and illustrating how changes in gender representations can highlight not just differences in attitudes towards gender across cultures, but also broader concerns relating to culture, genre, auteurism, politics and temporality.",Performing Arts,167,N/A,0,en

But the reality of their experiences is often harsh, and structural barriers—particularly those rooted in immigration policies and gender inequities—prevent many from reaching their economic goals. Sacrificing Families offers a first-hand look at Salvadoran transnational families, how the parents fare in the United States, and the experiences of the children back home. It captures the tragedy of these families' daily living arrangements, but also delves deeper to expose the structural context that creates and sustains patterns of inequality in their well-being. What prevents these parents from migrating with their children? What are these families' experiences with long-term separation? And why do some ultimately fare better than others? As free trade agreements expand and nation-states open doors widely for products and profits while closing them tightly for refugees and migrants, these transnational families are not only becoming more common, but they are living through lengthier separations. Leisy Abrego gives voice to these immigrants and their families and documents the inequalities across their experiences.",Social Science,269,N/A,0,en

"Trivial Grievances: on the Contradictions, Myths and Misery of Your 30s",Bridie Jabour,N/A,2021-07-07,"An oddly optimistic, witty and insightful generation-defining book for a lost generation, the miserable Millennials, from Bridie Jabour, opinion editor at Guardian Australia In the last days of 2019, journalist Bridie Jabour wrote a piece for The Guardian about the malaise of 31 year-old millennials and how the painful, protracted end of their adolescence is finally hitting home; they're hitting their thirties and the vast majority are neither famous, award-winning or rich -and that's making them miserable. The article went viral overnight, the response from readers was overwhelming, and Bridie decided the time had come to write a book about her generation - those much-maligned millenials. After all, she reasoned, this generation is coming of age in a fairly unique set of social and economic circumstances, including precarious work, delayed baby-making, rising singledom, a pandemic, a heating planet, loss of religion and increased unstable housing. But much to her surprise, despite her assumption that this generation of 31-year-olds is the most miserable ever, she discovered that wasn't the whole truth... Forthright, funny, incisive, provocative and insightful, Trivial Grievances is truly a book for our times, and for every twenty or thirty-something anxious about their place in the world.",,288,N/A,0,en

"Family Issues on Marriage, Divorce, and Older Adults in Japan",Fumie Kumagai,Springer,2014-10-14,"This book provides insightful sociological analyses of Japanese demography and families, paying attention not only to national average data, but also to regional variations and community level analyses. In analyzing Japanese family issues such as demographic changes, courtship and marriage, international marriage, divorce, late-life divorce, and the elderly living alone, this book emphasizes the significance of two theoretical frameworks: the dual structure and regional variations of the community network in Japan. By emphasizing the extensive cultural diversity from one region to another, this book represents a paradigm shift from former studies of Japanese families, which relied mostly on national average data. The method of analysis adopted in the study is qualitative, with a historical perspective. The book is thus an invitation to more in-depth, qualitative dialogue in the field of family sociology in Japan. This book will be of great interest not only to Asian scholars, but also to other specialists in comparative family studies around the world.",Social Science,201,N/A,0,en

Successful Family Language Policy,"Mila Schwartz, Anna Verschik",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-12-12,"This book presents the forefront of research in the emerging field of family language policy. This is the first volume to explore the link between family language policy, practice and management in the light of state and community language policy in more than 20 ethno-linguistic communities worldwide. Contributions by leading scholars from eight countries and three continents offer insights in how family language policy might be interpreted from various theoretical perspectives, using innovative methodologies. In particular, the authors present novel data on successful family language practices such as faith-related literacy activities and homework sessions, as well as management, including prayer, choice of bilingual education, and links with mainstream and complementary learning, which permit the realization of language ideology within three contexts: immigrant families, inter-marriage families, and minority and majority families in conflict-ridden societies.",Education,296,N/A,0,en

Family Literacies,"Rachael Levy, Mel Hall",Routledge,2021-04-19,"Family Literacies demonstrates, through reference to empirical research, how shared reading practices operate in a wide range of families, with a view to supporting families in reading with their pre-school children. At the heart of this book, written by two highly experienced experts in the field, is a fascinating project that captured diverse voices, and experiences by parents, children and other family members. Rachael Levy and Mel Hall deploy a rich and distinctive theoretical framework, drawing on insights from literacy studies, education and sociology. Family Literacies presents an account of shared reading practices in homes, focusing attention on what motivates parents to read with their children as well as revealing what parents may need if they are to begin and sustain shared reading activity. The authors show the many ways in which reading is centrally embedded in many aspects of family life, arguing that this has particular implications for children as they start school. Situated within a socio-cultural discourse, this book explains why it is important to understand how and why shared reading takes place in homes so that all families can be supported in reading with their children. Family Literacies is essential reading for all those who are studying and researching literacy practices, especially those involving young children. The book will also be of value to students, practitioners and researchers in education and applied linguistics who are working with families and have an interest in the study of family practices. The authors’ findings have major implications for how parents can be encouraged to develop positive reading relationships with their children.",Language Arts & Disciplines,179,N/A,0,en

Television Families,William Douglas,Routledge,2003-02-26,"This volume examines the analysis that was designed to map the development of the television family and assess its current state and, at the same time, to provide insight into the tangled relationships between fictional and real family life. In order to do this, the investigation examines the evolution of the American family, paying special attention to the postwar family, which is not only used recurrently as a benchmark for assessing the performance of modern families but also constituted television's first generation of families. The investigation also traces the evolution of the popular family in vaudeville, comics, and radio. However, the primary focus of the examination is the development of the television family, from families, such as the Nelsons, Andersons, and Cleavers, to more contemporary families, such as the Huxtables, Conners, and Taylors. The unit of analysis for the investigation is the relationship rather than the individual. Hence, the book deals with the portrayal of spousal, parent-child, and sibling relationships and how those portrayals differ across time and across groups defined by ethnicity, gender, and age. Moreover, the relational analysis is expansive so that television family relationships are examined in regard to power and affect, performance, and satisfaction and stability. Television Families provides a thorough summary and critical review of extant research, designed to promote informed classroom discussion. At the same time, it advances a number of hypotheses and recommendations and, as such, is intended to influence subsequent theory and research in the area. The book is intended for senior undergraduate students, graduate students, and television and family researchers.",History,206,N/A,0,en
Pyzaono Brothers,Joan P. Lloyd,AuthorHouse,2005-12,"A young girl's loss and sorrow leads her to a life she could never imagine. How can so much pain bring happiness? As Nelly goes through life, she learns what love and happiness are. After the loss of her father, she decides to move to New York to live with her Aunt. On that journey she meets a man that shows her what it means to be loved. Shortly after their marriage, Base Morgan was killed and Nelly didn't have time to tell him he was to be a father How could this keep happening to her? However, this tragedy would bring her to an ultimate love affair that would consume her and yet lift her to the realms of her dreams when she meets the man who would dedicate his life to her, secretly. Joe Barnatelli knew, the moment he first laid eyes on her, that she had to be in his life. He knew he needed to see her, to be near her, to hear her voice. He employed her, and shared his love. Nelly gave him her son. Joe took the baby as his own, although he carried the name of his father J'Dee Morgan. For Nelly and Joe, not to share love, not to make love would be the most difficult thing they would have to do. As the years went by they tried not to show any affection because Joe's life was complicated. He was married to Alicee and married to a family' in Brooklyn; which supposedly was to run its businesses alongside Joe's many enterprises. As much as he tried to stay away, problems would come up and as they arose, Joe dealt with them. There were attempts on his life. Men tried to destroy his family and his businesses. Meanwhile, Joe wanted to live a quiet life which seemed impossible to achieve. With J'Dee and his brothers, the Pyzaono's, growing into men and with the friends he had made along the way, Joe became more powerful and the family' in Brooklyn became more concerned. The Brooklyn Don waited until the time was right. He had a plan. He'd turned the tables on Joe by using more kindness, to lure him closer. Don Cello's wanted his plan to work so badly that he took a trip to Italy and invited Joe to travel with him. But Don Cello was in for a surprise. And you'll be too.",Fiction,485,N/A,0,en

It is difficult to overstate the evolutionary and functional significance of mammary tissue in biology. Substantial progress has been made by researchers in various disciplines, particularly over the last fifteen years, towards realizing the potential of this tissue to yield powerful experimental models for morphogenesis and tissue development; for cellular differentiation; for the biosynthesis and secretion of proteins, lipids, small molecules and inorganic salts; and for the coordination and regulation of these processes. More recently, the possibility of exploiting the secretory epithelial cells of mammary tissue as `cell factories' has become a reality and the recombinant production by lactating animals of an increasing number of proteins, valuable both in the pharmaceutical and `nutraceutical' fields, is in progress or under development. Also in this sphere of agricultural production, genetic as well as nutritional technologies are under investigation and exploitation to optimize milk composition for various end-uses - for instance in food process and manufacture. The possibilities of deriving health benefit from the bioactive properties of some of the minor constituents of milk are emerging to counter the highly-publicized negative health impact of excessive consumption of saturated animal fats. In human nutrition and medicine, the mammary gland is both a source of nutrition to the neonate and a potential health threat to the adult female - breast cancer remains the major single cause of female mortality in most developed countries.

Cellular and Molecular Biology of Intermediate Filaments,"R.D. Goldman, P.M. Steinert",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-06-29,"Research activity on intermediate filaments (IF) has increased dramatically over the past decade. For the most part, this surge of interest is due to their identification as ubiquitous constituents of the cytoskeleton and karyoskeleton (nuclear matrix) of eukaryotic cells and the fact that we know very little regarding their functions. In sharp contrast to the other major cytoskeletal systems, microfilaments and microtubules, IF exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity with regard to their protein subunit composition. Indeed, one can only marvel at the number of different IF polypeptides, their associated proteins (IFAP) and, consequently, the number of genes involved in encoding the multiple constituents of the various IF networks found in different cell types. The chapters in this book demonstrate how various experimental approaches involv ing cellular, molecular, biochemical, and immunological methods have been utilized to generate information regarding the structure and function of IF. To this end, we have gathered together chapters from experts in the major fields of IF research. In each chapter, the authors have combined reviews of the available scientific literature with their own ideas on current and future directions for IF research. The chapters have been divided into five major sections which are concerned with the subcellular organization of IF, the molecular structure of IF, the differential expression of IF genes, descriptions of associ ated proteins involved in the intracellular organization of IF, and finally an analysis of the changes seen in IF in pathological conditions.",Science,483,N/A,0,en

Transmembrane Signaling Protocols,"Hydar Ali, Haribabu Bodduluri",Springer Science & Business Media,2008-02-05,"The previous edition of Transmembrane Signaling Protocols was published in 1998. Since then the human genome has been completely sequenced and new methods have been developed for the use of microarrays and proteomics to analyze global changes in gene expression and protein profiles. These advances have increased our ability to understand transmembrane signaling processes in much greater detail. They have also simultaneously enhanced our ability to determine the role of a large number of newly identified molecules in signaling events. In addition, novel video microscopy methods have been developed to image transmembrane signaling events in live cells in real time. In view of these major advances, it is time to update the previous edition. Because of the success of that volume, we have chosen to keep the essential character of the book intact. Introductory chapters from experts have been included to provide overall perspective and an overview of recent advances in signal transduction pathways. The individual chapters now include comp- hensive detailed methods, studies in genetically tractable systems, fluorescence microscopy in live single cells, ex vivo analysis of primary cells from tra- genic mice, as well as genomic and proteomic approaches to the analysis of transmembrane signaling events.

A plethora of results known to be true in the Sacks model easily follow from CPA. Replacing iterated forcing arguments with deductions from CPA simplifies proofs, provides deeper insight, and leads to new results. One may say that CPA is similar in nature to Martin's axiom, as both capture the essence of the models of ZFC in which they hold.

Analysis of Biological Data,Sanghamitra Bandyopadhyay,World Scientific,2007,"Bioinformatics, a field devoted to the interpretation and analysis of biological data using computational techniques, has evolved tremendously in recent years due to the explosive growth of biological information generated by the scientific community. Soft computing is a consortium of methodologies that work synergistically and provides, in one form or another, flexible information processing capabilities for handling real-life ambiguous situations. Several research articles dealing with the application of soft computing tools to bioinformatics have been published in the recent past; however, they are scattered in different journals, conference proceedings and technical reports, thus causing inconvenience to readers, students and researchers. This book, unique in its nature, is aimed at providing a treatise in a unified framework, with both theoretical and experimental results, describing the basic principles of soft computing and demonstrating the various ways in which they can be used for analyzing biological data in an efficient manner. Interesting research articles from eminent scientists around the world are brought together in a systematic way such that the reader will be able to understand the issues and challenges in this domain, the existing ways of tackling them, recent trends, and future directions. This book is the first of its kind to bring together two important research areas, soft computing and bioinformatics, in order to demonstrate how the tools and techniques in the former can be used for efficiently solving several problems in the latter.

On Earth we feel more separated from each other, and “THE” (God or source), than at any other place in the universe. This illusion creates fear. There is no greater hell than the one we create here, on earth” “How is earth different than other realms?” J’s answer: “Each realm is different and as you use less empathy and telepathy they become more difficult. Earth is the most difficult and hardest place to be, so you must take classes before you’re allowed to enter into a realm. The events and emotions on earth also go from passion to despair.

Unwanted platelet activation and arterial thombus formation are, however, implicated in the onset of myocardial infarction, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases. Acceptance that platelets play a major role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis including coronary heart disease has revolutionized the pharmacological treatment of cardiovascular diseases, and aspirin is now an essential antiplatelet drug and the golden standard for future developments. Yet the search for better and perhaps safer antiplatelet drugs is one of the most active areas of investigation in both basic and clinical research. Platelets, especially human platelets, have also emerged as one of the major models for the study of inter- and intracellular signal transduction pathways. Many biochemists, cell biologists, pharmacologists, pathologists, hematologists, and cardiologists find platelets useful for studying processes such as adhesion, inside-out and outside-in signalling through the plasma membrane, channels, calcium homeostasis, protein kinases, the network of intracellular signal transduction cascades, and the release of vasoactive substances. The aim of the editors has been to compile chapters summarizing the current state-of-the-art information on the biochemistry, cell biology, pharmacology, and physiologic and pathophysiologic roles of human platelets.

This book provides a comprehensive overview of ion channel structure and function. It comprises two major parts. Part one is an introductory overview of the ion channel superfamily and the generic aspects of ion channel function. This part also reviews the methodologies by which ion channel function can be studied from the perspective of performing detailed biophysical characterization through to the deployment of high throughput approaches for identifying novel ion channel ligands. Part two of the book provides an in-depth review of the individual ion channel subfamilies and, as such, is subdivided into four broad sections: Voltage-Gated Ion Channels, Extracellular Ligand-Gated Ion Channels, Intracellular Ligand-Gated Ion Channels, and Polymodal-Gated Ion Channels, with each chapter focused on specific family members.

Wild Immunology—The Answers Are Out There,"Gregory M. Woods, Andrew S. Flies",Frontiers Media SA,2019-03-20,"“Go into partnership with nature; she does more than half the work and asks none of the fee.” - Martin H. Fisher. Nature has undertaken an immense amount of work throughout evolution. The evolutionary process has provided a power of information that can address key questions such as - Which immune molecules and pathways are conserved across species? Which molecules and pathways are exploited by pathogens to cause disease? What methods can be broadly used or readily adapted for wild immunology? How does co-infection and exposure to a dynamic environment affect immunity? Section 1 addresses these questions through an evolutionary approach. Laboratory mice have been instrumental in dissecting the nuances of the immune system. The first paper investigates the immunology of wild mice and reviews how evolution and ecology sculpt differences in the immune responses of wild mice and laboratory mice. A better understanding of wild immunology is required and sets the scene for the subsequent papers. Although nature doesn't ask for a fee, it is appropriate that nature is repaid in one form or another. The translational theme of the second section incorporates papers that translate wild immunology back to nature. But any non-human, non-laboratory mouse research environment is hindered by a lack of research tools, hence the underlying theme throughout the second section. Physiological resource allocation is carefully balanced according to the most important needs of the body. Tissue homeostasis can involve trade-offs between energy requirements of the host and compensatory mechanisms to respond to infection. The third section comprises a collection of papers that employ novel strategies to understand how the immune system is compensated under challenging physiological situations. Technology has provided substantial advances in understanding the immune system at cellular and molecular levels. The specificity of these tools (e.g. monoclonal antibodies) often limits the study to a specific species or strain. A consequence of similar genetic sequences or cross-reactivity is that the technology can be adapted to wild species. Section 4 provides two examples of probing wild immunology by adapting technology developed for laboratory species.",,191,N/A,0,en

Plant Omics: Trends and Applications,"Khalid Rehman Hakeem, Hüseyin Tombuloğlu, Güzin Tombuloğlu",Springer,2016-08-23,"To comprehend the organizational principle of cellular functions at diff erent levels, an integrative approach with large-scale experiments, the so-called ‘omics’ data including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, is needed. Omics aims at the collective characterization and quantifi cation of pools of biological molecules that translate into the structure, function, and dynamics of an organism or organisms. Currently, omics is an essential tool to understand the molecular systems that underlie various plant functions. Furthermore, in several plant species, the development of omicsresources has progressed to address the particular biological properties of individual species. Integration of knowledge from omics-based research is an emerging issue as researchers seek to identify significance, gain biological insights and promote translational research. From these perspectives, we intend to provide the emerging aspects of plant systems research based on omics and bioinformatics analyses together with their associated resources and technological advances. Th e present book covers a wide range of omics topics, and discusses the latest trends and application area of plant sciences. In this volume, we have highlighted the working solutions as well as open problems and future challenges in plant omics studies. We believe that this book will initiate and introduce readers to state-of-the-art developments and trends in omics-driven research.",Science,522,N/A,0,en

Preserving Family Recipes,Valerie J. Frey,University of Georgia Press,2015-11-01,"Heirloom dishes and family food traditions are rich sources of nostalgia and provide vivid ways to learn about our families’ past, yet they can be problematic. Many family recipes and food traditions are never documented in written or photographic form, existing only as unwritten know-how and lore that vanishes when a cook dies. Even when recipes are written down, they often fail to give the tricks and tips that would allow another cook to accurately replicate the dish. Unfortunately, recipes are also often damaged as we plunk Grandma’s handwritten cards on the countertop next to a steaming pot or a spattering mixer, shortening their lives. This book is a guide for gathering, adjusting, supplementing, and safely preserving family recipes and for interviewing relatives, collecting oral histories, and conducting kitchen visits to document family food traditions from the everyday to special occasions. It blends commonsense tips with sound archival principles, helping you achieve effective results while avoiding unnecessary pitfalls. Chapters are also dedicated to unfamiliar regional or ethnic cooking challenges, as well as to working with recipes that are “orphans,” surrogates, or terribly outdated. Whether you simply want to save a few accurate recipes, help yesterday’s foodways evolve so they are relevant for today’s table, or create an extensive family cookbook, this guidebook will help you to savor your memories.",Cooking,304,N/A,0,en

The Adolescent in the Family,"Patricia Noller, Victor Callan",Routledge,2015-12-22,"Adolescence can be a difficult time for all concerned. Issues such as high youth unemployment, sexual behaviour and drug abuse have made it a matter of great concern for the community at large, whether as parents, politicians or those working with adolescents in education and welfare. In addition, many parents fear that these problems could affect their own families. Originally published in 1991, the authors explore the complex needs of adolescents emphasising the importance of the family environment in helping adolescents cope with the many difficulties and changes they face during this period of their lives. The central theme is that adolescents, through conflict and negotiation, establish new but different relationships with their parents, relationships that can endure for a lifetime. The authors provide wide coverage of the key issues of adolescence, such as identity, separation from the family, and conflict, and look closely at the difficulties produced by events such as the divorce and re-marriage of parents, and social problems such as long-term unemployment. With its positive approach to the family and adolescents, this clear, concise and helpful book will be invaluable both to parents and to the many professionals whose work involves them with adolescents.",Psychology,185,N/A,0,en

Receptor and Ion-channel Trafficking,"Stephen John Moss, Jeremy Henley",N/A,2002,"A volume in the Molecular and Cellular Neurobiology series. This book reviews the recent advances in our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that control the assembly, transport, targeting and anchoring of the protein complexes making up the most important ion channels and receptor families, fundamental to synaptic function. Improved understanding of these processes is expected to reveal novel therapeutic targets relevant to a range of disease states. The first section of the book contains three chapters dealing with cation channels and provides an accessible, succinct and comprehensive account of what is known about the structures and the assembly and targeting of these multimeric proteins. The focus of the book then moves on to cover ligand-gated ion channels with two chapters on accetylcholine receptors. The final section of the book contains four chapters covering the excitatory and inhibitory amino acid receptors. Receptor and Ion-Channel Trafficking provides an integrated overview of the significant recent advances in the field of molecular neurobiology and will be essential reading for all researchers in neuroscience, neurobiology, biochemistry, cellular and molecular biology.",Medical,250,N/A,0,en

"Marriage, Work, and Family Life in Comparative Perspective","Noriko O. Tsuya, Larry L. Bumpass",University of Hawaii Press,2003-12-31,"When we compare Eastern and Western societies, we find similar economic and social forces at work. But the impact of these on family life reflects differences in cultural history and social context. This volume examines family change in Korea, Japan, and the United States, allowing us to contrast the collective emphasis of a Confucian social heritage with the individualism of the West. An impressive group of demographers and family sociologists considers such questions as: How do family patterns vary within countries and across societies? How essential are marriage and parenthood? How do levels of contact between middle-aged adults and their parents who live elsewhere differ in East Asian countries and the U.S.? How does female employment vary based on family factors and do these factors affect employment across societies? Policy makers and demographic and family researchers both in the U.S. and Asia will find this book a vital resource for understanding the dynamics of family life in contrasting modern societies.

"Gender, Generations and the Family in International Migration","Albert Kraler, Eleonore Kofman, Martin Kohli, Camille Schmoll",Amsterdam University Press,2011,"""Family-related migration is moving to the centre of political debates on migration, integration and multiculturalism in Europe. It is also more and more leading to lively academic interest in the family dimensions of international migration. At the same time, strands of research on family migrations and migrant families remain separate from--and sometimes ignorant of--each other. This volume seeks to bridge the disciplinary divides. Fifteen chapters come up with a number of common themes. Collectively, the authors address the need to better understand the diversity of family-related migration and its resulting family forms and practices, to question, if not counter, simplistic assumptions about migrant families in public discourses, to study family migration from a mix of disciplinary perspectives at various levels and via different methodological approaches and to acknowledge the state's role in shaping family-related migration, practices and lives""--Rear cover.",Political Science,804,N/A,0,en

Women and Muslim Family Laws in Arab States,Lynn Welchman,Amsterdam University Press,2007,"A number of Arab states have recently either codified Muslim family law for the first time, or have issued amendments or new laws which significantly impact the statutory rights of women as wives, mothers and daughters. In Women and Muslim Family Laws in Arab States Lynn Welchman examines women's rights in Muslim family laws in Arab states across the Middle East while also surveying the public debates surrounding the issues. The author considers these new laws alongside older statutes to comment on the patterns and dynamics of change both in the texts of the laws, and in the processes through by which they are drafted and issued. She draws on original legal texts and explanatory statements as well as on extensive secondary literature particular to certain states for an insight into practice, and on; interventions by women's rights organizations and other parties to the debate in the press and in advocacy materials. The discussions are set in the contemporary global context that 'internationalises' the domestic and regional debates.The book considers laws in states from the Gulf to North Africa in regard to their approaches to issues of codification processes and issues of and of registration, capacity and guardianship in marriage, polygyny, the marital relationship, divorce and child custody. -- Publisher description.",Social Science,255,N/A,0,en

The German Family (Routledge Revivals),"Richard J. Evans, W. R. Lee",Routledge,2015-06-11,"This book surveys the history of the German family in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The contributions deal with the influence of industrialisation on family life in town and country, with rural families and communities under the impact of social and economic change, and with the role and influence of the family in the lives of men and women in the newly-emerged working class. Research on the history of the family had so far, at the point of this book’s publication in 1981, concentrated on England and France; this book adds an important comparative dimension by extending the discussion into Central Europe and bringing fresh evidence and interpretation to bear on the wider debate about the effects of industrialisation on family structure and family life as a whole. The authors approach the subject from a variety of perspectives, including social anthropology, oral history, economic history and feminist studies.

When her friends gift her a 23-and-Me test as a gag, high school senior Chloe Chang doesn’t think much of trying it out. She doesn’t believe anything will come of it—she’s an only child, her mother is an orphan, and her father died in Seoul before she was even born, and before her mother moved to Oklahoma. It’s been just Chloe and her mom her whole life. But the DNA test reveals something Chloe never expected—she’s got a whole extended family from her father’s side half a world away in Korea. Turns out her father's family are amongst the richest families in Seoul and want to meet Chloe. So, despite her mother's reservations, Chloe travels to Seoul and is whisked into the lap of luxury . . . but something feels wrong. Soon Chloe will discover the reason why her mother never told her about her dad’s family, and why the Nohs wanted her in Seoul in the first place.

The Emergence of Spacetime in String Theory,Tiziana Vistarini,Routledge,2019-06-12,The nature of space and time is one of the most fascinating and fundamental philosophical issues which presently engages at the deepest level with physics. During the last thirty years this notion has been object of an intense critical review in the light of new scientific theories which try to combine the principles of both general relativity and quantum theory—called theories of quantum gravity. This book considers the way string theory shapes its own account of spacetime disappearance from the fundamental level.,Science,155,N/A,0,en

"Space, Structure and Randomness","Michel Bilodeau, Fernand Meyer, Michel Schmitt",Springer Science & Business Media,2007-12-23,"Space, structure, and randomness: these are the three key concepts underlying Georges Matheron’s scientific work. He first encountered them at the beginning of his career when working as a mining engineer, and then they resurfaced in fields ranging from meteorology to microscopy. What could these radically different types of applications possibly have in common? First, in each one only a single realisation of the phenomenon is available for study, but its features repeat themselves in space; second, the sampling pattern is rarely regular, and finally there are problems of change of scale. This volume is divided in three sections on random sets, geostatistics and mathematical morphology. They reflect his professional interests and his search for underlying unity. Some readers may be surprised to find theoretical chapters mixed with applied ones. We have done this deliberately. GM always considered that the distinction between the theory and practice was purely academic. When GM tackled practical problems, he used his skill as a physicist to extract the salient features and to select variables which could be measured meaningfully and whose values could be estimated from the available data. Then he used his outstanding ability as a mathematician to solve the problems neatly and efficiently. It was his capacity to combine a physicist’s intuition with a mathematician’s analytical skills that allowed him to produce new and innovative solutions to difficult problems. The book should appeal to graduate students and researchers working in mathematics, probability, statistics, physics, spatial data analysis, and image analysis. In addition it will be of interest to those who enjoy discovering links between scientific disciplines that seem unrelated at first glance. In writing the book the contributors have tried to put GM’s ideas into perspective. During his working life, GM was a genuinely creative scientist. He developed innovative concepts whose usefulness goes far beyond the confines of the discipline for which they were originally designed. This is why his work remains as pertinent today as it was when it was first written.",Mathematics,402,N/A,0,en

Specification and verification techniques are playing an increasingly important role in the design and production of practical concurrent systems. The wider application of these techniques serves to identify difficult problems that require new approaches to their solution and further developments in specification and verification. The Workshop aimed to capture this interplay by providing a forum for the exchange of the experience of academic and industrial experts in the field. Presentations included: surveys, original research, practical experi ence with methods, tools and environments in the following or related areas: Object-oriented, process, data and logic based models and specifi cation methods for concurrent systems Verification of concurrent systems Tools and environments for the analysis of concurrent systems Applications of specification languages to practical concurrent system design and development.

Differential Inclusions in a Banach Space,Alexander Tolstonogov,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Preface to the English Edition The present monograph is a revised and enlarged alternative of the author's monograph [19] which was devoted to the development of a unified approach to studying differential inclusions, whose values of the right hand sides are compact, not necessarily convex subsets of a Banach space. This approach relies on ideas and methods of modem functional analysis, general topology, the theory of multi-valued mappings and continuous selectors. Although the basic content of the previous monograph has been remained the same this monograph has been partly re-organized and the author's recent results have been added. The contents of the present book are divided into five Chapters and an Appendix. The first Chapter of the J>ook has been left without changes and deals with multi-valued differential equations generated by a differential inclusion. The second Chapter has been significantly revised and extended. Here the au thor's recent results concerning extreme continuous selectors of multi-functions with decomposable values, multi-valued selectors ofmulti-functions generated by a differential inclusion, the existence of solutions of a differential inclusion, whose right hand side has different properties of semicontinuity at different points, have been included. Some of these results made it possible to simplify schemes for proofs concerning the existence of solutions of differential inclu sions with semicontinuous right hand side a.nd to obtain new results. In this Chapter the existence of solutions of different types are considered.",Mathematics,314,N/A,0,en
Confronting the Odds,Laura Horn,Department of Education Office of Educational,1997,"This study used data on 1992 high school graduates from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (a survey that began with eighth graders in 1988 and followed them every two years through 1994) to examine the critical junctures when at-risk high school graduates are most likely to leave the pipeline to college enrollment, and to identify factors that increase their chances of successfully navigating the enrollment pipeline. An at-risk student was defined as having risk factors such as being from a single parent household, having an older sibling who dropped out of high school, and earning low grades between sixth and eighth grades. Highlights of the findings include: about 58 percent of graduates had one or more risk factors; of these, 30 percent successfully navigated the pipeline to college enrollment; at-risk students differed most from counterparts in their educational aspirations and academic preparation; and academically prepared at-risk students were much less likely than counterparts to take an entrance exam. After an introductory chapter, two chapters detail data and definitions and provide an overview of students at risk. The following two chapters present findings on the pipeline to a four-year college and compare at-risk students regarding completion of math courses, help received in the college application process, and level of school involvement of students, parents, and peers.

Subsequent Educational Attainment of High School Dropouts,"Jennifer Berktold, Sonya Geis, Phillip Kaufman, C. Dennis Carroll, National Center for Education Statistics",Department of Education Office of Educational,1998,"This study uses data from the 1988 National Education Longitudinal Study and its 1994 followup to examine the educational and employment attainment of 1988 eighth graders who dropped out of high school. About half of them ultimately completed high school. By 1994, 16% had completed a high school diploma, 29% had completed a General Educational Development (GED) or equivalency certificate, and 24% were working on a diploma or GED. The remaining one-third of dropouts had no credential and were not pursuing any further education. High school completion among dropouts was associated with socioeconomic status. Dropouts who had demonstrated academic ability, although not necessarily academic performance, were most likely to complete high school. By 1994, 2 years after most of the""cohort"" had completed high school, high school completion among dropouts was associated with some educational, but few employment, characteristics. In 1994, most dropouts were either working, looking for work, or at home. About the same proportion of dropouts as 1988 eighth graders who had never dropped out reported working full time or part time in 1994, but those who had never dropped out were more likely to be taking academic courses. More than half of those who had never dropped out were enrolled in 2-year or 4-year postsecondary institutions. About one in four dropouts had enrolled in a postsecondary institution by 1994.

Kalu:lnin and their students in the 50s and 60s. Nowadays the most deeply developed is the theory of binary invariant relations and their combinatorial approximations. These combinatorial approximations arose repeatedly during this century under various names (Hecke algebras, centralizer rings, association schemes, coherent configurations, cellular rings, etc.-see the first paper of the collection for details) andin various branches of mathematics, both pure and applied. One of these approximations, the theory of cellular rings (cellular algebras), was developed at the end of the 60s by B. Yu. Weisfeiler and A.A. Leman in the course of the first serious attempt to study the complexity of the graph isomorphism problem, one of the central problems in the modern theory of combinatorial algorithms. At roughly the same time G.M. Adelson-Velskir, V.L. Arlazarov, I.A. Faradtev and their colleagues had developed a rather efficient tool for the constructive enumeration of combinatorial objects based on the branch and bound method. By means of this tool a number of ""sports-like"" results were obtained. Some of these results are still unsurpassed.",Mathematics,513,N/A,0,en
Thermal Relaxation for Particle Systems in Interaction with Several Bosonic Heat Reservoirs,Matthias Mück,BoD – Books on Demand,2005,The present publication is concerned with the study of thermodynamic properties of a quantum mechanical system composed of a small particle system (such as a spin chain) and several quantized massless boson fields (as photon gasses or phonon fields) at positive temperature. As the text at hand is a contribution to the area of mathematical physics it unites mathematical concepts of the thermodynamics of a quantum system with the mathematically rigorous treatment of problems in positive temperature quantum physics. The dissertation character of this publication is reflected by the fact that recent research work of the author is displayed along with a review of established results in the field of statistical quantum mechanics. An extended introductory part serves as thorough familiarization of non-experts with the field of studies. The required technical tools for the mathematical treatment of the system under consideration are carefully compiled apart from the main text.,Bosons,348,N/A,0,en

Point-Counting and the Zilber–Pink Conjecture,Jonathan Pila,Cambridge University Press,2022-06-09,"Point-counting results for sets in real Euclidean space have found remarkable applications to diophantine geometry, enabling significant progress on the André–Oort and Zilber–Pink conjectures. The results combine ideas close to transcendence theory with the strong tameness properties of sets that are definable in an o-minimal structure, and thus the material treated connects ideas in model theory, transcendence theory, and arithmetic. This book describes the counting results and their applications along with their model-theoretic and transcendence connections. Core results are presented in detail to demonstrate the flexibility of the method, while wider developments are described in order to illustrate the breadth of the diophantine conjectures and to highlight key arithmetical ingredients. The underlying ideas are elementary and most of the book can be read with only a basic familiarity with number theory and complex algebraic geometry.

From Parent to Child,"Jere R. Behrman, Robert A. Pollak, Paul Taubman",University of Chicago Press,1995-08-15,"How do parents allocate human capital among their children? To what extent do parental decisions about resource allocation determine children's eventual economic success? The analyses in From Parent to Child explore these questions by developing and testing a model in which the earnings of children with different genetic endowments respond differently to investments in human capital. Behrman, Pollak, and Taubman use this model to investigate issues such as parental bias in resource allocations based on gender or birth order; the extent of intergenerational mobility in income, earnings, and schooling in the United States; the relative importance of environmental and genetic factors in determining variations in schooling; and whether parents' distributions offset the intended effects of government programs designed to subsidize children. In allocating scarce resources, parents face a trade-off between equity and efficiency, between the competing desires to equalize the wealth of their children and to maximize the sum of their earnings. Building on the seminal work of Gary Becker, From Parent to Child integrates careful modeling of household behavior with systematic empirical testing, and will appeal to anyone interested in the economics of the family.",Education,332,N/A,0,en
Scale-isometric Polytopal Graphs in Hypercubes and Cubic Lattices,"M.

The Cognitive Psychology of Knowledge,"G. Strube, K.F. Wender",Elsevier,1993-10-01,"The present book is a result of a seven-year (1986-1992) national research program in cognitive science in Germany, presumably the first large scale cognitive science program there. Anchored in psychology, and therefore christened Wissenpsychologie (psychology of knowledge), it has found interdisciplinary resonance, especially in artificial intelligence and education. The research program brought together cognitive scientists from over twenty German universities and more than thirty single projects were funded. The program was initiated by Heinz Mandl and Hans Spada, the main goals of which were to investigate the acquisition of knowledge, the access to knowledge, and the modification and application of knowledge from a psychological perspective. Emphasis was placed on formalisms of knowledge representation and on the processes involved. In many of the projects this was combined with computer simulations. A final but equally important goal was the development of experimental paradigms and methods for data analysis that are especially suited to investigate knowledge based processes.The research program has had a major impact on cognitive psychology in Germany. Research groups were established at many universities and research equipment was provided. It also inspired a considerable number of young scientists to carry out cognitive research, employ modeling techniques from artificial intelligence for psychological theorizing, and construct intelligent tutoring systems for education. Close contacts with cognitive scientists in the U.S. have helped to firmly integrate the program with international research endeavours. Each year, one or two workshops were held. The present volume is the result of the final workshop which was held in September 1992. Selected results from seventeen projects are presented in this book. The volume is enriched by three guest scholars who agreed to participate in the final workshop and to comment on the chapters of the book.",Psychology,471,N/A,0,en

Dynamical Systems,M. M. Peixoto,Academic Press,2014-05-10,"Dynamical Systems is a collection of papers that deals with the generic theory of dynamical systems, in which structural stability becomes associated with a generic property. Some papers describe structural stability in terms of mappings of one manifold into another, as well as their singularities. One paper examines the theory of polyhedral catastrophes, particularly, the analogues of each of the four basic differentiable catastrophes which map the line. Other papers discuss isolating blocks, the exponential rate conditions for dynamical systems, bifurcation, catastrophe, and a nondensity theorem. One paper reviews the results of functional differential equations which show that a qualitative theory will emerge despite the presence of an infinite dimensionality or of a semigroup property. Another paper discusses a class of quasi-periodic solutions for Hamiltonian systems of differential equations. These equations generalize a well-known result of Kolmogorov and Arnold on perturbations of n-dimensional invariant tori for Hamiltonian systems of n degrees of freedom. The researcher can derive mathematical models based on qualitative mathematical argument by using as ""axioms"" three dynamic qualities found in heart muscle fibers and nerve axons. The collection can prove useful for mathematicians, students and professors of advanced mathematics, topology or calculus.",Mathematics,764,N/A,0,en
Plant-Environment Interaction,"Mohamed Mahgoub Azooz, Parvaiz Ahmad",John Wiley & Sons,2016-01-26,"The increase in global population, urbanization and industrialization is resulting in the conversion of cultivated land into wasteland. Providing food from these limited resources to an ever-increasing population is one of the biggest challenges that present agriculturalists and plant scientists are facing. Environmental stresses make this situation even graver. Plants on which mankind is directly or indirectly dependent exhibit various mechanisms for their survival. Adaptability of the plants to changing environment is a matter of concern for plant biologists trying to reach the goal of food security. Despite the induction of several tolerance mechanisms, sensitive plants often fail to withstand these environmental extremes. Using new technological approaches has become essential and imperative. Plant-Environment Interaction: Responses and Approaches to Mitigate Stress throws light on the changing environment and the sustainability of plants under these conditions. It contains the most up-to-date research and comprehensive detailed discussions in plant physiology, climate change, agronomy and forestry, sometimes from a molecular point of view, to convey in-depth understanding of the effects of environmental stress in plants, their responses to the environment, how to mitigate the negative effects and improve yield under stress. This edited volume is written by expert plant biologists from around the world, providing invaluable knowledge to graduate and undergraduate students in plant biochemistry, food chemistry, plant physiology, molecular biology, plant biotechnology, and environmental sciences. This book updates scientists and researchers with the very latest information and sustainable methods used for stress tolerance, which will also be of considerable interest to plant based companies and institutions concerned with the campaign of food security.",Science,361,N/A,0,en
Business Statistics for Competitive Advantage with Excel 2007,Cynthia Fraser,Springer Science & Business Media,2008-12-11,"Exceptional managers know that they can create competitive advantages by basing decisions on performance response under alternative scenarios. To create these advantages, managers need to understand how to use statistics to provide information on performance response under alternative scenarios. Statistics are created to make better decisions. Statistics are essential and relevant. Statistics must be easily and quickly produced using widely available software, Excel. Then results must be translated into general business language and illustrated with compelling graphics to make them understandable and usable by decision makers. This book helps students master this process of using statistics to create competitive advantages as decision makers. Statistics are essential, relevant, easy to produce, easy to understand, valuable, and fun, when used to create competitive advantage. The Examples, Assignments, And Cases Used To Illustrate Statistics For Decision Making Come From Business Problems McIntire Corporate Sponsors and Partners, such as Rolls-Royce, Procter & Gamble, and Dell, and the industries that they do business in, provide many realistic examples. The book also features a number of examples of global business problems, including those from important emerging markets in China and India. It is exciting to see how statistics are used to improve decision making in real and important business decisions. This makes it easy to see how statistics can be used to create competitive advantages in similar applications in internships and careers.

Modelling and Empirical Evaluation of Labour Supply Behaviour,Isolde Woittiez,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"One of the major issues of policy makers in The Netherlands is to reduce the high unemployment rate. In 1988 economic growth was substantial in all OECD countries, which led to an increase in employment. The economic growth also induced extra labour supply, especially of married women, which altogether led to a smaller reduction in the unemployment rate than could have been expected in view of the economic growth (see Rapportage Arbeidsmarkt, 1989). The estimated official unemployment rate in 1988 is still 11. 0% of the total labour force. Therefore, there is a strong interest in policies that seek to increase employment (the demand side of the labour market) as well as in understanding the factors that influence labour supply. In this thesis we try to further such understanding by constructing a detailed model of household labour supply. The data we use relate t9 Dutch households in 1985. In that year the official rate of unemployment was 15. 9%. A distinguishing feature of Dutch labour supply is its very low level of female labour force participation, e. g. in 1985 it was only 35. 2%. Apart from Spain, which had a similar participation rate, most other industrialized OECD countries had a participation rate of around 60% (see OECD Labor Force Statistics).",Business & Economics,240,N/A,0,en

Joy, Eric Lifshin, Klaus-Rüdiger Peters",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"During the last four decades remarkable developments have taken place in instrumentation and techniques for characterizing the microstructure and microcomposition of materials. Some of the most important of these instruments involve the use of electron beams because of the wealth of information that can be obtained from the interaction of electron beams with matter. The principal instruments include the scanning electron microscope, electron probe x-ray microanalyzer, and the analytical transmission electron microscope. The training of students to use these instruments and to apply the new techniques that are possible with them is an important function, which. has been carried out by formal classes in universities and colleges and by special summer courses such as the ones offered for the past 19 years at Lehigh University. Laboratory work, which should be an integral part of such courses, is often hindered by the lack of a suitable laboratory workbook. While laboratory workbooks for transmission electron microscopy have-been in existence for many years, the broad range of topics that must be dealt with in scanning electron microscopy and microanalysis has made it difficult for instructors to devise meaningful experiments. The present workbook provides a series of fundamental experiments to aid in ""hands-on"" learning of the use of the instrumentation and the techniques.

In particular, it proposes a new approach to extremal problem theory for nonlinear operators, differential-operator equations and inclusions, and for variational inequalities in Banach spaces. An axiomatic study of nonlinear maps (including multi-valued ones) is given, and the properties of resolving operators for systems, consisting of operator and differential-operator equations, are stated in nonlinear-map terms. The solvability conditions and the properties of extremal problem solutions are obtained, while their weak expansions and necessary conditions of optimality in variational inequality form are formulated. In addition. the monograph proposes regularization methods and approximation schemes. This book is adressed to scientists, graduates and undergraduates who are interested in nonlinear analysis, control theory, system analysis and differential equations.",Mathematics,512,N/A,0,en

Civil Society and the Family,"Esther Muddiman, Sally Power, Chris Taylor",Policy Press,2020-10-21,"The relationship between the family and civil society has always been complex, with the family often regarded as separate from, or even oppositional to, civil society. Taking a fresh empirical approach, Muddiman, Power and Taylor reveal how such separation underestimates the important role the family plays in civil society. Considering the impact of family events, dinner table debates, intergenerational transmission of virtues and the role of the mother, this enlightening book draws on survey data from 1000 young people, a sample of their parents and grandparents, and extended family interviews, to uncover how civil engagement, activism and political participation are inherited and fostered within the home.",Political Science,216,N/A,0,en

Work/Family Conflicts,Bradley K. Googins,Praeger,1991,"Work/Family Conflicts describes a social earthquake which, without our knowledge, is changing the fiber of our lives. Conflicts inherent to complex work/family issues are being felt within and among three sectors: the family, the corporation, and society at large. These conflicts deny easy solutions and are aggravated as they bump up against social, economic, and cultural realities. According to Bradley Googins, all three sectors must ultimately appreciate their roles in the conflicts and accept some responsibility for resolving them. He focuses on the roles played by society and families and stresses the need to ignore simplistic solutions. He looks instead toward creative understandings, new partnerships, and the courage to confront dysfunctional structures, attitudes, and social arrangements. The ultimate goal is healthy and productive families and workplaces. Googins divides his volume into ten chapters. His first chapter provides an overview reflecting the magnitude of the issues. He then outlines a framework--examining issues at four levels: individuals, families, corporations, and governments. Salient changes, conflicts, and impacts are discussed at each level. Chapter three analyzes the development of work/family relationships over several centuries. Googins presents the findings of the Boston University Balancing Job and Homelife Study in chapter four. This study provides his research base. Viewing work/family conflicts from the perspective of today's families, chapter five looks at family members while chapter six and seven cover childcare and elder dependent care. Chapter eight identifies society's megaconflicts, chapter nine outlines the types of initiatives which have begun in response to these conflicts. A final chapter takes a look at the challenges and possibilities ahead of us.",Business & Economics,352,N/A,0,en

Family Time & Industrial Time,Tamara K. Hareven,University Press of America,1993,"The myth that industrialization broke down traditional family ties has long pervaded American society. Professor Hareven, a leading social historian, dispels this myth and illustrates how the family survived and became an active force in the modern factory. In this book, Hareven examines the multiple roles that the workers' families fulfilled in facilitating their adaptation to the pressures of changing work patterns and new modes of life in an industrial city. She reconstructs family and work patterns among immigrants as well as native textile laborers over two generations during a crucial period in the transformation of American industry from the late nineteenth century. A case study based on what was the world's largest textile plantóthe Amoskeag Manufacturing Company in Manchester, New Hampshireóthe book integrates a wide array of documentary evidence with oral testimony. It examines the lives of real peopleóthe way they acted, the way they perceived their lives, and the kinds of decisions they made when pacing their lives in relation to the demands of the industrial system.

Well, it includes the study of all kinds of people and places, some far away and some next door. In this book we talk about families, like your family in your house, and also lots of people close by, which we call a town or city, and finally about even more people in cities or outside of cities, all living in big places called countries. My Story and the World Around Me is a course for lower elementary students. It includes basic introductions to history, politics, sociology, economics, and geography, and provides a fuller understanding of God’s world and the cultures of the countries. This is a daily adventure-based curriculum series that encourages families to explore the world together through four nine-week quests and to understand it better from God’s perspective. It is designed with elements that make weekly learning fun and interactive, including: Activity timeWord find timeReview timeMy story journal Learn all about the world while you discover more about your own.

Like Family,Margaret K. Nelson,Rutgers University Press,2020-04-17,"For decades, social scientists have assumed that “fictive kinship” is a phenomenon associated only with marginal peoples and people of color in the United States. In this innovative book, Nelson reveals the frequency, texture and dynamics of relationships which are felt to be “like family” among the white middle-class. Drawing on extensive, in-depth interviews, Nelson describes the quandaries and contradictions, delight and anxiety, benefits and costs, choice and obligation in these relationships. She shows the ways these fictive kinships are similar to one another as well as the ways they vary—whether around age or generation, co-residence, or the possibility of becoming “real” families. Moreover she shows that different parties to the same relationship understand them in some similar – and some very different – ways. Theoretically rich and beautifully written, the book is accessible to the general public while breaking new ground for scholars in the field of family studies.",Family & Relationships,245,N/A,0,en

I don't know how she managed to sail across such dangerous waters' RACHEL CUSK He is a renowned Swedish filmmaker and has a plan for everything. She is his daughter, by the actress he directed and once loved. Each summer of her childhood, the daughter visits the father at his remote Faro island home on the edge of the Baltic Sea. Now that she's grown up - a writer, with children of her own - and he's in his eighties, they envision writing a book together, about old age, language, memory and loss. She will ask the questions. He will answer them. The tape recorder will record. But it's winter now and old age has caught up with him in ways neither could have foreseen. And when the father is gone, only memories, images and words -- both remembered and recorded - remain. And from these the daughter begins to write her own story, in the pages which become this book. Heart-breaking and spell-binding, Unquiet is a seamless blend of fiction and memoir in pursuit of elemental truths about how we live, love, lose and age.",Fiction,317,N/A,0,en

Family Life Education,"Carol A. Darling, Dawn Cassidy, Sharon M. Ballard",Waveland Press,2022-06-29,"Contemporary family life educators operate within a wide range of settings and with increasingly varied populations and families. In the fourth edition of Family Life Education, Carol Darling and Dawn Cassidy are pleased to have Sharon Ballard join in the process of exposing readers to the diverse landscape of the field while laying a comprehensive, research-based, and practical foundation for current and future family life educators. The authors, who are CFLE Certified, consider the Certified Family Life Educator credential requirements of the National Council on Family Relations throughout the text. Their broad overview of the field includes a brief history and discussion of family life education as an established profession. New to this edition is the inclusion of several models that provide insight into the discipline and practice. There is expanded information about working with diverse audiences and the skills needed to be a culturally competent family life educator. The addition of the personal experiences and reflections of 17 family life educators working in a variety of settings provides a meaningful context to the continuing evolution and importance of family life education in society. The authors incorporate theory, research, and practice while also providing guidelines for planning, implementing, and evaluating family life education programs. Content on sexuality education, relationship and marriage education, and parenting education highlights some of the more prevalent trends and visible forms of family life education. Comments from 35 international colleagues representing 27 countries and 6 continents facilitate understanding the role of family life education in various international settings. The provision of interactive classroom exercises focuses on building awareness, appreciation of diversity, and global trends. Discussion questions and activities encourage readers to examine issues and apply what they have learned.",Family & Relationships,468,N/A,0,en

The book then helps readers learn principles and methods for reaching out to the public and how to form and use community collaborations and use principles of social marketing to promote programs. The Second Edition contains five new chapters on education for personal well-being, marriage and relationship education, parenting education, sexuality education, and narratives of family life educators. The authors' practical, hands-on experience is used to demonstrate how readers can put principles from the latest and best scholarship into action and reinforced with the Interactive Explorations sections throughout.",Education,497,N/A,0,en

Family Life in Black America moves away from this negative perspective and instead deals with a wide range of issues including sexuality, procreation, infancy, adulthood, adolescence, cohabitation, parenting, grandparenting and ageing. A fresh aspect of this book is the amount of diversity it reveals within black families and the forces that shape, limit and enhance them.",Family & Relationships,396,N/A,0,en
Routledge Handbook of International Family Law,"Barbara Stark, Jacqueline Heaton",Routledge,2019-01-30,"Globalisation, and the vast migrations of capital and labour that have accompanied it in recent decades, has transformed family law in once unimaginable ways. Families have been torn apart and new families have been created. Borders have become more porous, allowing adoptees and mail order brides to join new families and women fleeing domestic violence to escape from old ones. People of different nationalities marry, have children, and divorce, not necessarily in that order. They file suits in their respective home states or third states, demanding support, custody, and property. Otherwise law-abiding parents risk jail in desperate efforts to abduct their own children from foreign ex-spouses. The aim of this Handbook is to provide scholars, postgraduate students, judges, and practioners with a broad but authoritative review of current research in the area of International Family Law. The contributors reflect on a range of jurisdictions and legal traditions and their approaches vary. Each chapter has a distinct subject matter and was written by an author who was invited because of his or her expertise on that subject. This volume provides a valuable contribution to emerging understandings of the subject.",Law,422,N/A,0,en
The Future of Child and Family Law,Elaine E.

In this volume, a variety of experts examine child and family law in thirteen countries - Australia, Canada, China, India, Israel, Malaysia, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Scotland, South Africa and the United States. Each chapter identifies the imperatives and influences that have prevailed to date and offers informed predictions of how it will develop in the years to come. A common chapter structure facilitates comparison of the jurisdictions, and in the introduction the editor highlights common trends and salient differences. The Future of Child and Family Law therefore provides practitioners, academics and policy-makers with access not just to an overview of child and family law in a range of countries around the world, but also to insights into what has shaped it and options for reform.",Law,497,N/A,0,en

Family Law in Practice,The City Law School,"Oxford University Press, USA",2012,"Almost all junior barristers in civil practice are likely to encounter family law work in their first years of practice. This manual therefore provides a detailed introduction to the key areas of the substantive family law of which the junior practitioner should have a good working knowledge. Key aspects of family law covered include domestic violence, care proceedings and pre-nuptial agreements. Adopting a highly pragmatic approach, Family Law in Practice encourages students to build on their existing basic practitioner skills, and highlights how to approach writing opinions and drafting documents specific to family law. It provides invaluable practical advice on how to prepare for different types of hearing, what factors to consider in relation to negotiation, how to make persuasive submissions, and how to handle witnesses effectively, ensuring that the junior practitioner is fully prepared for his or her first steps in the family courts.

Landmark Cases in Family Law,"Stephen Gilmore, Jonathan Herring, Rebecca Probert",Bloomsbury Publishing,2011-07-01,"There are a number of important (landmark) cases in the development of Family Law in England and Wales that deserve detailed examination and lend themselves particularly well to historical examination. Family law cases tend to raise highly controversial issues, often on striking facts, frequently provoking wider social debate and/or extensive publicity. Consequently, the landmark cases chosen for this collection provide considerable scope, not only for doctrinal analysis and explanation of the importance and impact of the decisions, but also for in-depth examination of the social or policy developments that influenced them. The stories behind the cases provide a fascinating insight into the complexities of family life and the drama that can be found in the family courts. In recent years, Family Law has seen enormous changes in law's engagement with the notion of 'family', with the enactment, for example, of the Civil Partnership Act 2004, the Gender Recognition Act 2004 and, more recently, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008. As we begin to move forward into the new millennium, this is an excellent time to engage in detailed analyses and 'stock-taking' of the landmark decisions, many of which were decided in the 1970s, and which have shaped modern Family Law. This book provides a series of in-depth studies of the key leading cases, and will be of interest to students and lecturers alike.",Law,232,N/A,0,en
Research Handbook on the Economics of Family Law,"Lloyd R. Cohen, Joshua D. Wright",Edward Elgar Publishing,2011-01-01,"Those not learned in the economic arts believe that economics is either solely or essentially concerned with commercial relations. And, so it was, originally. Then, in the second half of the 20th century, economists began applying their minimalist but sturdy tools to other human activities such as marriage, child-bearing, crime, religion and social groups. In this spirit, the Research Handbook on the Economics of Family Law gives us a series of original essays by distinguished scholars in economics, law or both. The essays represent a variety of approaches to the field. Many contain extensive surveys of the literature with respect to the particular question they address. Some employ empirical economics, others are more narrowly legal. They have in common one thing: each scholar employs a core economic tool or insight to shed light on some aspect of family law and social institutions broadly understood. Topics covered include: divorce, child support, infant feeding, abortion access, prostitution, the decline in marriage, birth control and incentives for partnering. This comprehensive and enlightening volume will be a valuable reference for those interested in law and economics generally and family law in particular.",Law,321,N/A,0,en
"Marriage, Work, and Family Life in Comparative Perspective","Noriko O. Tsuya, Larry L. Bumpass",University of Hawaii Press,2003-12-31,"When we compare Eastern and Western societies, we find similar economic and social forces at work. But the impact of these on family life reflects differences in cultural history and social context. This volume examines family change in Korea, Japan, and the United States, allowing us to contrast the collective emphasis of a Confucian social heritage with the individualism of the West. An impressive group of demographers and family sociologists considers such questions as: How do family patterns vary within countries and across societies? How essential are marriage and parenthood? How do levels of contact between middle-aged adults and their parents who live elsewhere differ in East Asian countries and the U.S.? How does female employment vary based on family factors and do these factors affect employment across societies? Policy makers and demographic and family researchers both in the U.S. and Asia will find this book a vital resource for understanding the dynamics of family life in contrasting modern societies.

Lesbian Family Life Cycle,Suzanne Slater,Simon and Schuster,1995-01-17,"Until now, lesbian families have had little help in identifying the stages of their couple relationships or recognizing the often stressful periods of relational transition. In this first-of-its-kind book, psychotherapist Suzanne Slater describes the joys and stresses common to lesbian families and provides a five-stage model of the development of lesbian couple relationships, from formation through old age and death. Drawing on sixteen years of clinical experience and research, Slater shows that lesbian families with and without children have created their own richly diverse family patterns, extending both the parameters of coupled life and the very definition of what constitutes ""family."" She describes the tasks, challenges, and accomplishments particular to each stage of the family life cycle, and helps couples distinguish between normal developmental stresses and the unique difficulties of particular couples. She considers in detail lesbian couples' interaction with their original families, with the straight world, and with the lesbian communities of which they are a part. Through a range of examples and cases, Slater addresses how lesbian families are affected by their position in a homophobic culture and details the unique coping mechanisms that different lesbian couples have created. Most important, she emphasizes the sources of fulfillment common to many lesbian families. In addition to educating lesbian couples and those close to them, this book will prepare psychotherapists to design more effective and informed therapeutic strategies. Instead of relying on theory based on heterosexual experience, clinicians can now base their interventions on what is normal for lesbian family life. The Lesbian Family Life Cycle will be invaluable reading for lesbian family members, their friends and relatives, and clinicians in a variety of helping professions.",Psychology,426,N/A,0,en

Families – Beyond the Nuclear Ideal,"Daniela Cutas, Sarah Chan",A&amp;C Black,2012-11-22,"This book is available as open access through the Bloomsbury Open Access programme and is available on www.bloomsburycollections.com. This book examines, through a multi-disciplinary lens, the possibilities offered by relationships and family forms that challenge the nuclear family ideal, and some of the arguments that recommend or disqualify these as legitimate units in our societies.That children should be conceived naturally, born to and raised by their two young, heterosexual, married to each other, genetic parents; that this relationship between parents is also the ideal relationship between romantic or sexual partners; and that romance and sexual intimacy ought to be at the core of our closest personal relationships - all these elements converge towards the ideal of the nuclear family. The authors consider a range of relationship and family structures that depart from this ideal: polyamory and polygamy, single and polyparenting, parenting by gay and lesbian couples, as well as families created through assisted human reproduction.",Social Science,238,N/A,0,en
Clinical Practice with Families,"Michael Rothery, George Enns",Routledge,2014-01-21,"Encourage creative change in troubled families! Clinical Practice with Families: Supporting Creativity and Competence presents the most important and useful contemporary ideas in family therapy from many diverse traditions. By organizing eclectic concepts within one basic, powerful framework, it makes these ideas more accessible and effective in practice. Instead of exploring these ideas in the abstract, Clinical Practice with Families illustrates them with in-depth case examples that include detailed studies of the client family's history and traditions, extensive analyses of the family system, and actual dialogue from sessions, along with the therapist's comments on shifting alliances and other unspoken occurrences. No other technique could better demonstrate the practical integration of therapeutic skills and concepts to meet the clients’needs. Clinical Practice with Families offers insight and ideas for practicing family therapists in such essential areas as: negotiating flexible, appropriate boundaries between family members and between yourself and your clients constructing ecomaps of a client's support systems and stressors identifying four kinds of supports helping the client reinterpret family traditions enabling clients to break the pattern of old narratives encouraging clients to set realistic, achievable goals Clinical Practice with Families offers a powerful set of techniques and ideas in a clear, understandable framework.

"Children, Families and Leisure","Heike Schaenzel, Neil Carr",Routledge,2018-02-02,"This book aims to further academic debate within the leisure and tourism studies community about the role of ‘families’ in contemporary life and the experiences of families and their children in the leisure environment. It is based on the recognition of the diverse nature of the family in the contemporary era and the position of children in families and society in general as active and knowing social agents rather than as passive objects. The family is on the one hand our first community with its own special kind of human attachment and on the other a little world on which the larger society is modelled. Families form the closest and most important emotional bond in humans. This relationship is what drives humanity and society, and positions families at the centre of leisure activities. This international and multi-disciplinary compilation of recent research into children and families examines progress made and challenges ahead for leisure studies. It extends the academic discourse to a wider understanding of what families, children and their leisure behaviour mean in today’s societies.

The Foundation of Choice of Law,Sagi Peari,Oxford University Press,2018-03-30,"This book focuses on the subject of choice of law as a whole and provides an analysis of its various rules, principles, doctrines and concepts. It offers a conceptual account of choice of law, called ""choice equality foundation"" (CEF), which aims to flesh out the normative basis of the subject. The author reveals that, despite the multiplicity of titles and labels within the myriad choice of law rules and practices of the U.S., Canadian, European, Australian, and other systems, many of them effectively confirm and crystallize CEF's vision of the subject. This alignment signifies the necessarily intimate relationship between theory and practice by which the normative underpinnings of CEF are deeply embedded and reflected in actual practical reality. Among other things, this book provides a justification of the nature and limits of such popular principles as party autonomy, most significant relationship, and closest connection. It also discusses such topics as the actual operation of public policy doctrine in domestic courts, and the relation between the notion of international human rights and international commercial dealings, and makes some suggestions about the ability of traditional rules to cope with the advancing challenges of the digital age and the Internet.",Law,345,N/A,0,en

The Ashgate Research Companion to Islamic Law,Peri Bearman,Routledge,2016-03-16,"This unparalleled Companion provides a comprehensive and authoritative guide to Islamic law to all with an interest in this increasingly relevant and developing field. The volume presents classical Islamic law through a historiographical introduction to and analysis of Western scholarship, while key debates about hot-button issues in modern-day circumstances are also addressed. In twenty-one chapters, distinguished authors offer an overview of their particular specialty, reflect on past and current thinking, and point to directions for future research. The Companion is divided into four parts. The first offers an introduction to the history of Islamic law as well as a discussion of how Western scholarship and historiography have evolved over time. The second part delves into the substance of Islamic law. Legal rules for the areas of legal status, family law, socio-economic justice, penal law, constitutional authority, and the law of war are all discussed in this section. Part three examines the adaptation of Islamic law in light of colonialism and the modern nation state as well as the subsequent re-Islamization of national legal systems. The final section presents contemporary debates on the role of Islamic law in areas such as finance, the diaspora, modern governance, and medical ethics, and the volume concludes by questioning the role of Sharia law as a legal authority in the modern context. By outlining the history of Islamic law through a linear study of research, this collection is unique in its examination of past and present scholarship and the lessons we can draw from this for the future. It introduces scholars and students to the challenges posed in the past, to the magnitude of milestones that were achieved in the reinterpretation and revision of established ideas, and ultimately to a thorough conceptual understanding of Islamic law.",Religion,502,N/A,0,en

Islamic Law and International Human Rights Law,"Anver M. Emon, Mark Ellis, Benjamin Glahn",OUP Oxford,2012-10-11,"The relationship between Islamic law and international human rights law has been the subject of considerable, and heated, debate in recent years. The usual starting point has been to test one system by the standards of the other, asking is Islamic law 'compatible' with international human rights standards, or vice versa. This approach quickly ends in acrimony and accusations of misunderstanding. By overlaying one set of norms on another we overlook the deeply contextual nature of how legal rules operate in a society, and meaningful comparison and discussion is impossible. In this volume, leading experts in Islamic law and international human rights law attempt to deepen the understanding of human rights and Islam, paving the way for a more meaningful debate. Focusing on central areas of controversy, such as freedom of speech and religion, gender equality, and minority rights, the authors examine the contextual nature of how Islamic law and international human rights law are legitimately formed, interpreted, and applied within a community. They examine how these fundamental interests are recognized and protected within the law, and what restrictions are placed on the freedoms associated with them. By examining how each system recognizes and limits fundamental freedoms, this volume clears the ground for exploring the relationship between Islamic law and international human rights law on a sounder footing. In doing so it offers a challenging and distinctive contribution to the literature on the subject, and will be an invaluable reference for students, academics, and policy-makers engaged in the legal and religious debates surrounding Islam and the West.",Law,417,N/A,0,en

La famille dans l’ordre juridique de l’Union européenne / Family within the Legal Order of the European Union,"Elsa Bernard, Marie Cresp, Marion Ho-Dac",Bruylant,2020-12-31,"Le droit de la famille, dans sa dimension civiliste, fortement ancré dans les cultures nationales des États membres, est une matière qui ne relève pas, en principe, du droit de l’Union européenne. Pourtant, il n’est plus possible d’affirmer que la matière échappe dans son entier au droit de l’Union. De nombreux aspects de la famille sont sous influence européenne, au point que l’on voit se dessiner les contours d’une « famille européenne ». L’ouvrage propose de mettre en lumière l’acquis européen en matière de droit de la famille, au prisme du droit matériel (citoyenneté européenne, politique sociale de l’Union, fonction publique européenne...), comme du droit international privé. Le droit de la famille de l’Union s’identifie alors comme un «droit spécial» complétant la diversité des droits nationaux de la famille. Sa signification théorique et politique dans l’Union est débattue par les auteurs, autant que son devenir. Loin de demeurer fragmentaire à côté des droits nationaux des États membres, il a probablement vocation à se densifier pour offrir aux citoyens et résidents européens un droit commun de la famille au sein de l’Union. Family law, with its civil law tradition, and strong roots in the national cultures of the Member States, does not normally fall within the scope of European law. However, it is no longer possible to argue that family law is outside European law entirely. There are many aspects of the family which are subject to European influence, to the point that the outlines of a «European family» are starting to emerge. This book is intended to highlight the European experience of family law and its substantive (i.e. European citizenship, EU social policy, EU civil service...) and private international law aspects. Union law therefore contains a form of «special» family law which is shared between the Member States and supplements their national family laws.

European Convention on Human Rights,Christoph Grabenwarter,Bloomsbury Publishing,2014-02-12,"The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) entered into force on 3 September 1953 with binding effect on all Member States of the Council of Europe. It grants the people of Europe a number of fundamental rights and freedoms (right to life, prohibition of torture, prohibition of slavery and forced labour, right to liberty and security, right to a fair trial, no punishment without law, right to respect for private and family life, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and association, right to marry, right to an effective remedy, prohibition of discrimination) plus some more by additional protocols to the Convention (Protocols 1 (ETS No. 009), 4 (ETS No. 046), 6 (ETS No. 114), 7 (ETS No. 117), 12 (ETS No. 177) and 13 (ETS No. 187)). Any person who feels his or her rights under the ECHR have been violated by the authorities of one of the Member States can bring a case to the European Court of Human Rights, established under the Convention. The States are bound by the Court's decisions. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe make sure that the decisions are properly executed. Today the Court receives thousands of petitions annually, demonstrating the immense impact of the Convention and the Strasbourg Court. Professor Grabenwarter's Commentary deals with the Convention systematically, article-by-article, considering the development and scope of each article, together with the relevant case-law and literature.",Law,578,N/A,0,en

Arbitrability,"Fabien Gélinas, Leyla Bahmany",Kluwer Law International B.V.,2023-11-17,"As simple as the arbitrability question might appear (namely, what types of issues may and may not be submitted to arbitration), for a legal system to set a clear and consistent approach to arbitration, it must consider many complicated factors that relate to public policy and economic priorities as well as international relations. This comprehensive, precise, and practical book identifies and analyzes the fundamentals of, and major approaches to, arbitrability in the current international context. The authors focus on nine major arbitration jurisdictions—the United States, Canada, France, England and Wales, Switzerland, Germany, China (Mainland), Hong Kong, and Singapore—with meticulous attention to each jurisdiction’s pertinent case law and legislative framework as well as relevant commentary. For each jurisdiction, the arbitrability of disputes in the following fields of law is discussed: antitrust/competition; bankruptcy/insolvency; consumer; corporate; family/domestic relations; intellectual property (copyright, patent, and trademark); labor/employment; securities; and torts. Based on the jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction analysis, the authors identify key areas in which the selected jurisdictions share similarities and evince differences with respect to each of the above-mentioned fields. With a structure that enables readers to easily locate what they are looking for and gives clear-cut answers, this unique book fully elucidates the notion of arbitrability by identifying the key concepts, the applicable rules, and different criteria for arbitrability and by explaining how different jurisdictions deal with specific types of disputes. It will be welcomed by counsel, arbitrators, judges, students, and academics active in international arbitration and the enforcement of arbitral awards.",Law,370,N/A,0,en

Diversity in Family Life,Elisabetta Ruspini,Policy Press,2013-06-19,"As new forms of family and 'non-traditional' families grow in number, there is a need to understand these 'new' arrangements and models of parenthood. This ground-breaking book discusses, using a comparative and a sociological perspective, examples of the relationship between changing gender identities and processes of family formation in the Western experience. It aims to show that, in the 21st century, it is possible to form a family without sex, without children, without a shared home, without a partner, without a working husband, without a heterosexual orientation or without a biological' sexual body. 'Diversity in family life' will help readers discover and understand the characteristics, advantages and drawbacks of these new models of parenthood, and their political implications in terms of social movements, characteristics and demands.",Social Science,176,N/A,0,en

European Family Law Volume I,Jens M. Scherpe,Edward Elgar Publishing,2016-01-29,"The Impact of Institutions and Organisations on European Family Law looks at the impact that institutions and organisations have had, and continue to have, on European family law. In many ways the chapters in this volume provide the easiest explanation for the existence of a European family law. While there is no European body that could actually legislate definitively on family law – even the European Union has no such mandate – there are still some obvious institutions that have a very direct impact on European family law. These can be divided into two groups; namely those that have a direct impact, such as the European Court of Human Rights and the European Union, and those that have an indirect impact, such as the Commission on European Family Law (CEFL), the Council of Europe and the International Commission on Civil Status (ICCL/CIEC) as well as the private international law instruments of the Hague Conference (HCCH) and the EU. Together, with religion, all of these institutions are contributing to the creation of a European family law. This book, and the others in the set, will serve as an invaluable resource for anyone interested in family law. It will be of particular use to students and scholars of comparative and international family law, as well as family law practitioners.",Law,373,N/A,0,en
Relational Autonomy and Family Law,Jonathan Herring,Springer Science & Business Media,2014-03-11,"This book explores the importance of autonomy in family law. It argues that traditional understandings of autonomy are inappropriate in the family law context and instead recommends the use of relational autonomy. The book starts by explaining how autonomy has historically been understood, before exploring the problems with its use in family law. It then sets out the model of relational autonomy which, it will be argued, is more appropriate in this context. Finally, some examples of practical application are presented. The issues raised and theoretical discussion is relevant to any jurisdiction.",Law,63,N/A,0,en
Adolescent Drinking and Family Life,"Geoff Lowe, David R. Foxcroft, David Sibley",Taylor & Francis,1993,"This book portrays teenage drinking, not as a symptom of pathology, but as a perfectly normal developmental phase within the context of the home environment. Drinking is a predominantly social behaviour and the family is seen as a major agent of socialization. The authors have therefore explored family dynamics and the influence which the home environment has upon adolescent drinking to come up with a new theoretical model. A major feature of this approach is the interaction of ideas from family life psychology and human geography. The authors present a typology of domestic regimes illustrated by case studies of boundary enforcement and transgression. The general theme of boundary transgression, applied here to both the psychosocial environment and built form, represents an interesting new theoretical perspective. The integration of these two fields is an innovation which should stimulate further interdisciplinary work in adolescence and addiction research. Adolescent Drinking and Family Life will be invaluable to researchers and practitioners in adolescence, family dynamics, and alcohol as well as any social scientist with an interest in the link between behaviour and the home environment. This new approach has important implications for health education and for interventions concerned with adolescent alcohol use.",Family & Relationships,224,N/A,0,en
Family Law Reimagined,Jill Elaine Hasday,Harvard University Press,2014-06-30,"One of the law’s most important and far-reaching roles is to govern family life and family members. Family law decides who counts as kin, how family relationships are created and dissolved, and what legal rights and responsibilities come with marriage, parenthood, sibling ties, and other family bonds. Yet despite its significance, the field remains remarkably understudied and poorly understood both within and outside the legal community. Family Law Reimagined is the first book to evaluate the canonical narratives, examples, and ideas that legal decisionmakers repeatedly invoke to explain family law and its governing principles. These stories contend that family law is exclusively local, that it repudiates market principles, that it has eradicated the imprint of common law doctrines which subordinated married women, that it is dominated by contract rules permitting individuals to structure their relationships as they choose, and that it consistently prioritizes children’s interests over parents’ rights. In this book, Jill Elaine Hasday reveals how family law’s canon misdescribes the reality of family law, misdirects attention away from the actual problems that family law confronts, and misshapes the policies that legal authorities pursue. She demonstrates how much of the “common sense” that decisionmakers expound about family law actually makes little sense. Family Law Reimagined uncovers and critiques the family law canon and outlines a path to reform. Challenging conventional answers and asking questions that judges and lawmakers routinely overlook, it calls on us to reimagine family law.",Law,318,N/A,0,en

Family Life in China,"William R. Jankowiak, Robert L. Moore",John Wiley & Sons,2016-11-28,"The family has long been viewed as both a microcosm of the state and a barometer of social change in China. It is no surprise, therefore, that the dramatic changes experienced by Chinese society over the past century have produced a wide array of new family systems. Where a widely accepted Confucian-based ideology once offered a standard framework for family life, current ideas offer no such uniformity. Ties of affection rather than duty have become prominent in determining what individuals feel they owe to their spouses, parents, children, and others. Chinese millennials, facing a world of opportunities and, at the same time, feeling a sense of heavy obligation, are reshaping patterns of courtship, marriage, and filiality in ways that were not foreseen by their parents nor by the authorities of the Chinese state. Those whose roots are in the countryside but who have left their homes to seek opportunity and adventure in the city face particular pressures as do the children and elders they have left behind. The authors explore this diversity focusing on rural vs. urban differences, regionalism, and ethnic diversity within China. Family Life in China presents new perspectives on what the current changes in this institution imply for a rapidly changing society.",Business & Economics,165,N/A,0,en

"Law, Family, and Women",Thomas Kuehn,University of Chicago Press,2015-08-07,"Focusing on Florence, Thomas Kuehn demonstrates the formative influence of law on Italian society during the Renaissance, especially in the spheres of family and women. Kuehn's use of legal sources along with letters, diaries, and contemporary accounts allows him to present a compelling image of the social processes that affected the shape and function of the law. The numerous law courts of Italian city-states constantly devised and revised statutes. Kuehn traces the permutations of these laws, then examines their use by Florentines to arbitrate conflict and regulate social behavior regarding such issues as kinship, marriage, business, inheritance, illlegitimacy, and gender. Ranging from one man's embittered denunciation of his father to another's reaction to his kinsmen's rejection of him as illegitimate, Law, Family, and Women provides fascinating evidence of the tensions riddling family life in Renaissance Florence. Kuehn shows how these same tensions, often articulated in and through the law, affected women. He examines the role of the mundualdus—a male legal guardian for women—in Florence, the control of fathers over their married daughters, and issues of inheritance by and through women. An ambitious attempt to reformulate the agenda of Renaissance social history, Kuehn's work will be of value to both legal anthropologists and social historians. Thomas Kuehn is professor of history at Clemson University.",History,430,N/A,0,en

"Chinese Visions of Family and State, 1915-1953",Susan L. Glosser,Univ of California Press,2003-02-12,"At the dawn of the twentieth century, China's sovereignty was fragile at best. In the face of international pressure and domestic upheaval, young urban radicals—desperate for reforms that would save their nation—clamored for change, championing Western-inspired family reform and promoting free marriage choice and economic and emotional independence. But what came to be known as the New Culture Movement had the unwitting effect of fostering totalitarianism. In this wide-reaching, engrossing book, Susan Glosser examines how the link between family order and national salvation affected state-building and explores its lasting consequences. Glosser effectively argues that the replacement of the authoritarian, patriarchal, extended family structure with an egalitarian, conjugal family was a way for the nation to preserve crucial elements of its traditional culture. Her comprehensive research shows that in the end, family reform paved the way for the Chinese Communist Party to establish a deeply intrusive state that undermined the legitimacy of individual rights.",History,298,N/A,0,en

The modern family is not e~in declinee(tm); its history is a success story. It is stable, unsociable, emotionally potent. Over the past three centuries it has turned its back on society. It is less remarkable for rebellious children than for the remorseless pressures it can exert upon the young, particularly for e~successe(tm) in the school system. In the home-centred society the school is an extension of the home, created in its image. Academic success seems most certain when the e~good homee(tm) and the e~good schoole(tm) form a determined alliance. The combined pressures of home and school often seem to produce withdrawn, self-disparaging and negative young men and women. The author argues that the good school must counter-act many of the influences of the good home and that the educational system must re-order its affairs so that it is able to encourage and assess achievement which comes from joy rather than neurotic drive.",Community and school,0,N/A,0,en

Then the biblical and theological arguments for daily family worship in are examined drawing from the Old and New Testaments as well as the classic authors. Once the case for family worship has been made, Johnson then moves on to develop the elements or practices of which family worship consists, as well as helpful tips for establishing the discipline practice of family worship.

The book covers an impressive range of topics and issues - marital happiness, adjustment of children in divorce marriages, gay marriage, sibling ties, ethnic families of colour, stepfamilies, aggression culture, work and family, religion, and social policy, to name a few. In summary, this superb volume is highly recommended and amply reflects the many contemporary perspectives on the family."" --Philip Siebler, Monash University, VictoriaSponsored by the National Council on Family Relations, the Sourcebook of Family Theory and Research is the reference work on theory and methods for family scholars and students around the world. This volume provides a diverse, eclectic, and paradoxically mature approach to theorizing and demonstrates how the development of theory is crucial to the future of family research. The Sourcebook reflects an interactive approach that focuses on the process of theory building and designing research, thereby engaging readers in ""doing"" theory rather than simply reading about it. An accompanying website offers additional participation and interaction in the process of doing theory and making science. Editors Vern L. Bengtson, Alan C. Acock, Katherine R. Allen, Peggye Dilworth-Anderson, and David M. Klein have brought together a prominent group of diverse contributors ranging in race and ethnicity, age and seniority, and gender and sexual orientation. The Sourcebook begins with a section that sets the context for future family research. The subsequent sections explore changing family patterns, changing family interactions within and across generations, and families and larger social forces. A concluding section discusses issues of teaching family theories and research.Key Features Focuses on the process rather than the outcomes of family theory and research methods Emphasizes the value of multi-methods approaches in family research by integrating theory development with the development of research methods Differs from many other publications on family research by describing the development of new ideas rather than just summarizing existing findings The interactive Web site and the special feature boxes within the chapters engage readers with theory and methodology. Boxed features include Case Studies, Spotlights on Theory, Spotlights on Methods, and a Discussion and Extension sections. Represents a ""Who′s Who"" of family researchers with contributions from many of the best researchers in the family realm The Sourcebook will be an excellent addition to any academic library. It is an authoritative reference for scholars and researchers in Human Development and Family Studies, Sociology, Social Work, and Psychology. In addition, the Sourcebook can also be used in graduate courses on family theory and methodology.",Family & Relationships,692,3,1,en

Unshared Care,Caroline Glendinning,Routledge & Kegan Paul Books,1983,"The vast majority of the 100,000 or so children with serious mental or physical disabilities in Britain today live at home with their families. A series of in-depth interviews carried out with a number of parents enabled the author to describe the extensive physical, practical and emotional demands made on those looking after their disabled child at home. In their own words, parents report how and when they learnt about their child's disability; the sheer physical work and mental effort of daily care which more often than not fall unremittingly on the child's mother; the feelings of isolation and the lack of information which are often relieved only by talking with parents of other disabled children. Unshared Care examines the community services available, revealing that, from the parents' point of view, the rhetoric of public concern is only barely matched by the practical support available. It shows that services are, all too often, insufficiently specialized and lacking in coherence.",Family & Relationships,300,N/A,0,en

Reflecting the aim of the Symposium itself, the book provides in-depth reflections on work, employment and social protection. Designed to be more than an account of the discussions, this book is a useful tool for all those interested in labour market transition and the increasing importance of female labour for the future of the labour markets, particularly in the developed world. The book discusses the need for more family friendly policies and a more radical policy of equality between the sexes.

Make Room for TV,Lynn Spigel,University of Chicago Press,1992-06,"Between 1948 and 1955, nearly two-thirds of all American families bought a television set—and a revolution in social life and popular culture was launched. In this fascinating book, Lynn Spigel chronicles the enormous impact of television in the formative years of the new medium: how, over the course of a single decade, television became an intimate part of everyday life. What did Americans expect from it? What effects did the new daily ritual of watching television have on children? Was television welcomed as an unprecedented ""window on the world,"" or as a ""one-eyed monster"" that would disrupt households and corrupt children? Drawing on an ambitious array of unconventional sources, from sitcom scripts to articles and advertisements in women's magazines, Spigel offers the fullest available account of the popular response to television in the postwar years. She chronicles the role of television as a focus for evolving debates on issues ranging from the ideal of the perfect family and changes in women's role within the household to new uses of domestic space. The arrival of television did more than turn the living room into a private theater: it offered a national stage on which to play out and resolve conflicts about the way Americans should live. Spigel chronicles this lively and contentious debate as it took place in the popular media. Of particular interest is her treatment of the way in which the phenomenon of television itself was constantly deliberated—from how programs should be watched to where the set was placed to whether Mom, Dad, or kids should control the dial. Make Room for TV combines a powerful analysis of the growth of electronic culture with a nuanced social history of family life in postwar America, offering a provocative glimpse of the way television became the mirror of so many of America's hopes and fears and dreams.",Family & Relationships,250,4,1,en

They Took the Kids Last Night,Diane L. Redleaf,Praeger,2018-11-02,"This account of six families whose children were wrongly seized by child protection services vividly illustrates the constitutional balancing act where medicine, family interests, and child safety can clash. They Took the Kids Last Night shows a rarely exposed side of America's contemporary struggle to address child abuse, telling the stories of loving families who were almost destroyed by false allegations—readily accepted by caseworkers, doctors, the media, and, too often, the courts. Each of the six wrongly accused families profiled in this book faced an epic and life-changing battle when child protection caseworkers came to their homes to take their kids. In each case, a child had an injury whose cause was unknown; it could have been due to an accident, a medical condition, or abuse. Each family ultimately exonerated itself and restored its family life, but still bears scars from the experience that will never disappear. The book tells why and how the child protection system failed these families. It also examines the larger flaws in our country's child protection safety net that is supposed to sort out the innocent from the guilty in order to protect children.",Family & Relationships,0,N/A,0,en

Too Much and Never Enough,Mary L. Trump,Simon and Schuster,2022-01-04,"In this revelatory, authoritative portrait of Donald J. Trump and the toxic family that made him, Mary L. Trump, a trained clinical psychologist and Donald’s only niece, shines a bright light on the dark history of their family in order to explain how her uncle became the man who now threatens the world’s health, economic security, and social fabric. Mary Trump spent much of her childhood in her grandparents’ large, imposing house in the heart of Queens, New York, where Donald and his four siblings grew up. She describes a nightmare of traumas, destructive relationships, and a tragic combination of neglect and abuse. She explains how specific events and general family patterns created the damaged man who occupied the Oval Office, including the strange and harmful relationship between Fred Trump and his two oldest sons, Fred Jr. and Donald. A firsthand witness to countless holiday meals and interactions, Mary brings an incisive wit and unexpected humor to sometimes grim, often confounding family events. She recounts in unsparing detail everything from her uncle Donald’s place in the family spotlight and Ivana’s penchant for regifting to her grandmother’s frequent injuries and illnesses and the appalling way Donald, Fred Trump’s favorite son, dismissed and derided him when he began to succumb to Alzheimer’s. Numerous pundits, armchair psychologists, and journalists have sought to parse Donald J. Trump’s lethal flaws. Mary L. Trump has the education, insight, and intimate familiarity needed to reveal what makes Donald, and the rest of her clan, tick. She alone can recount this fascinating, unnerving saga, not just because of her insider’s perspective but also because she is the only Trump willing to tell the truth about one of the world’s most powerful and dysfunctional families.",Biography & Autobiography,240,N/A,0,en

Call Me Steve,Les O'Brien,FriesenPress,2018-04-30,"“Lengang’arangetengop. At no time in human history has a book started with that name, I bet.” And so begins the true story of a Calgary man’s life-changing journey to Africa and the start of his life-long friendship with a Samburu warrior with an impossibly long name. On his first day at a Kenyan nature reserve, elephant expert Les O’Brien finds himself sought out by a park guide who is hungry to learn from him. But the tables quickly turn, and soon Lengang’arangetengop – who graciously allows tourists to call him “Steve” and his friends to call him “Tilas” – becomes the teacher. Tilas not only shares his knowledge of his environment and the beauty of Africa with his new friend, he also teaches him about the way of the Samburu – a semi-nomadic people who carry everything they own with them as they travel the African plains. From his new friend, Les learns about loyalty, friendship, responsibility, environmental stewardship, and how to be a better human.

Philanthropy in Toni Morrison’s Oeuvre,Rico Hollmach,Cambridge Scholars Publishing,2018-11-07,"This book examines Toni Morrison’s highly influential works through the lens of philanthropy. The point of departure of this endeavor is the keen observation that philanthropy has always played a leading role in US discourses about the nation itself. While doing so, time and again philanthropy has also been used as a means of social stratification – especially for so-called social minorities such as the African American community, whose historical experience within the United States is at the very heart of Morrison’s novels. This book pursues the goal of a twofold understanding – on the one hand, through offering a rather innovative access to Morrison’s works, the project allows for new insights into one of today’s most influential authors. On the other hand, this book explores the productivity of the concept of philanthropy for literary and cultural studies – a concept hitherto largely neglected by scholars in both academic fields.",Literary Criticism,302,N/A,0,en

"Differential Geometry, Lie Groups, and Symmetric Spaces",Sigurdur Helgason,American Mathematical Soc.,2001-06-12,"A great book ... a necessary item in any mathematical library. --S. S. Chern, University of California A brilliant book: rigorous, tightly organized, and covering a vast amount of good mathematics. --Barrett O'Neill, University of California This is obviously a very valuable and well thought-out book on an important subject. --Andre Weil, Institute for Advanced Study The study of homogeneous spaces provides excellent insights into both differential geometry and Lie groups. In geometry, for instance, general theorems and properties will also hold for homogeneous spaces, and will usually be easier to understand and to prove in this setting. For Lie groups, a significant amount of analysis either begins with or reduces to analysis on homogeneous spaces, frequently on symmetric spaces. For many years and for many mathematicians, Sigurdur Helgason's classic Differential Geometry, Lie Groups, and Symmetric Spaces has been--and continues to be--the standard source for this material. Helgason begins with a concise, self-contained introduction to differential geometry. Next is a careful treatment of the foundations of the theory of Lie groups, presented in a manner that since 1962 has served as a model to a number of subsequent authors. This sets the stage for the introduction and study of symmetric spaces, which form the central part of the book. The text concludes with the classification of symmetric spaces by means of the Killing-Cartan classification of simple Lie algebras over $\mathbb{C}$ and Cartan's classification of simple Lie algebras over $\mathbb{R}$, following a method of Victor Kac. The excellent exposition is supplemented by extensive collections of useful exercises at the end of each chapter. All of the problems have either solutions or substantial hints, found at the back of the book. For this edition, the author has made corrections and added helpful notes and useful references.

Adenosine,"Susan Masino, Detlev Boison",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-08-30,"Homeostasis of key metabolites and metabolic health affects all bodily systems. Not surprisingly, altered metabolic function is associated with a wide spectrum of dysfunctions in the central nervous system – including developmental disorders, acute nervous system injury, and neurodegenerative disorders. Accordingly, metabolism-based therapies offer significant promise as new category of treatment options designed to limit, delay or reverse the disease process by reconstructing homeostatic functions. Increasingly it is appreciated that restoring metabolic health could promote normal nervous system activity, and improve behavior and cognition. Adenosine: A Key Link Between Metabolism and Central Nervous System Activity focusses on diverse aspects of adenosine, an evolutionarily conserved homeostatic bioenergetic regulator in the central nervous system. Because of its interrelationship with ATP (adenosine triphosphate), adenosine is integral to cell metabolism. At the same time, adenosine influences neuronal activity directly via receptors, and is involved in biochemical processes related to gene expression. Thus, adenosine is uniquely placed as a reciprocal and rapid link between changes in metabolism and changes in neuronal activity, and, on a longer time scale, to changes in gene expression and long term changes in cell function. Leaders in the field feature basic research on adenosine at the cellular level in the central nervous system, and relate these findings to its recognized potential in diverse acute and chronic disorders. This comprehensive overview of adenosine also highlights emerging adenosine-based treatments and associated opportunities for central nervous system disorders.",Medical,680,N/A,0,en
Early Career Academics in New Zealand: Challenges and Prospects in Comparative Perspective,Kathryn A.

What challenges and prospects are new academics facing and how are they dealing with these? This book provides answers to these questions through an investigation of the experiences of early career academics in New Zealand universities. Filling a gap in the international literature on the academic profession by providing a comprehensive overview of the experiences of New Zealand academics, the book includes research findings from a national survey covering all eight New Zealand universities. This research is also compared with various findings from the 2007 Changing Academic Profession survey in 19 other countries. The book encourages readers to think about the early career academic experience in New Zealand in relation to their own experiences of the academic profession internationally. Key areas of focus in the nine chapters include: the teaching, research, and service preferences and activities of early career academics; work-life balance; satisfaction; the experiences of Māori academics; and professional development and support for all early career academics. Underpinning the book is the issue of the socialisation of early career academics into the academic profession in the twenty first century, and how structure and agency interact to affect that socialisation.

Buddhists, with a long history of resistance to the Chinese Han majority, the Lahu are currently facing a serious collapse of their traditional social system, with the highest suicide rate in the world, large scale human trafficking of their women, alcoholism and poverty. This book, based on extensive original research including long-term anthropological research among the Lahu, provides an overview of the traditional way of life of the Lahu, their social system, culture and beliefs, and discusses the ways in which these are changing. It shows how the Lahu are especially vulnerable because of their lack of political representatives and a state educated elite which can engage with, and be part of, the government administrative system.

In the past, research into this issue has remained very general despite the enormous weight economics put on the entire divorce process. This book concentrates on elements specifically relevant to the economic variables of divorce. It focuses on the issues of work, employment, and financial support after divorce and how these issues affect the parents, children, and home environments of divorced families. The research presented not only provides insights into the economic aspects of divorce, but it is also invaluable to the entire study of divorce and remarriage as it explores the personal impact of these issues.Geared toward anyone working with divorced families, whether they are clinicians, educators, mediators, or attorneys, The Economics of Divorce is also of use to members of divorced or remarried families. The book contains demographics on the financial lives of custodial parents who remarry, custodial parents who work, and the financial support of college students from divorced families. It offers a close study of the realities of single parenting and reentering the work force, as well as the economic consequences of marital dissolution. The Economics of Divorce is unique in that it is the first publication of its kind to formally identify the economic results of divorcing and remarried families.

Lessons from Laron Syndrome (LS) 1966-1992,"Zvi Laron, John S. Parks",Karger Medical and Scientific Publishers,1993-01-01,"Laron Syndrome (LS) is a disease characterized by resistance to growth hormone (GH) and caused by molecular defects of the GH receptor, leading to a deficiency of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and a significant impairment of growth. The syndrome is a unique human model of a peptide hormone receptor defect and GH-IGF-1 interaction. It offers the opportunity to study the consequences of long-term IGF-1 deficiency and the role of IGF-1 in growth and metabolism. With the recent biosynthesis of IGF-1 and the initiation of IGF-1 therapy, a whole new world of basic biological interactions is opening up. This volume brings together leading researchers in genetics, endocrinology, pediatrics, biochemistry, physiology and pharmacology to summarize what is now known about LS, and to discuss the lessons learned from studying and treating this disease since its initial description in 1966. Special features include the demography of LS, and the first data on the long-term IGF-1 treatment of a large group of patients.",Medical,384,N/A,0,en

COLT '89,COLT,Morgan Kaufmann,2014-06-28,"Computational Learning Theory presents the theoretical issues in machine learning and computational models of learning. This book covers a wide range of problems in concept learning, inductive inference, and pattern recognition. Organized into three parts encompassing 32 chapters, this book begins with an overview of the inductive principle based on weak convergence of probability measures. This text then examines the framework for constructing learning algorithms. Other chapters consider the formal theory of learning, which is learning in the sense of improving computational efficiency as opposed to concept learning. This book discusses as well the informed parsimonious (IP) inference that generalizes the compatibility and weighted parsimony techniques, which are most commonly applied in biology. The final chapter deals with the construction of prediction algorithms in a situation in which a learner faces a sequence of trials, with a prediction to be given in each and the goal of the learner is to make some mistakes.

No Family Is an Island,Ilana M. Gershon,Cornell University Press,2012-05-15,"Government bureaucracies across the globe have become increasingly attuned in recent years to cultural diversity within their populations. Using culture as a category to process people and dispense services, however, can create its own problems and unintended consequences. In No Family Is an Island, a comparative ethnography of Samoan migrants living in the United States and New Zealand, Ilana Gershon investigates how and when the categories ""cultural"" and ""acultural"" become relevant for Samoans as they encounter cultural differences in churches, ritual exchanges, welfare offices, and community-based organizations. In both New Zealand and the United States, Samoan migrants are minor minorities in an ethnic constellation dominated by other minority groups. As a result, they often find themselves in contexts where the challenge is not to establish the terms of the debate but to rewrite them. To navigate complicated and often unyielding bureaucracies, they must become skilled in what Gershon calls ""reflexive engagement"" with the multiple social orders they inhabit. Those who are successful are able to parlay their own cultural expertise (their ""Samoanness"") into an ability to subtly alter the institutions with which they interact in their everyday lives. Just as the ""cultural"" is sometimes constrained by the forces exerted by acultural institutions, so too can migrant culture reshape the bureaucracies of their new countries. Theoretically sophisticated yet highly readable, No Family Is an Island contributes significantly to our understanding of the modern immigrant experience of making homes abroad.",Social Science,207,N/A,0,en

Family Transformed,"Steven M. Tipton, John Witte Jr.",Georgetown University Press,2005-11-18,"Statistics on the American family are sobering. From 1975 to 2000, one-third of all children were born to single mothers, and one-half of all marriages ended in divorce. While children from broken homes are two to three times more likely to develop behavioral and learning difficulties, two-parent families are not immune to problems. The cost of raising children has increased dramatically, and married couples with children are now twice as likely as childless couples to file for bankruptcy. Clearly, the American family is in trouble. But how this trouble started, and what should be done about it, remain hotly contested. In a multifaceted analysis of the current state of a complex institution, Family Transformed brings together outstanding scholars from the fields of anthropology, demography, ethics, history, law, philosophy, primatology, psychology, sociology, and theology. Demonstrating that the family is both distinctive in its own right and deeply interwoven with other institutions, the authors examine the roles of education, work, leisure, consumption, legal regulation, public administration, and biology in shaping the ways we court and marry, bear and raise children, and make and break family bonds. International in approach, this wide-ranging volume situates current American debates over sex, marriage, and family within a global framework. Weighing mounting social science evidence that supports a continued need for the nuclear family while assessing the challenges posed by new advocacy for same-sex marriage, and delegalized coupling, the authors argue that only by reintegrating the family into a just moral order of the larger community and society can we genuinely strengthen it. This means not simply upholding traditional family values but truly grasping the family's growing diversity, sustaining its coherence, and protecting its fragility for our own sake and for the common good of society.",Social Science,332,N/A,0,en

Family Theories,"James M. White, Todd F. Martin, Kari Adamsons",SAGE Publications,2018-12-20,"Family Theories: An Introduction by James M. White, Todd F. Martin, and new co-author Kari Adamsons provides an incisive, thorough primer to current theories of the family that balances the diversity and richness of a broad scope of scholarly work in a concise manner. This best-selling text draws upon eight major theoretical frameworks developed by key social scientists to explain variation in family life. These frameworks include social exchange and choice, symbolic-interaction, family life course development, systems, conflict, feminist, ecological, and functional theories. This new Fifth Edition includes suggestions for integrating theory to guide a research program and more applications for those going on to careers in the helping professions. With an increased focus on both classical theories as well as contemporary and emerging theories, this text challenges students to think about how families and family theories have changed over the last 70 years as well as where family scholarship is headed.",Social Science,361,N/A,0,en

Inside the Multi-Generational Family Business,Mark Green,Macmillan,2011-04-26,"Inside the Multi-Generational Family Business is an inside look at how familial relationships affect the success or the failure of the family business. Many family business owners encounter conflict between siblings, children, and other relatives—especially when they're all involved with the business. The author’s message is simple: family businesses today are saddled with “generational stack-up,” or the convergence of several generations as owners, managers, employees, and shareholders, often without even knowing it. Each generation has its own work style, biases, and approach to money and business. Through detailed analysis of the various generations and the characteristics that define them in the family business, a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of the family in the family business can move the multi-generational family business from chaos and conflict to true collaboration and improved performance.",Business & Economics,210,N/A,0,en

The Collected Scientific Papers of Paul A. Samuelson,Paul Anthony Samuelson,"Cambridge, Mass. : M.I.T. Press",1966,"It is a measure of Professor Samuelson's preeminence that the sheer scale of his work should be so much taken for granted, observes a reviewer in the Economist who goes on to note that a cynic might add that it would have been better for Professor Samuelson to write less merely to give others a chance to write at all. When Professor Samuelson was awarded the 1970 Nobel Prize in economics, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in its citation that he ""has done more than any other contemporary economist to raise the level of scientific analysis in economic theory... {Samuelson's] extensive production, covering nearly all areas of economic theory, is characterized by an outstanding ability to derive important new theorems, and to find new applications for existing ones."" In 1966, The MIT Press published the first two volumes of The Collected Scientific Papers of Paul A. Samuelson, edited by joseph E. Stiglitz. These books contain virtually all of Professor Samuelson's contributions to economic theory through mid-1964 - a total of 129 papers collected from economic journals and books on current problems and including his classic articles on such topics as revealed preference, factor price equalization, and public goods, as well as articles that were privately circulated or buried in Festschriften, such as ""Market Maximization"" and ""The Structure of Minimal Equilibrium Systems."" Volume 3 contains 77 articles covering the period from mid-1964 to October 1971. Chapters are arranged in the manner of Volumes 1 and 2 - according to subject matter rather than chronologically and under the 18 section titles indicated by Stiglitz, plus an additional one. Characteristically, Professor Samuelson has moved on to an entirely new area - that of portfolio selection and warrant pricing theory, which includes the following articles: ""Proof that Properly Anticipated Prices Fluctuate Randomly"" - ""Rational Theory of Warrant Pricing that Maximizes Utility"" - ""General Proof that Diversification Pays"" - ""Efficient Portfolio Selection for Pareto-Levy Investments"" - ""The Fundamental Approximation Theorem of Portfolio Analysis in Terms of Means, Variances, and Higher Moments"" - ""Lifetime Portfolio Selection by Dynamic Stochastic Programming"" - ""Stochastic Speculative Price"" - ""The 'Fallacy' of Maximizing the Geometric Mean in Long Sequences of Investing and Gambling""",Business & Economics,954,N/A,0,en

Benjamin Franklin Bache and the Philadelphia Aurora,James Tagg,University of Pennsylvania Press Anniversary Collection,1991,"This is the first modern biography of Benjamin Franklin Bache, the grandson of Benjamin Franklin. Between the turbulent years of 1793 and 1798, Bache was the young nation's leading political journalist and a sharp critic of the Federalists and their policies. As editor of the most important radical newspaper of the 1790s, he lived at the center of most of the political storms of that decade. He defended the Democratic Societies as the earliest vehicles of public opinion; he strenuously opposed the ratification of the Jay Treaty, the central political event of the decade; he led and orchestrated the attack on George Washington in an attempt to curb growing executive authority; and his defense of French policies contributed to the sedition crisis of 1798. A primary target of the Federalist-sponsored Sedition Act, he was indicted for federal common law seditious libel before that act took effect. In 1798, at the height of the political hysteria, Bache died of yellow fever at the age of twenty-nine. Like Thomas Paine, to whom Bache was personally and ideologically connected, Bache was not a product of Whig Oppositionist or classical republican ideology. Yet neither was he an inheritor of a more thoroughly modem liberal ideal. Committed to rational self -interest, he promoted a civic vision and only partially embraced the newer world of nascent capitalism. James Tagg establishes the ideological and psychological framework of Bache's later radicalism by carefully examining Bache's childhood at Passy with his grandfather, his education in Geneva, and his adolescence in Philadelphia. Benjamin Franklin Bache and the Philadelphia Aurora will interest scholars and students of American history.",Biography & Autobiography,460,N/A,0,en

Mediation in Family Disputes,Marian Roberts,"Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.",2008-08-01,"This is the authoritative textbook on family mediation. As well as mediators, this work will be indispensable for practitioners and scholars across a wide range of fields, including social work and law. It draws on a wide cross-disciplinary theoretical literature and on the author's extensive and continuing practice experience. It encompasses developments in policy, research and practice in the UK and beyond. Roberts presents mediation as an aid to joint decision-making in the context of a range of family disputes, notably those involving children. Mediation is seen as a process of intervention distinct from legal, social work and therapeutic practice, drawing on a distinctive body of knowledge across disciplinary fields including anthropology, psychology and negotiation theory. Incorporating empirical evidence, the book emphasizes the value of mediation in mitigating the harmful effects of family breakdown and conflict. First published in 1988 as a pioneering work, this third edition has been fully updated to incorporate legal and policy developments in the UK and in Europe, new sociological and philosophical perspectives on respect, justice and conflict, and international research and practice innovations.",Social Science,293,N/A,0,en

Bianchi",SAGE Publications,2001-12-20,"Continuity and Change in the American Family engages students with issues they see every day in the news, providing them with a comprehensive description of the social demography of the American family. Understanding ever-changing family systems and patterns requires taking the pulse of contemporary family life from time to time. This book paints a portrait of family continuity and change in the later half of the 20th century, with a focus on data from the 1970′s to present. The authors explore such topics as the growth in cohabitation, changes in childbearing, and how these trends affect family life. Other topics include the changing lives of single mothers, fathers, and grandparents and increasing economic disparities among families; child care and child well-being; and combining paid work and family. The authors are talented writers who bring considerable professional and scholarly background to bear in illuminating this topic in a thoughtful yet lively presentation.",Family & Relationships,409,N/A,0,en

"Sex, Family, and the Culture Wars",Mark J. Cherry,Routledge,2017-07-05,"Extraordinary social and moral shifts have taken place in Western societies. Sex is no longer the exclusive province of husband and wife set within monogamous married family life. The world is awash in sex: advertising, books, magazines, movies, sex clubs, internet pornography, etc. Parents, traditionally responsible for guiding their children's moral and social development, have been effectively side-lined by commercial and governmental interests.This volume pursues a detailed study of how changes in social life dating from the sexual revolution of the 1960s have affected the family. Cherry shows that attempts to redefine the family away from the marital union of husband and wife come with real costs: social, emotional, psychological, and financial. He argues that while political campaigns have fuelled attempts to undermine the traditional family, to pretend it possesses no basic biological, social, or moral reality, such ideologically driven undertakings are injurious to society.Acting as if there are no consequential differences between traditional marriage and other sexual lifestyles ignores significant data demonstrating the importance of the traditional biological family to the well-being of men and women, and the successful raising of children. The family possesses a biological and moral being that is foundational; an essential building block of society. Cherry argues that the family is the most incontrovertible field of conflict in the culture wars; others might conclude that it is the decisive battleground.",Social Science,363,N/A,0,en
Family and Social Change,Angelique Janssens,Cambridge University Press,2002-04-18,"This book is a quantitative study into the influence of the process of industrialisation on the nature and strength of family relationships in a Dutch community between 1850 and 1920. The study makes use of the unique and unusually rich source of Dutch population registers, which enables the author to trace the history of individual households. The study closely relates aspects of family and household with the social processes characteristic of an industrialising society, such as increasing rates of social and geographical mobility and the shift of production from the home into the factory. Results reveal a striking continuity in the strength of nineteenth-century family relations despite the gradual but profound process of social change surrounding these families. Changes in behavioural patterns did occur, however, under the influence of changes in demographic rates, regional geographical mobility systems and local developments in the housing market. Nevertheless, these changes cannot be taken as a weakening of family relationships.",History,348,N/A,0,en

This ranges from the neuroendocrine control of eating to the effects of life-threatening disease on eating behavior. The importance of this contribution to the scientific literature lies in the fact that food and eating are an essential component of cultural heritage but the effects of perturbations in the food/cognitive axis can be profound. The complex interrelationship between neuropsychological processing, diet, and behavioral outcome is explored within the context of the most contemporary psychobiological research in the area. This comprehensive psychobiology- and pathology-themed text examines the broad spectrum of diet, behavioral, and neuropsychological interactions from normative function to occurrences of severe and enduring psychopathological processes.",Medical,3527,N/A,0,en

Work and Family in Urban China,Jiping Zuo,Springer,2016-08-27,"This book examines a three-way interaction among market, state, and family in China’s recent market reform. It depicts transformations in urban women’s experiences with both paid and non-paid domestic work. The book challenges China’s free-market approach and demonstrates its negative impacts on women’s work and family experiences by revealing labor commodification processes and work-to-family conflicts as the state abandons its commitment to public welfare. Using interview data collected from 165 women of three different cohorts in urban China during the 2000-2008 period, this study uncovers the revival of traditional gendered family roles among urban women and men as one of their strategies to resist market brutality and their struggles to balance work and family demands. The book also explores urban women’s non-market definitions of marital equality, and highlights theoretical and policy implications concerning market efficiency, marital equality, and the state’s role in protecting public good.",Political Science,223,N/A,0,en

What are communal families, and what impact do families have on how communes are run and how they develop? As the only contemporary exploration of communal families, this book investigates the assumptions that scholars and others have made regarding the status of the family within communes, and debunks current myths about communes and communal families. While some groups are predisposed to families, other communal groups become replacements or substitutes for the nuclear family. William L. Smith investigates a variety of practices, including monogamy, polygamy, pantagamy, and celibacy, as implemented by intentional communities in dealing with family life. Drawing on the history of communes in the United States, Smith discusses various communal groups, such as the Shakers, the Mormons, the Oneida Community, the Amana Colonies, as well as contemporary rural and urban communal groups such as Twin Oaks, Jesus People USA, and the Hutterites.

Considering the impact of family events, dinner table debates, intergenerational transmission of virtues and the role of the mother, this enlightening book draws on survey data from 1000 young people, a sample of their parents and grandparents, and extended family interviews, to uncover how civil engagement, activism and political participation are inherited and fostered within the home.",Political Science,216,N/A,0,en

International Human Rights Law and Crimes Against Women in Turkey,Ayşe Güneş,Routledge,2020-12-20,"This book evaluates the effectiveness of current international human rights law, and in particular the recent Istanbul Convention, in eradicating so-called honour killings in Turkey. So-called ‘honour killings’ have become an issue of concern for the international community. In Turkey, in particular, the practice still exists despite the adoption of the relevant human rights instruments. The book argues that the improvement of the status of women in Turkey in accordance with gender equality as well as the application of the principle of state due diligence, both requirements of the Istanbul Convention and international human rights law, are fundamental means towards eradicating the killing of women in the name of ‘honour’. Using feminist approaches, in particular the intersectionality approach, the study looks at the application of such standards as well as the current obstacles. Through such a lens, the study discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the Turkish Constitution, Turkish Civil Code, Turkish Penal Code and Law to Protect Family and Prevent Violence Against Women and questions the judicial approach to the implementation of the women’s right to life. It identifies the lacunae in the Turkish legislation that allow inadequate legal protection for women and the inconsistency of the judicial approach to the definition of the so-called honour killings in the judgements. The study then recommends some concrete amendments to the relevant legal provisions in order to better reflect the international framework and the feminist approaches. The book will be a valuable resource for academics, researchers and policy-makers in the areas of international human rights law and feminist legal theory.",Law,257,N/A,0,en

War and Society in Europe 1618-1648,"J. V.

It drew in virtually all of Europe, with the exception of England, and by 1650 no European country had entirely escaped the experience of violent conflict. Since the end of the Second World War historians in western and eastern Europe have been engaged in the task of reassuring the significance of the seventeenth century in general and the Thirty Years War in particular. They have formulated questions and attempted to answer them by using fresh sources. One especially rich depository is the archival system of Czechoslovakia. The seventeenth-century generals and diplomats of the Imperial side preserved masses of papers which usually found their way into family archives, many of them housed on Bohemian and Moravian landed estates. With the transfer of private archives into public hands after 1945, much new material became available to scholars.

Their conglomerates span sectors as diverse as real estate, telecommunications, hotels, industrial goods, computers and sugar plantations. New Asian Emperors shows how and why Overseas Chinese companies continue to dominate the region and have extended their reach in East Asia, despite the Asian financial and SARS crises of the past decade. The authors base their conclusions on in-depth structured interviews spanning a decade with the often elusive Overseas Chinese CEOs including Li Ka-shing, Stan Shih, Victor Fung, Stephen Riady and Sukanto Tanoto, as well as on the strategic information that their companies use. The analysis of the New Asian Emperors’ present-day management techniques and practices draws on the history, culture and philosophical perspectives of the Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia.

Handbook of Juvenile Forensic Psychology and Psychiatry,Elena L. Grigorenko,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-02-21,"Juvenile justice centers have a long tradition as an unfortunate stop for young offenders who need mental health care. Reports estimate that as many as 70% of the youth in detention centers meet criteria for mental health disorders. As juvenile justice systems once again turn their focus from confinement to rehabilitation, mental health providers have major opportunities to inform and improve both practice and policy. The Handbook of Juvenile Forensic Psychology and Psychiatry explores these opportunities by emphasizing a developmental perspective, multifaceted assessment, and evidence-based practice in working with juvenile offenders. This comprehensive volume provides insights at virtually every intersection of mental health practice and juvenile justice, covering areas as wide-ranging as special populations, sentencing issues, educational and pharmacological interventions, family involvement, ethical issues, staff training concerns, and emerging challenges. Together, its chapters contain guidelines not only for changing the culture of detention but also preventing detention facilities from being the venue of choice in placing troubled youth. Key issues addressed in the Handbook include: Developmental risks for delinquency. Race and sex disparities in juvenile justice processing. Establishing standards of practice in juvenile forensic mental health assessment. Serving dually diagnosed youth in the juvenile justice system. PTSD among court-involved youth. Female juvenile offenders. Juvenile sex offenders. The Handbook of Juvenile Forensic Psychology and Psychiatry is an essential reference for researchers, professors, allied clinicians and professionals, and policy makers across multiple fields, including child and school psychology, child and adolescent psychiatry, developmental psychology, criminology, juvenile justice, forensic psychology, neuropsychology, social work, and education.",Psychology,603,N/A,0,en
The Oxford Companion to United States History,Paul S. Boyer,Oxford University Press,2001-07-04,"Here is a volume that is as big and as varied as the nation it portrays. With over 1,400 entries written by some 900 historians and other scholars, it illuminates not only America's political, diplomatic, and military history, but also social, cultural, and intellectual trends; science, technology, and medicine; the arts; and religion. Here are the familiar political heroes, from George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, to Abraham Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson, and Franklin D. Roosevelt. But here, too, are scientists, writers, radicals, sports figures, and religious leaders, with incisive portraits of such varied individuals as Thomas Edison and Eli Whitney, Babe Ruth and Muhammed Ali, Black Elk and Crazy Horse, Margaret Fuller, Emma Goldman, and Marian Anderson, even Al Capone and Jesse James. The Companion illuminates events that have shaped the nation (the Great Awakening, Bunker Hill, Wounded Knee, the Vietnam War); major Supreme Court decisions (Marbury v. Madison, Roe v. Wade); landmark legislation (the Fugitive Slave Law, the Pure Food and Drug Act); social movements (Suffrage, Civil Rights); influential books (The Jungle, Uncle Tom's Cabin); ideologies (conservatism, liberalism, Social Darwinism); even natural disasters and iconic sites (the Chicago Fire, the Johnstown Flood, Niagara Falls, the Lincoln Memorial). Here too is the nation's social and cultural history, from Films, Football, and the 4-H Club, to Immigration, Courtship and Dating, Marriage and Divorce, and Death and Dying. Extensive multi-part entries cover such key topics as the Civil War, Indian History and Culture, Slavery, and the Federal Government.

"Women, the Family, and Peasant Revolution in China",Kay Ann Johnson,University of Chicago Press,2009-02-15,"Kay Ann Johnson provides much-needed information about women and gender equality under Communist leadership. She contends that, although the Chinese Communist Party has always ostensibly favored women's rights and family reform, it has rarely pushed for such reforms. In reality, its policies often have reinforced the traditional role of women to further the Party's predominant economic and military aims. Johnson's primary focus is on reforms of marriage and family because traditional marriage, family, and kinship practices have had the greatest influence in defining and shaping women's place in Chinese society. Conversant with current theory in political science, anthropology, and Marxist and feminist analysis, Johnson writes with clarity and discernment free of dogma. Her discussions of family reform ultimately provide insights into the Chinese government's concern with decreasing the national birth rate, which has become a top priority. Johnson's predictions of a coming crisis in population control are borne out by the recent increase in female infanticide and the government abortion campaign.",Social Science,292,N/A,0,en
Private International Law in BRICS,"Stellina Jolly, Saloni Khanderia",Bloomsbury Publishing,2024-08-08,"This book examines the convergences, divergences and reciprocal lessons that the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) share with one another in developing the principles of private international law. The chapters provide a thematic understanding of the cornerstones of private international law in each of the BRICS countries: namely, (1) the procedure to initiate claims in civil and commercial matters, (2) the law that would govern such matters in litigation and arbitration, as well as (3) the mechanism to recognise and enforce foreign judgments and arbitral awards. Written by leading private international law scholars and practitioners, the chapters draw on domestic legislation and its interpretation through cases decided by the courts in each of these emerging economies, and explicitly cover the rules applicable in contractual and non-contractual concerns and issues of choice of court agreements. Issues around marriage, divorce, matrimonial property, succession and surrogacy are also addressed, considering the implication of such aspects through the increased movement of persons.

"Adolescents, Family and Consumer Behaviour","Harleen Kaur, Chandan Deep Singh",Routledge,2019-12-20,"Buying decision making is a complicated process, in which a consumer’s decision is under the influence of others. The buyer’s decision making is directed in such a way that they must act as a consumer in society. Media and family are key socializing agents for adolescents. Moreover, changes in the socio-cultural environment in India necessitate that adolescents’ influence in family’s buying decision making should be investigated. In comparison to Western society, Indian society is quite different when compared in terms of family composition and structure, behavior, values and norms which impact adolescents’ buying decision making. Adolescents, Family and Consumer Behaviour studies the role of consumer socialization agents for adolescents, examining socio-economic factors that influence adolescents’ buying decision making in Indian urban families. It aims to discover the influence tactics that adolescents employ and to qualitatively analyse how marketers in turn influence adolescents. It addresses the topics with regard to strategic management and marketing and will be of interest to researchers, academics, practitioners, and students in the fields of management, entrepreneurship, small business management, and human resource management.",Business & Economics,203,N/A,0,en

"Illegitimacy, Family, and Stigma in England, 1660-1834","Kate Gibson, Leverhulme Early Career Fellow Kate Gibson",Oxford University Press,2022-07-08,"Illegitimacy, Family, and Stigma is the first full-length exploration of what it was like to be illegitimate in eighteenth-century England, a period of 'sexual revolution', unprecedented increase in illegitimate births, and intense debate over children's rights to state support. Using the words of illegitimate individuals and their families preserved in letters, diaries, poor relief, and court documents, this study reveals the impact of illegitimacy across the life cycle. How did illegitimacy affect children's early years, and their relationships with parents, siblings, and wider family as they grew up? Did illegitimacy limit education, occupation, or marriage chances? What were individuals' experiences of shame and stigma, and how did being illegitimate affect their sense of identity? Historian Kate Gibson investigates the circumstances that governed families' responses, from love and pragmatic acceptance, to secrecy and exclusion. In a major reframing of assumptions that illegitimacy was experienced only among the poor, this volume tells the stories of individuals from across the socio-economic scale, including children of royalty, physicians and lawyers, servants and agricultural labourers. It demonstrates that the stigma of illegitimacy operated along a spectrum, varying according to the type of parental relationship, the child's race, gender, and socio-economic status. Financial resources and the class-based ideals of parenthood or family life had a significant impact on how families reacted to illegitimacy. Class became more important over the eighteenth century, under the influence of Enlightenment ideals of tolerance, sensibility, and redemption. The child of sin was now recast as a pitiable object of charity, but this applied only to those who could fit narrow parameters of genteel tragedy. This vivid investigation of the meaning of illegitimacy gets to the heart of powerful inequalities in families, communities, and the state.",England,314,N/A,0,en

Behavioral Health Services with High-Risk Infants and Families,"Allison G. Dempsey, Joanna C. M. Cole, Sage N. Saxton",Oxford University Press,2022,"""The availability of services provided by psychologists in perinatal care is a relatively recent event. It remains uncommon for a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to have a psychologist as a dedicated staff member, although the number of NICU psychologists is increasing. This volume is primarily concerned with perinatal services provided by psychologists. I do, however, want to make note at the beginning of the valuable role of social workers as a complement to the care offered by psychologists. Social workers have been available in NICUs since the mid-1960s. The National Association of Perinatal Social Workers (NAPSW) was founded in 1980 to help standardize training and services. The initial focus of perinatal social workers was service delivery in the NICU, but social work services soon spread to antepartum care and follow-up. NAPSW has published an excellent set of standards for a variety of activities including fertility counseling, bereavement, obstetric settings, adoptions, field education, and surrogacy. Some activities of social workers overlap with those of psychologists, but each discipline has its own set of unique skills. Social workers are often involved in case and crisis management, bedside family support, and discharge planning in the NICU""--",Medical,489,N/A,0,en

Family and Gender Among American Muslims,"Barbara C.

In the final section, some of these issues are given a personal dimension through the life stories of several immigrants who relate their own experiences of adjusting to life in America.

Optimality in Infinite Horizon Economies,"Anders Borglin, Hans Keiding",Springer,1986-05,"Modern welfare economics as it is known today to economists took its final shape with the emergence of the Arrow-Debreu model. The classical conjectures about the beneficient workings of markets together with the converse statement, that optimal (in the sense of Pareto) allocations may be sustained by prices and markets, has laid a firm foundation for further research in welfare economics. But more than that, it has inspired researchers to take up entirely new topics, notably by closer considerations of situations where the assumptions of the original model may seem overly restrictive. One of these new directions has been connected with generalizing the model so that it takes into account the possibility of infinitely many commodities. On the face of it, the idea of an infinity of commodities may seem a mathematical fancy having no ""real"" counterpart in economic life. This is not so, however. Quite to the contrary, infinity enters in a very natural way when it is taken into account that economic transactions take place over time. 2 In the Arrow-Debreu formalism, time may be incorporated into the model in a very simple way using dated commodities. Thus two commodities are considered as being different if they are to be delivered at different points of time.",Business & Economics,196,N/A,0,en

Making Work and Family Work,"Jeffrey H. Greenhaus, Gary N.

Leading scholars Jeffrey Greenhaus and Gary Powell begin by identifying the factors that work against an employee's ability to be effective and satisfied in their work and family roles. From there, they examine a variety of factors that impact the decision-making process that employees and their families can use to enhance employees' feelings of work-family balance and families' well-being. Covering a comprehensive set of topics and perspectives, this fascinating book will appeal to upper-level students of human resource management, organizational behavior, industrial/organizational psychology, sociology, and economics, as well as to thoughtful and engaged professionals.",,164,N/A,0,en

Hillbilly Elegy,J D Vance,Harper Large Print,2024-10,"Hillbilly Elegy recounts J.D. Vance's powerful origin story... From a former marine and Yale Law School graduate now serving as a U.S. Senator from Ohio and the Republican Vice Presidential candidate for the 2024 election, an incisive account of growing up in a poor Rust Belt town that offers a broader, probing look at the struggles of America's white working class. THE #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER ""You will not read a more important book about America this year.""--The Economist ""A riveting book.""--The Wall Street Journal ""Essential reading.""--David Brooks, New York Times Hillbilly Elegy is a passionate and personal analysis of a culture in crisis--that of white working-class Americans. The disintegration of this group, a process that has been slowly occurring now for more than forty years, has been reported with growing frequency and alarm, but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside. J. D. Vance tells the true story of what a social, regional, and class decline feels like when you were born with it hung around your neck. The Vance family story begins hopefully in postwar America. J. D.'s grandparents were ""dirt poor and in love,"" and moved north from Kentucky's Appalachia region to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. They raised a middle-class family, and eventually one of their grandchildren would graduate from Yale Law School, a conventional marker of success in achieving generational upward mobility. But as the family saga of Hillbilly Elegy plays out, we learn that J.D.'s grandparents, aunt, uncle, and, most of all, his mother struggled profoundly with the demands of their new middle-class life, never fully escaping the legacy of abuse, alcoholism, poverty, and trauma so characteristic of their part of America. With piercing honesty, Vance shows how he himself still carries around the demons of his chaotic family history. A deeply moving memoir, with its share of humor and vividly colorful figures, Hillbilly Elegy is the story of how upward mobility really feels. And it is an urgent and troubling meditation on the loss of the American dream for a large segment of this country.",Biography & Autobiography,0,N/A,0,en

Competing Devotions,Mary Blair-Loy,Harvard University Press,2009-07,"The wrenching decision facing successful women who must choose between demanding careers and intensive family lives has been the subject of many articles and books, most of which propose strategies for resolving the dilemma. Competing Devotions focuses on broader social and cultural forces that create women's identities and shape their understanding of what makes life worth living. Mary Blair-Loy examines the career paths of women financial executives who have tried various approaches to balancing career and family. These mavericks, who face great resistance but are aided by new ideological and material resources that come with historical change, may eventually redefine both the nuclear family and the capitalist firm in ways that reduce work-family conflict.Table of Contents: Introduction 1 The Devotion to Work Schema 2 The Devotion to Family Schema 3 Reinventing Schemas: Creating Part-Time Careers 4 Reinventing Schemas: Family Life among Full-Time Executive Women 5 Turning Points 6 Implications Appendix: Methods and Data Notes References Acknowledgments Index Many professional women intuit that male colleagues whose spouse handle for them the details of everyday life are favored in the workplace. Blair-Loy confirms this intuition and shows us how it happens. She captures how the cultural schemas of ""family devotion"" and ""work devotion"" contribute to the reproduction of gender inequality, and how meeting the demands of a husband's job and other people's needs push professional women to progressively abandon their work to take care of others. Her analysis also gives us hope by comparing the fate of pre and post-baby boomers. This is both an important scholarly contribution and a book that will help readers think differently about their lives. It should be required reading for professional women who aspire to maintain multidimensional lives.--Mich'le Lamont, author of The Dignity of Working Men: Morality and the Boundaries of Race, Class, and ImmigrationThis is a fascinating book with an important message. Blair-Loy's findings are surprising. She challenges conventional viewpoints. She is on to something really new when she writes about not only the interplay between cultural norms and individual actions (and institutional structures) but on the cultural schemas that evoke deep emotional resonances. An outstanding book.--Cynthia Fuchs-Epstein, author of Deceptive Distinctions: Sex, Gender and the Social OrderMary Blair-Loy's book transcends old debates about work and family by examining the women who have beaten the odds and risen to the top. Her detailed examination of careers and strategies perfectly complements her subtle analysis of the schemas and visions these women have for their lives. Blair-Loy has given us not only a splendid view into a little known world, but also a new way of understanding the dynamic interplay of work and family. Looking beyond the static conflict we have studied so much, she shows how creative women put traditional schemas of family and work into a mutual transformation to build for themselves a new and more livable world.--Andrew Abbott, author of Time Matters.",Business & Economics,284,N/A,0,en

Quasi-Periodic Motions in Families of Dynamical Systems,"Hendrik W. Broer, George B. Huitema, Mikhail B. Sevryuk",Springer,2009-01-25,"This book is devoted to the phenomenon of quasi-periodic motion in dynamical systems. Such a motion in the phase space densely fills up an invariant torus. This phenomenon is most familiar from Hamiltonian dynamics. Hamiltonian systems are well known for their use in modelling the dynamics related to frictionless mechanics, including the planetary and lunar motions. In this context the general picture appears to be as follows. On the one hand, Hamiltonian systems occur that are in complete order: these are the integrable systems where all motion is confined to invariant tori. On the other hand, systems exist that are entirely chaotic on each energy level. In between we know systems that, being sufficiently small perturbations of integrable ones, exhibit coexistence of order (invariant tori carrying quasi-periodic dynamics) and chaos (the so called stochastic layers). The Kolmogorov-Arnol'd-Moser (KAM) theory on quasi-periodic motions tells us that the occurrence of such motions is open within the class of all Hamiltonian systems: in other words, it is a phenomenon persistent under small Hamiltonian perturbations. Moreover, generally, for any such system the union of quasi-periodic tori in the phase space is a nowhere dense set of positive Lebesgue measure, a so called Cantor family. This fact implies that open classes of Hamiltonian systems exist that are not ergodic. The main aim of the book is to study the changes in this picture when other classes of systems - or contexts - are considered.",Mathematics,203,N/A,0,en
G Families of Probability Distributions,"Mir Masoom Ali, Irfan Ali, Haitham M. Yousof, Mohamed Ibrahim Mohamed Ahmed",CRC Press,2023-03-31,"Statistical distributions are essential tools to model the characteristics of datasets, such as right or left skewness, bi-modality or multi-modality observed in different applied sciences, such as engineering, medicine, and finance. The well-known distributions like normal, Weibull, gamma and Lindley are extensively used because of their simple forms and identifiability properties. In the last decade, researchers have focused on the more complex and flexible distributions, referred to as Generalized or simply G families of probability distributions, to increase the modelling capability of these distributions by adding one or more shape parameters. The main aim of this edited book is to present new contributions by researchers in the field of G families of probability distributions. The book will help researchers to: Develop new univariate continuous and discrete G families of probability distributions. Develop new bivariate continuous and discrete G families of probability distributions. Derive beneficial mathematical properties such as ordinary and incomplete moments, moment generating functions, residual life and reversed residual life functions, order statistics, quantile spread ordering and entropies, and some bivariate and multivariate extensions of the new and existing models using a simple-type copula.",Mathematics,365,N/A,0,en

Family Legacy,Jack O'Halloran,MP Publishing,2011-11-01,"Jack Pagano has always felt he is different. Smart and physically talented, the normal pursuits of youth - women and sports - have always come a little too easy to him and left him unfulfilled. At age seventeen, Jack is eager to leave high school and begin his college career. But the schooling that lies ahead of him is of a far different variety than he could have ever imagined. Albert Anastasia, the notorious leader of Murder, Inc., appears and claims Pagano as his son. But before Jack can make heads or tails of his new-found father, Anastasia is gunned down at the Park Sheraton Hotel. Under the tutelage of his late father's associates, Meyer Lansky and Frank Costello, Jack enters a world where crime and politics, money and murder, and the American way of life are all but a hand's breadth apart and inextricably linked. At the same time, another father is grooming his son to further his plans: Joseph Kennedy, the patriarch of what will become American's ruling dynasty, has set his sights on the White House - and with the help of some old friends in Chicago, his son, also Jack, will rise to power. “Renaissance man, Jack O’Halloran — prizefighter, actor, and now author — has written a shocking and fast-paced novel of Mafia intrigue.

Mostly True,Molly O'Neill,Simon and Schuster,2006-05-02,"Molly O'Neill's father believed that baseball was his family's destiny. He wanted to spawn enough sons for an infield, so he married the tallest woman in Columbus, Ohio. Molly came out first, but eventually her father's plan prevailed. Five boys followed in rapid succession and the youngest, Paul O'Neill, did, in fact, grow up to be the star right fielder for the New York Yankees. In Mostly True, celebrated food critic and writer O'Neill tells the story of her quintessentially American family and the places where they come together -- around the table and on the ball field. Molly's great-grandfather played on one of the earliest traveling teams in organized baseball, her grandfather played barnstorming ball, and her father pitched in the minor leagues, but after being sidelined with an injury in the war, he set his sights on the next generation. While her brothers raged and struggled to become their own men, Molly, appointed ""Deputy Mom"" at an age when most girls were playing with dolls, learned early how to be the model Midwestern homemaker and began casting about wildly for other possible destinies. As her mother cleaned fanatically and produced elaborate, healthy meals, Molly spoiled her bro-thers with skyscraper cakes, scribbled reams of poetry, and staged theatrical productions in the backyard. By the late 1960s, the Woodstock Nation had challenged some of the O'Neill values, but nothing altered their conviction that only remarkable achievement could save them. Mostly True is the uncommon chronicle of a regular family pursuing the American dream and of one girl's quest to find her place in a world built for boys. Molly O'Neill -- an independent, extraordinarily talented, and fiercely funny woman -- showed that home runs can be hit in many fields. Her memoir is glorious.",Biography & Autobiography,303,3,1,en

Doing Family Photography,Professor Gillian Rose,"Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.",2012-11-28,"Family photography, a ubiquitous domestic tradition in the developed world, is now more popular than ever thanks to the development of digital photography. Once uploaded to PCs and other gadgets, photographs may be stored, deleted, put in albums, sent to relatives and friends, retouched, or put on display. Moreover, in recent years family photographs are more frequently appearing in public media: on posters, in newspapers and on the Internet, particularly in the wake of disasters like 9/11, and in cases of missing children. Here, case study material drawn from the UK offers a deeper understanding of both domestic family photographs and their public display. Recent work in material culture studies, geography, and anthropology is used to approach photographs as objects embedded in social practices, which produce specific social positions, relations and effects. Also explored are the complex economies of gifting and exchange amongst families, and the rich geographies of domestic and public spaces into which family photography offers an insight.",Science,170,N/A,0,en

Fully updated, this sixth edition of the landmark reference reflects the latest research, clinical perspectives, and advances in the field. It offers an unparalleled perspective on the the current state and future of neural science. This new edition features: Unmatched coverage of how the nerves, brain, and mind function NEW chapters on: - The Computational Bases of Neural Circuits that Mediate Behavior - Brain-Machine Interfaces - Decision-Making and Consciousness NEW section on the neuroscientific principles underlying the disorders of the nervous system Expanded coverage of the different forms of human memory Highly detailed chapters on stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and multiple sclerosis 2,200 images, including 300 new color illustrations, diagrams, radiology studies, and PET scans Principles of Neural Science, Sixth Edition benefits from a cohesive organization, beginning with an insightful overview of the interrelationships between the brain, nervous system, genes, and behavior. The text is divided into nine sections: Part I: Overall Perspective provides an overview of the broad themes of neural science, including the basic anatomical organization of the nervous system and the genetic bases of nervous system function and behavior. Part II: Cell and Molecular Biology of Cells of the Nervous System examines the basic properties of nerve cells, including the generation and conduction of propagated signaling. Part III: Synaptic Transmission focuses on the electrophysiological and molecular mechanism of synaptic transmission with chapters on neuronal excitability, neurotransmitters, and transmitter release. Part IV: Perception discusses the various aspects of sensory perception, including how information from the primary organs of sensation is transmitted to and processed by the central nervous system.

Sourcebook of Family Theories and Methods,"Pauline Boss, William J. Doherty, Ralph LaRossa, Walter R. Schumm, Suzanne K. Steinmetz",Springer Science & Business Media,2008-11-19,"Origins We call this book on theoretical orientations and methodological strategies in family studies a sourcebook because it details the social and personal roots (i.e., sources) from which these orientations and strategies flow. Thus, an appropriate way to preface this book is to talk first of its roots, its beginnings. In the mid 1980s there emerged in some quarters the sense that it was time for family studies to take stock of itself. A goal was thus set to write a book that, like Janus, would face both backward and forward a book that would give readers both a perspec tive on the past and a map for the future. There were precedents for such a project: The Handbook of Marriage and the Family edited by Harold Christensen and published in 1964; the two Contemporary Theories about theFamily volumes edited by Wesley Burr, Reuben Hill, F. Ivan Nye, and Ira Reiss, published in 1979; and the Handbook of Marriage and the Family edited by Marvin Sussman and Suzanne Steinmetz, then in production.",Social Science,747,N/A,0,en

Eating Tomorrow,Timothy A. Wise,The New Press,2019-02-05,"""A powerful polemic against agricultural technology."" —Nature A major new book that shows the world already has the tools to feed itself, without expanding industrial agriculture or adopting genetically modified seeds, from the Small Planet Institute expert Few challenges are more daunting than feeding a global population projected to reach 9.7 billion in 2050—at a time when climate change is making it increasingly difficult to successfully grow crops. In response, corporate and philanthropic leaders have called for major investments in industrial agriculture, including genetically modified seed technologies. Reporting from Africa, Mexico, India, and the United States, Timothy A. Wise's Eating Tomorrow discovers how in country after country agribusiness and its well-heeled philanthropic promoters have hijacked food policies to feed corporate interests. Most of the world, Wise reveals, is fed by hundreds of millions of small-scale farmers, people with few resources and simple tools but a keen understanding of what and how to grow food. These same farmers—who already grow more than 70 percent of the food eaten in developing countries—can show the way forward as the world warms and population increases. Wise takes readers to remote villages to see how farmers are rebuilding soils with ecologically sound practices and nourishing a diversity of native crops without chemicals or imported seeds. They are growing more and healthier food; in the process, they are not just victims in the climate drama but protagonists who have much to teach us all.",Political Science,271,N/A,0,en

Exit Zero,Christine J. Walley,University of Chicago Press,2013-01-17,"Winner of CLR James Book Prize from the Working Class Studies Association and 2nd Place for the Victor Turner Prize in Ethnographic Writing. In 1980, Christine J. Walley’s world was turned upside down when the steel mill in Southeast Chicago where her father worked abruptly closed. In the ensuing years, ninety thousand other area residents would also lose their jobs in the mills—just one example of the vast scale of deindustrialization occurring across the United States. The disruption of this event propelled Walley into a career as a cultural anthropologist, and now, in Exit Zero, she brings her anthropological perspective home, examining the fate of her family and that of blue-collar America at large. Interweaving personal narratives and family photos with a nuanced assessment of the social impacts of deindustrialization, Exit Zero is one part memoir and one part ethnography— providing a much-needed female and familial perspective on cultures of labor and their decline. Through vivid accounts of her family’s struggles and her own upward mobility, Walley reveals the social landscapes of America’s industrial fallout, navigating complex tensions among class, labor, economy, and environment. Unsatisfied with the notion that her family’s turmoil was inevitable in the ever-forward progress of the United States, she provides a fresh and important counternarrative that gives a new voice to the many Americans whose distress resulting from deindustrialization has too often been ignored. This book is part of a project that also includes a documentary film.",Social Science,237,N/A,0,en

Doing Time Together,Megan Comfort,University of Chicago Press,2009-05-15,"By quadrupling the number of people behind bars in two decades, the United States has become the world leader in incarceration. Much has been written on the men who make up the vast majority of the nation’s two million inmates. But what of the women they leave behind? Doing Time Together vividly details the ways that prisons shape and infiltrate the lives of women with husbands, fiancés, and boyfriends on the inside. Megan Comfort spent years getting to know women visiting men at San Quentin State Prison, observing how their romantic relationships drew them into contact with the penitentiary. Tangling with the prison’s intrusive scrutiny and rigid rules turns these women into “quasi-inmates,” eroding the boundary between home and prison and altering their sense of intimacy, love, and justice. Yet Comfort also finds that with social welfare weakened, prisons are the most powerful public institutions available to women struggling to overcome untreated social ills and sustain relationships with marginalized men. As a result, they express great ambivalence about the prison and the control it exerts over their daily lives. An illuminating analysis of women caught in the shadow of America’s massive prison system, Comfort’s book will be essential for anyone concerned with the consequences of our punitive culture.",Social Science,275,N/A,0,en
Once Kissed,Cecy Robson,Loveswept,2015-11-03,"RITA AWARD FINALIST • Once they shared a night of passion. Now a chance encounter forces them back together. In Cecy Robson’s O’Brien Family series debut—perfect for readers of Monica Murphy and J. Lynn—two total opposites find that the flames of desire are still smoldering. Tough-as-steel cop Curran O’Brien is quickly rising through the ranks of the Philadelphia police department. But when his rookie partner is almost killed under his watch, Curran just wants to prove he still has what it takes to walk among Philly’s finest. So he’s pissed to be stuck on a cushy security assignment for the DA’s office . . . until he gets a good look at the sweet, straitlaced intern he’s supposed to protect—but not touch. Tess Newart recognizes Curran instantly. How could she not? Back in college she tied this former frat boy to the bed with her argyle socks! That sizzling one-night stand was the only indiscretion Tess ever allowed herself. She has survived law school so far, despite being pushed to succeed by her overbearing father. Now that she’s interning on a major case against a ruthless crime boss, she won’t jeopardize her career by giving in to temptation again. She just never expected temptation to look so damn hot in uniform. Tess knows her father has other plans for her, and they don’t include Curran. But soon she’s falling for him all over again. And when danger emerges, Curran will prove just how good a bad-boy cop can be. Praise for Once Kissed “Make room on your list of book boyfriends for Curran O’Brien!

Ten Minutes for the Family,"Eia Asen, Dave Tomson, Venetia Young, Peter Tomson",Routledge,2004-08-02,"The provision of suitable mental health care is one of the major tasks facing general practitioners and their teams. Family-oriented primary care has moved from doctor-controlled to patient-centred consultations, with a greater emphasis on collaboration. The systemic framework uniquely lends itself to this shift in emphasis, as it views the delivery of care in social rather than merely medical terms. There is now a strong evidence base for the efficacy of systemic approaches in managing many different types of mental health and relationship issues. This text is a practical guide for health professionals working in primary care who wish to improve their management of problem patients, problem families and problem situations. Step-by-step, it introduces both the theory and the practice of the family approach - from interviewing individual patients in routine consultations to conducting specific family crisis meetings. It includes many concrete suggestions for using simple family therapy techniques and encourages the clinician to think about cases constructively. Case histories and patient stories are used extensively to illustrate the techniques as well as boxed information to highlight key points.",Medical,224,N/A,0,en
Family Entrepreneurship,"Kathleen Randerson, Cristina Bettinelli, Giovanna Dossena, Alain Fayolle",Routledge,2015-12-22,"Family business is the most prominent form of business organization, and its importance to the global economy cannot be under-estimated. Until recently, the impact of the family on entrepreneurial firms has been under-researched, leading to a conceptual gap between the two areas of study, and an underestimation of the contribution of family systems to entrepreneurial success. Starting from the consideration that family is an intimate and essential aspect of entrepreneurship, this book considers connections between family, family members, entrepreneurial behavior, family business, society and the economy. Bringing together a unique range of international contributions, it offers new theoretical perspectives and empirical insights as well as an in-depth consideration of the diversity of contexts and processes associated with entrepreneurship in family settings. Above all, this book opens up a comprehensive research agenda on the linkages between family, family firms and entrepreneurship and will be of interest to researchers, educators and advanced students of entrepreneurship, small firms and family business.",Business & Economics,359,N/A,0,en

Mrs Jordan's Profession,Claire Tomalin,Penguin UK,2003-12-04,"Mrs Jordan's Profession is the acclaimed biography of Dora Jordan by bestselling author Claire Tomalin 'Intelligent, finely made and wonderfully readable. As gripping as the best fiction' Independent on Sunday Acclaimed as the greatest comic actress of her day, Dora Jordan lived a quite different role off-stage as lover to Prince William, third son of George III. Unmarried, the pair lived in a villa on the Thames and had ten children together until William, under pressure from royal advisers, abandoned her. The story of how Dora moved between the worlds of the eighteenth-century theatre and happy domesticity, of her fights for her family and her career makes a classic story of royal perfidy and female courage. From the acclaimed author of Samuel Pepys: The Unequalled Self, Charles Dickens: A Life and The Invisible Woman, this celebrated biography is one of history's most astonishing untold stories. 'The strangest and most sensational story Tomalin has told so far. A miraculously detailed portrait - as brisk, unsentimental, good-humoured and fairminded as its subject' Hilary Spurling, Daily Telegraph 'Compelling, shrewd in its judgements, exceptionally well written, and informed by a vivid sense of the past' John Gross, Sunday Telegraph 'Fascinating, affecting. A compelling story and Tomalin tells it with clarity and warmth' Lucy Hughes-Hallett, Sunday Times Claire Tomalin is the award-winning author of eight highly acclaimed biographies, including: The Life and Death of Mary Wollstonecraft; Shelley and His World; Katherine Mansfield: A Secret Life; The Invisible Woman: The Story of Nelly Ternan and Charles Dickens; Mrs Jordan's Profession; Jane Austen: A Life; Samuel Pepys: The Unequalled Self; Thomas Hardy: The Time-Torn Man and, most recently, Charles Dickens: A Life.

The Population of Modern China,"Dudley L. Poston Jr., David Yaukey",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-11-11,"Student~ interested in world populations and demography inevitably need to know China. As the most populous country of the world, China occupies a unique position in the world population system. How its population is shaped by the intricate interplays among factors such as its political ideology and institutions, economic reality, government policies, sociocultural traditions, and ethnic divergence represents at once a fascinating and challenging arena for investigatIon and analysis. Yet, for much of the 20th century, while population studies have developed into a mature science, precise information and sophisticated analysis about the Chinese population had largely remained either lacking or inaccessible, first because of the absence of systematic databases due to almost uninterrupted strife and wars, and later because the society was closed to the outside observers for about three decades since 1949. Since the end of the Cultural Revolution, things have dramatically changed. China has embarked on an ambitious reform program where modernization became the utmost goal of societal mobilization. China could no longer afford to rely on imprecise census or survey information for population-related studies and policy planning, nor to remaining closed to the outside world. Both the gathering of more precise information and access to such information have dramatically increased in the 1980s. Systematic observations, analyses and reporting about the Chinese population have surfaced in the population literature around the globe.",Social Science,750,N/A,0,en

Moreover, when sociological inquiry has sought to go beyond the demographic and census aspects of the household, it has trained its eye on the heterosexual family centred on the conjugal couple, frequently at the expense of those relational patterns and diversities that fall outside the familiar circuits of desire within the family. The present volume brings together ten essays from a range of disciplines including law, literature, anthropology, sociology, and queer studies, to engage with hitherto neglected and emergent aspects of Indian family life.

Family Business and Regional Development,"Rodrigo Basco, Roger Stough, Lech Suwala",Routledge,2021-04-06,"This book explores the relationship between families, firms, and regions and the extent to which these relationships contribute to regional economic and social development. Although family business participation in economic activities has been a common phenomenon since pre-industrial societies, and its importance has evolved throughout time and across spatial contexts, the book suggests that these factors have often been neglected in family business and regional studies. Taking this research gap into account, the book aims to deepen our understanding of the role family firms play in the regional economy. In particular, it explores two seldom studied questions. Firstly, what role do family firms play in regional development? Secondly, how do different spatial regional contexts shape family firm operations and performance? Family Business and Regional Development presents a model of ""spatial familiness"" and uses themes such as productivity, networks and competitiveness to shed new light on family businesses. Moreover, it approaches the juxtaposition between family business and regional studies to encourage the cross-fertilisation of ideas, theories, and research methods between the two fields. Bringing together leading experts in entrepreneurship, regional economics, and economic geography, this book will be a valuable reading for advanced students, researchers and policymakers interested in family firms, regional studies and economic geography.",Business & Economics,301,N/A,0,en

"Values, Political Action, and Change in the Middle East and the Arab Spring","Mansoor Moaddel, Michele J. Gelfand",Oxford University Press,2017-01-18,"Although many have tried, the spontaneity of the Arab Spring uprisings and the unpredictability of its diverse geographical outcomes have resisted explanation. For social scientists, part of the challenge has been how to effectively measure and analyze the empirical data, while another obstacle has been a lack of attention to the worldviews, value orientations, and long-term concerns from the people of the Middle East and North Africa. In order to meet these challenges head-on, Mansoor Moaddel and Michele J. Gelfand have assembled an international team of experts to explore and employ a new and diverse set of frameworks in order to explain the dynamics of cross-national variation, values, political engagement, morality, and development in these regions. To this end, the authors address a wide range of questions, such as: To what extent do recent events reflect changes in values among the Middle Eastern publics? Are youth uniformly more supportive of change than the rest of the population? To what extent are changes in values connected to changes in identities? How do we explain the process of change in the long term? As Moaddel and Gelfand remark in their book's introduction, ""Our hope is that this collective effort will not only contribute to the development of the social sciences in the Middle East and North Africa, but also to practical political actions and public policies that serve social tolerance and harmony, peace, and economic prosperity for the people of the region.""",Psychology,393,N/A,0,en

This is achieved through qualitative analysis of narratives through which individuals and families explain themselves, their thinking, and their behavior. These family narratives are windows into individual and family identity, as well as descriptions of connections to others.

Arawata Bill,Ian Dougherty,Exisle Publishing,2012-02,"This is the story of a pioneering folk hero. It is a colourful tale of adventure, discovery and survival in the remotest areas of New Zealand’s Southern Alps.William James O’Leary was a man of humble origins. His lifetime (1865-1947) spanned a period of New Zealand history when the country was searching for homegrown heroes in whose lives the young nation could discover clues to the question of its identity.The decades O’Leary spent in the unforgiving mountain country of North-West Otago and South Westland, prospecting for gold and other minerals and making new tracks in unexplored areas, was bound to be regarded with envy and admiration by townsfolk.The myth-making process was assisted when the nickname ‘Arawata Bill’ stuck, but it is the man’s astonishing feats of endurance, tenacity and charming eccentricity which capture the imagination. Add in the mystery of a lost ruby mine, a seaboot full of gold sovereigns and the aura of secrecy surrounding the quest for precious metal, and you have the stuff of which legends are made.Generations of New Zealand schoolchildren are familiar with Denis Glover’s poem Arawata Bill, yet the subject of that work was only loosely based on William O’Leary. The man himself, in his solitary and self-effacing way, was both smaller and greater than the legend. He emerged as one of those archetypal New Zealanders who helped to define a distinctive nationality.In this biography, Ian Dougherty has separated the man from the myth, with a warmly human portrait of an ordinary man who lived an extraordinary life.",Biography & Autobiography,198,N/A,0,en

Family Dramas,Gwyn Daniel,Routledge,2018-11-15,"Most of Shakespeare’s tragedies have a family drama at their heart. This book brings these relationships to life, offering a radical new perspective on the tragic heroes and their dilemmas. Family Dramas: Intimacy, Power and Systems in Shakespeare's Tragedies focusses on the interactions and dialogues between people on stage, linking their intimate emotional worlds to wider social and political contexts. Since family relationships absorb and enact social ideologies, their conflicts often expose the conflicts that all ideologies contain. The complexities, contradictions and ambiguities of Shakespeare’s portrayals of individuals and their relationships are brought to life, while wider power structures and social discourses are shown to reach into the heart of intimate relationships and personal identity. Surveying relevant literature from Shakespeare studies, the book introduces the ideas behind the family systems approach to literary criticism. Explorations of gender relationships feature particularly strongly in the analysis since it is within gender that intimacy and power most compellingly intersect and frequently collide. For Shakespeare lovers and psychotherapists alike, this application of systemic theory opens a new perspective on familiar literary territory.",Psychology,388,N/A,0,en

Family and Space,"Maya Halatcheva-Trapp, Giulia Montanari, Tino Schlinzig",Routledge,2019-03-26,"While the ‘spatial turn’ within the social sciences has already nurtured a broad discussion of the relation between society and space, little attention has so far been paid to the question of what we can learn about families when exploring space in its different facets. This book brings together international authors from the fields of sociology, human geography, and anthropology to support the development of space-sensitive and de-territorialised perspectives on the family that reach beyond classical concepts such as the ‘household’ or the ‘nuclear family’. With close attention to the implications of differing relations to space for the social fabric of families, it presents studies of theoretical, methodological, and empirical aspects of late-modern family life. Examining the meaning of absence and presence for parenting, the aesthetic, and sensual dimensions of everyday family life, and its digital and media-related features aspects, Family and Space considers the value of a range of approaches to researching the spatial elements of family life, including ethnographic accounts, interviews, group discussions, mobile methods, and network analyses.",Social Science,281,N/A,0,en

Family Treatment of Personality Disorders,Malcolm M Macfarlane,Routledge,2014-02-25,"Help families cope with the impact of personality dysfunction! Family Treatment of Personality Disorders: Advances in Clinical Practice examines the application of marital and family therapy approaches to the treatment of a wide range of personality disorders. Valuable on its own and doubly useful as a companion volume to Family Therapy and Mental Health: Innovations in Theory and Practice (Haworth), the book integrates traditional individual models with family systems models to provide a multidimensional approach to treating personality disorders. Each chapter is written by a family therapist with extensive experience treating personality disorders and includes a case example, an exploration of the impact of the disorder on family members, a look at cultural and gender issues, and an examination of how the model is integrated with traditional psychiatric services and the proper application of medication. Family Treatment of Personality Disorders is a single, accessible source for significant contributions to the emerging literature on family treatment approaches that, until now, have been scattered through journals representing a variety of disciplines. The book’s strong clinical focus provides a concise summary of relevant theory and interventions for effective treatment, including discussion of how to manage crises and acting out behavior. Edited by a practicing frontline clinician, the book provides an overview of the personality disorders field, examines the Structural Analysis of Social Behavior model and the Interpersonal Reconstructive Therapy approach, and presents detailed descriptions of key concepts and treatment approaches. Family Treatment of Personality Disorders focuses on specific DSM-IV personality disorders, including: borderline narcissistic histrionic obsessive-compulsive passive-aggressive avoidant dependent paranoid Family Treatment of Personality Disorders: Advances in Clinical Practice is an excellent resource for clinicians treating mental health problems and for academic work in family psychopathology and family therapy and mental health.",Psychology,445,N/A,0,en

They Are All My Family,John P. Riordan,PublicAffairs,2015-04-07,"Published for the fortieth anniversary of the final days of the Vietnam War, this is the suspenseful and moving tale of how John Riordan, an assistant manager of Citibank's Saigon branch, devised a daring plan to save 106 Vietnamese from the dangers of the Communist takeover. Riordan -- who had served in the US Army after the Tet Offensive and had left the military behind for a career in international banking -- was not the type to take dramatic action, but once the North Vietnamese Army closed in on Saigon in April 1975 and it was clear that Riordan's Vietnamese colleagues and their families would be stranded in a city teetering on total collapse, he knew he could not leave them behind. Defying the objections of his superiors and going against the official policy of the United States, Riordan went back into Saigon to save them. In fifteen harrowing trips to Saigon's airport, he maneuvered through the bureaucratic shambles, claiming that the Vietnamese were his wife and scores of children. It was a ruse that, at times, veered close to failure, yet against all odds, the improbable plan succeeded. At great risk, the Vietnamese left their lives behind to start anew in the United States, and now John is known to his grateful Vietnamese colleagues and hundreds of their American descendants as Papa. They Are All My Family is a vivid narrative of one man's ingenious strategy which transformed a time of enormous peril into a display of extraordinary courage. Reflecting on those fateful days in this account, John Riordan's modest heroism provides a striking contrast to America's ignominious retreat from the decade of conflict.",History,259,N/A,0,en

Education and assistance is needed as part of the general attempt to raise the standard of living with a resultant tendency to limitation of family size and drop in the birth-rate. The nutritional level of the community and its young children is positively related to the educational and economic level of the community, to the availablity of sufficient food of the right quality and to the adequacy and accessibility of the health services. The problems of infant nutrition are dealt with from the point of view of the health worker in the field. The viewpoint is that an understanding of methods and approaches to food problems by active, community committees is often the prime nutritional need in developing countries.",Family & Relationships,344,N/A,0,en

The Family And The Nation,No Author,Harper Collins,2013-12-01,"As we aspire for rising economic prosperity and a strong and confident India, this book forcefully reminds us of the values that make for a truly sustainable society, at the heart of which is the family. For it is not economic growth or military strength alone that will make India strong. Sustainable success comes from values, and these can sustain a society and a nation even in times of hardship. The book expresses an ideal by which Indian society may prosper and speaks of how spirituality can help create a noble nation and a better world. It provides a valuable counterpoint to the modern-day emphasis on consumerism and the philosophy of more is better, highlighting the sanctity of the natural world and its great power to evoke human creativity and love. Writing on this crucial subject are two iconic Indians. Together, Acharya Mahapragya and A.P.J. Abdul Kalam-- one a Jain muni revered as a saint, the other a visionary, a distinguished scientist and a former President of India-- bring their vast experience to bear on this important subject. As the authors put it, it's only a united and happy family that will lead to a strong nation, one that can be a true fulfilment of 5,000 years of India's civilization. The book takes up the difficult and pressing task of setting a new agenda in a time of radical social change. It shows us the path we need to follow to take India to its rightful place as a great nation.",Social Science,147,N/A,0,en

But the story of Harry Agganis is his clean-cut life and love for family, friends and church, and dedication to his hometown of Lynn, Massachusetts, where he went from the sandlots to college to the Marines to the Boston Red Sox, where starring as a slugging left-hander at first base, he was paired with Ted Williams - until tragedy struck suddenly.

The Changing Rhythms of American Family Life,"Suzanne M. Bianchi, John P. Robinson, Melissa A. Milke",Russell Sage Foundation,2006-07-13,"Over the last forty years, the number of American households with a stay-at-home parent has dwindled as women have increasingly joined the paid workforce and more women raise children alone. Many policy makers feared these changes would come at the expense of time mothers spend with their children. In Changing Rhythms of American Family Life, sociologists Suzanne M. Bianchi, John P. Robinson, and Melissa Milkie analyze the way families spend their time and uncover surprising new findings about how Americans are balancing the demands of work and family. Using time diary data from surveys of American parents over the last four decades, Changing Rhythms of American Family Life finds that—despite increased workloads outside of the home—mothers today spend at least as much time interacting with their children as mothers did decades ago—and perhaps even more. Unexpectedly, the authors find mothers' time at work has not resulted in an overall decline in sleep or leisure time. Rather, mothers have made time for both work and family by sacrificing time spent doing housework and by increased ""multitasking."" Changing Rhythms of American Family Life finds that the total workload (in and out of the home) for employed parents is high for both sexes, with employed mothers averaging five hours more per week than employed fathers and almost nineteen hours more per week than homemaker mothers. Comparing average workloads of fathers with all mothers—both those in the paid workforce and homemakers—the authors find that there is gender equality in total workloads, as there has been since 1965. Overall, it appears that Americans have adapted to changing circumstances to ensure that they preserve their family time and provide adequately for their children. Changing Rhythms of American Family Life explodes many of the popular misconceptions about how Americans balance work and family. Though the iconic image of the American mother has changed from a docile homemaker to a frenzied, sleepless working mom, this important new volume demonstrates that the time mothers spend with their families has remained steady throughout the decades.",Business & Economics,273,N/A,0,en

Celani centers his program on Object Relations Theory, a branch of psychoanalysis developed by Scottish analyst Ronald Fairbairn. The human personality, Fairbairn argued, is not the result of inherited (and thus immutable) instincts. Rather, the developing child builds internal relational templates rooted in conscious and unconscious memories he internalized in childhood, and these guide his future interactions with others. While an attachment to neglectful or even abusive parents is not uncommon, there is a way out. Eloquent, relatable, and filled with rich examples taken from more than two decades of clinical practice, Leaving Home outlines the practical steps necessary to become a healthy adult.",Family & Relationships,170,N/A,0,en
Full Surrogacy Now,Sophie Lewis,Verso Books,2021-08-31,"Where pregnancy is concerned, let every pregnancy be for everyone. Let us overthrow, in short, the “family” The surrogacy industry is estimated to be worth over $1 billion a year, and many of its surrogates around the world work in terrible conditions—deception, wage-stealing and money skimming are rife; adequate medical care is horrifyingly absent; and informed consent is depressingly rare. In Full Surrogacy Now, Sophie Lewis brings a fresh and unique perspective to the topic. Often, we think of surrogacy as the problem, but, Full Surrogacy Now argues, we need more surrogacy, not less! Rather than looking at surrogacy through a legal lens, Lewis argues that the needs and protection of surrogates should be put front and center. Their relationship to the babies they gestate must be rethought, as part of a move to recognize that reproduction is productive work. Only then can we begin to break down our assumptions that children “belong” to those whose genetics they share. Taking collective responsibility for children would radically transform our notions of kinship, helping us to see that it always takes a village to make a baby.",Social Science,225,N/A,0,en

Understanding Family Support,"John Pinkerton, Pat Dolan, John Canavan",Jessica Kingsley Publishers,2016-04-21,"Understanding Family Support provides a definition of family support and a clear perspective on the role that it has in promoting the welfare of children and their families. Family support is a concept that has been used in a range of ways to describe various aspects of child welfare policy and practice. The authors argue that this weakens family support as an overarching child welfare paradigm. They present a unifying definition of family support along with ten principles and a series of reflective practice questions applicable to: legislation and policy; organisation, management and planning; direct work with children and families; and research and evaluation. This is an important resource for any professional engaged in policy development, service design, delivering or evaluation of family support, including social workers, residential care staff, community development workers, teachers, community police, human services managers, evaluators and policy makers.",Social Science,162,N/A,0,en

Parenting to a Degree,Laura T. Hamilton,University of Chicago Press,2016-04-29,"Helicopter parents—the kind that continue to hover even in college—are one of the most ridiculed figures of twenty-first-century parenting, criticized for creating entitled young adults who boomerang back home. But do involved parents really damage their children and burden universities? In this book, sociologist Laura T. Hamilton illuminates the lives of young women and their families to ask just what role parents play during the crucial college years. Hamilton vividly captures the parenting approaches of mothers and fathers from all walks of life—from a CFO for a Fortune 500 company to a waitress at a roadside diner. As she shows, parents are guided by different visions of the ideal college experience, built around classed notions of women’s work/family plans and the ideal age to “grow up.” Some are intensively involved and hold adulthood at bay to cultivate specific traits: professional helicopters, for instance, help develop the skills and credentials that will advance their daughters’ careers, while pink helicopters emphasize appearance, charm, and social ties in the hopes that women will secure a wealthy mate. In sharp contrast, bystander parents—whose influence is often limited by economic concerns—are relegated to the sidelines of their daughter’s lives. Finally, paramedic parents—who can come from a wide range of class backgrounds—sit in the middle, intervening in emergencies but otherwise valuing self-sufficiency above all. Analyzing the effects of each of these approaches with clarity and depth, Hamilton ultimately argues that successfully navigating many colleges and universities without involved parents is nearly impossible, and that schools themselves are increasingly dependent on active parents for a wide array of tasks, with intended and unintended consequences. Altogether, Parenting to a Degree offers an incisive look into the new—and sometimes problematic—relationship between students, parents, and universities.",Education,272,N/A,0,en

From Neurons to Neighborhoods,"National Research Council, Institute of Medicine, Board on Children, Youth, and Families, Committee on Integrating the Science of Early Childhood Development",National Academies Press,2000-11-13,"How we raise young children is one of today's most highly personalized and sharply politicized issues, in part because each of us can claim some level of ""expertise."" The debate has intensified as discoveries about our development-in the womb and in the first months and years-have reached the popular media. How can we use our burgeoning knowledge to assure the well-being of all young children, for their own sake as well as for the sake of our nation? Drawing from new findings, this book presents important conclusions about nature-versus-nurture, the impact of being born into a working family, the effect of politics on programs for children, the costs and benefits of intervention, and other issues. The committee issues a series of challenges to decision makers regarding the quality of child care, issues of racial and ethnic diversity, the integration of children's cognitive and emotional development, and more. Authoritative yet accessible, From Neurons to Neighborhoods presents the evidence about ""brain wiring"" and how kids learn to speak, think, and regulate their behavior.

The conference was supported by the NATO Scientific and Environmental Affairs Division as an Advanced Research Workshop. In fact, it was the first scientific conference in all Eastern Europe supported by NATO. The meeting was expected to establish contacts between East and West experts as well as to study the current state of the art in the area of Hamiltonian Mechanics and its applications. I am sure that the informal atmosphere of the city of Torun, the birthplace of Nicolaus Copernicus, stimulated many valuable scientific exchanges. The first idea for this cnference was carried out by Prof Andrzej J. Maciejewski and myself, more than two years ago, during his visit in Greece. It was planned for about forty well-known scientists from East and West. At that time participation of a scientist from Eastern Europe in an Organising Committee of a NATO Conference was not allowed. But always there is the first time. Our plans for such a ""small"" conference, as a first attempt in the new European situation -the Europe without borders -quickly passed away.

First Steps in Several Complex Variables,"Marek Jarnicki, Peter Pflug",European Mathematical Society,2008,"This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of several complex variables in the setting of a very special but basic class of domains, the so-called Reinhardt domains. In this way the reader may learn much about this area without encountering too many technical difficulties. Chapter 1 describes the fundamental notions and the phenomenon of simultaneous holomorphic extension. Chapter 2 presents a fairly complete discussion of biholomorphisms of bounded (complete) Reinhardt domains in the two dimensional case. The third chapter gives a classification of Reinhardt domains of existence for the most important classes of holomorphic functions. The last chapter deals with invariant functions and gives explicit calculations of many of them on certain Reinhardt domains. Numerous exercises are included to help the readers with their understanding of the material. Further results and open problems are added which may be useful as seminar topics. The primary aim of this book is to introduce students or non-experts to some of the main research areas in several complex variables.

On Certain Unitary Representations Of An Infinite Group Of Transformations - Thesis By Leon Van Hove,"Marcus Berg, Cecile Dewitt-morette",World Scientific,2001-05-17,"On April 20, 1951, Léon Van Hove presented his thesis “Sur certaines représentations unitaires d'un groupe infini de transformations' to the Université libre de Bruxelles (Free University of Brussels), two days before the University of Grenoble had approved the creation of L'Ecole d'été de physique théorique at Les Houches (Haute Savoie, France). The first session of the “Ecole des Houches” began on July 15, 1951, with a month-long course by Van Hove on quantum mechanics. The lecture notes for this course were written for the benefit of physicists who — like most of their colleagues outside the US, Canada, and England at that time — did not know quantum mechanics but wanted to learn it seriously. Van Hove's course met their expectations fully. The physics course benefitted from the mathematical expertise of the lecturer, which is also apparent in this thesis. Without his own research as scaffolding, Van Hove could not have built the short and beautiful course which provided the participants with a solid, useful foundation in modern physics.The lecture notes are in French. If they had been in English they would have been published together with the translation of the thesis. The first three pages of the notes are reproduced at the end of this book. The set of notes was reproduced by stencils and distributed to the participants at the beginning of the course.The translation of Léon Van Hove's thesis was initiated in late 2000, when Bob Hermann, formerly in the Department of Mathematics at MIT, sent to Van Hove's son Michel his view on the thesis: “I would consider it as one of the most important mathematical physics papers of the past fifty years, containing the key ideas for what has become known as ‘geometric quantization.’” Indeed, the thesis is interesting both to historians of science and to theoretical physicists and mathematicians exploring the relationships between quantum and classical physics, based on the Hilbert-space approach to classical mechanics.",Science,103,N/A,0,en

The urge to understand and systematize the mathematics of the time led Euclid to postulate axioms in an early attempt to put geometry on a ?rm footing. With roots in the Elements, the distinctive methodology of mathematics has become proof. Inevitably two questions arise: What are proofs? and What assumptions are proofs based on? The ?rst question, traditionally an internal question of the ?eld of logic, was also wrestled with in antiquity. Aristotle gave his famous syllogistic s- tems, and the Stoics had a nascent propositional logic. This study continued with ?ts and starts, through Boethius, the Arabs and the medieval logicians in Paris and London. The early germs of logic emerged in the context of philosophy and theology.

Probabilistic Graphical Models,"Daphne Koller, Nir Friedman",MIT Press,2009-07-31,"A general framework for constructing and using probabilistic models of complex systems that would enable a computer to use available information for making decisions. Most tasks require a person or an automated system to reason—to reach conclusions based on available information. The framework of probabilistic graphical models, presented in this book, provides a general approach for this task. The approach is model-based, allowing interpretable models to be constructed and then manipulated by reasoning algorithms. These models can also be learned automatically from data, allowing the approach to be used in cases where manually constructing a model is difficult or even impossible. Because uncertainty is an inescapable aspect of most real-world applications, the book focuses on probabilistic models, which make the uncertainty explicit and provide models that are more faithful to reality. Probabilistic Graphical Models discusses a variety of models, spanning Bayesian networks, undirected Markov networks, discrete and continuous models, and extensions to deal with dynamical systems and relational data. For each class of models, the text describes the three fundamental cornerstones: representation, inference, and learning, presenting both basic concepts and advanced techniques. Finally, the book considers the use of the proposed framework for causal reasoning and decision making under uncertainty. The main text in each chapter provides the detailed technical development of the key ideas. Most chapters also include boxes with additional material: skill boxes, which describe techniques; case study boxes, which discuss empirical cases related to the approach described in the text, including applications in computer vision, robotics, natural language understanding, and computational biology; and concept boxes, which present significant concepts drawn from the material in the chapter. Instructors (and readers) can group chapters in various combinations, from core topics to more technically advanced material, to suit their particular needs.",Computers,1270,N/A,0,en

Lot-Sizing and Scheduling for Flexible Flow Lines,Daniel Quadt,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-09-14,"The book considers the lot-sizing and scheduling problem for flexible flow line production facilities. Flexible flow lines are flow lines with parallel machines on some or all production stages. They can be found in a vast number of industries. A three-phased solution approach is presented that solves the integrated lot-sizing and scheduling problem in a hierarchical manner. The approach is able to handle several important features relevant in industrial practice, such as back-orders and setup carry-over. The developed solution procedures solve practically sized problems in a relatively short amount of time. One of the procedures is based on a novel mixed integer programming (MIP) model, which employs integer variables instead of binary variables. This makes it possible to find (near-)optimal solutions using standard algorithms such as CPLEX. Another procedure uses two nested Genetic Algorithms. An application of the framework in the semiconductor industry is given.",Business & Economics,240,N/A,0,en

It follows freely the previous edition (North Holland, 1992), Open Problems in Topology (North Holland, 1990) and Handbook of Set-Theoretic Topology (North Holland, 1984). The book was prepared in connection with the Prague Topological Symposium, held in 2001. During the last 10 years the focus in General Topology changed and therefore the selection of topics differs slightly from those chosen in 1992. The following areas experienced significant developments: Topological Groups, Function Spaces, Dimension Theory, Hyperspaces, Selections, Geometric Topology (including Infinite-Dimensional Topology and the Geometry of Banach Spaces). Of course, not every important topic could be included in this book. Except surveys, the book contains several historical essays written by such eminent topologists as: R.D. Anderson, W.W.

Families of Automorphic Forms,Roelof W. Bruggeman,Springer Science & Business Media,2010-02-28,"Automorphic forms on the upper half plane have been studied for a long time. Most attention has gone to the holomorphic automorphic forms, with numerous applications to number theory. Maass, [34], started a systematic study of real analytic automorphic forms. He extended Hecke’s relation between automorphic forms and Dirichlet series to real analytic automorphic forms. The names Selberg and Roelcke are connected to the spectral theory of real analytic automorphic forms, see, e. g. , [50], [51]. This culminates in the trace formula of Selberg, see, e. g. , Hejhal, [21]. Automorphicformsarefunctionsontheupperhalfplanewithaspecialtra- formation behavior under a discontinuous group of non-euclidean motions in the upper half plane. One may ask how automorphic forms change if one perturbs this group of motions. This question is discussed by, e. g. , Hejhal, [22], and Phillips and Sarnak, [46]. Hejhal also discusses the e?ect of variation of the multiplier s- tem (a function on the discontinuous group that occurs in the description of the transformation behavior of automorphic forms). In [5]–[7] I considered variation of automorphic forms for the full modular group under perturbation of the m- tiplier system. A method based on ideas of Colin de Verdi` ere, [11], [12], gave the meromorphic continuation of Eisenstein and Poincar ́ e series as functions of the eigenvalue and the multiplier system jointly.

"Stress, Coping, and Resiliency in Children and Families","E. Mavis Hetherington, Elaine A. Blechman",Psychology Press,2014-02-25,"Concern with stress and coping has a long history in biomedical, psychological and sociological research. The inadequacy of simplistic models linking stressful life events and adverse physical and psychological outcomes was pointed out in the early 1980s in a series of seminal papers and books. The issues and theoretical models discussed in this work shaped much of the subsequent research on this topic and are reflected in the papers in this volume. The shift has been away from identifying associations between risks and outcomes to a focus on factors and processes that contribute to diversity in response to risks. Based on the Family Research Consortium's fifth summer institute, this volume focuses on stress and adaptability in families and family members. The papers explore not only how a variety of stresses influence family functioning but also how family process moderates and mediates the contribution of individual and environmental risk and protective factors to personal adjustment. They reveal the complexity of current theoretical models, research strategies and analytic approaches to the study of risk, resiliency and vulnerability along with the central role risk, family process and adaptability play in both normal development and childhood psychopathology.",Psychology,256,N/A,0,en

Major Problems in American Women's History,"Mary Beth Norton, Ruth M. Alexander",Cengage Learning,2007,"Designed to encourage critical thinking about history, theMajor Problemsseries introduces students to both primary sources and analytical essays on important topics in U.S. history.Major Problems in American Women's Historyis the leading reader for courses on the history of American women, covering the subject's entire chronological span. While attentive to the roles of women and the details of women's lives, the authors are especially concerned with issues of historical interpretation and historiography. The Fourth Edition features greater coverage of the experiences of women in the Midwest and the West, immigrant women, and more voices of women of color. Key pedagogical elements of theMajor Problemsformat have been retained: 14 to 15 chapters per volume, chapter introductions, headnotes, and suggested readings. New!In Chapter 1, an exclusive essay by Kate Haulman examines the evolution of the field of women's history and the state of women's history today. New!Chapter 2 now focuses on Native American women, while a new Chapter 3 covers witches and their accusers in New England and the Salem witch trials. New!Chapter 6 draws on recent scholarship on the roles of ordinary and elite women in the numerous reform movements of the Early Republic. Revised!Chapter 7 rethinks and refocuses the text's coverage of women's roles in slavery and the Civil War, and more directly addresses the lives of African American women during and after slavery. New!Post-1960 coverage (in Chapters 15–16) has been thoroughly revised to highlight the women's movement, women's health, recent immigration, and economic changes affecting women.",History,566,N/A,0,en

Each Small Step,Marilyn MacKinnon,"Charlottetown, P.E.I. : Gynergy",1991,"A project of the Women's Post Treatment Centre in Winnipeg, Manitoba, this groundbreaking anthology contains personal narratives by women at various stages of recovery from the traumas of childhood sexual abuse, and chemical dependency. In compelling prose and poems, survivors confront their pain, fear, despair and anger--taking us each small step toward healing. Articles by professionals, active in treatment programs, provide insight into the links between childhood abuse and drug addiction. Each Small Step is a book for women struggling to be whole, and for those who care about them. As editor Marilyn MacKinnon writes, in telling their own stories the women ""slowly realized what courageous human beings they are. And usually, lighting ever step of the way, is a bright torch of anger.",Fiction,196,N/A,0,en

Groups and Characters,Larry C. Grove,Wiley-Interscience,1997-06-16,"An authoritative, full-year course on both group theory and ordinary character theory—essential tools for mathematics and the physical sciences One of the few treatments available combining both group theory and character theory, Groups and Characters is an effective general textbook on these two fundamentally connected subjects. Presuming only a basic knowledge of abstract algebra as in a first-year graduate course, the text opens with a review of background material and then guides readers carefully through several of the most important aspects of groups and characters, concentrating mainly on finite groups. Challenging yet accessible, Groups and Characters features: An extensive collection of examples surveying many different types of groups, including Sylow subgroups of symmetric groups, affine groups of fields, the Mathieu groups, and symplectic groups A thorough, easy-to-follow discussion of Pólya-Redfield enumeration, with applications to combinatorics Inclusive explorations of the transfer function and normal complements, induction and restriction of characters, Clifford theory, characters of symmetric and alternating groups, Frobenius groups, and the Schur index Illuminating accounts of several computational aspects of group theory, such as the Schreier-Sims algorithm, Todd-Coxeter coset enumeration, and algorithms for generating character tables As valuable as Groups and Characters will prove as a textbook for mathematicians, it has broader applications. With chapters suitable for use as independent review units, along with a full bibliography and index, it will be a dependable general reference for chemists, physicists, and crystallographers.",Mathematics,232,N/A,0,en

Over the course of a week, the naïve and dreamy girl finds herself quickly betrothed and married, and is soon living in Brooklyn. There Isra struggles to adapt to the expectations of her oppressive mother-in-law Fareeda and strange new husband Adam, a pressure that intensifies as she begins to have children—four daughters instead of the sons Fareeda tells Isra she must bear. Brooklyn, 2008. Eighteen-year-old Deya, Isra’s oldest daughter, must meet with potential husbands at her grandmother Fareeda’s insistence, though her only desire is to go to college. Deya can’t help but wonder if her options would have been different had her parents survived the car crash that killed them when Deya was only eight. But her grandmother is firm on the matter: the only way to secure a worthy future for Deya is through marriage to the right man. But fate has a will of its own, and soon Deya will find herself on an unexpected path that leads her to shocking truths about her family—knowledge that will force her to question everything she thought she knew about her parents, the past, and her own future.",Fiction,393,N/A,0,en

Set in 1954, Towles uses the story of two brothers to show that our personal journeys are never as linear or predictable as we might hope.” —Bill Gates “A real joyride . . . elegantly constructed and compulsively readable.” —NPR The bestselling author of A Gentleman in Moscow and Rules of Civility and master of absorbing, sophisticated fiction returns with a stylish and propulsive novel set in 1950s America In June, 1954, eighteen-year-old Emmett Watson is driven home to Nebraska by the warden of the juvenile work farm where he has just served fifteen months for involuntary manslaughter. His mother long gone, his father recently deceased, and the family farm foreclosed upon by the bank, Emmett's intention is to pick up his eight-year-old brother, Billy, and head to California where they can start their lives anew. But when the warden drives away, Emmett discovers that two friends from the work farm have hidden themselves in the trunk of the warden's car. Together, they have hatched an altogether different plan for Emmett's future, one that will take them all on a fateful journey in the opposite direction—to the City of New York. Spanning just ten days and told from multiple points of view, Towles's third novel will satisfy fans of his multi-layered literary styling while providing them an array of new and richly imagined settings, characters, and themes. “Once again, I was wowed by Towles’s writing—especially because The Lincoln Highway is so different from A Gentleman in Moscow in terms of setting, plot, and themes. Towles is not a one-trick pony. Like all the best storytellers, he has range. He takes inspiration from famous hero’s journeys, including The Iliad, The Odyssey, Hamlet, Huckleberry Finn, and Of Mice and Men. He seems to be saying that our personal journeys are never as linear or predictable as an interstate highway. But, he suggests, when something (or someone) tries to steer us off course, it is possible to take the wheel.” – Bill Gates",Fiction,593,N/A,0,en

Projections,Karl Deisseroth,Random House,2021-06-15,"A groundbreaking tour of the human mind that illuminates the biological nature of our inner worlds and emotions, through gripping, moving—and, at times, harrowing—clinical stories “[A] scintillating and moving analysis of the human brain and emotions.”—Nature “Beautifully connects the inner feelings within all human beings to deep insights from modern psychiatry and neuroscience.”—Robert Lefkowitz, Nobel Laureate Karl Deisseroth has spent his life pursuing truths about the human mind, both as a renowned clinical psychiatrist and as a researcher creating and developing the revolutionary field of optogenetics, which uses light to help decipher the brain’s workings. In Projections, he combines his knowledge of the brain’s inner circuitry with a deep empathy for his patients to examine what mental illness reveals about the human mind and the origin of human feelings—how the broken can illuminate the unbroken. Through cutting-edge research and gripping case studies from Deisseroth’s own patients, Projections tells a larger story about the material origins of human emotion, bridging the gap between the ancient circuits of our brain and the poignant moments of suffering in our daily lives. The stories of Deisseroth’s patients are rich with humanity and shine an unprecedented light on the self—and the ways in which it can break down. A young woman with an eating disorder reveals how the mind can rebel against the brain’s most primitive drives of hunger and thirst; an older man, smothered into silence by depression and dementia, shows how humans evolved to feel not only joy but also its absence; and a lonely Uighur woman far from her homeland teaches both the importance—and challenges—of deep social bonds. Illuminating, literary, and essential, Projections is a revelatory, immensely powerful work. It transforms our understanding not only of the brain but of ourselves as social beings—giving vivid illustrations through science and resonant human stories of our yearning for connection and meaning.",Science,257,5,1,en

This beautiful novel traces one Palestinian family's struggle with that question and how it can haunt generations. . . . This is an example of how fiction is often the best filter for the real world around us."" — NPR Lyrical and heartbreaking, Salt Houses follows three generations of a Palestinian family and asks us to confront that most devastating of all truths: you can’t go home again. On the eve of her daughter Alia’s wedding, Salma reads the girl’s future in a cup of coffee dregs. She sees an unsettled life for Alia and her children; she also sees travel and luck. While she chooses to keep her predictions to herself that day, they will all soon come to pass when the family is uprooted in the wake of the Six-Day War of 1967. Salma is forced to leave her home in Nablus; Alia’s brother gets pulled into a politically militarized world he can’t escape; and Alia and her gentle-spirited husband move to Kuwait City, where they reluctantly build a life with their three children.

New Developments in Molecular Chirality,Paul G. Mezey,Springer Science & Business Media,1991-01-31,"Molecular chirality is one of the fundamental aspects of chemistry. Chirality properties of molecules have implications in a wide variety of subjects, ranging from the basic quantum mechanical properties of simple of a few atoms to molecular optical activity, asymmetric synthesis, systems and the folding pattern of proteins. Chirality, in both the geometrical and the topological sense, has also been the subject of investigations in various branches of mathematics. In particular, new developments in a branch of topology, called knot theory, as well as in various branches of discrete mathematics, have led to a novel perspective on the topological aspects of molecular chirality. Some of the mathematical advances have already found applications to the interpretation of new concepts in theoretical chemistry and mathematical chemistry, as well as to novel synthetic approaches leading to new molecules of exceptional structural properties. Some of the new developments in molecular chirality have been truly fundamental to the theoretical understanding and to the actual practice of many aspects of chemistry. The progress in this field has been very rapid, even accelerating in recent years, and a review appears more than justified. This book offers a selection of subjects covering some of the latest developments. Our primary aim is to clarify some of the basic concepts that are the most prone to misinterpretation and to provide brief introductions to some of those subjects that are expected to have further, important contributions to our understanding of molecular properties and chemical reactivity.",Science,310,N/A,0,en

Ill-Posed Problems: Theory and Applications,"A. Bakushinsky, A. Goncharsky",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Recent years have been characterized by the increasing amountofpublications in the field ofso-called ill-posed problems. This is easilyunderstandable because we observe the rapid progress of a relatively young branch ofmathematics, ofwhich the first results date back to about 30 years ago. By now, impressive results have been achieved both in the theory ofsolving ill-posed problems and in the applicationsofalgorithms using modem computers. To mention just one field, one can name the computer tomography which could not possibly have been developed without modem tools for solving ill-posed problems. When writing this book, the authors tried to define the place and role of ill posed problems in modem mathematics. In a few words, we define the theory of ill-posed problems as the theory of approximating functions with approximately given arguments in functional spaces. The difference between well-posed and ill posed problems is concerned with the fact that the latter are associated with discontinuous functions. This approach is followed by the authors throughout the whole book. We hope that the theoretical results will be of interest to researchers working in approximation theory and functional analysis. As for particular algorithms for solving ill-posed problems, the authors paid general attention to the principles ofconstructing such algorithms as the methods for approximating discontinuous functions with approximately specified arguments. In this way it proved possible to define the limits of applicability of regularization techniques.",Mathematics,268,N/A,0,en

"Reaction-Diffusion Automata: Phenomenology, Localisations, Computation",Andrew Adamatzky,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-09-11,"Reaction-diffusion and excitable media are amongst most intriguing substrates. Despite apparent simplicity of the physical processes involved the media exhibit a wide range of amazing patterns: from target and spiral waves to travelling localisations and stationary breathing patterns. These media are at the heart of most natural processes, including morphogenesis of living beings, geological formations, nervous and muscular activity, and socio-economic developments. This book explores a minimalist paradigm of studying reaction-diffusion and excitable media using locally-connected networks of finite-state machines: cellular automata and automata on proximity graphs. Cellular automata are marvellous objects per se because they show us how to generate and manage complexity using very simple rules of dynamical transitions. When combined with the reaction-diffusion paradigm the cellular automata become an essential user-friendly tool for modelling natural systems and designing future and emergent computing architectures. The book brings together hot topics of non-linear sciences, complexity, and future and emergent computing. It shows how to discover propagating localisation and perform computation with them in very simple two-dimensional automaton models. Paradigms, models and implementations presented in the book strengthen the theoretical foundations in the area for future and emergent computing and lay key stones towards physical embodied information processing systems.",Technology & Engineering,328,N/A,0,en

Children Going Home,"Roger Bullock, Daniel Gooch, Michael Little",Routledge,2019-01-22,"First published in 1998, this Darlington child care study looks at the return experiences of children looked after by local authorities. It shows that although the great majority of children go back to their families and home communities, little is known about the process. How can professionals and carers make the transition as easy as possible? The book takes forward ideas first reported in the Dartmouth publication, going home: The return of children separated from their families and tested in subsequent research. It charts patterns of separation and return, considers the experiences of those involved and highlights factors associated with the likelihood of return and its success. Because the factors described in the earlier research have since been confirmed in a blind prospective study they are among the most robust indicators available.",Social Science,236,N/A,0,en

Shaking the Family Tree,Buzzy Jackson,Simon and Schuster,2010-07-06,"“WHO ARE YOU AND WHERE DO YOU COME FROM? ” As a historian, Buzzy Jackson thought she knew the answers to these simple questions—that is, until she took a look at her scrawny family tree. With a name like Jackson (the twentieth most common American surname), she knew she must have more relatives and more family history out there, somewhere. Her first visit to the Boulder Genealogy Society brought her more questions than answers . . . but it also gave her a tantalizing peek into the fascinating (and enormous) community of family-tree huggers and after-hours Alex Haleys. In Shaking the Family Tree, Jackson dives headfirst into her family gene pool: flying cross-country to locate an ancient family graveyard, embarking on a weeklong genealogy Caribbean cruise, and even submitting her DNA for testing to try to find her Jacksons. And in the process of researching her own family lore (Who was Bullwhip Jackson?) she meets legions of other genealogy buffs who are as interesting as they are driven—from the boy who saved his allowance so he could order his great-grandfather’s death certificate to the woman who spends her free time documenting the cemeteries of Colorado ghost towns. Through Jackson’s research she connects with distant relatives, traces her roots back more than 250 years and in the process comes to discover—genetically, historically, and emotionally—the true meaning of “family” for herself.",Social Science,258,N/A,0,en

"Neutrosophic Sets and Systems, vol. 48/2022","Florentin Smarandache, Mohamed Abdel-Basset, Said Broumi",Infinite Study,2022-02-01,"“Neutrosophic Sets and Systems” has been created for publications on advanced studies in neutrosophy, neutrosophic set, neutrosophic logic, neutrosophic probability, neutrosophic statistics that started in 1995 and their applications in any field, such as the neutrosophic structures developed in algebra, geometry, topology, etc. Neutrosophy is a new branch of philosophy that studies the origin, nature, and scope of neutralities, as well as their interactions with different ideational spectra. This theory considers every notion or idea <A> together with its opposite or negation <antiA> and with their spectrum of neutralities <neutA> in between them (i.e. notions or ideas supporting neither <A> nor <antiA>). The <neutA> and <antiA> ideas together are referred to as <nonA>. Neutrosophy is a generalization of Hegel's dialectics (the last one is based on <A> and <antiA> only). According to this theory every idea <A> tends to be neutralized and balanced by <antiA> and <nonA> ideas - as a state of equilibrium. In a classical way <A>, <neutA>, <antiA> are disjoint two by two. But, since in many cases the borders between notions are vague, imprecise, Sorites, it is possible that <A>, <neutA>, <antiA> (and <nonA> of course) have common parts two by two, or even all three of them as well. Neutrosophic Set and Neutrosophic Logic are generalizations of the fuzzy set and respectively fuzzy logic (especially of intuitionistic fuzzy set and respectively intuitionistic fuzzy logic).",Mathematics,496,N/A,0,en
5th International Conference on Practical Applications of Computational Biology & Bioinformatics,"Miguel P. Rocha, Juan Manuel Corchado Rodríguez, Florentino Fdez Riverola, Alfonso Valencia",Springer Science & Business Media,2011-03-09,"The growth in the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology fields over the last few years has been remarkable and the trend is to increase its pace. In fact, the need for computational techniques that can efficiently handle the huge amounts of data produced by the new experimental techniques in Biology is still increasing driven by new advances in Next Generation Sequencing, several types of the so called omics data and image acquisition, just to name a few. The analysis of the datasets that produces and its integration call for new algorithms and approaches from fields such as Databases, Statistics, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Optimization, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. Within this scenario of increasing data availability, Systems Biology has also been emerging as an alternative to the reductionist view that dominated biological research in the last decades. Indeed, Biology is more and more a science of information requiring tools from the computational sciences. In the last few years, we have seen the surge of a new generation of interdisciplinary scientists that have a strong background in the biological and computational sciences. In this context, the interaction of researchers from different scientific fields is, more than ever, of foremost importance boosting the research efforts in the field and contributing to the education of a new generation of Bioinformatics scientists. PACBB‘11 hopes to contribute to this effort promoting this fruitful interaction. PACBB'11 technical program included 50 papers from a submission pool of 78 papers spanning many different sub-fields in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. Therefore, the conference will certainly have promoted the interaction of scientists from diverse research groups and with a distinct background (computer scientists, mathematicians, biologists). The scientific content will certainly be challenging and will promote the improvement of the work that is being developed by each of the participants.",Technology & Engineering,399,N/A,0,en

Shorter entries treat specific topics within these fields, such as code switching, sound symbolism, and syntactic features. Other short entries define and discuss technical terms used within the various subfields or provide sketches of the careers of important scholars in the history of linguistics, such as Leonard Bloomfield, Roman Jakobson, and Edward Sapir.A major portion of the work is its extensive coverage of languages and language families. From those as familiar as English, Japanese, and the Romance languages to Hittite, Yoruba, and Nahuatl, all corners of the world receive treatment. Languages that are the subject of independent entries are analyzed in terms of their phonology, grammatical features, syntax, and writing systems. Lists attached to each article on a language group or family enumerate all languages, extinct or still spoken, within that group and provide detailed information on the number of known speakers, geographical range, and degree of intelligibility with other languages in the group. In this way, virtually every known language receives coverage.For ease of reference and to aid research, the articles are alphabetically arranged, each signed by the contributor, supported by up-to-date bibliographies, line drawings, maps, tables, and diagrams, and readily accessible via a system of cross-references and a detailed index and synoptic outline. Authoritative, comprehensive, and innovative, the 2nd edition of the International Encyclopedia of Linguistics will be an indispensable addition to personal, public, academic, and research libraries and will introduce a new generation of readers to the complexities and concerns of this field of study.",Language Arts & Disciplines,2198,5,1,en

Topologies on Closed and Closed Convex Sets,Gerald Beer,Springer Science & Business Media,1993-10-31,"This monograph provides an introduction to the theory of topologies defined on the closed subsets of a metric space, and on the closed convex subsets of a normed linear space as well. A unifying theme is the relationship between topology and set convergence on the one hand, and set functionals on the other. The text includes for the first time anywhere an exposition of three topologies that over the past ten years have become fundamental tools in optimization, one-sided analysis, convex analysis, and the theory of multifunctions: the Wijsman topology, the Attouch--Wets topology, and the slice topology. Particular attention is given to topologies on lower semicontinuous functions, especially lower semicontinuous convex functions, as associated with their epigraphs. The interplay between convex duality and topology is carefully considered and a chapter on set-valued functions is included. The book contains over 350 exercises and is suitable as a graduate text.

Early one morning on the shore of the Thames, DCI Samuel Owusu is called to the scene of a gruesome discovery. When Owusu sends the evidence for examination, he learns the bones are connected to a cold case that left three people dead on the kitchen floor in a Chelsea mansion thirty years ago.

Furthermore, and in essay after essay, Borski demonstrates how a single master key will unlock many of the book's secret relationships-all in the attempt to guide you through the labyrinth that is Gene Wolfe's BOOK OF THE NEW SUN.",Literary Criticism,206,N/A,0,en

However, remittances are also used for asset accumulation by some families and for some countries they constitute a good part of foreign funds coming into the country. In-spite of their increasing volume over the last few decades, a lot of things about remittances are not known and studies estimate that about half of these money transfers are not even recorded. Since these payments are shown to reduce poverty and help economic progress in the remittance receiving countries, a better knowledge about remittances would help the debates surrounding immigration, remittances and their relation to the global economy. This book provides an overview of remittances in different parts of the world over the last thirty years. It looks at the labor sending and labor receiving countries separately. The text examines the trends, uses, motivations behind sending remittances, cost of sending them and how they are affected by the nature and the development level of different institutional factors. The remittance flows are growing over time and they are used mostly for reducing the uncertainty of life in the less developed parts of the world. However, motivation for sending remittances could be improved and thus remittances could be more conducive to economic development if 1) the relation between the remittance decision and the migration decision is better understood and 2) the costs of international money transfers are reduced. More studies about those issues would benefit the international community. Efforts should be made in all fronts to encourage such international flow of funds not only to have a redistribution of income all over the world, but also to synchronize the efforts towards global economic development and a better integration of the world economy. This book is aimed researchers, policy practitioners and post graduates studying International Economics or International Economic Relations or Political Science or Economic Development.",Business & Economics,281,N/A,0,en
The Angel of the Crows,Katherine Addison,Tor Books,2020-06-23,"Katherine Addison, author of The Goblin Emperor, returns with The Angel of the Crows, a fantasy novel of alternate 1880s London, where killers stalk the night and the ultimate power is naming. This is not the story you think it is. These are not the characters you think they are. This is not the book you are expecting. In an alternate 1880s London, angels inhabit every public building, and vampires and werewolves walk the streets with human beings in a well-regulated truce. A fantastic utopia, except for a few things: Angels can Fall, and that Fall is like a nuclear bomb in both the physical and metaphysical worlds. And human beings remain human, with all their kindness and greed and passions and murderous intent. Jack the Ripper stalks the streets of this London too. But this London has an Angel.

Reconceptualizing the Nature of Science for Science Education,"Sibel Erduran, Zoubeida R. Dagher",Springer,2014-08-20,"Prompted by the ongoing debate among science educators over ‘nature of science’, and its importance in school and university curricula, this book is a clarion call for a broad re-conceptualizing of nature of science in science education. The authors draw on the ‘family resemblance’ approach popularized by Wittgenstein, defining science as a cognitive-epistemic and social-institutional system whose heterogeneous characteristics and influences should be more thoroughly reflected in science education. They seek wherever possible to clarify their developing thesis with visual tools that illustrate how their ideas can be practically applied in science education. The volume’s holistic representation of science, which includes the aims and values, knowledge, practices, techniques, and methodological rules (as well as science’s social and institutional contexts), mirrors its core aim to synthesize perspectives from the fields of philosophy of science and science education. The authors believe that this more integrated conception of nature of science in science education is both innovative and beneficial. They discuss in detail the implications for curriculum content, pedagogy, and learning outcomes, deploy numerous real-life examples, and detail the links between their ideas and curriculum policy more generally.",Science,206,N/A,0,en

Dracula's Bloodline,"Radu R. Florescu, Matei Cazacu",Rowman & Littlefield,2013-08-02,"This engrossing book tells the story of the Florescu family, from its feudal blood ties, to the notorious 15th century figure Vlad Tepes (Count Dracula), right up to present day, touching on such diverse personalities as the Kennedys, Bill Clinton, and Michael Jackson. In the tradition of Alex Haley’s Roots, Dracula’s Bloodline relates a multi-generational saga through the prism of one family’s narrative, from medieval Eastern Europe to the post-Communist era. The book provides an inside look at Romania’s bloody and turbulent history—a mostly untold narrative that embraces the cruel Ottoman invasions, vying boyars seeking to change the political order at home, and the toppling of the Ceausescu regime. The story of each century is told through the eyes of one Florescu (or more) who had a unique perch from which to view his or her contemporary society. Florescu and Cazacu drew on research that had mostly been kept in family hands. To track the Florescu footprint down through the centuries since the 1400s, they used many sources: the Brasov archives in Transylvania, select letters, unpublished diaries, and extensive family documents that have been scattered from Europe to the United States. This fully indexed book offers many photographs from family archives, as well as a glossary of terms and titles, and a full genealogy showing the Florescu’s family links to Vlad Tepes.",Biography & Autobiography,326,5,1,en

In telling Charlie’s story, Bragg conjures up the backwoods hamlets of Georgia and Alabama in the years when the roads were still dirt and real men never cussed in front of ladies. A masterly family chronicle and a human portrait so vivid you can smell the cornbread and whiskey, Ava’s Man is unforgettable.",Biography & Autobiography,274,5,1,en

The Family Roe: An American Story,Joshua Prager,W. W. Norton & Company,2021-09-14,"Finalist for the 2022 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction Finalist for the J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize Finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award for Nonfiction One of NPR's Best Books of 2021 A New York Times Notable Book of 2021 One of TIME's 100 Must-Read Books of 2021 ""The scope is sweeping, the writing is beautiful. It’s an epic story worthy of the impact this one case has had on the American psyche."" —Michel Martin, NPR ""Stupendous…. If you want to understand Roe more deeply before the coming decision, read it."" —Peggy Noonan, Wall Street Journal A masterpiece of reporting on the Supreme Court’s most divisive case, Roe v. Wade, and the unknown lives at its heart. Despite her famous pseudonym, “Jane Roe,” no one knows the truth about Norma McCorvey (1947–2017), whose unwanted pregnancy in 1969 opened a great fracture in American life. Journalist Joshua Prager spent hundreds of hours with Norma, discovered her personal papers—a previously unseen trove—and witnessed her final moments. The Family Roe presents her life in full. Propelled by the crosscurrents of sex and religion, gender and class, it is a life that tells the story of abortion in America. Prager begins that story on the banks of Louisiana’s Atchafalaya River where Norma was born, and where unplanned pregnancies upended generations of her forebears. A pregnancy then upended Norma’s life too, and the Dallas waitress became Jane Roe. Drawing on a decade of research, Prager reveals the woman behind the pseudonym, writing in novelistic detail of her unknown life from her time as a sex worker in Dallas, to her private thoughts on family and abortion, to her dealings with feminist and Christian leaders, to the three daughters she placed for adoption. Prager found those women, including the youngest—Baby Roe—now fifty years old. She shares her story in The Family Roe for the first time, from her tortured interactions with her birth mother, to her emotional first meeting with her sisters, to the burden that was uniquely hers from conception. The Family Roe abounds in such revelations—not only about Norma and her children but about the broader “family” connected to the case. Prager tells the stories of activists and bystanders alike whose lives intertwined with Roe. In particular, he introduces three figures as important as they are unknown: feminist lawyer Linda Coffee, who filed the original Texas lawsuit yet now lives in obscurity; Curtis Boyd, a former fundamentalist Christian, today a leading provider of third-trimester abortions; and Mildred Jefferson, the first black female Harvard Medical School graduate, who became a pro-life leader with great secrets. An epic work spanning fifty years of American history, The Family Roe will change the way you think about our enduring American divide: the right to choose or the right to life.",History,448,N/A,0,en

Eleanor West's Home for Wayward Children No Solicitations No Visitors No Quests Children have always disappeared under the right conditions; slipping through the shadows under a bed or at the back of a wardrobe, tumbling down rabbit holes and into old wells, and emerging somewhere... else. But magical lands have little need for used-up miracle children. Nancy tumbled once, but now she's back. The things she's experienced... they change a person. The children under Miss West's care understand all too well. And each of them is seeking a way back to their own fantasy world. But Nancy's arrival marks a change at the Home. There's a darkness just around each corner, and when tragedy strikes, it's up to Nancy and her new-found schoolmates to get to the heart of things. No matter the cost.

What Works in Girls' Education,"Gene B Sperling, Rebecca Winthrop",Brookings Institution Press,2015-09-29,"Hard-headed evidence on why the returns from investing in girls are so high that no nation or family can afford not to educate their girls. Gene Sperling, author of the seminal 2004 report published by the Council on Foreign Relations, and Rebecca Winthrop, director of the Center for Universal Education, have written this definitive book on the importance of girls’ education. As Malala Yousafzai expresses in her foreword, the idea that any child could be denied an education due to poverty, custom, the law, or terrorist threats is just wrong and unimaginable. More than 1,000 studies have provided evidence that high-quality girls’ education around the world leads to wide-ranging returns: Better outcomes in economic areas of growth and incomes Reduced rates of infant and maternal mortality Reduced rates of child marriage Reduced rates of the incidence of HIV/AIDS and malaria Increased agricultural productivity Increased resilience to natural disasters Women’s empowerment What Works in Girls’ Education is a compelling work for both concerned global citizens, and any academic, expert, nongovernmental organization (NGO) staff member, policymaker, or journalist seeking to dive into the evidence and policies on girls’ education.",Social Science,321,N/A,0,en

Handbook of Behavioural Family Therapy,Ian Falloon,Routledge,2015-07-30,"First published in 1988, behavioural family therapists worked in an area that had greatly changed since its inception over 20 years before. Growing out of the pioneering work of Gerald Patterson, Robert Paul Liberman, and Richard Stuart, whose backgrounds vary from psychology to psychiatry to social work, behavioural family therapy (BFT) had evolved to encompass systems theory, considerations of the therapeutic alliance, as well as approaches to accounting for and restructuring family members’ subjective experiences through cognitive strategies. As BFT had not been the ‘brain child’ of any one charismatic innovator, but rather of a wide array of clinicians and researchers developing and rigorously testing hypotheses, it is fitting that this much-needed summation of the field was a collaborative product of an array of well-established practitioners of the time. They discuss in Part 1 of the book the theoretical parameters of BFT, focusing on modular behavioural strategies, the indications for therapy, assessment of family problems, pertinent issues arising in clinical practice, and approaches to the problem of resistance to change. Contributors to Part 2 then apply theory to such clinical situations as ‘parent training’ and helping families cope with patients suffering from developmental disabilities, alcoholism, schizophrenia, senile dementia, as well as anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and depressive disorders. Specific attention is also given to acute inpatient and primary health-care settings. While BFT had already proved quite effective in treating a great number of family problems, it was only in its infancy at the time of writing. As Falloon says in his overview ‘all exponents of the method are constantly involved with the process of refinement, each clinician is a researcher, each family member is a research subject, and each researcher is contributing to clinical advancement.’ This openness, in combination with a willingness to modify ‘sacred’ tenets of behaviourism while adapting proven techniques from other family therapies, made this title a landmark in its field. As such, it was not only of interest to all clinicians and researchers with a behavioural slant, but also to all family therapists who wished to challenge themselves to develop an integrative approach.",Psychology,491,N/A,0,en

The Family in Asia,"Man Singh Das, Panos D. Bardis",Taylor & Francis,2023-08-09,"The institution of the family is by far the most important of all the societal networks in which the lives of men, women and children are involved. Nowhere is this more true than in the less developed countries of Asia. Originally published in 1979, The Family in Asia aimed to provide a series of comprehensive survey chapters which described traditional family patterns in a selection of Asian countries at different stages of economic development. These range from a rapidly expanding and highly developed industrial nation, Japan, through modernising and developing countries, India, Pakistan, Iran, China, South Korea and the Philippines, to more underdeveloped countries, such as Thailand and Afghanistan. Each chapter is written by a senior country specialist and covers an integrated series of topics within a uniform framework in order to facilitate inter-country comparisons. Valuable description and statistical material is provided on the literature and on the effects of industrialisation, urbanisation and modernisation, but perhaps more important is a theoretical framework and the editors’ review of some basic characteristics of social modernisation. These include the degree of equalitarian family relations and sexual divisions in society; emphasis on individualism and independence; the differentiation and specialised functioning of social institutions; urban life; birth control and family planning; social mobility; marital disruption and divorce; neglect and care of the elderly; formal education for children; and government intervention and influence on family activities. Read in its historical context, this title will interest specialists in development and Asian studies, in demography, sociology and in anthropology. Students in particular, will value the tight analytical framework in which the book has been written.",Social Science,366,N/A,0,en

Finding the Family in Medieval and Early Modern Scotland,"Elizabeth Ewan, Janay Nugent",Routledge,2017-03-02,"In this interdisciplinary collaboration, an international group of scholars have come together to suggest new directions for the study of the family in Scotland circa 1300-1750. Contributors apply tools from across a range of disciplines including art history, literature, music, gender studies, anthropology, history and religious studies to assess creatively the broad range of sources which inform our understanding of the pre-modern Scottish family. A central purpose of this volume is to encourage further studies in this area by highlighting the types of sources available, as well as actively engaging in broader historiographical debates to demonstrate how important and effective family studies are to advancing our understanding of the past. Articles in the first section demonstrate the richness and variety of sources that exist for studies of the Scottish family. These essays clearly highlight the uniqueness, feasibility and value of family studies for pre-industrial Scotland. The second and third sections expand upon the arguments made in part one to demonstrate the importance of family studies for engaging in broader historiographical issues. The focus of section two is internal to the family. These articles assess specific family roles and how they interact with broader social forces/issues. In the final section the authors explore issues of kinship ties (an issue particularly associated with popular images of Scotland) to examine how family networks are used as a vehicle for social organization.",History,220,N/A,0,en
"Young Women, Work, and Family in England 1918-1950",Selina Todd,OUP Oxford,2005-09-22,"This fascinating account of young women's lives challenges existing assumptions about working class life and womanhood in England between the end of the First World War and the beginning of the 1950s. While contemporaries commonly portrayed young women as pleasure-loving leisure consumers, this book argues that the world of work was in fact central to their life experiences. Social and economic history are woven together to examine the working, family, and social lives of the maids, factory workers, shop assistants, and clerks who made up the majority of England's young women. Selina Todd traces the complex interaction between class, gender, and locale that shaped young women's roles at work and home, indicating that paid work structured people's lives more profoundly than many social histories suggest. Rich autobiographical accounts show that, while poverty continued to constrain life choices, young women also made their own history. Far from being apathetic workers or pliant consumers, they forged new patterns of occupational and social mobility, were important breadwinners in working class homes, developed a distinct youth culture, and acted as workplace militants. In doing so they helped to shape twentieth-century society.",History,287,N/A,0,en

A Revolution in Family Policy,"Henricson, Clem",Policy Press,2012-09-26,"This book offers a radical rethink of family policy in the UK. Clem Henricson, the family policy expert, analyses in detail the major shift in the role of the state viz a viz personal relationships in recent years, with its aspirations to reduce child poverty, increase social mobility and deliver social cohesion.Brought in by New Labour and carried forward, albeit in diluted form, by the Coalition, Henricson asks whether this philosophy of social betterment through manipulating the parent-child relationship is appropriate for family policy. She challenges the thinking behind the expectation that you can change a highly unequal society through the family route.Instead the argument is made for a family policy with its own raison d'etre, free of other government agendas. A premium is set on the need to manage the multiple core tensions in families of affection, empathy and supportiveness on the one hand and aggression, deception and self interest on the other.

Families in the Roman and Late Antique World,"Lena Larsson Loven, Mary Harlow",A&C Black,2012-02-02,"This volume seeks to explain developments within the structure of the family in antiquity, in particular in the later Roman Empire and late antiquity. Contributions extend the traditional chronological focus on the Roman family to include the transformation of familial structures in the newly formed kingdoms of late antiquity in Europe, thus allowing a greater historical perspective and establishing a new paradigm for the study of the Roman family. Drawing on the latest research by leading scholars in the field the book includes new approaches to the life course and the family in the Byzantine empire, family relationships in the dynasty of Constantine the Great, death, burial and commemoration of newborn children in Roman Italy, and widows and familial networks in Roman Egypt. In short, this volume seeks to establish a new agenda for the understanding of the Roman family and its transformation in late antiquity.",Family & Relationships,290,N/A,0,en
General Topology II,A. V. Arhangel' skii,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Compactness is related to a number of fundamental concepts of mathemat ics. Particularly important are compact Hausdorff spaces or compacta. Com pactness appeared in mathematics for the first time as one of the main topo logical properties of an interval, a square, a sphere and any closed, bounded subset of a finite dimensional Euclidean space. Once it was realized that pre cisely this property was responsible for a series of fundamental facts related to those sets such as boundedness and uniform continuity of continuous func tions defined on them, compactness was given an abstract definition in the language of general topology reaching far beyond the class of metric spaces. This immensely extended the realm of application of this concept (including in particular, function spaces of quite general nature). The fact, that general topology provided an adequate language for a description of the concept of compactness and secured a natural medium for its harmonious development is a major credit to this area of mathematics. The final formulation of a general definition of compactness and the creation of the foundations of the theory of compact topological spaces are due to P.S. Aleksandrov and Urysohn (see Aleksandrov and Urysohn (1971)).",Mathematics,265,N/A,0,en

Complex Wave Dynamics on Thin Films,"Hen-hong Chang, E.A. Demekhin",Elsevier,2002-03-14,"Wave evolution on a falling film is a classical hydrodynamic instability whose rich wave dynamics have been carefully recorded in the last fifty years. Such waves are known to profoundly affect the mass and heat transfer of multi-phase industrial units.This book describes the collective effort of both authors and their students in constructing a comprehensive theory to describe the complex wave evolution from nearly harmonic waves at the inlet to complex spatio-temporal patterns involving solitary waves downstream. The mathematical theory represents a significant breakthrough from classical linear stability theories, which can only describe the inlet harmonic waves and also extends classical soliton theory for integrable systems to real solitrary wave dynamics with dissipation. One unique feature of falling-film solitary wave dynamics, which drives much of the spatio-temporal wave evolution, is the irreversible coalescence of such localized wave structures. It represents the first full description of a hydrodynamic instability from inception to developed chaos. This approach should prove useful for other complex hydrodynamic instabilities and would allow industrial engineers to better design their multi-phase apparati by exploiting the deciphered wave dynamics. This publication gives a comprehensive review of all experimental records and existing theories and significantly advances state of the art on the subject and are complimented by complex and attractive graphics from computational fluid mechanics.",Technology & Engineering,413,N/A,0,en

Assessing Impairment,"Sam Goldstein, Jack A. Naglieri",Springer Science & Business Media,2009-06-15,"Impairment and disability are widely used terms, yet considerable disagreement exists as to their relationship—especially when impairment means different things to different professionals in the fields of mental health, medicine, and education. Although diagnostic criteria for various disorders are clearly detailed in the DSM-IV and elsewhere, criteria for impairment remain elusive. And patients with severe limitations but minimal symptoms, or the reverse, further complicate the discussion. The first in-depth treatment of the theory, definition, and evaluation of this core concept, Assessing Impairment: From Theory to Practice cuts through the confusion and cross-talk. Leading scholars and clinicians offer a robust evidence base for a much-needed reconceptualization of impairment within the context of diagnosis and disability, arguing for a wide-ranging quality-of-life perspective. This contextual approach to assessment goes beyond mere symptom counting, resulting in more accurate diagnosis, targeted interventions, and improved patient functioning. Within this concise but comprehensive volume, coverage focuses on key areas including: Current conceptualizations from the DSM-IV and other medical models. Methodologies for measuring symptom severity and impairment. Social/behavioral issues, such as resilience, adaptive behaviors, and family environment. Developmental issues across the life span. Legal and ethical questions and civil rights issues. Impairment and disability as they relate to trauma. The interdisciplinary model proposed in Assessing Impairment gives clinicians vital tools for working with the unique limitations and strengths of every patient. Child, school, and educational psychologists will find it particularly useful, given the critical importance of early detection and the complexity of young people’s lives.",Psychology,173,N/A,0,en

A Turbulent Voyage,Floyd Windom Hayes,Rowman & Littlefield,2000,"This anthology is designed to introduce the reader to the contours and content of African American Studies. The text and readings included here not only impart information but seek as their foremost goal to precipitate in the reader an awareness of the complex and changing character of the African American experience--its origins, developments, and future challenges. The book aims to engage readers in the critical analysis of a broad spectrum of subjects, themes, and issues--ancient and medieval Africa, Western European domination and African enslavement, resistance to oppression, African American expressive culture, family and educational policies, economic and political matters, and the importance of ideas. The materials included in this anthology comprise a discussion of some of the fundamental problems and prospects related to the African American experience that deserve attention in a course in African American Studies. African American Studies is a broad field concerned with the examination of the black experience, both historically and presently. Hence, the subjects, themes, and issues included in this text transcend the narrow confines of traditional academic disciplinary boundaries. In selecting materials for this book, Floyd W. Hayes was guided by a developmental or historical approach in the general compilation of each section's readings. By doing so, the author hopes that the reader will be enabled to arrive at a critical understanding of the conditions and forces that have influenced the African American experience.

Social Change and the Family in Taiwan,"Arland Thornton, Hui-Sheng Lin",University of Chicago Press,1994,"Until the 1940s, social life in Taiwan was generally organized through the family—marriages were arranged by parents, for example, and senior males held authority. In the following years, as Taiwan evolved rapidly from an agrarian to an industrialized society, individual decisions became less dependent on the family and more influenced by outside forces. Social Change and the Family in Taiwan provides an in-depth analysis of the complex changes in family relations in a society undergoing revolutionary social and economic transformation. This interdisciplinary study explores the patterns and causes of change in education, work, income, leisure time, marriage, living arrangements, and interactions among extended kin. Theoretical chapters enunciate a theory of family and social change centered on the life course and modes of social organization. Other chapters look at the shift from arranged marriages toward love matches, as well as changes in dating practices, premarital sex, fertility, and divorce.

A Concubine For The Family,Amy S. Kwei,Tatspublishing,2009-06-16,"Imagine a wife giving her husband a younger woman as a birthday present! A Concubine for the Family is a fictionalized account based on a true-life event: my Chinese grandmother's selfless gift to my grandfather to ensure a male heir for the family. It is also a story of feminine solidarity and heroism. Full of vivid descriptions, the book tells of dramatic events in an opium den, the traditions of raising silkworms as pets, acupuncture, medicines and techniques used in healing, foot binding, and behavior protocols between husbands and wives, masters and servants, children and parents, as well as the plight of a family fleeing war. It is also the heart-rending saga of a “book-fragrant” family and their harrowing experiences from 1937 until the fall of Hong Kong in 1941. Reviewing the book, the best-selling author Lisa See was moved to write: “You did a terrific job . . . I really enjoyed the story.” And the Kirkus Review wrote: “Purple Jade has broader concerns: There is the unsettling influence of American and European ‘West Ocean Devils,’ internal strife between the Nationalists and Communists, and an impending Japanese invasion . . . the author details Chinese traditions and the fascinating but evanescent world as only someone steeped in the old ways could. An adept stylist and storyteller, the author weaves with simplicity this tale of upper-class China in upheaval . . . An engaging family saga by a talented storyteller.” Using Tang poetry, colloquialisms, terms of endearment, and other vernacular, the books give the reader an immediate and deep understanding of Chinese culture and how it differs from our own. This compelling, heartfelt story of feminine and family solidarity is lovingly drawn. It will find emotional and intellectual resonance with most families in Diaspora.",Fiction,354,N/A,0,en

"A Demographic Perspective on Gender, Family and Health in Europe","Gabriele Doblhammer, Jordi Gumà",Springer,2018-02-12,"This open access book examines the triangle between family, gender, and health in Europe from a demographic perspective. It helps to understand patterns and trends in each of the three components separately, as well as their interdependencies. It overcomes the widely observable specialization in demographic research, which usually involves researchers studying either family or fertility processes or focusing on health and mortality. Coverage looks at new family and partnership forms among the young and middle-aged, their relationship with health, and the pathways through which they act. Among the old, lifelong family biography and present family situation are explored. Evidence is provided that partners advancing in age start to resemble each other more closely in terms of health, with the health of the partner being a crucial factor of an individual’s own health. Gender-specific health outcomes and pathways are central in the designs of the studies and the discussion of the results. The book compares twelve European countries reflecting different welfare state regimes and offers country-specific studies conducted in Austria, Germany, Italy - all populations which have received less attention in the past - and Sweden. As a result, readers discover the role of different concepts of family and health as well as comparisons within European countries and ethnic groups. It will be an insightful resource for students, academics, policy makers, and researchers that will help define future research in terms of gender and public health.",Social Science,302,N/A,0,en

Drawing on ethnographic and archival research, Coe uncovers a rich and dynamic set of familial concepts, habits, relationships, and expectations—what she calls repertoires—that have developed over time, through previous encounters with global capitalism. Separated immigrant families, she demonstrates, use these repertoires to help themselves navigate immigration law, the lack of child care, and a host of other problems, as well as to help raise children and maintain relationships the best way they know how. Examining this complex interplay between the local and global, Coe ultimately argues for a rethinking of what family itself means.",Social Science,253,N/A,0,en

The central thesis of the book is that God has placed human persons in a created order for which the covenant love of God provides the fundamental paradigm for parenting, sexuality, and marriage, and the formation of family life. From the perspective of the church as the new family of God, the human family is liberated from its own failures and fears, and each person is affirmed as having a place in God's kingdom.

Lucy's Family Tree,Karen Halvorsen Schreck,N/A,2006-12,"When Lucy comes home from school with a family tree assignment, she asks her parents to write her a note to excuse her from the task. Lucy's adoption from Mexico makes her feel as though her family is too ""different,"" but her parents gently and wisely challenge Lucy to think some more about it and to find three families that are the ""same."" As Lucy ponders her list of school and family friends who are ""normal,"" she comes to realize that there are many different kinds of families. Her best friend Lucinda has a stay-at-home dad and a working mom. The brother and sister next door look alike and their family matches perfectly, but she discovers that they feel different in their neighborhood because they are Jewish. Her friend Robert has two ""moms"" who both cheer him on at soccer games, and the parent who attends all of Dora's and Seth's school events is their stepfather. Although her friends the Malones certainly look like an ""all-American family,"" Lucy knows they've suffered a loss that doesn't always show on the outside. Lucy wins her bet with her parents in a surprising way and ends up creating a family tree that celebrates both her past and present. This is a wonderful book for exploring family diversity and what constitutes a family. Two pages at the back of the book offer further suggestions for parents and teachers, with new approaches for the traditional family tree project.",Adoption,0,N/A,0,en

An Infinite History,Emma Rothschild,Princeton University Press,2021-01-26,"An innovative history of deep social and economic changes in France, told through the story of a single extended family across five generations Marie Aymard was an illiterate widow who lived in the provincial town of Angoulême in southwestern France, a place where seemingly nothing ever happened. Yet, in 1764, she made her fleeting mark on the historical record through two documents: a power of attorney in connection with the property of her late husband, a carpenter on the island of Grenada, and a prenuptial contract for her daughter, signed by eighty-three people in Angoulême. Who was Marie Aymard? Who were all these people? And why were they together on a dark afternoon in December 1764? Beginning with these questions, An Infinite History offers a panoramic look at an extended family over five generations. Through ninety-eight connected stories about inquisitive, sociable individuals, ending with Marie Aymard’s great-great granddaughter in 1906, Emma Rothschild unfurls an innovative modern history of social and family networks, emigration, immobility, the French Revolution, and the transformation of nineteenth-century economic life. Rothschild spins a vast narrative resembling a period novel, one that looks at a large, obscure family, of whom almost no private letters survive, whose members traveled to Syria, Mexico, and Tahiti, and whose destinies were profoundly unequal, from a seamstress living in poverty in Paris to her third cousin, the cardinal of Algiers. Rothschild not only draws on discoveries in local archives but also uses new technologies, including the visualization of social networks, large-scale searches, and groundbreaking methods of genealogical research. An Infinite History demonstrates how the ordinary lives of one family over three centuries can constitute a remarkable record of deep social and economic changes.",History,464,N/A,0,en

Families and Family Therapy,Salvador Minuchin,Harvard University Press,2009-07-01,"No other book in the field so fully combines vivid clinical examples, specific details of technique, and mature perspectives on both effectively functioning families and those seeking therapy. The views and strategies of a master clinician are presented here in such clear and precise form that readers can proceed directly from the book with comparisons and modifications to suit their own styles and working situations. Salvador Minuchin presents six chapter-length transcripts of actual family sessions—two devoted to ordinary families who are meeting their problems with relative success; four concerned with families seeking help. Accompanying each transcript is the author’s running interpretation of what is taking place, laying particular stress on the therapist’s tactics and maneuvers. These lively sessions are interpreted in a brilliant theoretical analysis of why families develop problems and what it takes to set them right. The author constructs a model of an effectively functioning family and defines the boundaries around its different subsystems, whether parental, spouse, or sibling. He discusses ways in which families adapt to stress from within and without, as they seek to survive and grow. Dr. Minuchin describes methods of diagnosing or “mapping” problems of the troubled family and determining appropriate therapeutic goals and strategies. Different situations, such as the extended family, the family with a parental child, and the family in transition through death or divorce, are examined. Finally, the author explores the dynamics of change, examining the variety of restructuring operations that can be employed to challenge a family and to change its basic patterns.",Psychology,281,N/A,0,en

Family Sacrifices,"Russell M. Jeung, Seanan S. Fong, Helen Jin Kim",Oxford University Press,2019-05-06,"Fifty-two percent of Chinese Americans report having no religious affiliation, making them the least religiously-identified ethnic group in the United States. But that statistic obscures a much more complex reality. Family Sacrifices reveals that Chinese Americans employ familism, not religion, as the primary narrative by which they find meaning, identity, and belonging. As a transpacific lived tradition, Chinese American familism prioritizes family above other commitments and has roots in Chinese Popular Religion and Confucianism. The spiritual and ethical systems of China emphasize practicing rituals and cultivating virtue, whereas American religious research usually focuses on belief in the supernatural or belonging to a religious tradition. To address this gap in understanding, Family Sacrifices introduces the concept of liyi, translated as ritual propriety and righteous relations. Re-appropriated from its original Chinese usage, liyi offers a new way of understanding Chinese religion and a new lens for understanding the emergence of religious ""nones"" in the United States. The first book based on national survey data on Asian American religious practices, Family Sacrifices is a seminal text on the fastest-growing racial group in the United States.",Social Science,225,N/A,0,en
Tracing Your Family's Genealogical History by Records,Dane Calloway,N/A,2016-08-04,"According to the hundreds of emails and multiple great comments on my YouTube channel that I have received, people have been asking me the almost identical question, as to how would they go about tracing their family's genealogical background by records. Some of these people have stated that they have attempted to start their own research, but they tend to quit abruptly due to the lack of supporting instructions or directions as to where they should look next. Also, I took notice to many people stating that they have since researched the information and sources that I have previously presented, concerning those famously known genealogy DNA testing companies, who are blatantly and consistently producing fictitious test results, but promoting the results as if they are creditable and factual records of information, surrounding your actual genealogical historic background. When that is absolutely not true. Those constant contacts from people that I have received, led me to put together this very informative instructional reference book that will assist those in need of guidelines, as to how the beautiful journey of learning and researching one's historic background should go step by step from start to finish.",,92,N/A,0,en

Names for Light,Thirii Myo Kyaw Myint,Graywolf Press,2021-08-17,"Winner of the Graywolf Press Nonfiction Prize, a lyrical meditation on family, place, and inheritance Names for Light traverses time and memory to weigh three generations of a family’s history against a painful inheritance of postcolonial violence and racism. In spare, lyric paragraphs framed by white space, Thirii Myo Kyaw Myint explores home, belonging, and identity by revisiting the cities in which her parents and grandparents lived. As she makes inquiries into their stories, she intertwines oral narratives with the official and mythic histories of Myanmar. But while her family’s stories move into the present, her own story—that of a writer seeking to understand who she is—moves into the past, until both converge at the end of the book. Born in Myanmar and raised in Bangkok and San Jose, Myint finds that she does not have typical memories of arriving in the United States; instead, she is haunted by what she cannot remember. By the silences lingering around what is spoken. By a chain of deaths in her family line, especially that of her older brother as a child. For Myint, absence is felt as strongly as presence. And, as she comes to understand, naming those absences, finding words for the unsaid, means discovering how those who have come before have shaped her life. Names for Light is a moving chronicle of the passage of time, of the long shadow of colonialism, and of a writer coming into her own as she reckons with her family’s legacy.",Biography & Autobiography,257,N/A,0,en

In My Father's House,Fox Butterfield,Vintage,2018-10-09,"From the Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times journalist: a pathbreaking examination of our huge crime and incarceration problem that looks at the influence of the family--specifically one Oregon family with a generations-long legacy of lawlessness. The United States currently holds the distinction of housing nearly one-quarter of the world's prison population. But our reliance on mass incarceration, Fox Butterfield argues, misses the intractable reality: As few as 5 percent of families account for half of all crime, and only 10 percent account for two-thirds. In introducing us to the Bogle family, the author invites us to understand crime in this eye-opening new light. He chronicles the malignant legacy of criminality passed from parents to children, grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren. Examining the long history of the Bogles, a white family, Butterfield offers a revelatory look at criminality that forces us to disentangle race from our ideas about crime and, in doing so, strikes at the heart of our deepest stereotypes. And he makes clear how these new insights are leading to fundamentally different efforts at reform. With his empathic insight and profound knowledge of criminology, Butterfield offers us both the indelible tale of one family's transgressions and tribulations, and an entirely new way to understand crime in America.",True Crime,293,N/A,0,en
Parent's Guide to Coping with Autism,Sarah Ziegel,Robert Hale Ltd,2016-07-31,"This is an essential guide for parents and carers coping with children with autism. When Sarah Ziegel's twin boys were diagnosed with autism, aged almost three, she realized that there was very little practical information about what to do.

This book is the result of Sarah's experiences of dealing with autism in the family. While covering personal aspects such as coping emotionally with a diagnosis, the book also tackles practical matters, such as education and the EHCP process, how to get help and support, and also considers the medical side of autism.

This warm, practical book by Jen Oshman explores what the Bible says to help readers discover how to make space for others, however different they are to them, in their church and in their lives. She also gives practical advice, drawing on good practice from churches around the world in a range of situations. In a world of division, individualism, and isolation, readers will see that their church can witness to Christ by being a place of welcome, community, and connection. Chapters include how Jesus welcomes us, the impact of welcoming in the early church, the effect of being siblings in Christ, how to welcome beyond Sunday, helpful systems and strategies, how our joy in Christ causes us to be outward-looking, and mirroring the glorious vision set out in Revelation. Whether you’re a pastor looking to encourage your congregation to welcome others or a church member wanting to see unbelievers come to faith and help everyone feel part of the family, this book is for you.",Religion,100,N/A,0,en

Australian Languages,"Claire Bowern, Harold Koch",John Benjamins Publishing,2004-03-18,"This book addresses controversial issues in the application of the comparative method to the languages of Australia which have recently come to international prominence. Are these languages ‘different’ in ways that challenge the fundamental assumptions of historical linguistics? Can subgrouping be successfully undertaken using the Comparative Method? Is the genetic construct of a far-flung ‘Pama-Nyungan’ language family supportable by classic methods of reconstruction? Contrary to increasingly established views of the Australian scene, this book makes a major contribution to the demonstration that traditional methods can indeed be applied to these languages. These studies, introduced by chapters on subgrouping methodology and the history of Australian linguistic classification, rigorously apply the comparative method to establishing subgroups among Australian languages and justifying the phonology of Proto-Pama-Nyungan. Individual chapters can profitably be read either for their contribution to Australian linguistic prehistory or as case studies in the application of the comparative method.",Language Arts & Disciplines,704,N/A,0,en

In recent years it may seem that this challenge can be met most successful ly by biologicalIy oriented researchers and therapists: AlI over the world neuroleptic drugs have made it possible to control disturbing symptoms and shorten hospital stays. Ever more refined technologies permit study of intricate neurophysiological and pharma cological processes that seem to underlie, if not contribute to, schizophrenic disorders. Most recently, the discovery of the endorphins promises a new therapeutic breakthrough. At the same time, a vast and growing research litera ture confirms the importance, if not primacy, of hereditary and neurophysiological fac tors in the etiopathogenesis of these disorders. And yet, as Loren Mosher notes in this volume, after 2 decades of almost universal usage of neuroleptics, it is now dear that they do not cure schizophrenia.

Instrument of Peace,Rebecca Hall,Elsewhen Press,2016-06-24,"Raised in the world-leading Academy of magic rather than by his absentee parents, Mitch has come to see it as his home. He’s spent more time with his friends than his family and the opinion of his maths teacher matters far more than that of his parents. His peaceful life is shattered when a devastating earthquake strikes and almost claims his little brother’s life. But this earthquake is no natural phenomenon, it’s a result of the ongoing war between Heaven and Hell. To protect the Academy, one of the teachers makes an ill-advised contract with a fallen angel, unwittingly bringing down The Twisted Curse on staff and students. Even as they struggle to rebuild the school, things begin to go wrong. The curse starts small, with truancy, incomplete assignments, and negligent teachers over-reacting to minor transgressions, but it isn’t long before the bad behaviour escalates to vandalism, rioting and attempted murder. As they succumb to the influence of the curse, Mitch’s friends drift away and his girlfriend cheats on him. When the first death comes, Mitch unites with the only other students who, like him, appear to be immune to the curse; together they are determined to find the cause of the problem and stop it.",Fiction,400,N/A,0,en

The Ancestral Continuum is an extraordinary investigation into the spiritual and emotional legacies we inherit at our birth from our ancestors, and a powerful and revolutionary blueprint for transforming how we feel about ourselves.

Antiracism as Daily Practice,Jennifer Harvey,St. Martin's Press,2024-07-16,"""Nurturing and inspiring.""―Kirkus Reviews “An essential book of practical wisdom.... If you’re white and have been asking, ‘What can I do now?’ this lively and timely book is for you.”―Robert Jones, New York Times bestselling author of The Hidden Roots of White Supremacy Antiracism as Daily Practice illustrates the many ways white Americans—those newly waking to the crisis of racism in 2020 and those already aware—can choose behaviors in our everyday lives to grow racial justice. Full of real life stories, this book shows how vital it is for white people to engage in and with our families, through our social networks, in our neighborhoods, and at our jobs to make antiracism a daily living commitment. We have real power in our relationships with other white people—and not enough of us have used it. Dr. Harvey explains why we white people struggle with knowing what to do about racism, and explores the significance of emotions like grief and anger (as well as the harmful role of shame) in really reckoning with the transformation and change needed in our communities to become the partners in justice that Black communities and other communities of color need and deserve. Not only is such transformation vital to the well-being of U.S. democracy. It’s vital to the freedom and wholeness of white people too.",Social Science,220,N/A,0,en

The volume makes the case for textbook discourse studies to go beyond studies of textual representation and critically consider the ways in which textbook discourse is situated within wider social practices. Each chapter considers a different social semiotic practice in which textbook and textbook discourse is involved: representation, communication, interaction, learning, and recontextualization. In bringing together this work with contemporary ethnography scholarship, the book offers a comprehensive toolkit for further research on textbook discourse and pushes the field forward into new directions.

Making up Numbers: A History of Invention in Mathematics,Ekkehard Kopp,Open Book Publishers,2020-10-23,"Making up Numbers: A History of Invention in Mathematics offers a detailed but accessible account of a wide range of mathematical ideas. Starting with elementary concepts, it leads the reader towards aspects of current mathematical research. The book explains how conceptual hurdles in the development of numbers and number systems were overcome in the course of history, from Babylon to Classical Greece, from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, and so to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The narrative moves from the Pythagorean insistence on positive multiples to the gradual acceptance of negative numbers, irrationals and complex numbers as essential tools in quantitative analysis. Within this chronological framework, chapters are organised thematically, covering a variety of topics and contexts: writing and solving equations, geometric construction, coordinates and complex numbers, perceptions of ‘infinity’ and its permissible uses in mathematics, number systems, and evolving views of the role of axioms. Through this approach, the author demonstrates that changes in our understanding of numbers have often relied on the breaking of long-held conventions to make way for new inventions at once providing greater clarity and widening mathematical horizons. Viewed from this historical perspective, mathematical abstraction emerges as neither mysterious nor immutable, but as a contingent, developing human activity. Making up Numbers will be of great interest to undergraduate and A-level students of mathematics, as well as secondary school teachers of the subject. In virtue of its detailed treatment of mathematical ideas, it will be of value to anyone seeking to learn more about the development of the subject.",Mathematics,282,N/A,0,en

This is my only way of having a positive outcome without complications of having my true feelings come out the wrong way. It's not what you say but how you say it that means the most. Growing up in a mentally abusive family, I've learned that one single word said in different ways can have different meanings. If we say things the wrong way because we're hurting inside and hurt someone with our words, it only hurts us three times worse. God equips us all the same way and gives us all the same tools in life. The problem is he doesn't supply instructions on how to use them.

Elementary Mathematics from a Higher Standpoint,Felix Klein,Springer,2016-06-29,"These three volumes constitute the first complete English translation of Felix Klein’s seminal series “Elementarmathematik vom höheren Standpunkte aus”. “Complete” has a twofold meaning here: First, there now exists a translation of volume III into English, while until today the only translation had been into Chinese. Second, the English versions of volume I and II had omitted several, even extended parts of the original, while we now present a complete revised translation into modern English. The volumes, first published between 1902 and 1908, are lecture notes of courses that Klein offered to future mathematics teachers, realizing a new form of teacher training that remained valid and effective until today: Klein leads the students to gain a more comprehensive and methodological point of view on school mathematics. The volumes enable us to understand Klein’s far-reaching conception of elementarisation, of the “elementary from a higher standpoint”, in its implementation for school mathematics./div This volume II presents a paradigmatic realisation of Klein’s approach of elementarisation for teacher education. It is shown how the various geometries, elaborated particularly since the beginning of the 19th century, are revealed as becoming unified in a new restructured geometry. As Klein liked to stress: “Projective geometry is all geometry”. Non-Euclidean geometry proves to constitute a part of this unifying process. The teaching of geometry is discussed in a separate chapter, which provides moreover important information on the history of geometry teaching and an international comparison.",Education,318,N/A,0,en

Mourner's Bench,Sanderia Faye,University of Arkansas Press,2015-09-15,"At the First Baptist Church of Maeby, Arkansas, the sins of the child belonged to the parents until the child turned thirteen. Sarah Jones was only eight years old in the summer of 1964, but with her mother Esther Mae on eight prayer lists and flipping around town with the generally mistrusted civil rights organizers, Sarah believed it was time to get baptized and take responsibility for her own sins. That would mean sitting on the mourner’s bench come revival, waiting for her sign, and then testifying in front of the whole church. But first, Sarah would need to navigate the growing tensions of small-town Arkansas in the 1960s. Both smarter and more serious than her years (a “fifty-year-old mind in an eight-year-old body,” according to Esther), Sarah was torn between the traditions, religion, and work ethic of her community and the progressive civil rights and feminist politics of her mother, who had recently returned from art school in Chicago. When organizers from the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) came to town just as the revival was beginning, Sarah couldn’t help but be caught up in the turmoil. Most folks just wanted to keep the peace, and Reverend Jefferson called the SNCC organizers “the evil among us.” But her mother, along with local civil rights activist Carrie Dilworth, the SNCC organizers, Daisy Bates, attorney John Walker, and indeed most of the country, seemed determined to push Maeby toward integration. With characters as vibrant and evocative as their setting, Mourner’s Bench is the story of a young girl coming to terms with religion, racism, and feminism while also navigating the terrain of early adolescence and trying to settle into her place in her family and community.",Fiction,384,N/A,0,en

Summer on Sag Harbor,Sunny Hostin,HarperCollins,2023-05-02,"INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER The View cohost and three-time Emmy Award winner Sunny Hostin spirits readers away to the warm beaches of Sag Harbor in this instant New York Times bestseller, the second novel in her acclaimed Summer series. In a hidden enclave in Sag Harbor, affectionately known as SANS—Sag Harbor Hills, Azurest, and Nineveh—there’s a close-knit community of African American elites who escape the city and enjoy the beautiful warm weather and beaches at their vacation homes. Since the 1930s, very few have known about this Historically Black Beachfront Community in this part of the Hamptons on Long Island, and the residents like it that way. That is, until real estate developers discover the hidden gem. And now, the residents must fight for the soul of this HBBC. Against the odds, Olivia Jones has blazed her own enviable career path and built her name in the finance world. But hidden behind the veneer of her success, there is a gaping hole. Mourning both the loss and the betrayal of Omar, a surrogate father to her and her two godsisters, Olivia is driven to solve the mystery of what happened to her biological father, a police officer unjustly killed when she was a little girl. Untethered from her life in New York City, Olivia moves to a summer home in Sag Harbor and begins forging a new community out in this HBBC. Friendships blossom with Kara, an ambitious art curator; and Whitney, the wife of an ex-basketball player and current president of the Sag Harbor Homeowners Association; and a sexy new neighbor and single father, Garrett, who makes her reconsider her engagement with Anderson. She also takes to a kind, older gentleman named Mr. Whittingham, but soon discovers he too is not without his own troubles. As the summer stretches on, each relationship teaches her more about who she really is. Though not without cost, Olivia’s search for her authentic identity in the secret history of her family of origin and her fight to preserve her new Black utopia, will lead her to redefine the meaning of love, friendship, community, and family—and restore her faith in herself, her relationships, and her chosen path.",Fiction,444,N/A,0,en

Mayumu,Abi Balingit,HarperCollins,2023-02-28,"A sweet baking book of fantastically imaginative remixed Filipino American dessert recipes, plus essays on the Filipino American experience by baker-fundraiser Abi Balingit. When the pandemic started her lonely work-from-home life in 2020, Abi Balingit channeled all her energy into the one thing that brought her joy: baking. In her tiny, dimly lit, shared kitchen, she produced hundreds of “pasalubong” (souvenir) boxes filled with especially creative treats that blended the Filipino treats and Western style baked goods she grew up with. Each time, she’d sell out within hours and donated the proceeds to support her community in need. Now Abi shares some of these cult-favorite desserts with Mayumu (which means “sweet” in one of the 8 major languages in Philippines), an incredibly fresh baking book of 75 recipes that span from the never-before-seen, incredibly inventive flavor combinations that Abi dreamed up, to the more familiar, classic Filipino favorites: Adobo Chocolate Chip Cookie Strawberry Shortcake Sapin-Sapin (Rice Cakes) Ube Macapuno Molten Lava Cakes Matcha Pastillas Melon Chicharron Crumble Halo-Halo Baked Alaska Throughout, essays following Abi’s heritage and self-discovery introduce the flavors and experiences that have shaped her life, from visiting the motherland and her parents’ birthplace in Pampanga, Philippines, to California where she grew up and went to school, to her now home Brooklyn, NY. This beautiful book is a celebration of the Filipino American experience, perfect for home bakers wanting both nostalgic and excitingly new recipes.",Cooking,408,N/A,0,en

A Nearly Normal Family,M. T.

Edvardsson’s A Nearly Normal Family and lauds it as a “page-turner” that forces the reader to confront “the compromises we make with ourselves to be the people we believe our beloveds expect.” (NYTimes Book Review Summer Reading Issue) M.T. Edvardsson’s A Nearly Normal Family is a gripping legal thriller that forces the reader to consider: How far would you go to protect the ones you love? In this twisted narrative of love and murder, a horrific crime makes a seemingly normal family question everything they thought they knew about their life—and one another. Eighteen-year-old Stella Sandell stands accused of the brutal murder of a man almost fifteen years her senior. She is an ordinary teenager from an upstanding local family. What reason could she have to know a shady businessman, let alone to kill him? Stella’s father, a pastor, and mother, a criminal defense attorney, find their moral compasses tested as they defend their daughter, while struggling to understand why she is a suspect. Told in an unusual three-part structure, A Nearly Normal Family asks the questions: How well do you know your own children? How far would you go to protect them?",Fiction,361,5,2,en

The Family That Couldn't Sleep,D. T. Max,Random House,2006-09-05,"For two hundred years a noble Venetian family has suffered from an inherited disease that strikes their members in middle age, stealing their sleep, eating holes in their brains, and ending their lives in a matter of months. In Papua New Guinea, a primitive tribe is nearly obliterated by a sickness whose chief symptom is uncontrollable laughter. Across Europe, millions of sheep rub their fleeces raw before collapsing. In England, cows attack their owners in the milking parlors, while in the American West, thousands of deer starve to death in fields full of grass. What these strange conditions–including fatal familial insomnia, kuru, scrapie, and mad cow disease–share is their cause: prions. Prions are ordinary proteins that sometimes go wrong, resulting in neurological illnesses that are always fatal. Even more mysterious and frightening, prions are almost impossible to destroy because they are not alive and have no DNA–and the diseases they bring are now spreading around the world. In The Family That Couldn’t Sleep, essayist and journalist D. T. Max tells the spellbinding story of the prion’s hidden past and deadly future. Through exclusive interviews and original archival research, Max explains this story’s connection to human greed and ambition–from the Prussian chemist Justus von Liebig, who made cattle meatier by feeding them the flesh of other cows, to New Guinean natives whose custom of eating the brains of the dead nearly wiped them out. The biologists who have investigated these afflictions are just as extraordinary–for example, Daniel Carleton Gajdusek, a self-described “pedagogic pedophiliac pediatrician” who cracked kuru and won the Nobel Prize, and another Nobel winner, Stanley Prusiner, a driven, feared self-promoter who identified the key protein that revolutionized prion study. With remarkable precision, grace, and sympathy, Max–who himself suffers from an inherited neurological illness–explores maladies that have tormented humanity for centuries and gives reason to hope that someday cures will be found. And he eloquently demonstrates that in our relationship to nature and these ailments, we have been our own worst enemy.",Health & Fitness,333,3.5,3,en

The forms to which aunt Sophie clings, and which she seeks to impose on her family, represent an arrogant blindness to the personal needs of others and to the cruelties of the colonial system, and underscore the struggles of displaced people who must accept the eclipse of their way of life.

It Didn't Start With You,Mark Wolyn,Random House,2022-06-30,"'Groundbreaking' Tara Brach Depression. Anxiety. Chronic pain. Phobias. Obsessive thoughts. The evidence is compelling: the root of these difficulties may reside in the traumas of our parents, grandparents and even great-grandparents. The latest research affirms that traumatic experience is passed on to future generations and that this emotional inheritance, hidden in everything from our gene expression to everyday language, plays a greater role in our health than ever previously understood. Building on the work of leading experts in neuroscience and posttraumatic stress, Mark Wolynn has developed a pioneering approach to identifying and breaking these inherited family patterns. Having worked with individuals and groups on a therapeutic level for more than twenty years, It Didn't Start With You is his accessible, pragmatic and transformative guide to a method that has helped thousands of people reclaim their lives.",Self-Help,158,N/A,0,en

Friend Of A Friend . . .,David Burkus,HarperCollins,2018-05-01,"What if all the advice we’ve heard about networking is wrong? What if the best way to grow your network isn’t by introducing yourself to strangers at cocktail parties, handing out business cards, or signing up for the latest online tool, but by developing a better understanding of the existing network that’s already around you? We know that it’s essential to reach out and build a network. But did you know that it’s actually your distant or former contacts who will be the most helpful to you? Or that many of our best efforts at meeting new people simply serve up the same old opportunities we already have? In this startling new look at the art and science of networking, business school professor David Burkus digs deep to find the unexpected secrets that reveal the best ways to grow your career.

Baby of the Family,Maura Roosevelt,Penguin,2020-03-03,"A wry and addictive debut about a modern-day American dynasty and its unexpected upheaval when the patriarch wills his dwindling fortune to his youngest, adopted son—setting off a chain of events that unearths secrets and tests long-held definitions of love and family. The money is old, the problems are new. Meet the Whitbys: an American dynasty once inundated with ungodly real estate wealth and now facing a new millennium of unfamiliar obstacles. There was a time when the death of a Whitby would have made national news, but when the family patriarch, Roger, dies, he is alone. Word of his death travels from the long-suffering family lawyer to Roger’s clan of children (from four different marriages), and the outlook isn’t good. Roger has left everything to his twenty-one-year-old son Nick, a Whitby only in name—and Nick is nowhere to be found. Brooke, an older daughter who is both overwhelmingly nostalgic and unexpectedly pregnant, leads the search for Nick, hoping to convince him to let her keep her Boston home. Shelley, the only child from the third marriage, hasn’t told anyone that she’s dropped out of college just months before graduation and is currently working as an amanuensis for a blind architect, with whom she crosses complicated boundaries. And when Nick, on the run from the law after a misguided act of political activism, finally appears at Shelley’s New York home, worlds collide and explode in spectacular fashion. Soon, the three siblings are faced with the question they have been running from their whole lives: What do they want their future to look like, if they can finally escape their past? Weaving together multiple perspectives to create a portrait of the American dream gone awry, Baby of the Family is a vivid, absorbing debut about family secrets and how they define us, bind us together, and threaten to blow us apart.",Fiction,466,N/A,0,en

The Carter Family,"Frank M. Young, David Lasky",ABRAMS,2012-12-15,"A biographical graphic novel about the original superstar American folk music group, their lives, and their successes & struggles. The Carter Family: Don’t Forget This Song is a rich and compelling original graphic novel that tells the story of the Carter Family—the first superstar group of country music—who made hundreds of recordings and sold millions of records. Many of their hit songs, such as “Wildwood Flower” and “Will the Circle Be Unbroken,” have influenced countless musicians and remain timeless country standards. The Carter Family: Don’t Forget This Song is not only a unique illustrated biography, but a moving account that reveals the family’s rise to success, their struggles along the way, and their impact on contemporary music. Illustrated with exacting detail and written in the Southern dialect of the time, its dynamic narrative is pure Americana. It is also a story of success and failure, of poverty and wealth, of racism and tolerance, of creativity and business, and of the power of music and love. Praise for The Carter Family Winner of the 2013 Eisner Award for Best Reality-Based Work “[A] charming, faithful, and resonant biography of the most influential trio in the history of American roots music. . . .

How Will You Measure Your Life? (Harvard Business Review Classics),Clayton M.

The students wanted to know how to apply his wisdom to their personal lives. He shared with them a set of guidelines that have helped him find meaning in his own life, which led to this now-classic article. Although Christensen’s thinking is rooted in his deep religious faith, these are strategies anyone can use. Since 1922, Harvard Business Review has been a leading source of breakthrough ideas in management practice.

The Technique of Pseudodifferential Operators,Heinz Otto Cordes,Cambridge University Press,1995-02-23,"Pseudodifferential operators arise naturally in a solution of boundary problems for partial differential equations. The formalism of these operators serves to make the Fourier-Laplace method applicable for nonconstant coefficient equations. This book presents the technique of pseudodifferential operators and its applications, especially to the Dirac theory of quantum mechanics. The treatment uses 'Leibniz formulas' with integral remainders or as asymptotic series. While a pseudodifferential operator is commonly defined by an integral formula, it also may be described by invariance under action of a Lie group. The author discusses connections to the theory of C*-algebras, invariant algebras of pseudodifferential operators under hyperbolic evolution, and the relation of the hyperbolic theory to the propagation of maximal ideals. The Technique of Pseudodifferential Operators will be of particular interest to researchers in partial differential equations and mathematical physics.",Mathematics,398,N/A,0,en
Dimension and Extensions,"J.M. Aarts, T. Nishiura",Elsevier,1993-01-28,"Two types of seemingly unrelated extension problems are discussed in this book. Their common focus is a long-standing problem of Johannes de Groot, the main conjecture of which was recently resolved. As is true of many important conjectures, a wide range of mathematical investigations had developed, which have been grouped into the two extension problems. The first concerns the extending of spaces, the second concerns extending the theory of dimension by replacing the empty space with other spaces.The problem of de Groot concerned compactifications of spaces by means of an adjunction of a set of minimal dimension. This minimal dimension was called the compactness deficiency of a space. Early success in 1942 lead de Groot to invent a generalization of the dimension function, called the compactness degree of a space, with the hope that this function would internally characterize the compactness deficiency which is a topological invariant of a space that is externally defined by means of compact extensions of a space. From this, the two extension problems were spawned.With the classical dimension theory as a model, the inductive, covering and basic aspects of the dimension functions are investigated in this volume, resulting in extensions of the sum, subspace and decomposition theorems and theorems about mappings into spheres. Presented are examples, counterexamples, open problems and solutions of the original and modified compactification problems.",Mathematics,347,N/A,0,en
Liberal Utilitarianism,Jonathan Riley,CUP Archive,1988-04-07,"This is a book about liberal democratic values and their implications for the design of political institutions. Its distinctive feature is the use of some simple mathematical techniques (known as social choice theory) to clarify and defend a rather complex utilitarian conception of the liberal democratic 'way of life' based on John Stuart Mill's work. More specifically, the text focuses on three well-known 'social choice paradoxes' which are commonly held to destroy any possibility of an ideal harmony among liberal democratic values; and draws upon suggestions implicit in Mill's writings to develop an ethically appealing liberal democratic social choice framework in which the aforementioned paradoxes no longer cause concern. The revised framework is a rather complex version of utilitarianism and should be of special interest to welfare economists, social choice theorists, democratic political theorists and philosophers concerned with utilitarian ethics.",Business & Economics,424,N/A,0,en
Higher-Dimensional Geometry Over Finite Fields,"D. Kaledin, Y. Tschinkel",IOS Press,2008-06-05,"Number systems based on a finite collection of symbols, such as the 0s and 1s of computer circuitry, are ubiquitous in the modern age. Finite fields are the most important such number systems, playing a vital role in military and civilian communications through coding theory and cryptography. These disciplines have evolved over recent decades, and where once the focus was on algebraic curves over finite fields, recent developments have revealed the increasing importance of higher-dimensional algebraic varieties over finite fields. The papers included in this publication introduce the reader to recent developments in algebraic geometry over finite fields with particular attention to applications of geometric techniques to the study of rational points on varieties over finite fields of dimension of at least 2.",Mathematics,356,N/A,0,en

Beyond Topology,"Frdric Mynard, Elliott Pearl",American Mathematical Soc.,2009-05-15,"The purpose of this collection is to guide the non-specialist through the basic theory of various generalizations of topology, starting with clear motivations for their introduction. Structures considered include closure spaces, convergence spaces, proximity spaces, quasi-uniform spaces, merotopic spaces, nearness and filter spaces, semi-uniform convergence spaces, and approach spaces. Each chapter is self-contained and accessible to the graduate student, and focuses on motivations to introduce the generalization of topologies considered, presenting examples where desirable properties are not present in the realm of topologies and the problem is remedied in the more general context. Then, enough material will be covered to prepare the reader for more advanced papers on the topic. While category theory is not the focus of the book, it is a convenient language to study these structures and, while kept as a tool rather than an object of study, will be used throughout the book. For this reason, the book contains an introductory chapter on categorical topology.",Mathematics,395,N/A,0,en

General Principles of Quantum Field Theory,"N.N. Bogolubov, Anatoly A. Logunov, A.I. Oksak, I. Todorov",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The majority of the ""memorable"" results of relativistic quantum theory were obtained within the framework of the local quantum field approach. The explanation of the basic principles of the local theory and its mathematical structure has left its mark on all modern activity in this area. Originally, the axiomatic approach arose from attempts to give a mathematical meaning to the quantum field theory of strong interactions (of Yukawa type). The fields in such a theory are realized by operators in Hilbert space with a positive Poincare-invariant scalar product. This ""classical"" part of the axiomatic approach attained its modern form as far back as the sixties. * It has retained its importance even to this day, in spite of the fact that nowadays the main prospects for the description of the electro-weak and strong interactions are in connection with the theory of gauge fields. In fact, from the point of view of the quark model, the theory of strong interactions of Wightman type was obtained by restricting attention to just the ""physical"" local operators (such as hadronic fields consisting of ''fundamental'' quark fields) acting in a Hilbert space of physical states. In principle, there are enough such ""physical"" fields for a description of hadronic physics, although this means that one must reject the traditional local Lagrangian formalism.

Inequalities and Applications,"Catherine Bandle, Attila Gilányi, László Losonczi, Zsolt Páles, Michael Plum",Springer Science & Business Media,2008-12-17,"Inequalities continue to play an essential role in mathematics. Perhaps, they form the last field comprehended and used by mathematicians in all areas of the discipline. Since the seminal work Inequalities (1934) by Hardy, Littlewood and Pólya, mathematicians have laboured to extend and sharpen their classical inequalities. New inequalities are discovered every year, some for their intrinsic interest whilst others flow from results obtained in various branches of mathematics. The study of inequalities reflects the many and various aspects of mathematics. On one hand, there is the systematic search for the basic principles and the study of inequalities for their own sake. On the other hand, the subject is the source of ingenious ideas and methods that give rise to seemingly elementary but nevertheless serious and challenging problems. There are numerous applications in a wide variety of fields, from mathematical physics to biology and economics. This volume contains the contributions of the participants of the Conference on Inequalities and Applications held in Noszvaj (Hungary) in September 2007. It is conceived in the spirit of the preceding volumes of the General Inequalities meetings held in Oberwolfach from 1976 to 1995 in the sense that it not only contains the latest results presented by the participants, but it is also a useful reference book for both lecturers and research workers.

A Course in Mathematical Logic,Yu.I. Manin,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-06-29,"1. This book is above all addressed to mathematicians. It is intended to be a textbook of mathematical logic on a sophisticated level, presenting the reader with several of the most significant discoveries of the last ten or fifteen years. These include: the independence of the continuum hypothe sis, the Diophantine nature of enumerable sets, the impossibility of finding an algorithmic solution for one or two old problems. All the necessary preliminary material, including predicate logic and the fundamentals of recursive function theory, is presented systematically and with complete proofs. We only assume that the reader is familiar with ""naive"" set theoretic arguments. In this book mathematical logic is presented both as a part of mathe matics and as the result of its self-perception. Thus, the substance of the book consists of difficult proofs of subtle theorems, and the spirit of the book consists of attempts to explain what these theorems say about the mathematical way of thought. Foundational problems are for the most part passed over in silence. Most likely, logic is capable of justifying mathematics to no greater extent than biology is capable of justifying life. 2. The first two chapters are devoted to predicate logic.

Simple Adaptive Strategies: From Regret-matching To Uncoupled Dynamics,"Sergiu Hart, Andreu Mas-colell",World Scientific,2013-01-22,"This volume collects almost two decades of joint work of Sergiu Hart and Andreu Mas-Colell on game dynamics and equilibria. The starting point was the introduction of the adaptive strategy called regret-matching, which on the one hand is simple and natural, and on the other is shown to lead to correlated equilibria. This initial finding — boundedly rational behavior that yields fully rational outcomes in the long run — generated a large body of work on the dynamics of simple adaptive strategies. In particular, a natural condition on dynamics was identified: uncoupledness, whereby decision-makers do not know each other's payoffs and utilities (so, while chosen actions may be observable, the motivations are not). This condition turns out to severely limit the equilibria that can be reached. Interestingly, there are connections to the behavioral and neurobiological sciences and also to computer science and engineering (e.g., via notions of “regret”).Simple Adaptive Strategies is self-contained and unified in its presentation. Together with the formal treatment of concepts, theorems, and proofs, significant space is devoted to informal explanations and illuminating examples.

Clinical and Educational Interventions with Fathers,"Jay Fagan, Alan Hawkins",Routledge,2018-10-24,"Call on men's hidden strengths to help them become responsible fathers in even the most challenging circumstances!Clinical and Educational Interventions with Fathers gives you fresh approaches for effective interventions with fathers. Whether by calling on their faith to help them deal with the complexities of fatherhood or offering high-tech interventions on the Internet, these techniques help men find their strengths, maintain their masculinity, and learn to guide, nurture, and discipline with love and responsibility. Instead of thinking of fathers as deficient, the book emphasizes finding fathers’strengths and potentials for growth. It also respects the diversity of parenting styles among fathers from various ethnic, racial, and class backgrounds.No man wants to be a bad father. Nevertheless, many men in our culture do not know how to care for the children they beget. Trapped by stereotypes of masculine behavior and deprived of positive role models, they find themselves trying to do the challenging work of fatherhood without the necessary resources, information, or support.Clinical and Educational Interventions with Fathers offers positive approaches to helping men become responsible fathers, including: designing special techniques and programs to help fathers in prison and other challenging circumstances helping fathers manage anger developing therapeutic support groups for African-American men offering Web-based support for fathers training staff to recognize and respond to fathers’unique needs finding legal tools to support fathers’rights Reaching fathers has become an ever more urgent priority for practitioners as family structure and family life change. Traditional social-service programs for mothers tend not to work well with men's very different needs and attitudes. Yet very little has been published on successful interventions with fathers. Clinical and Educational Interventions with Fathers fills that gap and suggests promising new directions for further research in this field. By offering positive, tested ways to help men become responsible fathers, this volume will help you improve their lives and the lives of their sons and daughters.",Family & Relationships,286,N/A,0,en

It was the editors' conviction that the time had become ripe and the circumstances propitious for these two mathematical communities--that of PDE control and optimization theorists and that of dynamical specialists--to come together in order to share recent advances and breakthroughs in their respective disciplines.

The chain rule or differentiation of composite functions is ubiquitous since almost all (a.a.) functions are composite functions of (elementary) functions and with the change of variable method as its reverse process. The Leibniz rule or differentiation of the product of two functions is essential since it makes differentiation nonlinear and with the method of integration by parts as its reverse process.Readers will find numerous worked-out examples and exercises in this volume.

General Topology,J. Dixmier,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-06-29,"This book is a course in general topology, intended for students in the first year of the second cycle (in other words, students in their third univer sity year). The course was taught during the first semester of the 1979-80 academic year (three hours a week of lecture, four hours a week of guided work). Topology is the study of the notions of limit and continuity and thus is, in principle, very ancient. However, we shall limit ourselves to the origins of the theory since the nineteenth century. One of the sources of topology is the effort to clarify the theory of real-valued functions of a real variable: uniform continuity, uniform convergence, equicontinuity, Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem (this work is historically inseparable from the attempts to define with precision what the real numbers are). Cauchy was one of the pioneers in this direction, but the errors that slip into his work prove how hard it was to isolate the right concepts. Cantor came along a bit later; his researches into trigonometric series led him to study in detail sets of points of R (whence the concepts of open set and closed set in R, which in his work are intermingled with much subtler concepts). The foregoing alone does not justify the very general framework in which this course is set. The fact is that the concepts mentioned above have shown themselves to be useful for objects other than the real numbers.",Mathematics,150,N/A,0,en

Etale Cohomology (PMS-33),J. S. Milne,Princeton University Press,1980-04-21,"One of the most important mathematical achievements of the past several decades has been A. Grothendieck's work on algebraic geometry. In the early 1960s, he and M. Artin introduced étale cohomology in order to extend the methods of sheaf-theoretic cohomology from complex varieties to more general schemes. This work found many applications, not only in algebraic geometry, but also in several different branches of number theory and in the representation theory of finite and p-adic groups. Yet until now, the work has been available only in the original massive and difficult papers. In order to provide an accessible introduction to étale cohomology, J. S. Milne offers this more elementary account covering the essential features of the theory. The author begins with a review of the basic properties of flat and étale morphisms and of the algebraic fundamental group. The next two chapters concern the basic theory of étale sheaves and elementary étale cohomology, and are followed by an application of the cohomology to the study of the Brauer group. After a detailed analysis of the cohomology of curves and surfaces, Professor Milne proves the fundamental theorems in étale cohomology -- those of base change, purity, Poincaré duality, and the Lefschetz trace formula. He then applies these theorems to show the rationality of some very general L-series. Originally published in 1980.

Nonstandard Analysis and Vector Lattices,Semën Samsonovich Kutateladze,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Nonstandard methods of analysis consist generally in comparative study of two interpretations of a mathematical claim or construction given as a formal symbolic expression by means of two different set-theoretic models: one, a ""standard"" model and the other, a ""nonstandard"" model. The second half of the twentieth century is a period of significant progress in these methods and their rapid development in a few directions. The first of the latter appears often under the name coined by its inventor, A. Robinson. This memorable but slightly presumptuous and defiant term, non standard analysis, often swaps places with the term Robinsonian or classical non standard analysis. The characteristic feature of Robinsonian analysis is a frequent usage of many controversial concepts appealing to the actual infinitely small and infinitely large quantities that have resided happily in natural sciences from ancient times but were strictly forbidden in modern mathematics for many decades. The present-day achievements revive the forgotten term infinitesimal analysis which reminds us expressively of the heroic bygones of Calculus. Infinitesimal analysis expands rapidly, bringing about radical reconsideration of the general conceptual system of mathematics. The principal reasons for this progress are twofold. Firstly, infinitesimal analysis provides us with a novel under standing for the method of indivisibles rooted deeply in the mathematical classics.",Mathematics,312,N/A,0,en
Positive Operator Semigroups,"András Bátkai, Marjeta Kramar Fijavž, Abdelaziz Rhandi",Birkhäuser,2017-02-13,"This book gives a gentle but up-to-date introduction into the theory of operator semigroups (or linear dynamical systems), which can be used with great success to describe the dynamics of complicated phenomena arising in many applications. Positivity is a property which naturally appears in physical, chemical, biological or economic processes. It adds a beautiful and far reaching mathematical structure to the dynamical systems and operators describing these processes. In the first part, the finite dimensional theory in a coordinate-free way is developed, which is difficult to find in literature. This is a good opportunity to present the main ideas of the Perron-Frobenius theory in a way which can be used in the infinite dimensional situation. Applications to graph matrices, age structured population models and economic models are discussed. The infinite dimensional theory of positive operator semigroups with their spectral and asymptotic theory is developed in the second part. Recent applications illustrate the theory, like population equations, neutron transport theory, delay equations or flows in networks. Each chapter is accompanied by a large set of exercises. An up-to-date bibliography and a detailed subject index help the interested reader. The book is intended primarily for graduate and master students.

Classical Potential Theory and Its Probabilistic Counterpart,J. L. Doob,Springer Science & Business Media,1984-01-30,"Potential theory and certain aspects of probability theory are intimately related, perhaps most obviously in that the transition function determining a Markov process can be used to define the Green function of a potential theory. Thus it is possible to define and develop many potential theoretic concepts probabilistically, a procedure potential theorists observe withjaun diced eyes in view of the fact that now as in the past their subject provides the motivation for much of Markov process theory. However that may be it is clear that certain concepts in potential theory correspond closely to concepts in probability theory, specifically to concepts in martingale theory. For example, superharmonic functions correspond to supermartingales. More specifically: the Fatou type boundary limit theorems in potential theory correspond to supermartingale convergence theorems; the limit properties of monotone sequences of superharmonic functions correspond surprisingly closely to limit properties of monotone sequences of super martingales; certain positive superharmonic functions [supermartingales] are called ""potentials,"" have associated measures in their respective theories and are subject to domination principles (inequalities) involving the supports of those measures; in each theory there is a reduction operation whose properties are the same in the two theories and these reductions induce sweeping (balayage) of the measures associated with potentials, and so on.",Mathematics,898,N/A,0,en

Algorithmic aspects of resource allocation and multiwinner voting: theory and experiments,"Kaczmarczyk, Andrzej",Universitätsverlag der TU Berlin,2021-12-10,"This thesis is concerned with investigating elements of computational social choice in the light of real-world applications. We contribute to a better understanding of the areas of fair allocation and multiwinner voting. For both areas, inspired by real-world scenarios, we propose several new notions and extensions of existing models. Then, we analyze the complexity of answering the computational questions raised by the introduced concepts. To this end, we look through the lens of parameterized complexity. We identify different parameters which describe natural features specific to the computational problems we investigate. Exploiting the parameters, we successfully develop efficient algorithms for spe- cific cases of the studied problems. We complement our analysis by showing which parameters presumably cannot be utilized for seeking efficient algorithms. Thereby, we provide comprehensive pictures of the computational complexity of the studied problems. Specifically, we concentrate on four topics that we present below, grouped by our two areas of interest. For all but one topic, we present experimental studies based on implementations of newly developed algorithms. We first focus on fair allocation of indivisible resources. In this setting, we consider a collection of indivisible resources and a group of agents. Each agent reports its utility evaluation of every resource and the task is to “fairly” allocate the resources such that each resource is allocated to at most one agent. We concentrate on the two following issues regarding this scenario. The social context in fair allocation of indivisible resources. In many fair allocation settings, it is unlikely that every agent knows all other agents. For example, consider a scenario where the agents represent employees of a large corporation. It is highly unlikely that every employee knows every other employee. Motivated by such settings, we come up with a new model of graph envy-freeness by adapting the classical envy-freeness notion to account for social relations of agents modeled as social networks. We show that if the given social network of agents is simple (for example, if it is a directed acyclic graph), then indeed we can sometimes find fair allocations efficiently. However, we contrast tractability results with showing NP-hardness for several cases, including those in which the given social network has a constant degree. Fair allocations among few agents with bounded rationality. Bounded rationality is the idea that humans, due to cognitive limitations, tend to simplify problems that they face. One of its emanations is that human agents usually tend to report simple utilities over the resources that they want to allocate; for example, agents may categorize the available resources only into two groups of desirable and undesirable ones. Applying techniques for solving integer linear programs, we show that exploiting bounded rationality leads to efficient algorithms for finding envy-free and Pareto-efficient allocations, assuming a small number of agents. Further, we demonstrate that our result actually forms a framework that can be applied to a number of different fairness concepts like envy-freeness up to one good or envy-freeness up to any good. This way, we obtain efficient algorithms for a number of fair allocation problems (assuming few agents with bounded rationality). We also empirically show that our technique is applicable in practice. Further, we study multiwinner voting, where we are given a collection of voters and their preferences over a set of candidates. The outcome of a multiwinner voting rule is a group (or a set of groups in case of ties) of candidates that reflect the voters’ preferences best according to some objective. In this context, we investigate the following themes. The robustness of election outcomes. We study how robust outcomes of multiwinner elections are against possible mistakes made by voters. Assuming that each voter casts a ballot in a form of a ranking of candidates, we represent a mistake by a swap of adjacent candidates in a ballot. We find that for rules such as SNTV, k-Approval, and k-Borda, it is computationally easy to find the minimum number of swaps resulting in a change of an outcome. This task is, however, NP-hard for STV and the Chamberlin-Courant rule. We conclude our study of robustness with experimentally studying the average number of random swaps leading to a change of an outcome for several rules. Strategic voting in multiwinner elections. We ask whether a given group of cooperating voters can manipulate an election outcome in a favorable way. We focus on the k-Approval voting rule and we show that the computational complexity of answering the posed question has a rich structure. We spot several cases for which our problem is polynomial-time solvable. However, we also identify NP-hard cases. For several of them, we show how to circumvent the hardness by fixed-parameter tractability. We also present experimental studies indicating that our algorithms are applicable in practice. Diese Arbeit befasst sich mit der Untersuchung von Themen des Forschungsgebiets Computational Social Choice im Lichte realer Anwendungen. Dabei trägt sie zu einem besseren Verständnis der Bereiche der fairen Zuordnung und der Mehrgewinnerwahlen bei. Für beide Konzepte schlagen wir – inspiriert von realen Anwendungen – verschiedene neue Begriffe und Erweiterungen bestehender Modelle vor. Anschließend analysieren wir die Komplexität der Beantwortung von Berechnungsfragen, die durch die eingeführten Konzepte aufgeworfen werden. Dabei fokussieren wir uns auf die parametrisierte Komplexität. Hierzu identifizieren wir verschiedene Parameter, welche natürliche Merkmale der von uns untersuchten Berechnungsprobleme beschreiben. Durch die Nutzung dieser Parameter entwickeln wir erfolgreich effiziente Algorithmen für Spezialfälle der untersuchten Probleme. Wir ergänzen unsere Analyse indem wir zeigen, welche Parameter vermutlich nicht verwendet werden können um effiziente Algorithmen zu finden. Dabei zeichnen wir ein umfassendes Bild der Berechnungskomplexität der untersuchten Probleme. Insbesondere konzentrieren wir uns auf vier Themen, die wir, gruppiert nach unseren beiden Schwerpunkten, unten vorstellen. Für alle Themen bis auf eines präsentieren wir Experimente, die auf Implementierungen der von uns neu entwickelten Algorithmen basieren. Wir konzentrieren uns zunächst auf die faire Zuordnung unteilbarer Ressourcen. Hier betrachten wir eine Menge unteilbarer Ressourcen und eine Gruppe von Agenten. Jeder Agent gibt eine Bewertung des Nutzens jeder Ressource ab und die Aufgabe besteht darin, eine ""faire"" Zuordnung der Ressourcen zu finden, wobei jede Ressource höchstens einem Agenten zugeordnet werden kann. Innerhalb dieses Bereiches konzentrieren wir uns auf die beiden folgenden Problemstellungen. Der soziale Kontext bei der fairen Zuordnung unteilbarer Ressourcen. In vielen Szenarien, in denen Ressourcen zugeordnet werden sollen, ist es unwahrscheinlich, dass jeder Agent alle anderen kennt. Vorstellbar ist beispielsweise ein Szenario, in dem die Agenten Mitarbeiter eines großen Unternehmens repräsentieren. Es ist höchst unwahrscheinlich, dass jeder Mitarbeiter jeden anderen Mitarbeiter kennt. Motiviert durch solche Szenarien entwickeln wir ein neues Modell der graph-basierten Neidfreiheit. Wir erweitern den klassischen Neidfreiheitsbegriff um die sozialen Beziehungen von Agenten, die durch soziale Netzwerke modelliert werden. Einerseits zeigen wir, dass wenn das soziale Netzwerk der Agenten einfach ist (zum Beispiel, wenn es sich um einen gerichteten azyklischen Graph handelt), in manchen Fällen faire Zuordnungen effizient gefunden werden können. Andererseits stellen wir diesen algorithmisch positiven Ergebnissen mehrere NP-schweren Fällen entgegen. Ein Beispiel für einen solchen Fall sind soziale Netzwerke mit einem konstanten Knotengrad. Faire Zuteilung an wenige Agenten mit begrenzter Rationalität. Begrenzte Rationalität beschreibt die Idee, dass Menschen aufgrund kognitiver Grenzen dazu neigen, Probleme, mit denen sie konfrontiert werden, zu vereinfachen. Eine mögliche Folge dieser Grenzen ist, dass menschliche Agenten in der Regel einfache Bewertungen der gewünschten Ressourcen abgeben; beispielsweise könnten Agenten die verfügbaren Ressourcen nur in zwei Gruppen, erwünschte und unerwünschte Ressourcen, kategorisieren. Durch Anwendung von Techniken zum Lösen von Ganzzahligen Linearen Programmen zeigen wir, dass unter der Annahme einer kleinen Anzahl von Agenten die Ausnutzung begrenzter Rationalität dabei hilft, effiziente Algorithmen zum Finden neidfreier und Pareto-effizienter Zuweisungen zu entwickeln. Weiterhin zeigen wir, dass unser Ergebnis ein allgemeines Verfahren liefert, welches auf eine Reihe verschiedener Fairnesskonzepte angewendet werden kann, wie zum Beispiel Neidfreiheit bis auf ein Gut oder Neidfreiheit bis auf irgendein Gut. Auf diese Weise gewinnen wir effiziente Algorithmen für eine Reihe fairer Zuordnungsprobleme (wenige Agenten mit begrenzter Rationalität vorausgesetzt). Darüber hinaus zeigen wir empirisch, dass unsere Technik in der Praxis anwendbar ist. Weiterhin untersuchen wir Mehrgewinnerwahlen, bei denen uns eine Menge von Wählern sowie ihre Präferenzen über eine Reihe von Kandidaten gegeben sind. Das Ergebnis eines Mehrgewinnerwahlverfahrens ist eine Gruppe (oder eine Menge von Gruppen im Falle eines Unentschiedens) von Kandidaten, welche die Präferenzen der Wähler am besten einem bestimmten Ziel folgend widerspiegeln. In diesem Kontext untersuchen wir die folgenden Themen. Die Robustheit von Wahlergebnissen. Wir untersuchen, wie robust die Ergebnisse von Mehrgewinnerwahlen gegenüber möglicher Fehler der Wähler sind. Unter der Annahme, dass jeder Wähler eine Stimme in Form einer Rangliste von Kandidaten abgibt, modellieren wir einen Fehler als einen Tausch benachbarter Kandidaten in der Rangliste. Wir zeigen, dass für Wahlregeln wie SNTV, k-Approval und k-Borda die minimale Anzahl an Vertauschungen, welche zu einer Ergebnisänderung führt, einfach zu berechnen ist. Für STV und die Chamberlin-Courant-Regel ist diese Aufgabe allerdings NP-schwer. Wir schließen unsere Untersuchung der Robustheit unterschiedlicher Wahlregeln ab mit einer experimentellen Evaluierung der durchschnittlichen Anzahl zufälliger Vertauschungen, die zu einer Änderung des Ergebnisses führen. Strategische Abstimmung bei Wahlen mit mehreren Gewinnern. Wir fragen, ob eine bestimmte Gruppe von kooperierenden Wählern ein Wahlergebnis zu ihren Gunsten manipulieren kann. Dabei konzentrieren wir uns auf die k-Approval-Wahlregel. Wir zeigen, dass die Berechnungskomplexität der besagten Manipulation eine reiche Struktur besitzt. Auf der einen Seite identifizieren wir mehrere Fälle in denen das Problem in Polynomzeit lösbar ist. Auf der anderen Seite identifizieren wir jedoch auch NP-schwere Fälle. Für einige von ihnen zeigen wir, wie die Berechnungsschwere durch parametrisierte Algorithmen umgangen werden kann. Wir präsentieren zudem experimentelle Untersuchungen, welche darauf hindeuten, dass unsere Algorithmen in der Praxis anwendbar sind.",Computers,248,N/A,0,en

"Rough Sets, Fuzzy Sets, Data Mining, and Granular Computing","Dominik Slezak, Marcin Szczuka, Ivo Duentsch, Yiyu Yao",Springer,2005-09-19,"This volume contains the papers selected for presentation at the 10th Int- national Conference on Rough Sets, Fuzzy Sets, Data Mining, and Granular Computing, RSFDGrC 2005, organized at the University of Regina, August 31st–September 3rd, 2005. This conference followed in the footsteps of inter- tional events devoted to the subject of rough sets, held so far in Canada, China, Japan,Poland,Sweden, and the USA. RSFDGrC achievedthe status of biennial international conference, starting from 2003 in Chongqing, China. The theory of rough sets, proposed by Zdzis law Pawlak in 1982, is a model of approximate reasoning. The main idea is based on indiscernibility relations that describe indistinguishability of objects. Concepts are represented by - proximations. In applications, rough set methodology focuses on approximate representation of knowledge derivable from data. It leads to signi?cant results in many areas such as ?nance, industry, multimedia, and medicine. The RSFDGrC conferences put an emphasis on connections between rough sets and fuzzy sets, granularcomputing, and knowledge discoveryand data m- ing, both at the level of theoretical foundations and real-life applications. In the case of this event, additional e?ort was made to establish a linkage towards a broader range of applications. We achieved it by including in the conference program the workshops on bioinformatics, security engineering, and embedded systems, as well as tutorials and sessions related to other application areas.",Computers,764,N/A,0,en

A Course in Mathematical Logic for Mathematicians,Yu. I. Manin,Springer Science & Business Media,2009-10-13,"1. The ?rst edition of this book was published in 1977. The text has been well received and is still used, although it has been out of print for some time. In the intervening three decades, a lot of interesting things have happened to mathematical logic: (i) Model theory has shown that insights acquired in the study of formal languages could be used fruitfully in solving old problems of conventional mathematics. (ii) Mathematics has been and is moving with growing acceleration from the set-theoretic language of structures to the language and intuition of (higher) categories, leaving behind old concerns about in?nities: a new view of foundations is now emerging. (iii) Computer science, a no-nonsense child of the abstract computability theory, has been creatively dealing with old challenges and providing new ones, such as the P/NP problem. Planning additional chapters for this second edition, I have decided to focus onmodeltheory,the conspicuousabsenceofwhichinthe ?rsteditionwasnoted in several reviews, and the theory of computation, including its categorical and quantum aspects. The whole Part IV: Model Theory, is new. I am very grateful to Boris I. Zilber, who kindly agreed to write it. It may be read directly after Chapter II. The contents of the ?rst edition are basically reproduced here as Chapters I–VIII. Section IV.7, on the cardinality of the continuum, is completed by Section IV.7.3, discussing H. Woodin’s discovery.",Mathematics,389,N/A,0,en

Evolution Semigroups in Dynamical Systems and Differential Equations,"Carmen Chicone, Yuri Latushkin",American Mathematical Soc.,1999,"The main theme of the book is the spectral theory for evolution operators and evolution semigroups, a subject tracing its origins to the classical results of J. Mather on hyperbolic dynamical systems and J. Howland on nonautonomous Cauchy problems. The authors use a wide range of methods and offer a unique presentation. The authors give a unifying approach for a study of infinite-dimensional nonautonomous problems, which is based on the consistent use of evolution semigroups. This unifying idea connects various questions in stability of semigroups, infinite-dimensional hyperbolic linear skew-product flows, translation Banach algebras, transfer operators, stability radii in control theory, Lyapunov exponents, magneto-dynamics and hydro-dynamics. Thus the book is much broader in scope than existing books on asymptotic behavior of semigroups. Included is a solid collection of examples from different areas of analysis, PDEs, and dynamical systems. This is the first monograph where the spectral theory of infinite dimensional linear skew-product flows is described together with its connection to the multiplicative ergodic theorem; the same technique is used to study evolution semigroups, kinematic dynamos, and Ruelle operators; the theory of stability radii, an important concept in control theory, is also presented. Examples are included and non-traditional applications are provided.",Mathematics,375,N/A,0,en

Possibility of Long Range Precipitation Forecasting for the Hawaiian Islands,Samuel B. Solot,N/A,1948,"In order to establish a meteorological forecasting system, it is necessary to find a direct relationship between measurable physical states of the atmosphere and the end product, the weather element to be forecast. The long range forecaster is quite limited in his choice of physical parameters. In fact only the very large-scale dynamics of the atmosphere which can be expressed in terms of mean pressure patterns are amenable to long range analysis. Thus the problem reduces to finding a link between mean planetary pressure patterns and precipitation in the Hawaiian Islands",Long-range weather forecasting,666,N/A,0,en
From Stein to Weinstein and Back,"Kai Cieliebak, Y. Eliashberg",American Mathematical Soc.,2012,This book is devoted to the interplay between complex and symplectic geometry in affine complex manifolds. Affine complex (a.k.a. Stein) manifolds have canonically built into them symplectic geometry which is responsible for many phenomena in complex geometry and analysis. The goal of the book is the exploration of this symplectic geometry (the road from 'Stein to Weinstein') and its applications in the complex geometric world of Stein manifolds (the road 'back').,Mathematics,379,N/A,0,en

It starts with the definition of simplicial homology and cohomology, with many examples and applications. Then the Kolmogorov-Alexander multiplication in cohomology is introduced. A significant part of the book is devoted to applications of simplicial homology and cohomology to obstruction theory, in particular, to characteristic classes of vector bundles. The later chapters are concerned with singular homology and cohomology, and Cech and de Rham cohomology. The book ends with various applications of homology to the topology of manifolds, some of which might be of interest to experts in the area.

Contests in Higher Mathematics,Gabor J. Szekely,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"One of the most effective ways to stimulate students to enjoy intellectual efforts is the scientific competition. In 1894 the Hungarian Mathematical and Physical Society introduced a mathematical competition for high school students. The success of high school competitions led the Mathematical Society to found a college level contest, named after Miklós Schweitzer. The problems of the Schweitzer Contests are proposed and selected by the most prominent Hungarian mathematicians. This book collects the problems posed in the contests between 1962 and 1991 which range from algebra, combinatorics, theory of functions, geometry, measure theory, number theory, operator theory, probability theory, topology, to set theory. The second part contains the solutions. The Schweitzer competition is one of the most unique in the world. The experience shows that this competition helps to identify research talents. This collection of problems and solutions in several fields in mathematics can serve as a guide for many undergraduates and young mathematicians. The large variety of research level problems might be of interest for more mature mathematicians and historians of mathematics as well.",Mathematics,576,N/A,0,en

The Topology of Chaos,"Robert Gilmore, Marc Lefranc",Wiley-VCH,2002-07-19,"A new approach to understanding nonlinear dynamics and strange attractors The behavior of a physical system may appear irregular or chaotic even when it is completely deterministic and predictable for short periods of time into the future. How does one model the dynamics of a system operating in a chaotic regime? Older tools such as estimates of the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents and estimates of the spectrum of fractal dimensions do not sufficiently answer this question. In a significant evolution of the field of Nonlinear Dynamics, The Topology of Chaos responds to the fundamental challenge of chaotic systems by introducing a new analysis method-Topological Analysis-which can be used to extract, from chaotic data, the topological signatures that determine the stretching and squeezing mechanisms which act on flows in phase space and are responsible for generating chaotic data. Beginning with an example of a laser that has been operated under conditions in which it behaved chaotically, the authors convey the methodology of Topological Analysis through detailed chapters on: * Discrete Dynamical Systems: Maps * Continuous Dynamical Systems: Flows * Topological Invariants * Branched Manifolds * The Topological Analysis Program * Fold Mechanisms * Tearing Mechanisms * Unfoldings * Symmetry * Flows in Higher Dimensions * A Program for Dynamical Systems Theory Suitable at the present time for analyzing ""strange attractors"" that can be embedded in three-dimensional spaces, this groundbreaking approach offers researchers and practitioners in the discipline a complete and satisfying resolution to the fundamental questions of chaotic systems.",Mathematics,528,N/A,0,en

Danling Fu joins the current debate over this issue, examining the learning experiences of four Laotian students at a mainstream secondary school. She not only describes and interprets the students' learning situations, but also reveals their perspectives along with those of their teachers. Throughout the book, Fu provides essential information on how students with different cultural backgrounds and learning styles react, behave, and learn in a classroom and how teachers can use that knowledge to create a community of learners.",Education,256,N/A,0,en

Safe House,"Joshua Straub, PhD",WaterBrook,2015-10-20,"Parenting isn't rocket science, it's just brain surgery. And Dr. Joshua Straub has good news for you: You can do it! You don’t need to do all the “right” things as a parent. Both science and the Bible show us that the most important thing we can provide for our kids is a place of emotional safety. In other words, the posture from which we parent matters infinitely more than the techniques of parenting. Emotional safety—more than any other factor—is scientifically linked to raising kids who live, love, and lead well. Learn how to use emotional safety as a foundation from which you parent—and make a cultural impact that could change the world! In Safe House, Dr. Straub draws from his extensive research and personal experience to help you: - Foster healthy identity and social development in children of any age - Win the war without getting overwhelmed in the daily battles - Discipline in a way that builds relationship - Understand how the culture is affecting your child and what you can do about it - Cultivate responsible, self-regulating behavior in your kids - Establish an unshakeable sense of faith, morality, and values in your home - Feel more confident and peaceful as a parent - Find a greater perspective on parenting than what you might see on a daily basis Also includes a Safe House Parenting Assessment.",Religion,226,N/A,0,en

Pride and Shame in Child and Family Social Work,"Gibson, Matthew",Policy Press,2019-03-27,"What role does emotion play in child and family social work practice? In this book, researcher Matthew Gibson reviews the role of shame and pride in social work, providing invaluable new insights from the first study undertaken into the role of these emotions within professional practice. The author demonstrates how these emotions, which are embedded within the very structures of society but experienced as individual phenomena, are used as mechanism of control in relation to both professionals themselves and service users. Examining the implications of these emotional experiences in the context of professional practice and the relationship between the individual, the family and the state, the book calls for a more humane form of practice, rooted in more informed policies that take in to consideration the realities and frailties of the human experience.",Social Science,264,N/A,0,en

Marriage and Modernity,Rochona Majumdar,Duke University Press,2009-04-13,"An innovative cultural history of the evolution of modern marriage practices in Bengal, Marriage and Modernity challenges the assumption that arranged marriage is an antiquated practice. Rochona Majumdar demonstrates that in the late colonial period Bengali marriage practices underwent changes that led to a valorization of the larger, intergenerational family as a revered, “ancient” social institution, with arranged marriage as the apotheosis of an “Indian” tradition. She meticulously documents the ways that these newly embraced “traditions”—the extended family and arranged marriage—entered into competition and conversation with other emerging forms of kinship such as the modern unit of the couple, with both models participating promiscuously in the new “marketplace” for marriages, where matrimonial advertisements in the print media and the payment of dowry played central roles. Majumdar argues that together the kinship structures newly asserted as distinctively Indian and the emergence of the marriage market constituted what was and still is modern about marriages in India. Majumdar examines three broad developments related to the modernity of arranged marriage: the growth of a marriage market, concomitant debates about consumption and vulgarity in the conduct of weddings, and the legal regulation of family property and marriages. Drawing on matrimonial advertisements, wedding invitations, poems, photographs, legal debates, and a vast periodical literature, she shows that the modernization of families does not necessarily imply a transition from extended kinship to nuclear family structures, or from matrimonial agreements negotiated between families to marriage contracts between individuals. Colonial Bengal tells a very different story.",History,357,N/A,0,en

A Treatise on the Family,Gary Stanley Becker,N/A,1981-01-01,"Imagine each family as a kind of little factory--a multiperson unit producing meals, health, skills, children, and self-esteem from market goods and the time, skills, and knowledge of its members. This is only one of the remarkable concepts explored by Gary Becker in his landmark work on the family.Becker applies economic theory to the most sensitive and fateful personal decisions, such as choosing a spouse or having children. He uses the basic economic assumptions of maximizing behavior, stable preferences, arid equilibria in explicit or implicit markets to analyze the allocation of time to child care as well as to careers, to marriage and divorce in polygynous as well as monogamous societies, to the increase and decrease of wealth from one generation to another. The consideration of the family from this perspective has profound theoretical and practical implications. For example, Becker's analysis of assortative mating can be used to study matching processes generally. Becker extends the powerful tools of economic analysis to problems once considered the province of the sociologist, the anthropologist, and the historian. The obligation of these scholars to take account of his work thus constitutes an important step in the unification of the social sciences. A Treatise on the Family will have an impact on public policy as well. Becker shows that social welfare programs have significant effects on the allocation of resources within families. For example, social security taxes tend to reduce the amount of resources children give to their aged parents. The implications of these findings are obvious and far-reaching. With the publication of this extraordinary hook, the family moves to the forefront of the research agenda in the social sciences.",Families,288,N/A,0,en

Messy Grace,Caleb Kaltenbach,WaterBrook,2015-10-20,"Sometimes, grace gets messy. Caleb Kaltenbach was raised by LGBT parents, marched in gay pride parades as a youngster, and experienced firsthand the hatred and bitterness of some Christians toward his family. But then Caleb surprised everyone, including himself, by becoming a Christian…and a pastor. Very few issues in Christianity are as divisive as the acceptance of the LGBT community in the church. As a pastor and as a person with beloved family members living a gay lifestyle, Caleb had to face this issue with courage and grace. Messy Grace shows us that Jesus’s command to “love your neighbor as yourself” doesn’t have an exception clause for a gay “neighbor”—or for that matter, any other “neighbor” we might find it hard to relate to. Jesus was able to love these people and yet still hold on to his beliefs. So can you. Even when it’s messy. “Messy Grace is an important contribution to the conversation about sexual identity for churches and leaders. Caleb's story is surprising and unique, and he weaves it together compellingly. He states his views clearly, leaves room for disagreement, and champions love no matter where you are in this conversation.” —Jud Wilhite, Sr. Pastor, Central Christian Church",Religion,226,N/A,0,en

The Opposite of Spoiled,Ron Lieber,Harper Collins,2015-02-03,"New York Times Bestseller “We all want to raise children with good values—children who are the opposite of spoiled—yet we often neglect to talk to our children about money. . . . From handling the tooth fairy, to tips on allowance, chores, charity, checking accounts, and part-time jobs, this engaging and important book is a must-read for parents.” — Gretchen Rubin, author of The Happiness Project In the spirit of Wendy Mogel’s The Blessing of a Skinned Knee and Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman’s Nurture Shock, New York Times “Your Money” columnist Ron Lieber delivers a taboo-shattering manifesto that explains how talking openly to children about money can help parents raise modest, patient, grounded young adults who are financially wise beyond their years For Ron Lieber, a personal finance columnist and father, good parenting means talking about money with our kids. Children are hyper-aware of money, and they have scores of questions about its nuances. But when parents shy away from the topic, they lose a tremendous opportunity—not just to model the basic financial behaviors that are increasingly important for young adults but also to imprint lessons about what the family truly values. Written in a warm, accessible voice, grounded in real-world experience and stories from families with a range of incomes, The Opposite of Spoiled is both a practical guidebook and a values-based philosophy. The foundation of the book is a detailed blueprint for the best ways to handle the basics: the tooth fairy, allowance, chores, charity, saving, birthdays, holidays, cell phones, checking accounts, clothing, cars, part-time jobs, and college tuition. It identifies a set of traits and virtues that embody the opposite of spoiled, and shares how to embrace the topic of money to help parents raise kids who are more generous and less materialistic. But The Opposite of Spoiled is also a promise to our kids that we will make them better with money than we are. It is for all of the parents who know that honest conversations about money with their curious children can help them become more patient and prudent, but who don’t know how and when to start.",Family & Relationships,189,N/A,0,en

Red Families v. Blue Families,"Naomi Cahn, June Carbone",Oxford University Press,2010-03-08,"Red Families v. Blue Families identifies a new family model geared for the post-industrial economy. Rooted in the urban middle class, the coasts and the ""blue states"" in the last three presidential elections, the Blue Family Paradigm emphasizes the importance of women's as well as men's workforce participation, egalitarian gender roles, and the delay of family formation until both parents are emotionally and financially ready. By contrast, the Red Family Paradigm--associated with the Bible Belt, the mountain west, and rural America--rejects these new family norms, viewing the change in moral and sexual values as a crisis. In this world, the prospect of teen childbirth is the necessary deterrent to premarital sex, marriage is a sacred undertaking between a man and a woman, and divorce is society's greatest moral challenge. Yet, the changing economy is rapidly eliminating the stable, blue collar jobs that have historically supported young families, and early marriage and childbearing derail the education needed to prosper. The result is that the areas of the country most committed to traditional values have the highest divorce and teen pregnancy rates, fueling greater calls to reinstill traditional values. Featuring the groundbreaking research first hailed in The New Yorker, this penetrating book will transform our understanding of contemporary American culture and law. The authors show how the Red-Blue divide goes much deeper than this value system conflict--the Red States have increasingly said ""no"" to Blue State legal norms, and, as a result, family law has been rent in two. The authors close with a consideration of where these different family systems still overlap, and suggest solutions that permit rebuilding support for both types of families in changing economic circumstances. Incorporating results from the 2008 election, Red Families v. Blue Families will reshape the debate surrounding the culture wars and the emergence of red and blue America.",Law,299,N/A,0,en
Family Mobility,"Catherine Doherty, Wendy Patton, Paul Shield",Routledge,2014-08-21,"Family mobility decisions reveal much about how the public and private realms of social life interact and change. This sociological study explores how contemporary families reconcile individual members’ career and education projects within the family unit over time and space, and unpacks the intersubjective constraints on workforce mobility. This Australian mixed methods study sampled Defence Force families and middle class professional families to illustrate how families’ educational projects are necessarily and deeply implicated in issues of workforce mobility and immobility, in complex ways. Defence families move frequently, often absorbing the stresses of moving through ‘viscous’ institutions as private troubles. In contrast, the selective mobility of middle class professional families and their ‘no go zones’ contribute to the public issue of poorly serviced rural communities. Families with different social, material and vocational resources at their disposal are shown to reflexively weigh the benefits and risks associated with moving differently. The book also explore how priorities shift as children move through educational phases. The families’ narratives offer empirical windows on larger social processes, such as the mobility imperative, the gender imbalance in the family’s intersubjective bargains, labour market credentialism, the social construction of place, and the family’s role in the reproduction of class structure.",Social Science,234,N/A,0,en

From Source to Seep,"M. Lawson, M.J. Formolo, J.M.

To meet the increasing challenges of discovering hydrocarbon resources, it is essential that we advance our understanding of these systems through new geochemical approaches and analytical developments. Such development requires that academic- and industry-led research efforts converge in ways that are unique to the geosciences. The aim of this volume is to bring together a multidisciplinary geochemical community from industry and academia working in hydrocarbon systems to publish recent advances and state-of-the-art approaches to resolve the many remaining questions in hydrocarbon systems analysis. From Source to Seep presents geochemical and isotopic studies that are grouped into three themes: (1) source-rock identification and the temperature/timing of hydrocarbon generation; (2) mechanisms and time-scales associated with hydrocarbon migration, trapping, storage and alteration; and (3) the impact of fluid flow on reservoir properties.",Science,210,N/A,0,en

As the translator writes in a prefatory note, ``For all [advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate] students, and for the many specialists in other branches of math who need a liberal education in algebraic geometry, Shafarevich’s book is a must.'' The second volume is in two parts: Book II is a gentle cultural introduction to scheme theory, with the first aim of putting abstract algebraic varieties on a firm foundation; a second aim is to introduce Hilbert schemes and moduli spaces, that serve as parameter spaces for other geometric constructions. Book III discusses complex manifolds and their relation with algebraic varieties, Kähler geometry and Hodge theory. The final section raises an important problem in uniformising higher dimensional varieties that has been widely studied as the ``Shafarevich conjecture''. The style of Basic Algebraic Geometry 2 and its minimal prerequisites make it to a large extent independent of Basic Algebraic Geometry 1, and accessible to beginning graduate students in mathematics and in theoretical physics.",Mathematics,271,N/A,0,en

A Course in Metric Geometry,"Dmitri Burago, Yuri Burago, Sergei Ivanov",American Mathematical Society,2022-01-27,"“Metric geometry” is an approach to geometry based on the notion of length on a topological space. This approach experienced a very fast development in the last few decades and penetrated into many other mathematical disciplines, such as group theory, dynamical systems, and partial differential equations. The objective of this graduate textbook is twofold: to give a detailed exposition of basic notions and techniques used in the theory of length spaces, and, more generally, to offer an elementary introduction into a broad variety of geometrical topics related to the notion of distance, including Riemannian and Carnot-Carathéodory metrics, the hyperbolic plane, distance-volume inequalities, asymptotic geometry (large scale, coarse), Gromov hyperbolic spaces, convergence of metric spaces, and Alexandrov spaces (non-positively and non-negatively curved spaces). The authors tend to work with “easy-to-touch” mathematical objects using “easy-to-visualize” methods. The authors set a challenging goal of making the core parts of the book accessible to first-year graduate students. Most new concepts and methods are introduced and illustrated using simplest cases and avoiding technicalities.

Topological Vector Spaces,H.H. Schaefer,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The present book is intended to be a systematic text on topological vector spaces and presupposes familiarity with the elements of general topology and linear algebra. The author has found it unnecessary to rederive these results, since they are equally basic for many other areas of mathematics, and every beginning graduate student is likely to have made their acquaintance. Simi larly, the elementary facts on Hilbert and Banach spaces are widely known and are not discussed in detail in this book, which is mainly addressed to those readers who have attained and wish to get beyond the introductory level. The book has its origin in courses given by the author at Washington State University, the University of Michigan, and the University of Tiibingen in the years 1958-1963. At that time there existed no reasonably complete text on topological vector spaces in English, and there seemed to be a genuine need for a book on this subject. This situation changed in 1963 with the appearance of the book by Kelley, Namioka et al. [1] which, through its many elegant proofs, has had some influence on the final draft of this manuscript. Yet the two books appear to be sufficiently different in spirit and subject matter to justify the publication of this manuscript; in particular, the present book includes a discussion of topological tensor products, nuclear spaces, ordered topological vector spaces, and an appendix on positive operators.",Mathematics,306,N/A,0,en

The United Nations Principles to Combat Impunity: A Commentary,"Frank Haldemann, Thomas Unger",Oxford University Press,2018-03-16,"The fight against impunity has become a growing concern of the international community. Updated in 2005, the UN Set of Principles for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights Through Action to Combat Impunity is the fruit of several years of study, developed under the aegis of the UN Commission on Human Rights and then affirmed by the Human Rights Council. These Principles are today widely accepted as constituting an authoritative reference point for efforts in the fight against impunity for gross human rights abuses and serious violations of international humanitarian law. As a comprehensive attempt to codify universal accountability norms, the UN Set of Principles marks a significant step forward in the debate on the obligation of states to combat impunity in its various forms. Bringing together leading experts in the field, this volume provides comprehensive academic commentary of the 38 principles. The book is a perfect companion to the document, setting out the text of the Principles alongside detailed analysis, as well as a full introduction and a guide to the relevant literature and case law. The commentary advances debates and clarifies complex legal issues, making it an essential resource for legal academics, students, and practitioners working in fields such as human rights, international criminal law, and transitional justice.",Law,481,N/A,0,en

"Pastoral Epistles, Volume 46","Zondervan,",Zondervan Academic,2017-10-10,"The Word Biblical Commentary delivers the best in biblical scholarship, from the leading scholars of our day who share a commitment to Scripture as divine revelation. This series emphasizes a thorough analysis of textual, linguistic, structural, and theological evidence. The result is judicious and balanced insight into the meanings of the text in the framework of biblical theology. These widely acclaimed commentaries serve as exceptional resources for the professional theologian and instructor, the seminary or university student, the working minister, and everyone concerned with building theological understanding from a solid base of biblical scholarship. Overview of Commentary Organization Introduction—covers issues pertaining to the whole book, including context, date, authorship, composition, interpretive issues, purpose, and theology. Each section of the commentary includes: Pericope Bibliography—a helpful resource containing the most important works that pertain to each particular pericope. Translation—the author’s own translation of the biblical text, reflecting the end result of exegesis and attending to Hebrew and Greek idiomatic usage of words, phrases, and tenses, yet in reasonably good English. Notes—the author’s notes to the translation that address any textual variants, grammatical forms, syntactical constructions, basic meanings of words, and problems of translation. Form/Structure/Setting—a discussion of redaction, genre, sources, and tradition as they concern the origin of the pericope, its canonical form, and its relation to the biblical and extra-biblical contexts in order to illuminate the structure and character of the pericope. Rhetorical or compositional features important to understanding the passage are also introduced here. Comment—verse-by-verse interpretation of the text and dialogue with other interpreters, engaging with current opinion and scholarly research. Explanation—brings together all the results of the discussion in previous sections to expose the meaning and intention of the text at several levels: (1) within the context of the book itself; (2) its meaning in the OT or NT; (3) its place in the entire canon; (4) theological relevance to broader OT or NT issues. General Bibliography—occurring at the end of each volume, this extensive bibliographycontains all sources used anywhere in the commentary.",Religion,778,3,1,en

While many people believe that the real meaning of 'family' has shrunk to the nuclear family household, there is considerable evidence to suggest that relationships with the wider kin group remain an important part of most people's lives. Based on the findings of a major study of kinship, and including lively verbatim accounts of conversations with family members concepts of responsibility and obligation within family life are examined and the authors expand theories on the nature of assistance within families and argue that it is negotiated over time rather than given automatically.",Medical,272,N/A,0,en

Reading the Family Dance,"John V. Knapp, Kenneth Womack",University of Delaware Press,2003,"The development in recent years of the intersections between the family and literary study continues to emerge as one of the most productive and illuminating arenas of contemporary critique. In addition to addressing the family dynamic through which a given literary character develops a fully realized sense of self, family systems therapy allows readers to examine the patterns by which characters function in their larger intimate systems, whether those systems be social, institutional, or even global. As the intellectual foundation for the forms of therapy practiced by the majority of contemporary American and European psychotherapists, the study of family systems theory and its intersections with literary works affords readers with an illuminating glimpse into the terminology and processes involved in this dynamic form of critique. Perhaps most significantly, family systems therapy allows critics to consider the distinctly social interactions that characterise our pathways to interpersonal development and selfhood. John V. Knapp is Professor of English, with a joint appointment in modern literature and in teacher education, at Northern Illinois University. Kenneth Womack is Assist",Literary Criticism,342,N/A,0,en

A Village with My Name,Scott Tong,University of Chicago Press,2017-11-17,"An “immensely readable” journey through modern Chinese history told through the experiences of the author’s extended family (Christian Science Monitor). When journalist Scott Tong moved to Shanghai, his assignment was to start the first full-time China bureau for “Marketplace,” the daily business and economics program on public radio stations across the US. But for Tong the move became much more: an opportunity to reconnect with members of his extended family who’d remained there after his parents fled the communists six decades prior. Uncovering their stories gave him a new way to understand modern China’s defining moments and its long, interrupted quest to go global. A Village with My Name offers a unique perspective on China’s transitions through the eyes of regular people who witnessed such epochal events as the toppling of the Qing monarchy, Japan’s occupation during WWII, exile of political prisoners to forced labor camps, mass death and famine during the Great Leap Forward, market reforms under Deng Xiaoping, and the dawn of the One Child Policy. Tong focuses on five members of his family, who each offer a specific window on a changing country: a rare American-educated girl born in the closing days of the Qing Dynasty, a pioneer exchange student, a toddler abandoned in wartime who later rides the wave of China’s global export boom, a young professional climbing the ladder at a multinational company, and an orphan (the author’s daughter) adopted in the middle of a baby-selling scandal fueled by foreign money. Through their stories, Tong shows us China anew, visiting former prison labor camps on the Tibetan plateau and rural outposts along the Yangtze, exploring the Shanghai of the 1930s, and touring factories across the mainland—providing a compelling and deeply personal take on how China became what it is today. “Vivid and readable . . . The book’s focus on ordinary people makes it refreshingly accessible.” —Financial Times “Tong tells his story with humor, a little snark, [and] lots of love . . . Highly recommended, especially for those interested in Chinese history and family journeys.” —Library Journal (starred review)",Biography & Autobiography,262,N/A,0,en

The worldwide distributed family includes 55 recent and 10 extinct genera with about 600 species that are classified within 3 subfamilies and 12 tribes. In spite of fewer number of species, Trogossitidae is morphologically and ecologically extremely diversified. There are four-eyed predators that fly, run and even jump around swiftly in forest clearings to contrast with slow-moving, fungivorous species that dwell under the bark of old trees. There are also species that squat on flowers to feed on pollen grains as well as minute creatures that have been extracted from forest litter. Brief descriptions of all genera as well as keys to all higher taxa are provided. All known species and subspecies are listed, together with complete taxonomic references back to 1910, the date of issue of their last catalogue. The work includes maps of distribution of all genera, colour photographs of generic representatives, SEM photographs and remarks on a phylogeny of particular taxa.",Science,200,N/A,0,en

Working with Interpreters and Translators,"Henriette W. Langdon, Terry Irvine Saenz",Plural Publishing,2015-10-15,"Working with Interpreters and Translators: A Guide for Speech-Language Pathologists and Audiologists offers state-of-the-art procedures to conduct interviews, assessments, and conferences with students with limited English language proficiency and their families. As no research base is available in the field of communicative disorders on this specific topic, the information presented in this guide is supported by a critical review of the literature on best practices in interpreting for international conferences and legal and medical fields. Furthermore, the authors' experience working with language interpreters and training professionals as well as graduate students in communicative disorders, makes this a very valuable resource for professionals, interpreters/translators, as well as undergraduate and graduate students. Federal and state laws specify that, if necessary, English-language learners (ELL) need to be assessed in their native language when referred for possible special education. The number of ELL students attending public schools across the nation has increased in the past few decades. There are not enough speech-language pathologists (SLPs) or audiologists who are proficient in the various languages spoken by ELL students--even in Spanish, the most common language spoken by ELL students in the United States. The next best solution is to conduct assessments in collaboration with a trained interpreter/translator. Key features include: * Information and references for the most common languages spoken by ELL students * Discussion of culturally based variables that need to be considered in the process of interviewing and working with linguistically and culturally diverse populations *Description of the roles and responsibilities for individuals who will be collaborating as interpreters and translators with SLPs and audiologists in various contexts, such as interviews, assessments, and various meetings (such as IEPs and IFSPs), as well as suggestions on training individuals in this collaborative process *Review of best practices in speech-language and audiological assessments, both with and without materials in the given language Disclaimer: Please note that ancillary content (such documents, audio, and video) may not be included as published in the original print version of this book. Working with Interpreters and Translators: A Guide for Speech-Language Pathologists and Audiologists is a must-have reference for anyone working with ELL students. Although the process was developed with the pediatric population in mind, much of this information can be applied to older culturally and linguistically diverse populations in need of speech-language and/or hearing services. It will also be useful to professionals working with language interpreters in allied health professions in other countries.",Medical,289,N/A,0,en
Elementary Probability Theory with Stochastic Processes,K. L. Chung,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-03-09,"In the past half-century the theory of probability has grown from a minor isolated theme into a broad and intensive discipline interacting with many other branches of mathematics. At the same time it is playing a central role in the mathematization of various applied sciences such as statistics, opera tions research, biology, economics and psychology-to name a few to which the prefix ""mathematical"" has so far been firmly attached. The coming-of-age of probability has been reflected in the change of contents of textbooks on the subject. In the old days most of these books showed a visible split personality torn between the combinatorial games of chance and the so-called ""theory of errors"" centering in the normal distribution. This period ended with the appearance of Feller's classic treatise (see [Feller l]t) in 1950, from the manuscript of which I gave my first substantial course in probability. With the passage of time probability theory and its applications have won a place in the college curriculum as a mathematical discipline essential to many fields of study. The elements of the theory are now given at different levels, sometimes even before calculus. The present textbook is intended for a course at about the sophomore level. It presupposes no prior acquaintance with the subject and the first three chapters can be read largely without the benefit of calculus.",Mathematics,332,N/A,0,en

Set Theoretical Aspects of Real Analysis,Alexander B. Kharazishvili,CRC Press,2014-08-26,"Set Theoretical Aspects of Real Analysis is built around a number of questions in real analysis and classical measure theory, which are of a set theoretic flavor. Accessible to graduate students, and researchers the beginning of the book presents introductory topics on real analysis and Lebesgue measure theory. These topics highlight the boundary between fundamental concepts of measurability and nonmeasurability for point sets and functions. The remainder of the book deals with more specialized material on set theoretical real analysis. The book focuses on certain logical and set theoretical aspects of real analysis. It is expected that the first eleven chapters can be used in a course on Lebesque measure theory that highlights the fundamental concepts of measurability and non-measurability for point sets and functions. Provided in the book are problems of varying difficulty that range from simple observations to advanced results. Relatively difficult exercises are marked by asterisks and hints are included with additional explanation. Five appendices are included to supply additional background information that can be read alongside, before, or after the chapters. Dealing with classical concepts, the book highlights material not often found in analysis courses.

Mathematical Statistics With Applications,"Asha Seth Kapadia, Wenyaw Chan, Lemuel A. Moyé",CRC Press,2017-07-12,"Mathematical statistics typically represents one of the most difficult challenges in statistics, particularly for those with more applied, rather than mathematical, interests and backgrounds. Most textbooks on the subject provide little or no review of the advanced calculus topics upon which much of mathematical statistics relies and furthermore contain material that is wholly theoretical, thus presenting even greater challenges to those interested in applying advanced statistics to a specific area. Mathematical Statistics with Applications presents the background concepts and builds the technical sophistication needed to move on to more advanced studies in multivariate analysis, decision theory, stochastic processes, or computational statistics. Applications embedded within theoretical discussions clearly demonstrate the utility of the theory in a useful and relevant field of application and allow readers to avoid sudden exposure to purely theoretical materials. With its clear explanations and more than usual emphasis on applications and computation, this text reaches out to the many students and professionals more interested in the practical use of statistics to enrich their work in areas such as communications, computer science, economics, astronomy, and public health.",Mathematics,644,N/A,0,en

Mathematical Elasticity,Philippe G.

The book also shows how asymptotic methods justify nonlinear elastic shell theories and gives a detailed presentation of the Koiter equations for a nonlinearly elastic shell. An extended preface and extensive bibliography have been added to highlight the progress that has been made since the volume’s original publication. While each one of the three volumes is self-contained, together the Mathematical Elasticity set provides the only modern treatise on elasticity; introduces contemporary research on three-dimensional elasticity, the theory of plates, and the theory of shells; and contains proofs, detailed surveys of all mathematical prerequisites, and many problems for teaching and self-study These classic textbooks are for advanced undergraduates, first-year graduate students, and researchers in pure or applied mathematics or continuum mechanics.

Handbook of the Shapley Value,"Encarnación Algaba, Vito Fragnelli, Joaquín Sánchez-Soriano",CRC Press,2019-12-06,"Handbook of the Shapley Value contains 24 chapters and a foreword written by Alvin E. Roth, who was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences jointly with Lloyd Shapley in 2012. The purpose of the book is to highlight a range of relevant insights into the Shapley value. Every chapter has been written to honor Lloyd Shapley, who introduced this fascinating value in 1953. The first chapter, by William Thomson, places the Shapley value in the broader context of the theory of cooperative games, and briefly introduces each of the individual contributions to the volume. This is followed by a further contribution from the editors of the volume, which serves to introduce the more significant features of the Shapley value. The rest of the chapters in the book deal with different theoretical or applied aspects inspired by this interesting value and have been contributed specifically for this volume by leading experts in the area of Game Theory. Chapters 3 through to 10 are more focused on theoretical aspects of the Shapley value, Chapters 11 to 15 are related to both theoretical and applied areas. Finally, from Chapter 16 to Chapter 24, more attention is paid to applications of the Shapley value to different problems encountered across a diverse range of fields. As expressed by William Thomson in the Introduction to the book, ""The chapters contribute to the subject in several dimensions: Mathematical foundations; axiomatic foundations; computations; applications to special classes of games; power indices; applications to enriched classes of games; applications to concretely specified allocation problems: an ever-widening range, mapping allocation problems into games or implementation."" Nowadays, the Shapley value continues to be as appealing as when it was first introduced in 1953, or perhaps even more so now that its potential is supported by the quantity and quality of the available results. This volume collects a large amount of work that definitively demonstrates that the Shapley value provides answers and solutions to a wide variety of problems.",Business & Economics,607,N/A,0,en

Simplicial Complexes of Graphs,Jakob Jonsson,Springer,2007-12-10,"A graph complex is a finite family of graphs closed under deletion of edges. Graph complexes show up naturally in many different areas of mathematics. Identifying each graph with its edge set, one may view a graph complex as a simplicial complex and hence interpret it as a geometric object.

Saddlepoint Approximations with Applications,Ronald W. Butler,Cambridge University Press,2007-08-16,"Modern statistical methods use complex, sophisticated models that can lead to intractable computations. Saddlepoint approximations can be the answer. Written from the user's point of view, this book explains in clear language how such approximate probability computations are made, taking readers from the very beginnings to current applications. The core material is presented in chapters 1-6 at an elementary mathematical level. Chapters 7-9 then give a highly readable account of higher-order asymptotic inference. Later chapters address areas where saddlepoint methods have had substantial impact: multivariate testing, stochastic systems and applied probability, bootstrap implementation in the transform domain, and Bayesian computation and inference. No previous background in the area is required. Data examples from real applications demonstrate the practical value of the methods. Ideal for graduate students and researchers in statistics, biostatistics, electrical engineering, econometrics, and applied mathematics, this is both an entry-level text and a valuable reference.",Mathematics,548,N/A,0,en

Families of the Heart,Ann Campbell,Rutgers University Press,2022-11-11,"In this innovative analysis of canonical British novels, Campbell identifies a new literary device—the surrogate family—as a signal of cultural anxieties about young women’s changing relationship to matrimony across the long eighteenth century. By assembling chosen families rather than families of origin, Campbell convincingly argues, female protagonists in these works compensate for weak family ties, explore the world and themselves, prepare for idealized marriages, or sidestep marriage altogether. Tracing the evolution of this rich convention from the female characters in Defoe’s and Richardson’s fiction who are allowed some autonomy in choosing spouses, to the more explicitly feminist work of Haywood and Burney, in which connections between protagonists and their surrogate sisters and mothers can substitute for marriage itself, this book makes an ambitious intervention by upending a traditional trope—the model of the hierarchal family—ultimately offering a new lens through which to regard these familiar works.",Literary Criticism,111,N/A,0,en
"Archaeology of a Brothel in Nineteenth-Century Boston, MA",Jade W. Luiz,Taylor & Francis,2022-12-30,"Archaeology of a Brothel in Nineteenth-Century Boston, MA provides an accessible and thought-provoking account of the archaeological understanding of nineteenth-century prostitution in Boston, Massachusetts. The book explores how the practice of nineteenth-century sex work involved a careful construction of fantasy for brothel customers. This fantasy had the potential to provide financial stability and security for the madam of the establishment, if not for the women working for them. Employing theories of embodiment, sexuality, and an archaeology of the senses, this study of the Endicott Street collection contributes a new methodological and theoretical framework for studying the archaeology of prostitution across time, space, and culture. The material culture recovered from brothel sites allows exploration of both the semi-private, ""behind the scenes"" narrative of sex work, as well as the semi-public, eroticised ""performance space"" where patrons were entertained. Few books on the archaeology of sex work exist and this volume will both provide an updated perspective on the history of sex work in Boston in the nineteenth century as well as tie advances in gender and embodiment theories to a compelling case study. The book is for students and scholars of historical archaeology, nineteenth-century urban America, and gender studies. Students studying feminist theory and archaeology of the senses will also be interested in the contents.",Social Science,133,N/A,0,en

Genetic Hearing Impairment,"Cornelius Wilhelmus Radboud Jozef Cremers, Richard Smith",Karger Medical and Scientific Publishers,2002-01-01,"A decade of innovative findings in the research of molecular biology of hearing and deafness is reflected in this volume. The genetic causes for many types of syndromic and non-syndromic deafness are identified and genotypic-phenotypic relationships are explored. Although the type and degree of deafness caused by mutations in different genes significantly overlap, relatively unique age-related audiometric profiles are also emerging. For example, the audioprofile of DFNA1 and DFNA6-14 is a low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss; with DFNA8-14 it is a mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, and with DFNA2, DFNA5 and DFNA20-26 it is a high-frequency progressive hearing loss. Recognizing such audioprofiles can facilitate well-guided decision-making in clinical practice and can direct genetic testing for deafness. With an accurate genetic diagnosis, prognostic information can be provided to patients and their families. In the future, gene-specific habilitation options may also become available. To keep up to date with new clinical standards of diagnosing genetic hearing impairment, this book is indispensable reading to otorhinolaryngologists and audiologists.",Medical,263,N/A,0,en

Father-Daughter Succession in Family Business,"Paul W. Thurman, Robert S.

Once it would always have been his eldest son, but increasingly women are becoming involved in family firms having risen to positions of influence and leadership. Using revealing case studies from the daughters who succeeded their entrepreneur fathers in a wide variety of challenging situations, cultures and continents, Father-Daughter Succession in Family Business discusses the changes which have led to daughters gaining influence in more and more family businesses. It looks at the tensions this succession can produce between old notions of how men and women should behave, and the new style of leadership that often comes about when a woman takes the helm. This book will help consultants, business educators, and researchers, as well as those who are themselves involved in significant family managed enterprises to better understand why it can no longer be assumed in any part of the World that the first born son will take over the reins of the family business.",Business & Economics,336,N/A,0,en

"Phoenix Assurance and the Development of British Insurance: Volume 2, The Era of the Insurance Giants 1870-1984",Clive Trebilcock,Cambridge University Press,1985,"This is the second and final volume of the business history of one of the UK's oldest and largest insurance offices, based upon probably the best archive in the business. This volume covers the period from 1870 to the absorption of the Phoenix by Sun Alliance (now Royal and Sun Alliance) in 1984. The Phoenix papers are used to analyse the triumphs and trials, not only of a single insurance venture, but of an entire financial sector in a notably turbulent century. Insurance is concerned with the way people drive, the way they retire, or buy their houses, or invest, or educate their children, or go to war. It follows that a major insurance history also throws light on many aspects of modern British social history. As the great composite offices expanded to offer fire, accident, marine, and life insurance across a single 'counter', so they caught within their dealings an increasingly representative slice of British commercial and social life.",Business & Economics,1100,N/A,0,en

The analyses of womens experiences reveal the variety of ways in which private patriarchy in families combines with public patriarchy in economies and states to create a system of domination which subordinates women. The authors detail how gender is constructed under specific political, economic, and cultural circumstances, and seek to understand how state policies with differing sensitivities to womens issues have produced mixed outcomes for women and their families in the process of economic development.",Social Science,312,N/A,0,en

Confronting Saddam Hussein,Melvyn P. Leffler,Oxford University Press,2023,"""Based on a unique set of interviews and British and American documents, this book examines the motives for the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, examines the decision-making inside the Bush administration, and assesses the reasons for the chaotic, bloody, and costly occupation. The attack on America on 9/11 by al Qaeda terrorists transformed the thinking and actions of Bush and his top advisers. Bush conceived the administration's response. Fear, power, and hubris shaped his approach - fear of another attack; pride in American values; and confidence in America's ability to effectuate change. Worried about another attack on American soil - this time with biological or chemical weapons - Bush turned his attention to Iraq because of Saddam Hussein's history with weapons of mass destruction and because of his record of aggression, brutality, and duplicity. To achieve his goals, the American president embraced a strategy of coercive diplomacy. If Iraq faced a military threat, Bush hoped Hussein would open his country to inspections, relinquish his alleged weapons of mass destruction, flee, or be toppled. When Hussein admitted inspectors yet remained obstructive, Bush denounced the dictator's defiance and believed America's credibility was at stake. Without resolving the ambiguities and inconsistencies in his strategy of coercive diplomacy and failing to assess the consequences of an invasion or to plan effectively for its many contingencies, Bush ordered U.S. troops to invade Iraq. Friction and acrimony within the administration turned the occupation into a tragedy, the consequences of which we are still living with""--",History,369,N/A,0,en

Family-Peer Relationships,"Ross D. Parke, Gary W.

Considerable work in the past had focused on family issues or peer relationships, but these systems had typically been considered separately. This volume bridges the gap across these two important socialization contexts and provides insights into the processes that account for the links across the systems – the ways in which the relationships between these systems shift across development. In addition, the variations in the links between family and peers are illustrated by cross-cultural work, studies of abused children, and research on the impact of maternal depression. In short, the volume provides not only a convenient overview of recent progress at the time but lays out an agenda for future research.",Psychology,508,N/A,0,en

""A licensed psychologist in private practice, Dr. Young-Eisendrath follows four struggling couples through therapy and locates the psychological predicament at the root of failure-bound relationships: Actual lovers either don't correspond to their partners' idealized ""dream lovers"" or they exhibit traits reminiscent of previous unhappy experiences."" ""Husbands ultimately fail to grow into the model ""Hero"" or they resemble their wives' ""Terrible Fathers."" Wives who abandon the role of ""Maiden Lover"" metamorphose into a twentieth-century witch, the ""Terrible Mother."" Polly Young-Eisendrath points the way to ""mature dependence"": an intimacy built on equality.

Algebra,L.E. Sigler,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"There is no one best way for an undergraduate student to learn elementary algebra. Some kinds of presentations will please some learners and will disenchant others. This text presents elementary algebra organized accord ing to some principles of universal algebra. Many students find such a presentation of algebra appealing and easier to comprehend. The approach emphasizes the similarities and common concepts of the many algebraic structures. Such an approach to learning algebra must necessarily have its formal aspects, but we have tried in this presentation not to make abstraction a goal in itself. We have made great efforts to render the algebraic concepts intuitive and understandable. We have not hesitated to deviate from the form of the text when we feel it advisable for the learner. Often the presenta tions are concrete and may be regarded by some as out of fashion. How to present a particular topic is a subjective one dictated by the author's estima tion of what the student can best handle at this level. We do strive for consistent unifying terminology and notation. This means abandoning terms peculiar to one branch of algebra when there is available a more general term applicable to all of algebra. We hope that this text is readable by the student as well as the instructor. It is a goal of ours to free the instructor for more creative endeavors than reading the text to the students.",Mathematics,427,N/A,0,en

British Forts and Their Communities,"Christopher R. DeCorse, Zachary J. M. Beier",University Press of Florida,2018-03-14,"While the military features of historic forts usually receive the most attention from researchers, this volume focuses instead on the people who met and interacted in these sites. Contributors to British Forts and Their Communities look beyond the defensive architecture, physical landscapes, and armed conflicts to explore the complex social diversity that arose in the outposts of the British Empire. The forts investigated here operated at the empire's peak in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, protecting British colonial settlements and trading enclaves scattered across the globe. Locations in this volume include New York State, Michigan, the St. Lawrence River, and Vancouver, as well as sites in the Caribbean and in Africa. Using archaeological and archival evidence, these case studies show how forts brought together people of many different origins, ethnicities, identities, and social roles, from European soldiers to indigenous traders to African slaves. Characterized by shifting networks of people, commodities, and ideas, these fort populations were microcosms of the emerging modern world. This volume reveals how important it is to move past the conventional emphasis on the armed might of the colonizer in order to better understand the messy, entangled nature of British colonialism and the new era it helped usher in.

Bifurcations of Planar Vector Fields and Hilbert's Sixteenth Problem,Robert Roussarie,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-11-26,"In a coherent, exhaustive and progressive way, this book presents the tools for studying local bifurcations of limit cycles in families of planar vector fields. A systematic introduction is given to such methods as division of an analytic family of functions in its ideal of coefficients, and asymptotic expansion of non-differentiable return maps and desingularisation. The exposition moves from classical analytic geometric methods applied to regular limit periodic sets to more recent tools for singular limit sets. The methods can be applied to theoretical problems such as Hilbert's 16th problem, but also for the purpose of establishing bifurcation diagrams of specific families as well as explicit computations. - - - The book as a whole is a well-balanced exposition that can be recommended to all those who want to gain a thorough understanding and proficiency in the recently developed methods. The book, reflecting the current state of the art, can also be used for teaching special courses. (Mathematical Reviews)",Mathematics,215,N/A,0,en

Measures and Probabilities,Michel Simonnet,Springer Science & Business Media,1996-06-06,"Integration theory holds a prime position, whether in pure mathematics or in various fields of applied mathematics. It plays a central role in analysis; it is the basis of probability theory and provides an indispensable tool in mathe matical physics, in particular in quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics. Therefore, many textbooks devoted to integration theory are already avail able. The present book by Michel Simonnet differs from the previous texts in many respects, and, for that reason, it is to be particularly recommended. When dealing with integration theory, some authors choose, as a starting point, the notion of a measure on a family of subsets of a set; this approach is especially well suited to applications in probability theory. Other authors prefer to start with the notion of Radon measure (a continuous linear func tional on the space of continuous functions with compact support on a locally compact space) because it plays an important role in analysis and prepares for the study of distribution theory. Starting off with the notion of Daniell measure, Mr. Simonnet provides a unified treatment of these two approaches.",Mathematics,530,N/A,0,en

Be sparse! Be dense! Be robust!,"Sorge, Manuel",Universitätsverlag der TU Berlin,2017-05-31,"In this thesis we study the computational complexity of five NP-hard graph problems. It is widely accepted that, in general, NP-hard problems cannot be solved efficiently, that is, in polynomial time, due to many unsuccessful attempts to prove the contrary. Hence, we aim to identify properties of the inputs other than their length, that make the problem tractable or intractable. We measure these properties via parameters, mappings that assign to each input a nonnegative integer. For a given parameter k, we then attempt to design fixed-parameter algorithms, algorithms that on input q have running time upper bounded by f(k(q)) * |q|^c , where f is a preferably slowly growing function, |q| is the length of q, and c is a constant, preferably small. In each of the graph problems treated in this thesis, our input represents the setting in which we shall find a solution graph. In addition, the solution graphs shall have a certain property specific to our five graph problems. This property comes in three flavors. First, we look for a graph that shall be sparse! That is, it shall contain few edges. Second, we look for a graph that shall be dense! That is, it shall contain many edges. Third, we look for a graph that shall be robust! That is, it shall remain a good solution, even when it suffers several small modifications. Be sparse! In this part of the thesis, we analyze two similar problems. The input for both of them is a hypergraph H , which consists of a vertex set V and a family E of subsets of V , called hyperedges. The task is to find a support for H , a graph G such that for each hyperedge W in E we have that G[W ] is connected. Motivated by applications in network design, we study SUBSET INTERCONNECTION DESIGN, where we additionally get an integer f , and the support shall contain at most |V| - f + 1 edges. We show that SUBSET INTERCONNECTION DESIGN admits a fixed-parameter algorithm with respect to the number of hyperedges in the input hypergraph, and a fixed-parameter algorithm with respect to f + d , where d is the size of a largest hyperedge. Motivated by an application in hypergraph visualization, we study r-OUTERPLANAR SUPPORT where the support for H shall be r -outerplanar, that is, admit a edge-crossing free embedding in the plane with at most r layers. We show that r-OUTER-PLANAR SUPPORT admits a fixed-parameter algorithm with respect to m + r , where m is the number of hyperedges in the input hypergraph H. Be dense! In this part of the thesis, we study two problems motivated by community detection in social networks. Herein, the input is a graph G and an integer k. We look for a subgraph G' of G containing (exactly) k vertices which adheres to one of two mathematically precise definitions of being dense. In mu-CLIQUE, 0 < mu <= 1, the sought k-vertex subgraph G' should contain at least mu time k choose 2 edges. We study the complexity of mu-CLIQUE with respect to three parameters of the input graph G: the maximum vertex degree delta, h-index h, and degeneracy d. We have delta >= h >= d in every graph and h as well as d assume small values in graphs derived from social networks. For delta and for h, respectively, we obtain fixed-parameter algorithms for mu-CLIQUE and we show that for d + k a fixed-parameter algorithm is unlikely to exist. We prove the positive algorithmic results via developing a general framework for optimizing objective functions over k-vertex subgraphs. In HIGHLY CONNECTED SUBGRAPH we look for a k-vertex subgraph G' in which each vertex shall have degree at least floor(k/2)+1. We analyze a part of the so-called parameter ecology for HIGHLY CONNECTED SUBGRAPH, that is, we navigate the space of possible parameters in a quest to find a reasonable trade-off between small parameter values in practice and efficient running time guarantees. The highlights are that no 2^o(n) * n^c -time algorithms are possible for n-vertex input graphs unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails; that there is a O(4^g * n^2)-time algorithm for the number g of edges outgoing from the solution G; and we derive a 2^(O(sqrt(a)log(a)) + a^2nm-time algorithm for the number a of edges not in the solution. Be robust! In this part of the thesis, we study the VECTOR CONNECTIVITY problem, where we are given a graph G, a vertex labeling ell from V(G) to {1, . . . , d }, and an integer k. We are to find a vertex subset S of V(G) of size at most k such that each vertex v in V (G)\S has ell(v) vertex-disjoint paths from v to S in G. Such a set S is useful when placing servers in a network to satisfy robustness-of-service demands. We prove that VECTOR CONNECTIVITY admits a randomized fixed-parameter algorithm with respect to k, that it does not allow a polynomial kernelization with respect to k + d but that, if d is treated as a constant, then it allows a vertex-linear kernelization with respect to k. In dieser Dissertation untersuchen wir die Berechnungskomplexität von fünf NP-schweren Graphproblemen. Es wird weithin angenommen, dass NP-schwere Probleme im Allgemeinen nicht effizient gelöst werden können, das heißt, dass sie keine Polynomialzeitalgorithmen erlauben. Diese Annahme basiert auf vielen bisher nicht erfolgreichen Versuchen das Gegenteil zu beweisen. Aus diesem Grund versuchen wir Eigenschaften der Eingabe herauszuarbeiten, die das betrachtete Problem handhabbar oder unhandhabbar machen. Solche Eigenschaften messen wir mittels Parametern, das heißt, Abbildungen, die jeder möglichen Eingabe eine natürliche Zahl zuordnen. Für einen gegebenen Parameter k versuchen wir dann Fixed-Parameter Algorithmen zu entwerfen, also Algorithmen, die auf Eingabe q eine obere Laufzeitschranke von f(k(q)) * |q|^c erlauben, wobei f eine, vorzugsweise schwach wachsende, Funktion ist, |q| die Länge der Eingabe, und c eine Konstante, vorzugsweise klein. In den Graphproblemen, die wir in dieser Dissertation studieren, repräsentiert unsere Eingabe eine Situation in der wir einen Lösungsgraph finden sollen. Zusätzlich sollen die Lösungsgraphen bestimmte problemspezifische Eigenschaften haben. Wir betrachten drei Varianten dieser Eigenschaften: Zunächst suchen wir einen Graphen, der sparse sein soll. Das heißt, dass er wenige Kanten enthalten soll. Dann suchen wir einen Graphen, der dense sein soll. Das heißt, dass er viele Kanten enthalten soll. Zuletzt suchen wir einen Graphen, der robust sein soll. Das heißt, dass er eine gute Lösung bleiben soll, selbst wenn er einige kleine Modifikationen durchmacht. Be sparse! In diesem Teil der Arbeit analysieren wir zwei ähnliche Probleme. In beiden ist die Eingabe ein Hypergraph H, bestehend aus einer Knotenmenge V und einer Familie E von Teilmengen von V, genannt Hyperkanten. Die Aufgabe ist einen Support für H zu finden, einen Graphen G, sodass für jede Hyperkante W in E der induzierte Teilgraph G[W] verbunden ist. Motiviert durch Anwendungen im Netzwerkdesign betrachten wir SUBSET INTERCONNECTION DESIGN, worin wir eine natürliche Zahl f als zusätzliche Eingabe bekommen, und der Support höchstens |V| - f + 1 Kanten enthalten soll. Wir zeigen, dass SUBSET INTERCONNECTION DESIGN einen Fixed-Parameter Algorithmus in Hinsicht auf die Zahl der Hyperkanten im Eingabegraph erlaubt, und einen Fixed-Parameter Algorithmus in Hinsicht auf f + d, wobei d die Größe einer größten Hyperkante ist. Motiviert durch eine Anwendung in der Hypergraphvisualisierung studieren wir r-OUTERPLANAR SUPPORT, worin der Support für H r-outerplanar sein soll, das heißt, er soll eine kantenkreuzungsfreie Einbettung in die Ebene erlauben mit höchstens r Schichten. Wir zeigen, dass r-OUTERPLANAR SUPPORT einen Fixed-Parameter Algorithmus in Hinsicht auf m + r zulässt, wobei m die Anzahl der Hyperkanten im Eingabehypergraphen H ist. Be dense! In diesem Teil der Arbeit studieren wir zwei Probleme, die durch Community Detection in sozialen Netzwerken motiviert sind. Dabei ist die Eingabe ein Graph G und eine natürliche Zahl k. Wir suchen einen Teilgraphen G' von G, der (genau) k Knoten enthält und dabei eine von zwei mathematisch präzisen Definitionen davon, dense zu sein, aufweist. In mu-CLIQUE, 0 < mu <= 1, soll der gesuchte Teilgraph G' mindestens mu mal k über 2 Kanten enthalten. Wir studieren die Berechnungskomplexität von mu-CLIQUE in Hinsicht auf drei Parameter des Eingabegraphen G: dem maximalen Knotengrad delta, dem h-Index h, und der Degeneracy d. Es gilt delta >= h >= d für jeden Graphen und h als auch d nehmen kleine Werte in Graphen an, die aus sozialen Netzwerken abgeleitet sind. Für delta und h erhalten wir Fixed-Parameter Algorithmen für mu-CLIQUE und wir zeigen, dass für d + k wahrscheinlich kein Fixed-Parameter Algorithmus existiert. Unsere positiven algorithmischen Resultate erhalten wir durch Entwickeln eines allgemeinen Frameworks zum Optimieren von Zielfunktionen über k-Knoten-Teilgraphen. In HIGHLY CONNECTED SUBGRAPH soll in dem gesuchten k-Knoten-Teilgraphen G' jeder Knoten Knotengrad mindestens floor(k/2) + 1 haben. Wir analysieren einen Teil der sogenannten Parameter Ecology für HIGHLY CONNECTED SUBGRAPH. Das heißt, wir navigieren im Raum der möglichen Parameter auf der Suche nach einem vernünftigen Trade-off zwischen kleinen Parameterwerten in der Praxis und effizienten oberen Laufzeitschranken. Die Highlights hier sind, dass es keine Algorithmen mit 2^o(n) * poly(n)-Laufzeit für HIGHLY CONNECTED SUBGRAPH gibt, es sei denn die Exponential Time Hypothesis stimmt nicht; die Entwicklung eines Algorithmus mit O(4^y * n^2 )-Laufzeit, wobei y die Anzahl der Kanten ist, die aus dem Lösungsgraphen G' herausgehen; und die Entwicklung eines Algorithmus mit 2^O(sqrt(a) log(a)) + O(a^2nm)-Laufzeit, wobei a die Anzahl der Kanten ist, die nicht in G' enthalten sind.",Mathematics,272,N/A,0,en

New Directions in Identity Theory and Research,"Jan E. Stets, Richard T.

Having emerged out of a landmark 2014 national conference that sought to integrate various research programs and to honor the groundbreaking work of Dr. Peter J.

Edited by Dr. Jan E. Stets and Dr. Richard T. Serpe, this volume asserts that researchers and scholars can no longer rely on using samples, measures, concepts, and mechanisms that limit the overall advancement of identity theory and research. Instead, as Stets and Serpe contend in their introductory chapter, ""Researchers constantly must try out new ideas, test the ideas with more refined measures, use samples that are representative yet racially and ethnically diverse, and employ methods (perhaps mixed methods) that capture the different dimensions of the identity process."" This book is the truest testament to this idea.

Archaeobotanical studies of past plant cultivation in northern Europe,"Santeri Vanhanen, Per Lagerås",Barkhuis,2020-10-31,"Plant cultivation has a long and successful history that is tightly linked to environmental and climate change, social development and to cultural traditions and diversity. This is true also for the high latitudes of northern Europe, where cultivation started thousands of years before the earliest written records. The long history of cultivation can be studied by archaeobotany, which is the study of ancient seeds, pollen and other plant remains found on archaeological sites. This book presents recent advances in North-European archaeobotany. It focuses on plant cultivation and brings together studies from different countries and research environments, both at universities and within contract archaeology. The studies cover the Nordic countries and adjacent parts of the Baltic countries and Russia, and they span more than 5.000 years of agricultural history, from the Neolithic to the Middle Ages.

Cohomological Aspects in Complex Non-Kähler Geometry,Daniele Angella,Springer,2013-11-22,"In these notes, we provide a summary of recent results on the cohomological properties of compact complex manifolds not endowed with a Kähler structure. On the one hand, the large number of developed analytic techniques makes it possible to prove strong cohomological properties for compact Kähler manifolds. On the other, in order to further investigate any of these properties, it is natural to look for manifolds that do not have any Kähler structure. We focus in particular on studying Bott-Chern and Aeppli cohomologies of compact complex manifolds. Several results concerning the computations of Dolbeault and Bott-Chern cohomologies on nilmanifolds are summarized, allowing readers to study explicit examples.

Manjunath",John Wiley & Sons,2016-05-02,"Integrates the theory and applications of statistics using R A Course in Statistics with R has been written to bridge the gap between theory and applications and explain how mathematical expressions are converted into R programs. The book has been primarily designed as a useful companion for a Masters student during each semester of the course, but will also help applied statisticians in revisiting the underpinnings of the subject. With this dual goal in mind, the book begins with R basics and quickly covers visualization and exploratory analysis. Probability and statistical inference, inclusive of classical, nonparametric, and Bayesian schools, is developed with definitions, motivations, mathematical expression and R programs in a way which will help the reader to understand the mathematical development as well as R implementation. Linear regression models, experimental designs, multivariate analysis, and categorical data analysis are treated in a way which makes effective use of visualization techniques and the related statistical techniques underlying them through practical applications, and hence helps the reader to achieve a clear understanding of the associated statistical models. Key features: Integrates R basics with statistical concepts Provides graphical presentations inclusive of mathematical expressions Aids understanding of limit theorems of probability with and without the simulation approach Presents detailed algorithmic development of statistical models from scratch Includes practical applications with over 50 data sets",Computers,693,N/A,0,en

A Treatise on the Mathematical Theory of Elasticity,Augustus Edward Hough Love,N/A,1892,"An indispensable reference work for engineers, mathematicians, and physicists, this book is the most complete and authoritative treatment of classical elasticity in a single volume. Beginning with elementary notions of extension, simple shear and homogeneous strain, the analysis rapidly undertakes a development of types of strain, displacements corresponding to a given strain, cubical dilatation, composition of strains and a general theory of strains. A detailed analysis of stress including the stress quadric and uniformly varying stress leads into an exposition of the elasticity of solid bodies. Based upon the work-energy concept, experimental results are examined and the significance of elastic constants in general theory considered. Hooke's Law, elastic constants, methods of determining stress, thermo-elastic equations, and other topics are carefully discussed. --Back cover.",Elasticity,376,N/A,0,en

The Carriers,Anne Skomorowsky,Columbia University Press,2022-05-03,"A tiny mutation on the X chromosome can shape a family’s history. Passed down from a “carrier” parent to a child, fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and autism. Beyond that—and a rarity among genetic disorders—some fragile X carriers not only transmit the mutation but also experience related conditions themselves. In such cases, carriers can have tremors, infertility, and psychiatric disorders that complicate raising children with fragile X syndrome—and all too often, they suffer in silence. The Carriers investigates this common but still little-known genetic condition and its life-altering consequences. Anne Skomorowsky reveals how this disorder afflicts families across generations, telling the stories of the mothers and grandparents of fragile X patients and considering how genes interact with family dynamics. She interweaves the personal narratives and family histories of the people affected by fragile X disorders with clear and accessible explanations of the science behind them. Skomorowsky unpacks the latest research on the fragile X mutation and explores the history of its discovery. She highlights the roles of women as carriers, caregivers, and researchers who have made astonishing scientific breakthroughs over the last three decades. The Carriers is an essential book for fragile X families, including those just learning they are carriers, and for all readers interested in the complexities of heredity, the ethical dilemmas of genetic medicine, and the relationship between genes and personality.",Medical,118,5,1,en

Psychopathology and the Family,"Jennifer Hudson, Ron Rapee",Elsevier,2005-10-11,"Understanding the factors that place an individual at greater risk of developing psychopathology has important implications for both treatment and prevention of psychological disorders. Of critical relevance in this regard is the exploration of the potential influence of the family. Parenting and the family environment are considered to significantly contribute to a child's early development and adjustment. It follows then that parental behavior may also be of importance in the development, maintenance and or the prevention of psychopathology. Over the past 50 years there has been a considerable amount of research as well as controversy surrounding the link between parenting and psychopathology. The purpose of this book is to provide researchers and clinicians with state-of-the art research findings, presented by experts in the field, on the role of the family in the development and maintenance of psychopathology. This edited book is divided into 3 sections. The first addresses broader issues of theory and methodology and the second provides separate chapters relating to the role of the family in the development and maintenance of specific psychopathologies. A final section discusses the involvement of the family in treatment and prevention.",Psychology,399,N/A,0,en

X-Plan Parenting,Bert Fulks,Howard Books,2019-06-11,"Winner of the Gold Medal for Best Christian Family and Parenting Book of 2020 by the Illumination Book Awards The creator of the viral parenting concept the “X-Plan” illuminates the importance of awakening your child’s unique strength—while also taking an introspective look at your own life story to become a better parent. Last year, father and former teacher Bert Fulks’s simple parenting idea went viral: if your teenagers find themselves in a situation where they feel uncomfortable or trapped, they can text a family member an “X.” That family member will then call, giving the teen a way out, while still maintaining their freedom—and no questions will be asked. Now in X-Plan Parenting, Fulks expands on the how and the why behind his plan, emphasizing the importance of developing trusting relationships with our kids. Drawing on biblical principles, Fulks’s approach illuminates how even though we want the very best for our children, we sometimes parent from a place of brokenness and a desire for control rather than support and encouragement. We focus on our mistakes and painful growing up moments and the things we wish we’d had when we were kids instead of what’s best for our own children right now. This dynamic can pit kids against their parents and create rifts in the relationship. Fulks advocates for an alliance between children and parents instead of an “us vs. them” mentality. Rather than spending so much time coaxing or battling our kids, Fulks inspires us to work with our kids instead of against them. And rather than trying to right our own past wrongs vicariously through our children, he urges us to recognize where we need healing so we can provide authentic strength to support our kids’ unique journeys. There is a tender art to disciplining our kids, and X-Plan Parenting serves up laughter and tears, hard questions, and plenty of grace to moms and dads who want their kids to love God and lead passionate, joyful lives in an unpredictable world.",Family & Relationships,320,N/A,0,en

Saint X,Alexis Schaitkin,Celadon Books,2020-02-18,"A New York Times Notable Book of 2020 ""'Saint X' is hypnotic. Schaitkin's characters...are so intelligent and distinctive it feels not just easy, but necessary, to follow them. I devoured [it] in a day."" –Oyinkan Braithwaite, New York Times Book Review When you lose the person who is most essential to you, who do you become? Recommended by Entertainment Weekly, included in Good Morning America's 20 Books We're Excited for in 2020 & named as one of Vogue's Best Books to Read This Winter, Bustle's Most Anticipated Books of February 2020, and O Magazine's 14 of the Best Books to Read This February! Hailed as a “marvel of a book” and “brilliant and unflinching,” Alexis Schaitkin’s stunning debut, Saint X, is a haunting portrait of grief, obsession, and the bond between two sisters never truly given the chance to know one another. Claire is only seven years old when her college-age sister, Alison, disappears on the last night of their family vacation at a resort on the Caribbean island of Saint X. Several days later, Alison’s body is found in a remote spot on a nearby cay, and two local men–employees at the resort–are arrested. But the evidence is slim, the timeline against it, and the men are soon released. The story turns into national tabloid news, a lurid mystery that will go unsolved. For Claire and her parents, there is only the return home to broken lives. Years later, Claire is living and working in New York City when a brief but fateful encounter brings her together with Clive Richardson, one of the men originally suspected of murdering her sister. It is a moment that sets Claire on an obsessive pursuit of the truth–not only to find out what happened the night of Alison’s death but also to answer the elusive question: Who exactly was her sister? At seven, Claire had been barely old enough to know her: a beautiful, changeable, provocative girl of eighteen at a turbulent moment of identity formation. As Claire doggedly shadows Clive, hoping to gain his trust, waiting for the slip that will reveal the truth, an unlikely attachment develops between them, two people whose lives were forever marked by the same tragedy. For readers of Emma Cline’s The Girls and Lauren Groff’s Fates and Furies, Saint X is a flawlessly drawn and deeply moving story that culminates in an emotionally powerful ending.",Fiction,356,3,1,en

The Poet X,Elizabeth Acevedo,HarperCollins,2018-03-06,"Winner of the National Book Award for Young People’s Literature, the Michael L. Printz Award, and the Pura Belpré Award! Fans of Jacqueline Woodson, Meg Medina, and Jason Reynolds will fall hard for this astonishing New York Times-bestselling novel-in-verse by an award-winning slam poet, about an Afro-Latina heroine who tells her story with blazing words and powerful truth. Xiomara Batista feels unheard and unable to hide in her Harlem neighborhood. Ever since her body grew into curves, she has learned to let her fists and her fierceness do the talking. But Xiomara has plenty she wants to say, and she pours all her frustration and passion onto the pages of a leather notebook, reciting the words to herself like prayers—especially after she catches feelings for a boy in her bio class named Aman, who her family can never know about. With Mami’s determination to force her daughter to obey the laws of the church, Xiomara understands that her thoughts are best kept to herself. So when she is invited to join her school’s slam poetry club, she doesn’t know how she could ever attend without her mami finding out. But she still can’t stop thinking about performing her poems. Because in the face of a world that may not want to hear her, Xiomara refuses to be silent. “Crackles with energy and snaps with authenticity and voice.” —Justina Ireland, author of Dread Nation “An incredibly potent debut.” —Jason Reynolds, author of the National Book Award Finalist Ghost “Acevedo has amplified the voices of girls en el barrio who are equal parts goddess, saint, warrior, and hero.” —Ibi Zoboi, author of American Street This young adult novel, a selection of the Schomburg Center's Black Liberation Reading List, is an excellent choice for accelerated tween readers in grades 6 to 8.

Population Dynamics,C. Y. Cyrus Chu,Oxford University Press,1998-09-03,"Population Dynamics fills the gap between the classical supply-side population theory of Malthus and the modern demand-side theory of economic demography. In doing so, author Cyrus Chu investigates specifically the dynamic macro implications of various static micro family economic decisions. Holding the characteristic composition of the macro population to always be an aggregate result of some corresponding individual micro decision, Chu extends his research on the fertility-related decisions of families to an analysis of other economic determinations. Within this framework, Chu studies the income distribution, attitude composition, job structure, and aggregate savings and pensions of the population. While in some cases a micro-macro connection is easily established under regular behavioral assumptions, in several chapters Chu enlists the mathematical tool of branching processes to determine the connection. Offering a wealth of detail, this book provides a balanced discussion of background motivation, theoretical characterization, and empirical evidence in an effort to bring about a renewal in the economic approach to population dynamics.

Generalized Symplectic Geometries and the Index of Families of Elliptic Problems,Liviu I. Nicolaescu,American Mathematical Soc.,1997,"In this book, an index theorem is proved for arbitrary families of elliptic boundary value problems for Dirac operators and a surgery formula for the index of a family of Dirac operators on a closed manifold. Also obtained is a very general result on the cobordism invariance of the index of a family. All results are established by first symplectically rephrasing the problems and then using a generalized symplectic reduction technique. This provides a unified approach to all possible parameter spaces and all possible symmetries of a Dirac operator (eigh symmetries in the real case and two in the complex case).

An explicit description of corresponding topological structures expands the theory in the case of equations with continuous right hand sides also. In reality, this is a new science where Ordinary Differential Equations, General Topology, Integration theory and Functional Analysis meet. In what concerns equations with discontinuities and differential inclu sions, we do not restrict the consideration to the Cauchy problem, but we show how to develop an advanced theory whose volume is commensurable with the volume of the existing theory of Ordinary Differential Equations.

On the Shoulders of Grandmothers,Cinzia Solari,Routledge,2017-08-03,"On the Shoulders of Grandmothers is a global ethnography of Ukrainian transnational migration. Gendered migrant subjectivities are a key site for understanding the production of neoliberal capitalism and Ukrainian nation-state building, a fraught process that places Ukraine precariously between Europe and Russia with dramatic implications for the political economy of the region. However, processes of gender and migration that undergird transnational nation-state building require further attention. Solari compares two patterns of Ukrainian migration: the ""forced"" exile of middle-aged women, most grandmothers, to Italy and the ""voluntary"" exodus of families, led by the same cohort of middle-aged women, to the United States. In both receiving sites these migrants are caregivers to the elderly. Using in-depth interviews and ethnographic data collected in three countries, Solari shows that Ukrainian nation-state building occurs transnationally. She examines the collective practices of migrants who are building the ""new"" Ukraine from the outside in and shaping both Italy and the United States as well. The Ukrainian state, in order to fulfil its First World aspirations of joining Europe and distancing itself from all things Soviet, is pursuing a gendered reorganization of family and work structures to achieve a transition from socialism to capitalism. This has created a labor force of migrant grandmothers who carry the new Ukraine on their shoulders. Solari shows that this post-Soviet economic transformation requires a change in the moral order as migrant women struggle to understand how to be ""good"" mothers and grandmothers and men join women in attempts to teach their children to be successful and honorable people, now that the social rules have drastically changed. Looking at individual migrant women and men and their families in Ukraine allows us to see the production of neoliberal capitalism and new nationalism from the ground up and the outside in for a region that promises to be a flashpoint in our century.",Social Science,297,N/A,0,en

Structural-Chemical Systematics of Minerals,"Alexander A. Godovikov, Svetlana N. Nenasheva",Springer,2019-08-22,"This book represents new structural-chemical minerals of A.A. Godovikov which reflects the latest data on communication of the chemical composition with structure and properties of minerals, conditions of their formation, their paragenesis. The following features lay its basis: a) the numerous, often not considered earlier chemical signs on which chemical properties of minerals, conditions of their formation or paragenesis may depend; b) the determined consistent patterns of communication between chemical compounds structure and fundamental properties of the elements forming them; c) regularities of structure change and properties of minerals depending on physical and chemical parameters of formation or environment systems. This systematiс considers real associations, differences in physical and chemical parameters at which minerals are forming and existing. In this systematic sometimes the preference is given to the last signs because all natural associations aren't casual in an arrangement of minerals, so they formed as a result of difficult and longtime selection. The properties of minerals are coordinated with their structure, formation conditions. The transition conditions from one taxon to another both at one level and at its deepenings are accurately formulated. The primary type of a chemical bond was accepted as leading sign of five highest taxons. The lowest taxons were allocated on: a) the mineral belongings to izodesmichesky or anizodesmichesky connections; b) the type of anion, cation; c) the coordination number of an anionoobrazovatel; d) the size of CX; e) the type of the structure. The signs which are in the basis for systematization give the chance to find the place for new mineral types in the tables, to change the place of mineral in connection with specification of its formula or structure. They also allow to distinguish new taxons for the new mineral types representing chemical compounds, earlier not known in nature. Thus this systematic is not a stiffened representation but the developing system.",Science,323,N/A,0,en

Social Networks and Travel Behaviour,"Matthias Kowald, Kay W. Axhausen",Routledge,2016-03-03,"In aiming to understand and model peoples’ out-of-home movements, the academic field of transport planning is confronted with two major challenges. Firstly, leisure travel is increasing in importance and is more complex and variable than work-related travel, being less rigid in temporal and spatial patterns and more influenced by external factors such as social contacts or weather conditions. Secondly, traditional aggregated transport models do not include any information on peoples’ social interactions or their personal social networks. In contrast, the recent development and availability of disaggregated models allows more detailed modelling of elements such as individual characteristics, motivations, constraints and travel costs, as well as a consideration of influences from an actor’s social environment. People travel not only within an infrastructure but also within a social structure. These two main factors have driven transport planners to focus on peoples’ interaction and their social network. In recent years there have been a remarkable number of data collection efforts in the field, surveying information on the link between travel behaviour and social motivation. Providing an overview of selected exemplary studies, this volume addresses the overlap between transport planning and methods of social network analysis; applied methods of social network analysis and related empirical results; and current challenges and new research questions in this field.",Political Science,229,N/A,0,en

The File,San Charles Haddad,Post Hill Press,2020-03-31,"Three people living in Tel Aviv, Haifa, and Jerusalem embark on distinct journeys that converge at “the file”; their efforts to admit Palestine to the Olympics in the early twentieth century. Their pivotal roles in history have been purposely omitted from official record, kept secret, or forgotten. Why? Because of the “Nazi Olympics” in 1936 in Berlin. And because of the death in 1972 of eleven Israeli Olympic athletes in the Munich Massacre. This book narrates the previously untold history of a Palestine Olympic Committee recognized before the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. It sheds light on some of the darkest events in sport history, exposing secretive relationships behind the doors of the Jerusalem YMCA, Nazi agitation, arrests, internments, and other intrigue in the complicated history of Israeli and Palestinian sport. The File breaks new ground at the intersection of sport and politics—illuminating the hope, tension, and horror of the 20s, 30s, and 40s, the creation of the State of Israel and the Palestinian refugees, and the resulting guerrilla attack at the Olympics in Munich in 1972—and reveals a handful of heroes whose impact on athletes and international sport competitions is still felt today. Consultant and researcher San Charles Haddad weaves a true and masterful tale of forgotten personalities in a conflict characterized by unabated venom, bringing hope and new questions in his wake.

On the whole, these articles should be understandable to mathe matics students in their first specialization years, to graduates from other mathematical areas and, depending on the specific subject, to specialists in other domains of science, engineers and teachers of mathematics. These articles treat their material at a fairly general level and aim to give an idea of the kind of problems, techniques and concepts involved in the area in question.

Topological Groups and Related Structures,"A. V. Arkhangelʹskiĭ, Mikhail Tkachenko",atlantis press,2008,"This book presents a large amount of material, both classic and recent (on occasion, unpublished) about the relations of Algebra and Topology. It therefore belongs to the area called Topological Algebra. More specifically, the objects of the study are subtle and sometimes unexpected phenomena that occur when the continuity meets and properly feeds an algebraic operation. Such a combination gives rise to many classic structures, including topological groups and semigroups, paratopological groups, etc. Special emphasis is given to tracing the influence of compactness and its generalizations on the properties of an algebraic operation, causing on occasion the automatic continuity of the operation. The main scope of the book, however, is outside of the locally compact structures, thus distinguishing the monograph from a series of more traditional textbooks.The book is unique in that it presents very important material, dispersed in hundreds of research articles, not covered by any monograph in existence. The reader is gently introduced to an amazing world at the interface of Algebra, Topology, and Set Theory. He/she will find that the way to the frontier of the knowledge is quite short -- almost every section of the book contains several intriguing open problems whose solutions can contribute significantly to the area.",Mathematics,797,5,2,en

Principles Of Statistical Inference From A Neo-fisherian Perspective,"Luigi Pace, Alessandra Salvan",World Scientific Publishing Company,1997-08-05,"In this book, an integrated introduction to statistical inference is provided from a frequentist likelihood-based viewpoint. Classical results are presented together with recent developments, largely built upon ideas due to R.A. Fisher. The term “neo-Fisherian” highlights this.After a unified review of background material (statistical models, likelihood, data and model reduction, first-order asymptotics) and inference in the presence of nuisance parameters (including pseudo-likelihoods), a self-contained introduction is given to exponential families, exponential dispersion models, generalized linear models, and group families. Finally, basic results of higher-order asymptotics are introduced (index notation, asymptotic expansions for statistics and distributions, and major applications to likelihood inference).The emphasis is more on general concepts and methods than on regularity conditions. Many examples are given for specific statistical models. Each chapter is supplemented with problems and bibliographic notes.

A History of the Calculus of Variations from the 17th through the 19th Century,H. H. Goldstine,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The calculus of variations is a subject whose beginning can be precisely dated. It might be said to begin at the moment that Euler coined the name calculus of variations but this is, of course, not the true moment of inception of the subject. It would not have been unreasonable if I had gone back to the set of isoperimetric problems considered by Greek mathemati cians such as Zenodorus (c. 200 B. C. ) and preserved by Pappus (c. 300 A. D. ). I have not done this since these problems were solved by geometric means. Instead I have arbitrarily chosen to begin with Fermat's elegant principle of least time. He used this principle in 1662 to show how a light ray was refracted at the interface between two optical media of different densities. This analysis of Fermat seems to me especially appropriate as a starting point: He used the methods of the calculus to minimize the time of passage cif a light ray through the two media, and his method was adapted by John Bernoulli to solve the brachystochrone problem. There have been several other histories of the subject, but they are now hopelessly archaic. One by Robert Woodhouse appeared in 1810 and another by Isaac Todhunter in 1861.",Mathematics,427,N/A,0,en

Multiple Regressions from Contingency Tables,Mingche M. Li,N/A,1975,"In Section II and Section III, we use a simple example of black homeownership to show that identical results are obtained whether we run a regression with over 23,000 individual household records or with a modest contingency table having eight cells, available from the published census report. Moreover, we show that the interaction effect between independent variables can be estimated from either form of data. We then discuss two strategies for dealing with the situation in which the sample joint distribution between some pair of variables in a set of contingency tables is missing, and provide a se:1.sitivity test of the estimated coefficients under different assumptions about the missing joint distribution. Section IV focuses on the estimate obtained under the assumption of independence between the two variables, which is equivalent to assuming that we have absolutely no information about the missing joint distribution; whereas, Section V suggests that, if we take advantage of any knowledge about the joint distribution of its parent population, however remotely related to the sample, the error in the prediction of the missing sample joint distribution is greatly reduced. As extensions to the use of contingency tables, we also present a conditional logit estimate (Section VI), which is a weighted least squares regression, as well as a maximum likelihood estimate (Section VII), which is a modified multiple regression in the analysis of dichotomous variables. These two approaches are especially suitable for the estimation of relationships involving qualitative variables. Both belong to the class of consistent asymptotically normal estimators. Using a numerical example, we compare the estimates obtained using the three alternative methods.",African Americans,44,N/A,0,en

The Spanish Archives of New Mexico,Ralph Emerson Twitchell,N/A,1914,"In what follows can be found the doors to a house of words and stories. This house of words and stories is the ""Archive of New Mexico"" and the doors are each of the documents contained within it. Like any house, New Mexico's archive has a tale of its own origin and a complex history. Although its walls have changed many times, its doors and the encounters with those doors hold stories known and told and others not yet revealed. In the Archives, there are thousands of doors (4,481) that open to a time of kings and popes, of inquisition and revolution. ""These archives,"" writes Ralph Emerson Twitchell, ""are by far the most valuable and interesting of any in the Southwest."" Many of these documents were given a number by Twitchell, small stickers that were appended to the first page of each document, an act of heresy to archivists and yet these stickers have now become part of the artifact. These are the doors that Ralph Emerson Twitchell opened at the dawn of the 20th century with a key that has served scholars, policy-makers, and activists for generations. In 1914 Twitchell published in two volumes ""The Spanish Archives of New Mexico,"" the first calendar and guide to the documents from the Spanish colonial period. Volume One of the two volumes focuses on the collection known as the ""Spanish Archives of New Mexico, Series I,"" or SANM I, an appellation granted because of Twitchell's original compilation and description of the 1,384 documents identified in the first volume of his series. The Spanish Archives of New Mexico was assembled by the Surveyor General of New Mexico (1854-1891) and the Court of Private Land Claims (1891-1904). The collection consists of civil land records of the Spanish period governments of New Mexico and materials created by the Surveyor General and Court of Private Land Claims during the process of adjudication. It includes the original Spanish colonial petitions for land grants, land conveyances, wills, mine registers, records books, journals, dockets, reports, minutes, letters, and a variety of other legal documents. Each of these documents tell a story, sometimes many stories. The bulk of the records accentuate the amazingly dynamic nature of land grant and settlement policies. While the documents reveal the broad sweep of community settlement and its reverse effect, hundreds of last wills and testaments are included in these records, that are scripted in the most eloquent and spiritual tone at the passing of individuals into death. These testaments also reveal a legacy of what colonists owned and bequeathed to the next generations. Most of the documents are about the geographic, political and cultural mapping of New Mexico, but many reflect the stories of that which is owned both in terms of commodities and human lives. Archives inevitably, and these archives more than most, help to shape current debates about dispossession, the colonial past, and the postcolonial future of New Mexico. For this reason, the task of understanding the role of archives, archival documents, and the kinds of stories that emanate from them has never been more urgent. Let this effort and the key provided by Twitchell in his two volumes open the doors wide for knowledge to be useful today and tomorrow.--From the Foreword by Estevan Rael-Galvez, New Mexico State Historian""",Archives,756,4,1,en

Amigas y Amantes,Katie L. Acosta,Rutgers University Press,2013-10-30,"Amigas y Amantes (Friends and Lovers) explores the experiences of sexually nonconforming Latinas in the creation and maintenance of families. It is based on forty-two in-depth ethnographic interviews with women who identify as lesbian, bisexual, or queer (LBQ). Additionally, it draws from fourteen months of participant observation at LBQ Latina events that Katie L. Acosta conducted in 2007 and 2008 in a major northeast city. With this data, Acosta examines how LBQ Latinas manage loving relationships with the families who raised them, and with their partners, their children, and their friends. Acosta investigates how sexually nonconforming Latinas negotiate cultural expectations, combat compulsory heterosexuality, and reconcile tensions with their families. She offers a new way of thinking about the emotion work involved in everyday lives, which highlights the informal, sometimes invisible, labor required in preserving family ties. Acosta contends that the work LBQ Latinas take on to preserve connections with biological families, lovers, and children results in a unique way of doing family. Paying particular attention to the negotiations that LBQ Latinas undertake in an effort to maintain familial order, Amigas y Amantes explores how they understand femininity, how they negotiate their religious faiths, how they face the unique challenges of being in interracial/interethnic relationships, and how they raise their children while integrating their families of origin.",Social Science,185,N/A,0,en

In it, the eminent sociologist Jessie Bernard argued that in every marriage there are actually two marriages-his and hers-and that sociological data reveals that marriage is more beneficial for men than for women. In a new edition of this pioneering work, Bernard provides a fresh introduction and update showing what has changed and what has remained the same since her book was first published",Family & Relationships,436,N/A,0,en

The Long Way Home,Kate Shayler,N/A,2001,"""Australia's own Frank McCourt!' Sally Loane, ABC Radio This is an important story that has long been neglected. We are familiar with stories of the stolen generation and the British child migrants, but there is a third group about whom very little has been written- their white Australian contemporaries who as a result of family breakdown, court orders or abandonment were institutionalised as children. Kate Shayler (pseudonym) grew up a 'homes kid' in the fifties and sixties. Her memoir is more than just an account of her experience as an institutionalised white kid- it's a heartbreaking story of what happens to a child in the absence of emotional support and affection. Far from being a litany of despair, Kate manages to weave into her journey of self-discovery a sense of community, camraderie, and humour of a childhood of sorts - a 'family' that she was forced to create for herself. The Long Way Home- The Story of a Homes Kidwill strike a chord with anyone who has ever suffered discrimination, insecurity or the pain of separation from family. It's a timely and profound reminder that every child deserves to be cherished and valued.""",Biography & Autobiography,364,N/A,0,en

It provides a tool to improve patient care by using the history and physical examination items that have the most reliability and efficiency.""--Annals of Internal Medicine ""The evidence-based examination techniques put forth by Rational Clinical Examination is the sort that can be brought to bear on a daily basis – to save time, increase confidence in medical decisions, and help decrease unnecessary testing for conditions that do not require absolute diagnostic certainty. In the end, the whole of this book is greater than its parts and can serve as a worthy companion to a traditional manual of physical examination.""--Baylor University Medical Center (BUMC)Proceedings 5 STAR DOODY'S REVIEW! ""Physical diagnosis has been taught to every medical student but this evidence-based approach now shows us why, presenting one of medicine's most basic tenets in a new and challenging light. The format is extraordinary, taking previously published material and updating the pertinent evidence since the initial publication, affirming or questioning or refining the conclusions drawn from the data. ""This is a book for everyone who has studied medicine and found themselves doubting what they have been taught over the years, not that they have been deluded, but that medical traditions have been unquestionably believed because there was no evidence to believe otherwise. The authors have uncovered the truth. ""This extraordinary, one-of-a-kind book is a valuable addition to every medical library.""--Doody's Review Service Completely updated with new literature analyses, here is a uniquely practical, clinically relevant approach to the use of evidence in the content of physical examination. Going far beyond the scope of traditional physical examination texts, this invaluable resource compiles and presents the evidence-based meanings of signs, symptoms, and results from physical examination maneuvers and other diagnostic studies. Page after page, you'll find a focus on actual clinical questions and presentations, making it an incomparably practical resource that you'll turn to again and again. Importantly, the high-yield content of The Rational Clinical Examination is significantly expanded and updated from the original JAMA articles, much of it published here for the first time. It all adds up to a definitive, ready-to-use clinical exam sourcebook that no student or clinician should be without. FEATURES Packed with updated, new, and previously unpublished information from the original JAMA articles Standardized template for every issue covered, including: Case Presentation; Why the Issue Is Clinically Important; Research and Statistical Methods Used to Find the Evidence Presented; The Sensitivity and Specificity of Each Key Result; Resolution of the Case Presentation; and the Clinical Bottom Line Completely updated with all-new literature searches and appraisals supplementing each chapter Full-color format with dynamic clinical illustrations and images Real-world focus on a specific clinical question in each chapter, reflecting the way clinicians approach the practice of evidence-based medicine More than 50 complete chapters on common and challenging clinical questions and patient presentations Also available: JAMAevidence.com, a new interactive database for the best practice of evidence based medicine",Medical,940,5,1,en

Saving Face,Angie Y. Chung,Rutgers University Press,2016-09-20,"Tiger Mom. Asian patriarchy. Model minority children. Generation gap. The many images used to describe the prototypical Asian family have given rise to two versions of the Asian immigrant family myth. The first celebrates Asian families for upholding the traditional heteronormative ideal of the “normal (white) American family” based on a hard-working male breadwinner and a devoted wife and mother who raises obedient children. The other demonizes Asian families around these very same cultural values by highlighting the dangers of excessive parenting, oppressive hierarchies, and emotionless pragmatism in Asian cultures. Saving Face cuts through these myths, offering a more nuanced portrait of Asian immigrant families in a changing world as recalled by the people who lived them first-hand: the grown children of Chinese and Korean immigrants. Drawing on extensive interviews, sociologist Angie Y. Chung examines how these second-generation children negotiate the complex and conflicted feelings they have toward their family responsibilities and upbringing. Although they know little about their parents’ lives, she reveals how Korean and Chinese Americans assemble fragments of their childhood memories, kinship narratives, and racial myths to make sense of their family experiences. However, Chung also finds that these adaptive strategies come at a considerable social and psychological cost and do less to reconcile the social stresses that minority immigrant families endure today. Saving Face not only gives readers a new appreciation for the often painful generation gap between immigrants and their children, it also reveals the love, empathy, and communication strategies families use to help bridge those rifts.",History,253,N/A,0,en

Although the defendants were sentenced to death in 1971, their sentences were commuted to life with parole in 1972; since 1978, they have been regularly attending parole hearings. Today all of the living defendants remain behind bars. Relying on nearly fifty years of parole hearing transcripts, as well as interviews and archival materials, Hadar Aviram invites readers into the opaque world of the California parole process—a realm of almost unfettered administrative discretion, prison programming inadequacies, high-pitched emotions, and political pressures. Yesterday’s Monsters offers a fresh longitudinal perspective on extreme punishment.",Social Science,293,N/A,0,en
Normal Families,Joel L. Schiff,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-04-17,"A book on the subject of normal families more than sixty years after the publication of Montel's treatise Ler;ons sur les familles normales de fonc tions analytiques et leurs applications is certainly long overdue. But, in a sense, it is almost premature, as so much contemporary work is still being produced. To misquote Dickens, this is the best of times, this is the worst of times. The intervening years have seen developments on a broad front, many of which are taken up in this volume. A unified treatment of the classical theory is also presented, with some attempt made to preserve its classical flavour. Since its inception early this century the notion of a normal family has played a central role in the development of complex function theory. In fact, it is a concept lying at the very heart of the subject, weaving a line of thought through Picard's theorems, Schottky's theorem, and the Riemann mapping theorem, to many modern results on meromorphic functions via the Bloch principle. It is this latter that has provided considerable impetus over the years to the study of normal families, and continues to serve as a guiding hand to future work. Basically, it asserts that a family of analytic (meromorphic) functions defined by a particular property, P, is likely to be a normal family if an entire (meromorphic in",Mathematics,241,N/A,0,en

The IBM System z®, the latest generation of the IBM distinguished family of mainframe systems, has come a long way from its IBM System/360 heritage. Likewise, its IBM z/OS® operating system is far superior to its predecessors in providing, among many other capabilities, world class and state-of-the-art support for the TCP/IP Internet protocol suite. TCP/IP is a large and evolving collection of communication protocols managed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), an open, volunteer organization. Because of its openness, the TCP/IP protocol suite has become the foundation for the set of technologies that form the basis of the Internet. The convergence of IBM mainframe capabilities with Internet technology, connectivity, and standards (particularly TCP/IP) is dramatically changing the face of information technology and driving requirements for even more secure, scalable, and highly available mainframe TCP/IP implementations. The z/OS Communications Server TCP/IP Implementation series provides understandable, step-by-step guidance about how to enable the most commonly used and important functions of z/OS Communications Server TCP/IP. In this IBM Redbooks® publication, we provide an introduction to z/OS Communications Server TCP/IP.

The IBM System z®, the latest generation of the IBM distinguished family of mainframe systems, has come a long way from its IBM System/360 heritage. Likewise, its IBM z/OS® operating system is far superior to its predecessors in providing, among many other capabilities, world-class and state-of-the-art support for the TCP/IP Internet protocol suite. TCP/IP is a large and evolving collection of communication protocols managed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), an open, volunteer organization. Because of its openness, the TCP/IP protocol suite has become the foundation for the set of technologies that form the basis of the Internet. The convergence of IBM mainframe capabilities with Internet technology, connectivity, and standards (particularly TCP/IP) is dramatically changing the face of information technology and driving requirements for even more secure, scalable, and highly available mainframe TCP/IP implementations. The z/OS Communications Server TCP/IP Implementation series provides understandable, step-by-step guidance about how to enable the most commonly used and important functions of z/OS Communications Server TCP/IP. This IBM Redbooks® publication is for people who install and support z/OS Communications Server. It introduces z/OS Communications Server TCP/IP, discusses the system resolver, showing implementation of global and local settings for single and multi-stack environments. It presents implementation scenarios for TCP/IP base functions, connectivity, routing, virtual MAC support, and sysplex subplexing.",Computers,506,N/A,0,en

Convexity and Optimization in Finite Dimensions I,"Josef Stoer, Christoph Witzgall",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Dantzig's development of linear programming into one of the most applicable optimization techniques has spread interest in the algebra of linear inequalities, the geometry of polyhedra, the topology of convex sets, and the analysis of convex functions. It is the goal of this volume to provide a synopsis of these topics, and thereby the theoretical back ground for the arithmetic of convex optimization to be treated in a sub sequent volume. The exposition of each chapter is essentially independent, and attempts to reflect a specific style of mathematical reasoning. The emphasis lies on linear and convex duality theory, as initiated by Gale, Kuhn and Tucker, Fenchel, and v. Neumann, because it represents the theoretical development whose impact on modern optimi zation techniques has been the most pronounced. Chapters 5 and 6 are devoted to two characteristic aspects of duality theory: conjugate functions or polarity on the one hand, and saddle points on the other. The Farkas lemma on linear inequalities and its generalizations, Motzkin's description of polyhedra, Minkowski's supporting plane theorem are indispensable elementary tools which are contained in chapters 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The treatment of extremal properties of polyhedra as well as of general convex sets is based on the far reaching work of Klee. Chapter 2 terminates with a description of Gale diagrams, a recently developed successful technique for exploring polyhedral structures.",Mathematics,306,N/A,0,en

Mathematical Theory of Scattering Resonances,"Semyon Dyatlov, Maciej Zworski",American Mathematical Soc.,2019-09-10,"Scattering resonances generalize bound states/eigenvalues for systems in which energy can scatter to infinity. A typical resonance has a rate of oscillation (just as a bound state does) and a rate of decay. Although the notion is intrinsically dynamical, an elegant mathematical formulation comes from considering meromorphic continuations of Green's functions. The poles of these meromorphic continuations capture physical information by identifying the rate of oscillation with the real part of a pole and the rate of decay with its imaginary part. An example from mathematics is given by the zeros of the Riemann zeta function: they are, essentially, the resonances of the Laplacian on the modular surface. The Riemann hypothesis then states that the decay rates for the modular surface are all either or . An example from physics is given by quasi-normal modes of black holes which appear in long-time asymptotics of gravitational waves. This book concentrates mostly on the simplest case of scattering by compactly supported potentials but provides pointers to modern literature where more general cases are studied. It also presents a recent approach to the study of resonances on asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds. The last two chapters are devoted to semiclassical methods in the study of resonances.",Mathematics,649,N/A,0,en

Statistical Learning in Genetics,Daniel Sorensen,Springer Nature,2023-09-19,"This book provides an introduction to computer-based methods for the analysis of genomic data. Breakthroughs in molecular and computational biology have contributed to the emergence of vast data sets, where millions of genetic markers for each individual are coupled with medical records, generating an unparalleled resource for linking human genetic variation to human biology and disease. Similar developments have taken place in animal and plant breeding, where genetic marker information is combined with production traits. An important task for the statistical geneticist is to adapt, construct and implement models that can extract information from these large-scale data. An initial step is to understand the methodology that underlies the probability models and to learn the modern computer-intensive methods required for fitting these models. The objective of this book, suitable for readers who wish to develop analytic skills to perform genomic research, is to provide guidance to take this first step. This book is addressed to numerate biologists who typically lack the formal mathematical background of the professional statistician. For this reason, considerably more detail in explanations and derivations is offered. It is written in a concise style and examples are used profusely. A large proportion of the examples involve programming with the open-source package R. The R code needed to solve the exercises is provided. The MarkDown interface allows the students to implement the code on their own computer, contributing to a better understanding of the underlying theory. Part I presents methods of inference based on likelihood and Bayesian methods, including computational techniques for fitting likelihood and Bayesian models. Part II discusses prediction for continuous and binary data using both frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Some of the models used for prediction are also used for gene discovery. The challenge is to find promising genes without incurring a large proportion of false positive results. Therefore, Part II includes a detour on False Discovery Rate assuming frequentist and Bayesian perspectives. The last chapter of Part II provides an overview of a selected number of non-parametric methods. Part III consists of exercises and their solutions. Daniel Sorensen holds PhD and DSc degrees from the University of Edinburgh and is an elected Fellow of the American Statistical Association. He was professor of Statistical Genetics at Aarhus University where, at present, he is professor emeritus.",Mathematics,696,N/A,0,en
Foundations of the Theory of Parthood,Andrzej Pietruszczak,Springer Nature,2020-02-21,"This is the first book to systematically study the weak systems of mereology. In its chapters, the author critically analyzes and explains core topics related to mereology, such as parthood without antisymmetry, non-existence of the zero element, and Leśniewski's notion of class and set. The book also delves into three theories of parthood: two concern the sum existence axioms, and the third contends with transitivity of parthood. This is the first systematic analysis of systems of mereology of its kind and is suitable for students, scholars, logicians, and mathematicians who wish to further their knowledge of mereology.

Singular Algebraic Curves,"Gert-Martin Greuel, Christoph Lossen, Eugenii Shustin",Springer,2018-12-30,"Singular algebraic curves have been in the focus of study in algebraic geometry from the very beginning, and till now remain a subject of an active research related to many modern developments in algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, and tropical geometry. The monograph suggests a unified approach to the geometry of singular algebraic curves on algebraic surfaces and their families, which applies to arbitrary singularities, allows one to treat all main questions concerning the geometry of equisingular families of curves, and, finally, leads to results which can be viewed as the best possible in a reasonable sense. Various methods of the cohomology vanishing theory as well as the patchworking construction with its modifications will be of a special interest for experts in algebraic geometry and singularity theory. The introductory chapters on zero-dimensional schemes and global deformation theory can well serve as a material for special courses and seminars for graduate and post-graduate students.Geometry in general plays a leading role in modern mathematics, and algebraic geometry is the most advanced area of research in geometry. In turn, algebraic curves for more than one century have been the central subject of algebraic geometry both in fundamental theoretic questions and in applications to other fields of mathematics and mathematical physics. Particularly, the local and global study of singular algebraic curves involves a variety of methods and deep ideas from geometry, analysis, algebra, combinatorics and suggests a number of hard classical and newly appeared problems which inspire further development in this research area.",Mathematics,569,N/A,0,en

An Introduction to Complex Function Theory,Bruce P.

While presupposing in its readership a degree of mathematical maturity, it insists on no formal prerequisites beyond a sound knowledge of calculus. Starting from basic definitions, the text slowly and carefully develops the ideas of complex analysis to the point where such landmarks of the subject as Cauchy's theorem, the Riemann mapping theorem, and the theorem of Mittag-Leffler can be treated without sidestepping any issues of rigor. The emphasis throughout is a geometric one, most pronounced in the extensive chapter dealing with conformal mapping, which amounts essentially to a ""short course"" in that important area of complex function theory. Each chapter concludes with a wide selection of exercises, ranging from straightforward computations to problems of a more conceptual and thought-provoking nature.",Mathematics,585,3,1,en

The A to Z of the Renaissance,Charles Garfield Nauert,A to Z Guide Series,2006,"Few periods have given civilization such a strong impulse as the Renaissance, which started in Italy and then spread to the rest of Europe. During its brief epoch, most vigorously from the fourteen to the sixteenth centuries, Europe reached back to Ancient Greece and Rome, and pushed ahead in numerous fields: art, architecture, literature, philosophy, banking, commerce, religion, politics, and warfare. This era is inundated with famous names (Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Petrarch, Machiavelli, Cervantes, and Shakespeare), and the heritage it left can hardly be overestimated. The A to Z of the Renaissance provides information on these fields through its chronology, which traces events from 1250 to 1648, and its introduction delineating the underlying features of the period. However, it is the dictionary section, with hundreds of cross-referenced entries on famous persons (from Adrian to Zwingli), key locations, supporting political and social institutions, wars, religious reformations, achievements, and failures, which is the heart of this book.

Differential Equations on Singular Manifolds,"Bert-Wolfgang Schulze, Boris Sternin, Viktor Evgenʹevich Shatalov",Wiley-VCH,1998,"In the book, new methods in the theory of differential equations on manifolds with singularities are presented. The semiclassical theory in quantum mechanics is employed, adapted to operators that are degenerate in a typical way. The degeneracies may be induced by singular geometries, e.g., conical or cuspidal ones. A large variety of non-standard degenerate operators are also discussed. The semiclassical approach yields new results and unexpected effects, also in classical situations. For instance, full asymptotic expansions for cuspidal singularities are constructed, and nonstationary problems on singular manifolds are treated. Moreover, finiteness theorems are obtained by using operator algebra methods in a unified framework. Finally the method of characteristics for general elliptic equations on manifolds with singularities is developed in the book.",Mathematics,384,N/A,0,en

The Archive of the Theban Choachytes (second Century B.C.),P. W. Pestman,N/A,1993,"The archive of the Theban choachytes contains over 80 texts, Greek and demotic. They are largely private documents that together constitute the papers of a family of choachytes (undertakers). It is known since the beginnings of modern Egyptology and Papyrology as the ""Hermias Archive"" after the antagonist of the choachytes in a now famous Greek law suit kept in Turin. Although its bilingual information contributed in no uncertain measure to the decipherment of demotic, a large part of this fundamentally demotic archive is still not or not properly published. This Survey reviews for each text, Greek or Demotic, all relevant data in great detail and determines its exact place within the whole of the archive. The second half of the book presents the study of a number of special subjects that emerge from the contentts of the archive, such as the topography of Thebes (city and necropolis), prosopography, mummies and liturgies, but also more general subjects as onomastics, prices and transfer tax (enkyklion), and the diplomatics of the documents.",History,598,N/A,0,en

This session of the Summer School in Theoretical Physics concentrated on the recent advances in areas of physics ranging from (super)strings to field theory and statistical mechanics. The articles contained in this volume provide a stimulating and up-to-date account of a rapidly growing subject.Discussion focussed on the many points of convergence between field theory and statistical mechanics: conformal field theory, field theory on a lattice, the study of strongly correlated electron systems, as in the Hubbard model, leading to topological Lagrangians, which are perhaps the key of the understanding of high Tc superconductivity or the fractional quantum Hall effect. The critical phenomena in (1+1) dimensions, in the domain in which quantum fluctuations are strong, are described for antiferromagnetic couplings by relativistic theories in which the methods of abelian or non-abelian bosonization are particularly powerful.",Mathematics,678,N/A,0,en

The treatment goes beyond the standard material of power series, Cauchy's theorem, residues, conformal mapping, and harmonic functions by including accessible discussions of intriguing topics that are uncommon in a book at this level. The flexibility afforded by the supplementary topics and applications makes the book adaptable either to a short, one-term course or to a comprehensive, full-year course.

There Is Life After College,Jeffrey J. Selingo,HarperCollins,2016-04-12,"From the bestselling author of College Unbound comes a hopeful, inspiring blueprint to help alleviate parents’ anxiety and prepare their college-educated child to successfully land a good job after graduation. Saddled with thousands of dollars of debt, today’s college students are graduating into an uncertain job market that is leaving them financially dependent on their parents for years to come—a reality that has left moms and dads wondering: What did I pay all that money for? There Is Life After College offers students, parents, and even recent graduates the practical advice and insight they need to jumpstart their careers.

Oxford Dictionary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,Richard Cammack,Oxford University Press,2006-06-29,"The Oxford Dictionary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology provides a comprehensive survey of current biochemistry and molecular biology. Over the last few years, the language of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology has expanded enormously to the extent that few scientists can expect to be familiar with all aspects of it. This is partly due to the Genome projects and the successive -omics projects which have provided comprehensive information about genes, the functions of gene products, and cellular processes. At the same time, terms from other subject areas appear increasingly in the biochemical literature. The popular Dictionary has been comprehensively reviewed and updated to include many important new concepts and words. The entries are short but informative, providing up-to-date information on a broad range of topics, including definitions for selected terms from Bioinformatics, Biophysics, Cell Biology, Chemistry, Genetics, Immunology, Mathematics, Microbiology, Pharmacology, Systems Biology, and Toxicology. There are over 21,000 main entries, which give details of biochemical substances and the processes in which they are involved, define methods and concepts in molecular biology, and give definitions of biochemical symbols and abbreviations. It points out pitfalls where terms are often confused. It explains the precise syntax of biochemical terms, such as Greek letters and other formatting, which are lost when searching the Internet. In addition the dictionary is illustrated with over 900 chemical structures. The Oxford Dictionary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology will serve as an invaluable reference for biochemists and molecular biologists seeking information outside their own fields, and for those wishing to revisit fundamental principles.",Medical,744,N/A,0,en

House of Leaves,Mark Z. Danielewski,Pantheon,2000,"THE MIND-BENDING CULT CLASSIC ABOUT A HOUSE THAT’S LARGER ON THE INSIDE THAN ON THE OUTSIDE • A masterpiece of horror and an astonishingly immersive, maze-like reading experience that redefines the boundaries of a novel. ''Simultaneously reads like a thriller and like a strange, dreamlike excursion into the subconscious."" —Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times ""Thrillingly alive, sublimely creepy, distressingly scary, breathtakingly intelligent—it renders most other fiction meaningless."" —Bret Easton Ellis, bestselling author of American Psycho “This demonically brilliant book is impossible to ignore.” —Jonathan Lethem, award-winning author of Motherless Brooklyn One of The Atlantic’s Great American Novels of the Past 100 Years Years ago, when House of Leaves was first being passed around, it was nothing more than a badly bundled heap of paper, parts of which would occasionally surface on the Internet. No one could have anticipated the small but devoted following this terrifying story would soon command. Starting with an odd assortment of marginalized youth—musicians, tattoo artists, programmers, strippers, environmentalists, and adrenaline junkies—the book eventually made its way into the hands of older generations, who not only found themselves in those strangely arranged pages but also discovered a way back into the lives of their estranged children. Now made available in book form, complete with the original colored words, vertical footnotes, and second and third appendices, the story remains unchanged. Similarly, the cultural fascination with House of Leaves remains as fervent and as imaginative as ever. The novel has gone on to inspire doctorate-level courses and masters theses, cultural phenomena like the online urban legend of “the backrooms,” and incredible works of art in entirely unrealted mediums from music to video games. Neither Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Will Navidson nor his companion Karen Green was prepared to face the consequences of the impossibility of their new home, until the day their two little children wandered off and their voices eerily began to return another story—of creature darkness, of an ever-growing abyss behind a closet door, and of that unholy growl which soon enough would tear through their walls and consume all their dreams.",Fiction,742,4.5,35,en

The Anti-social Family,"Michèle Barrett, Mary McIntosh",London : NLB,1982,"""Haven in a heartless world or site of oppression and inequality? Such claims answer each other endlessly as the state and prospects of the family are debated. The end of the family is in sight, it is often said, and from the European Parliament to the heartlands of the Moral Majority the guardians of 'traditional values' prepare their last stand. On the left too, it is frequently argued--sometimes with regret more often with easy confidence--that the family is in decline. Yet the family continues to thrive, both as an institution and as an ideology. Our society is saturated with familialism. Welfare services take it as a natural point of reference. Trade unions still bargain on the basis of the 'family wage'. The return to 'family values' is offered as a cure for everything from unemployment to street crime. In this compact book, Michèle Barrett and Mary McIntosh dissect the network of household, kinship and sexual relations that is the dominant family form in advanced capitalist societies. They explore the personal and social needs that it ideally meets but more often denies. They consider the role of the nuclear family form in capitalism and its functions in the formation of gendered subjectivity, taking issue with theses of such writers as Jacques Donzelot and Christopher Lasch. A final chapter proposes some elements of a moral and political practice directed beyond the family towards more egalitarian and caring alternatives. Barrett and McIntosh have written a sensitive but uncompromising socialist-feminist critique of 'the anti-social family.'""--Publisher's description.",Family & Relationships,178,N/A,0,en

"Gender, Emotion, and the Family",Leslie Brody,Harvard University Press,2009-07-01,"Do women express their feelings more than men? Popular stereotypes say they do, but in this provocative book, Leslie Brody breaks with conventional wisdom. Integrating a wealth of perspectives and research--biological, sociocultural, developmental--her work explores the nature and extent of gender differences in emotional expression, as well as the endlessly complex question of how such differences come about. Nurture, far more than nature, emerges here as the stronger force in fashioning gender differences in emotional expression. Brody shows that whether and how men and women express their feelings varies widely from situation to situation and from culture to culture, and depends on a number of particular characteristics including age, ethnicity, cultural background, power, and status. Especially pertinent is the organization of the family, in which boys and girls elicit and absorb different emotional strategies. Brody also examines the importance of gender roles, whether in the family, the peer group, or the culture at large, as men and women use various patterns of emotional expression to adapt to power and status imbalances. Lucid and level-headed, Gender, Emotion, and the Family offers an unusually rich and nuanced picture of the great range of male and female emotional styles, and the variety of the human character.",Social Science,369,N/A,0,en

Evangelizing Mormons can be so much more effective if Christians first know, understand, and respect Mormon heritage. With helpful illustrations and discussions of Mormon values and theology, Rowe calls Christians away from confrontational evangelism and instead suggests active listening and respect as a way to bridge Christian beliefs and Mormon culture. A glossary in the back of the book and discussion questions at the end of each chapter will help readers apply these concepts in their own witnessing experiences.

The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,Shoshana Zuboff,Profile Books,2019-01-31,"THE TOP 10 SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK OF THE YEAR ONE OF BARACK OBAMA'S TOP BOOKS OF THE YEAR Shortlisted for The Orwell Prize 2020 Shortlisted for the FT Business Book of the Year Award 2019 'Easily the most important book to be published this century. I find it hard to take any young activist seriously who hasn't at least familarised themselves with Zuboff's central ideas.' - Zadie Smith, The Guardian The challenges to humanity posed by the digital future, the first detailed examination of the unprecedented form of power called ""surveillance capitalism,"" and the quest by powerful corporations to predict and control us. The heady optimism of the Internet's early days is gone. Technologies that were meant to liberate us have deepened inequality and stoked divisions. Tech companies gather our information online and sell it to the highest bidder, whether government or retailer. Profits now depend not only on predicting our behaviour but modifying it too. How will this fusion of capitalism and the digital shape our values and define our future? Shoshana Zuboff shows that we are at a crossroads. We still have the power to decide what kind of world we want to live in, and what we decide now will shape the rest of the century. Our choices: allow technology to enrich the few and impoverish the many, or harness it and distribute its benefits. The Age of Surveillance Capitalism is a deeply-reasoned examination of the threat of unprecedented power free from democratic oversight. As it explores this new capitalism's impact on society, politics, business, and technology, it exposes the struggles that will decide both the next chapter of capitalism and the meaning of information civilization. Most critically, it shows how we can protect ourselves and our communities and ensure we are the masters of the digital rather than its slaves.",Computers,556,N/A,0,en

The Seventh Child,Erik Valeur,Amazon Publishing,2014,"Winner of the 2012 Glass Key Award given by the members of the Crime Writers of Scandinavia All the best homes are by the water, or so the matron of Kongslund Orphanage tells her small charges. But at this particular house by the sea, not all is as it appears. On September 11, 2001, on a desolate beach on the outskirts of Copenhagen, police begin investigating the strange death of an unidentified woman. Surrounding the body are what appear to be offerings to the deceased: a book, a small noose, a dead golden canary, a linden tree branch, and a photo of the Kongslund Orphanage. As the police puzzle over their bizarre findings, the Twin Towers fall in walls of flame and the case is quickly overshadowed by the terror half a world away. Years later, as the sixtieth anniversary of the matron's reign at Kongslund approaches, identical anonymous letters are sent to six of the home's former residents, hinting at a cover-up that has allowed Denmark's most influential to hide away their dirty secrets and keep their grip on power. As one tenacious reporter hunts for clues, he begins to unravel the true parentage of some of Kongslund's ""orphans."" Can he figure out who is sending the mysterious letters and who murdered the woman on the beach years earlier before it is too late?",Murder,0,N/A,0,en

The Big Story,Justin Buzzard,Moody Publishers,2013-05-15,"How would you explain your life to a stranger? When strangers meet today, they often ask not, ""What do you do?"" but, ""What is your story?"" Everybody on the planet believes some larger story in order to make sense of the smaller story of his or her life. We want our lives to fit within a larger plot—a plot full of history, forward movement, and future. So, the better question to ask is, ""What sort of story are you in?"" Most people believe false stories that leave them disillusioned, enslaved, and hopeless. Secular stories of chasing success and religious stories of doing good works leave us feeling exhausted and empty. Only Christianity offers a story that's big enough to make sense of both the beauty and brokenness in our lives and in our world.",Religion,180,N/A,0,en
iGen,Jean M. Twenge,Simon and Schuster,2017-08-22,"As seen in Time, USA TODAY, The Atlantic, The Wall Street Journal, and on CBS This Morning, BBC, PBS, CNN, and NPR, iGen is crucial reading to understand how the children, teens, and young adults born in the mid-1990s and later are vastly different from their Millennial predecessors, and from any other generation. With generational divides wider than ever, parents, educators, and employers have an urgent need to understand today’s rising generation of teens and young adults. Born in the mid-1990s up to the mid-2000s, iGen is the first generation to spend their entire adolescence in the age of the smartphone. With social media and texting replacing other activities, iGen spends less time with their friends in person—perhaps contributing to their unprecedented levels of anxiety, depression, and loneliness. But technology is not the only thing that makes iGen distinct from every generation before them; they are also different in how they spend their time, how they behave, and in their attitudes toward religion, sexuality, and politics. They socialize in completely new ways, reject once sacred social taboos, and want different things from their lives and careers. More than previous generations, they are obsessed with safety, focused on tolerance, and have no patience for inequality. With the first members of iGen just graduating from college, we all need to understand them: friends and family need to look out for them; businesses must figure out how to recruit them and sell to them; colleges and universities must know how to educate and guide them. And members of iGen also need to understand themselves as they communicate with their elders and explain their views to their older peers. Because where iGen goes, so goes our nation—and the world.",Social Science,452,4,3,en

This book reviews recent research in order to show how children who experience high levels of inter-parental conflict are put at both an immediate psychological and physical risk and a longer-developing risk of recapitulating such behaviors. The authors examine topics such as the differences between destructive and constructive inter-parental conflict on child development, why some children are more adversely affected than others, and how conflict affects child physiology. Ultimately they provide suggestions for improving the futures of children who are experiencing challenging family environments today.",Social Science,200,5,1,en
Couples' Transitions to Parenthood,"Daniela Grunow, Marie Evertsson",N/A,2016,"It is common for European couples living fairly egalitarian lives to adopt a traditional division of labour at the transition to parenthood. Based on in-depth interviews with 332 parents-to-be in eight European countries, this book explores the implications of family policies and gender culture from the perspective of couples who are expecting their first child. Couples' Transitions to Parenthood: Analysing Gender and Work in Europe is the first comparative, qualitative study that explicitly locates couples' parenting ideals and plans in the wider context of national institutions. This unique analysis of transitions to parenthood in contemporary Europe focuses on Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, the Czech Republic and Poland. It explores how parents' agency varies along with policy-culture gaps in their countries and provides evidence of their struggle to adapt to, or resist, socially desired paths and patterns of change. In fact, the ways in which institutional structures limit possible choices and beliefs about motherhood and fatherhood are linked in ways that often go unnoticed by social scientists, policy makers and parents themselves. This cutting-edge book will be of interest to social scientists, political scientists, journalists and policy-makers. Parents-to-be will also find value in this analysis of gender in parenthood.
