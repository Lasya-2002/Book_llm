Tactile Learning Activities in Mathematics,"Julie Barnes, Jessica M. Libertini",American Mathematical Soc.,2018-08-06,"Q: What do feather boas, cookies, and paper shredders have in common? A: They are all ingredients that have the potential to help your undergraduate students understand a variety of mathematical concepts. In this book, 43 faculty from a wide range of institutional settings share a total of 64 hands-on activities that allow students to physically engage with mathematical ideas ranging from the basics of precalculus to special topics appropriate for upper-level courses. Each learning activity is presented in an easy-to-read recipe format that includes a list of supplies; a narrative briefly describing the reasons, logistics, and helpful hints for running the activity; and a page that can be used as a handout in class. Purchase of the book also includes access to electronic printable versions of the handouts. With so many activities, it might be hard to decide where to start. For that reason, there are four indices to help the reader navigate this book: a concept index, a course index, an [Author]; index, and a main ingredient index. In addition to providing activities for precalculus, calculus, commonly required mathematics courses for majors, and more specialized upper-level electives, there is also a section describing how to modify many of the activities to fit into a liberal arts mathematics class. Whether you are new to using hands-on activities in class or are more experienced, the [Author];s hope that this book will encourage and inspire you to explore the possibilities of using more hands-on activities in your classes.

Mathematics: A Concise History and Philosophy,W.S. Anglin,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This is a concise introductory textbook for a one-semester (40-class) course in the history and philosophy of mathematics. It is written for mathemat ics majors, philosophy students, history of science students, and (future) secondary school mathematics teachers. The only prerequisite is a solid command of precalculus mathematics. On the one hand, this book is designed to help mathematics majors ac quire a philosophical and cultural understanding of their subject by means of doing actual mathematical problems from different eras. On the other hand, it is designed to help philosophy, history, and education students come to a deeper understanding of the mathematical side of culture by means of writing short essays. The way I myself teach the material, stu dents are given a choice between mathematical assignments, and more his torical or philosophical assignments. (Some sample assignments and tests are found in an appendix to this book. ) This book differs from standard textbooks in several ways. First, it is shorter, and thus more accessible to students who have trouble coping with vast amounts of reading. Second, there are many detailed explanations of the important mathematical procedures actually used by famous mathe maticians, giving more mathematically talented students a greater oppor tunity to learn the history and philosophy by way of problem solving.",Science,253,N/A,0,en

Concrete Mathematics,"Ronald L. Graham, Donald E. Knuth, Oren Patashnik",Addison-Wesley Professional,1994-02-28,"This book introduces the mathematics that supports advanced computer programming and the analysis of algorithms. The primary aim of its well-known authors is to provide a solid and relevant base of mathematical skills - the skills needed to solve complex problems, to evaluate horrendous sums, and to discover subtle patterns in data. It is an indispensable text and reference not only for computer scientists - the authors themselves rely heavily on it! - but for serious users of mathematics in virtually every discipline. Concrete Mathematics is a blending of CONtinuous and disCRETE mathematics. ""More concretely,"" the authors explain, ""it is the controlled manipulation of mathematical formulas, using a collection of techniques for solving problems."" The subject matter is primarily an expansion of the Mathematical Preliminaries section in Knuth's classic Art of Computer Programming, but the style of presentation is more leisurely, and individual topics are covered more deeply. Several new topics have been added, and the most significant ideas have been traced to their historical roots. The book includes more than 500 exercises, divided into six categories. Complete answers are provided for all exercises, except research problems, making the book particularly valuable for self-study. Major topics include: Sums Recurrences Integer functions Elementary number theory Binomial coefficients Generating functions Discrete probability Asymptotic methods This second edition includes important new material about mechanical summation. In response to the widespread use of the first edition as a reference book, the bibliography and index have also been expanded, and additional nontrivial improvements can be found on almost every page. Readers will appreciate the informal style of Concrete Mathematics. Particularly enjoyable are the marginal graffiti contributed by students who have taken courses based on this material.

Street-Fighting Mathematics,Sanjoy Mahajan,MIT Press,2010-03-05,"An antidote to mathematical rigor mortis, teaching how to guess answers without needing a proof or an exact calculation. In problem solving, as in street fighting, rules are for fools: do whatever works—don't just stand there! Yet we often fear an unjustified leap even though it may land us on a correct result. Traditional mathematics teaching is largely about solving exactly stated problems exactly, yet life often hands us partly defined problems needing only moderately accurate solutions. This engaging book is an antidote to the rigor mortis brought on by too much mathematical rigor, teaching us how to guess answers without needing a proof or an exact calculation. In Street-Fighting Mathematics, Sanjoy Mahajan builds, sharpens, and demonstrates tools for educated guessing and down-and-dirty, opportunistic problem solving across diverse fields of knowledge—from mathematics to management. Mahajan describes six tools: dimensional analysis, easy cases, lumping, picture proofs, successive approximation, and reasoning by analogy. Illustrating each tool with numerous examples, he carefully separates the tool—the general principle—from the particular application so that the reader can most easily grasp the tool itself to use on problems of particular interest. Street-Fighting Mathematics grew out of a short course taught by the author at MIT for students ranging from first-year undergraduates to graduate students ready for careers in physics, mathematics, management, electrical engineering, computer science, and biology. They benefited from an approach that avoided rigor and taught them how to use mathematics to solve real problems.

Advanced Problems in Mathematics bridges the gap between school and university mathematics, and prepares students for an undergraduate mathematics course. The questions analysed in this book are all based on past STEP questions and each question is followed by a comment and a full solution. The comments direct the reader's attention to key points and put the question in its true mathematical context. The solutions point students to the methodology required to address advanced mathematical problems critically and independently. This book is a must read for any student wishing to apply to scientific subjects at university level and for anyone interested in advanced mathematics.",Mathematics,188,N/A,0,en

Revolutionary Mathematics,Justin Joque,Verso Books,2022-01-18,"Traces the revolution in statistics that gave rise to artificial intelligence and predictive algorithms refiguring contemporary capitalism. Our finances, politics, media, opportunities, information, shopping and knowledge production are mediated through algorithms and their statistical approaches to knowledge; increasingly, these methods form the organizational backbone of contemporary capitalism. Revolutionary Mathematics traces the revolution in statistics and probability that has quietly underwritten the explosion of machine learning, big data and predictive algorithms that now decide many aspects of our lives. Exploring shifts in the philosophical understanding of probability in the late twentieth century, Joque shows how this was not merely a technical change but a wholesale philosophical transformation in the production of knowledge and the extraction of value. This book provides a new and unique perspective on the dangers of allowing artificial intelligence and big data to manage society. It is essential reading for those who want to understand the underlying ideological and philosophical changes that have fueled the rise of algorithms and convinced so many to blindly trust their outputs, reshaping our current political and economic situation.",Political Science,241,N/A,0,en

How to Think About Analysis,Lara Alcock,OUP Oxford,2014-09-25,"Analysis (sometimes called Real Analysis or Advanced Calculus) is a core subject in most undergraduate mathematics degrees. It is elegant, clever and rewarding to learn, but it is hard. Even the best students find it challenging, and those who are unprepared often find it incomprehensible at first. This book aims to ensure that no student need be unprepared. It is not like other Analysis books. It is not a textbook containing standard content. Rather, it is designed to be read before arriving at university and/or before starting an Analysis course, or as a companion text once a course is begun. It provides a friendly and readable introduction to the subject by building on the student's existing understanding of six key topics: sequences, series, continuity, differentiability, integrability and the real numbers. It explains how mathematicians develop and use sophisticated formal versions of these ideas, and provides a detailed introduction to the central definitions, theorems and proofs, pointing out typical areas of difficulty and confusion and explaining how to overcome these. The book also provides study advice focused on the skills that students need if they are to build on this introduction and learn successfully in their own Analysis courses: it explains how to understand definitions, theorems and proofs by relating them to examples and diagrams, how to think productively about proofs, and how theories are taught in lectures and books on advanced mathematics. It also offers practical guidance on strategies for effective study planning. The advice throughout is research based and is presented in an engaging style that will be accessible to students who are new to advanced abstract mathematics.",Mathematics,265,N/A,0,en

A Guide Book to Mathematics,BRONSHTEIN,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"TO THE FIRST RUSSIAN EDITION It was a very difficult task to write a guide-book of a small size designed to contain the fundamental knowledge of mathema tics which is most necessary to engineers and students of higher technical schools. In our tendency to the compactness and brevity of the exposition, we attempted, however, to produce a guide-book which would be easy to understand, convenient to use and as accurate as possible (as much as it is required in engineering). It should be pointed out that this book is neither a handbook nor a compendium, but a guide-book. Therefore it is not written as systematically as a handbook should be written. Hence the reader should not be surprised to find, for example, I'HOpital's rule in the section devoted to computation of limits which is a part of the chapter ""Introduction to the analysis"" placed before the concept of the derivative, or information about the Gamma function in the chapter ""Algebra""-just after the concept of the factorial. There are many such ""imperfections"" in the book. Thus a reader who wants to acquire certain information is advised to use not only the table of contents but also the alpha betical index inserted at the end of the book.

Mathematics as the Science of Patterns,Patrick M. Jenlink,N/A,2022,"Mathematics as the Science of Patterns: Making the Invisible Visible to Students through Teaching introduces the reader to a collection of thoughtful, research-based works by authors that represent current thinking about mathematics, mathematics education, and the preparation of mathematics teachers. Each chapter focuses on mathematics teaching and the preparation of teachers who will enter classrooms to instruct the next generation of students in mathematics. The value of patterns to the teaching and learning of mathematics is well understood, both in terms of research and application. When we involve or appeal to pattern in teaching mathematics, it is usually because we are trying to help students to extract greater meaning, or enjoyment, or both, from the experience of learning environments within which they are occupied, and perhaps also to facilitate remembering. As a general skill it is thought that the ability to discern a pattern is a precursor to the ability to generalize and abstract, a skill essential in the early years of learning and beyond. Research indicates that the larger problem in teaching mathematics does not lie primarily with students; rather it is with the teachers themselves. In order to make changes for students there first needs to be a process of change for teachers. Understanding the place of patterns in learning mathematics is a predicate to understanding how to teach mathematics and how to use pedagogical reasoning necessary in teaching mathematics. Importantly, the lack of distinction created by the pedagogical use of patterns is not immediately problematic to the student or the teacher. The deep-seated cognitive patterns that both teachers and students bring to the classroom require change. Chapter 1 opens the book with a focus on mathematics as the science of patterns and the importance of patterns in mathematical problem solving, providing the reader with an introduction. The authors of Chapter 2 revisit the work of Pólya and the development and implementation of problem solving in mathematics. In Chapter 3, the authors present an argument for core pedagogical content knowledge in mathematics teacher preparation. The authors of Chapter 4 focus on preservice teachers' patterns of conception as related to understanding number and operation. In Chapter 5 the authors examine the role of visual representation in exploring proportional reasoning, denoting the importance of helping learners make their thinking visible. The authors of Chapter 6 examine patterns and relationships, and the importance of each in assisting students' learning and development in mathematical understanding. The authors of Chapter 7 examine the use of worked examples as a scalable practice, with emphasis on the importance of worked examples in teaching fraction magnitude and computation is discussed. In Chapter 8, the authors expand on the zone of proximal development to investigate the potential of Zankov's Lesson in terms of students analyzing numerical equalities. The authors of Chapter 9 focus on high leverage mathematical practices in elementary pre-service teacher preparation, drawing into specific relief the APEX cycle to develop deep thinking. In Chapter 10, the author focuses on number talks and the engagement of students in mathematical reasoning, which provides opportunities for students to be sensemakers of mathematics. Chapter 11 presents an epilogue, focusing on the importance of recognizing the special nature of mathematics knowledge for teaching.",Mathematics,266,N/A,0,en

The foundational material, presented in the unstarred sections of Chapters 1 through 11, was normally covered, but different applications of this basic material were stressed from year to year, and the book therefore contains more material than was covered in any one year. It can accordingly be used (with omissions) as a text for a year's course in advanced calculus, or as a text for a three-semester introduction to analysis.The prerequisites are a good grounding in the calculus of one variable from a mathematically rigorous point of view, together with some acquaintance with linear algebra. The reader should be familiar with limit and continuity type arguments and have a certain amount of mathematical sophistication. As possible introductory texts, we mention Differential and Integral Calculus by R Courant, Calculus by T Apostol, Calculus by M Spivak, and Pure Mathematics by G Hardy. The reader should also have some experience with partial derivatives.In overall plan the book divides roughly into a first half which develops the calculus (principally the differential calculus) in the setting of normed vector spaces, and a second half which deals with the calculus of differentiable manifolds.",Mathematics,595,5,4,en

Making up Numbers: A History of Invention in Mathematics,Ekkehard Kopp,Open Book Publishers,2020-10-23,"Making up Numbers: A History of Invention in Mathematics offers a detailed but accessible account of a wide range of mathematical ideas. Starting with elementary concepts, it leads the reader towards aspects of current mathematical research. The book explains how conceptual hurdles in the development of numbers and number systems were overcome in the course of history, from Babylon to Classical Greece, from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, and so to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The narrative moves from the Pythagorean insistence on positive multiples to the gradual acceptance of negative numbers, irrationals and complex numbers as essential tools in quantitative analysis. Within this chronological framework, chapters are organised thematically, covering a variety of topics and contexts: writing and solving equations, geometric construction, coordinates and complex numbers, perceptions of ‘infinity’ and its permissible uses in mathematics, number systems, and evolving views of the role of axioms. Through this approach, the author demonstrates that changes in our understanding of numbers have often relied on the breaking of long-held conventions to make way for new inventions at once providing greater clarity and widening mathematical horizons. Viewed from this historical perspective, mathematical abstraction emerges as neither mysterious nor immutable, but as a contingent, developing human activity. Making up Numbers will be of great interest to undergraduate and A-level students of mathematics, as well as secondary school teachers of the subject. In virtue of its detailed treatment of mathematical ideas, it will be of value to anyone seeking to learn more about the development of the subject.",Mathematics,282,N/A,0,en

Elements of Mathematics,Gabor Toth,Springer Nature,2021-09-23,"This textbook offers a rigorous presentation of mathematics before the advent of calculus. Fundamental concepts in algebra, geometry, and number theory are developed from the foundations of set theory along an elementary, inquiry-driven path. Thought-provoking examples and challenging problems inspired by mathematical contests motivate the theory, while frequent historical asides reveal the story of how the ideas were originally developed. Beginning with a thorough treatment of the natural numbers via Peano’s axioms, the opening chapters focus on establishing the natural, integral, rational, and real number systems. Plane geometry is introduced via Birkhoff’s axioms of metric geometry, and chapters on polynomials traverse arithmetical operations, roots, and factoring multivariate expressions. An elementary classification of conics is given, followed by an in-depth study of rational expressions. Exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions complete the picture, driven by inequalities that compare them with polynomial and rational functions. Axioms and limits underpin the treatment throughout, offering not only powerful tools, but insights into non-trivial connections between topics. Elements of Mathematics is ideal for students seeking a deep and engaging mathematical challenge based on elementary tools. Whether enhancing the early undergraduate curriculum for high achievers, or constructing a reflective senior capstone, instructors will find ample material for enquiring mathematics majors. No formal prerequisites are assumed beyond high school algebra, making the book ideal for mathematics circles and competition preparation.

Deep Learning,"Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville",MIT Press,2016-11-10,"An introduction to a broad range of topics in deep learning, covering mathematical and conceptual background, deep learning techniques used in industry, and research perspectives. “Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject.” —Elon Musk, cochair of OpenAI; cofounder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX Deep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

The strongly related to that Computational Analysis is a very large area with lots of applications. This monograph includes a great variety of topics of Computational Analysis. We present: probabilistic wavelet approximations, constrained abstract approximation theory, shape preserving weighted approximation, non positive approximations to definite integrals, discrete best approximation, approximation theory of general Picard singular operators including global smoothness preservation property, fractional singular operators. We also deal with non-isotropic general Picard singular multivariate operators and q-Gauss-Weierstrass singular q-integral operators. We talk about quantitative approximations by shift-invariant univariate and multivariate integral operators, nonlinear neural networks approximation, convergence with rates of positive linear operators, quantitative approximation by bounded linear operators, univariate and multivariate quantitative approximation by stochastic positive linear operators on univariate and multivariate stochastic processes. We further present right fractional calculus and give quantitative fractional Korovkin theory of positive linear operators. We also give analytical inequalities, fractional Opial inequalities, fractional identities and inequalities regarding fractional integrals. We further deal with semi group operator approximation, simultaneous Feller probabilistic approximation. We also present Fuzzy singular operator approximations. We give transfers from real to fuzzy approximation and talk about fuzzy wavelet and fuzzy neural networks approximations, fuzzy fractional calculus and fuzzy Ostrowski inequality. We talk about discrete fractional calculus, nabla discrete fractional calculus and inequalities. We study the q-inequalities, and q-fractional inequalities. We further study time scales: delta and nabla approaches, duality principle and inequalities. We introduce delta and nabla time scales fractional calculus and inequalities. We finally study convergence with rates of approximate solutions to exact solution of multivariate Dirichlet problem and multivariate heat equation, and discuss the uniqueness of solution of general evolution partial differential equation \ in multivariate time. The exposed results are expected to find applications to: applied and computational mathematics, stochastics, engineering, artificial intelligence, vision, complexity and machine learning.

Invigorating High School Math,"Steven Leinwand, Eric Milou",N/A,2021-08-31,"Dramatically Improving High School Mathematics Must Start Now! High school math is failing many students. Out-of-date and stale curricula are not only dull, but perpetuate inequity by limiting opportunities and failing to prepare a majority of students for life in the 21st century. Even traditionalists recognize that the status quo is no longer acceptable. Major shifts in course organization, mathematical content, pedagogy, and assessment are long overdue. Practical Guidance for Meaningful Transformation Invigorating High School Math is a clarion call for meaningful transformation. Throughout the book, Steven Leinwand and Eric Milou address the most critical challenges facing high school mathematics and provide practical guidance for: addressing challenges and excuses that often short-circuit new approaches making the case for the importance of and rationale for changing high school math creating core integrated math courses for grades 9 and 10 and coherent pathways for grades 11 and 12 making critical shifts in pedagogy and classroom practice designing high-quality assessments and using them effectively developing and executing a rational implementation plan A Stimulus for Discussion and a Road Map for Change Many of these ideas will not be broadly popular. It's likely that none of them will be easy to implement. That's no surprise: For nearly a century, the basic structure of high school mathematics has barely changed-not because of its effectiveness, but because the status quo is a powerful force requiring purposeful action to break. This book was written for every high school math educator and leader-as both a stimulus for discussion and a road map for change. Our hope, say the authors, is that this book stimulates change, empowers teachers, and guides the profession on this critical journey to invigorate high school mathematics.",,216,N/A,0,en

"Foundations of Applied Mathematics, Volume I","Jeffrey Humpherys, Tyler J. Jarvis, Emily J. Evans",SIAM,2017-07-07,"This book provides the essential foundations of both linear and nonlinear analysis necessary for understanding and working in twenty-first century applied and computational mathematics. In addition to the standard topics, this text includes several key concepts of modern applied mathematical analysis that should be, but are not typically, included in advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate mathematics curricula. This material is the introductory foundation upon which algorithm analysis, optimization, probability, statistics, differential equations, machine learning, and control theory are built. When used in concert with the free supplemental lab materials, this text teaches students both the theory and the computational practice of modern mathematical analysis. Foundations of Applied Mathematics, Volume 1: Mathematical Analysis includes several key topics not usually treated in courses at this level, such as uniform contraction mappings, the continuous linear extension theorem, Daniell?Lebesgue integration, resolvents, spectral resolution theory, and pseudospectra. Ideas are developed in a mathematically rigorous way and students are provided with powerful tools and beautiful ideas that yield a number of nice proofs, all of which contribute to a deep understanding of advanced analysis and linear algebra. Carefully thought out exercises and examples are built on each other to reinforce and retain concepts and ideas and to achieve greater depth. Associated lab materials are available that expose students to applications and numerical computation and reinforce the theoretical ideas taught in the text. The text and labs combine to make students technically proficient and to answer the age-old question, ""When am I going to use this?",Mathematics,710,5,1,en

Partendo dall'esperienza di applicazione del metodo ai bambini in età scolare, l'autore dimostra come esso possa essere applicato anche a studenti delle università. Il testo è diviso in due parti: nella prima è illustrato il lavoro preliminare di ricerca seguito da un'esposizione più specifica del metodo e dei suoi principi teorici. La seconda parte ha un contenuto pratico nella quale sono indicati i criteri di valutazione dei test, suddivisi nelle principali materie all'epoca studiate nei college americani. L'opera è il risultato del lavoro di ricerca sperimentale condotto dall'autore grazie al quale ha conseguito il suo secondo titolo accademico presso l'Università della Columbia, nel 1922.","Education, Higher",376,N/A,0,en

Humble Pi,Matt Parker,Penguin,2020-01-21,"#1 INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER AN ADAM SAVAGE BOOK CLUB PICK The book-length answer to anyone who ever put their hand up in math class and asked, “When am I ever going to use this in the real world?” “Fun, informative, and relentlessly entertaining, Humble Pi is a charming and very readable guide to some of humanity's all-time greatest miscalculations—that also gives you permission to feel a little better about some of your own mistakes.” —Ryan North, author of How to Invent Everything Our whole world is built on math, from the code running a website to the equations enabling the design of skyscrapers and bridges. Most of the time this math works quietly behind the scenes . . . until it doesn’t. All sorts of seemingly innocuous mathematical mistakes can have significant consequences. Math is easy to ignore until a misplaced decimal point upends the stock market, a unit conversion error causes a plane to crash, or someone divides by zero and stalls a battleship in the middle of the ocean. Exploring and explaining a litany of glitches, near misses, and mathematical mishaps involving the internet, big data, elections, street signs, lotteries, the Roman Empire, and an Olympic team, Matt Parker uncovers the bizarre ways math trips us up, and what this reveals about its essential place in our world.

Analysis I,Terence Tao,Springer,2016-08-29,"This is part one of a two-volume book on real analysis and is intended for senior undergraduate students of mathematics who have already been exposed to calculus. The emphasis is on rigour and foundations of analysis. Beginning with the construction of the number systems and set theory, the book discusses the basics of analysis (limits, series, continuity, differentiation, Riemann integration), through to power series, several variable calculus and Fourier analysis, and then finally the Lebesgue integral. These are almost entirely set in the concrete setting of the real line and Euclidean spaces, although there is some material on abstract metric and topological spaces. The book also has appendices on mathematical logic and the decimal system. The entire text (omitting some less central topics) can be taught in two quarters of 25–30 lectures each. The course material is deeply intertwined with the exercises, as it is intended that the student actively learn the material (and practice thinking and writing rigorously) by proving several of the key results in the theory.",Mathematics,366,5,2,en

Elementary Mathematics Specialists,"Maggie B. McGatha, Nicole R.

The Association of Mathematics Teacher Educators (AMTE), the Association of State Supervisors of Mathematics, the National Council of Supervisors of Mathematics, and the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, in a 2010 joint position paper on Elementary Mathematics Specialists (EMSs), all advocate for the use of EMSs to support the teaching and learning of mathematics. The specific roles and expectations of EMSs will vary according to the needs of each setting, “but their expertise and successful experience at the elementary level is critical” (p 1). Elementary Mathematics Specialists: Developing, Refining, and Examining Programs that Support Mathematics Teaching and Learning is AMTE’s latest resource supporting the important work of EMSs. It has five sections related to the preparation and professional development of EMSs: (a) Overview and Current State of Affairs; (b) Models of EMS Program Development & Delivery; (c) Supporting EMSs in the Field; (d) The Mathematics Specialist Research; and (e) Future Directions.

Proofs and Fundamentals,Ethan D. Bloch,Springer Science & Business Media,2011-02-15,"“Proofs and Fundamentals: A First Course in Abstract Mathematics” 2nd edition is designed as a ""transition"" course to introduce undergraduates to the writing of rigorous mathematical proofs, and to such fundamental mathematical ideas as sets, functions, relations, and cardinality. The text serves as a bridge between computational courses such as calculus, and more theoretical, proofs-oriented courses such as linear algebra, abstract algebra and real analysis. This 3-part work carefully balances Proofs, Fundamentals, and Extras. Part 1 presents logic and basic proof techniques; Part 2 thoroughly covers fundamental material such as sets, functions and relations; and Part 3 introduces a variety of extra topics such as groups, combinatorics and sequences. A gentle, friendly style is used, in which motivation and informal discussion play a key role, and yet high standards in rigor and in writing are never compromised. New to the second edition: 1) A new section about the foundations of set theory has been added at the end of the chapter about sets. This section includes a very informal discussion of the Zermelo– Fraenkel Axioms for set theory. We do not make use of these axioms subsequently in the text, but it is valuable for any mathematician to be aware that an axiomatic basis for set theory exists. Also included in this new section is a slightly expanded discussion of the Axiom of Choice, and new discussion of Zorn's Lemma, which is used later in the text. 2) The chapter about the cardinality of sets has been rearranged and expanded. There is a new section at the start of the chapter that summarizes various properties of the set of natural numbers; these properties play important roles subsequently in the chapter. The sections on induction and recursion have been slightly expanded, and have been relocated to an earlier place in the chapter (following the new section), both because they are more concrete than the material found in the other sections of the chapter, and because ideas from the sections on induction and recursion are used in the other sections. Next comes the section on the cardinality of sets (which was originally the first section of the chapter); this section gained proofs of the Schroeder–Bernstein theorem and the Trichotomy Law for Sets, and lost most of the material about finite and countable sets, which has now been moved to a new section devoted to those two types of sets. The chapter concludes with the section on the cardinality of the number systems. 3) The chapter on the construction of the natural numbers, integers and rational numbers from the Peano Postulates was removed entirely. That material was originally included to provide the needed background about the number systems, particularly for the discussion of the cardinality of sets, but it was always somewhat out of place given the level and scope of this text. The background material about the natural numbers needed for the cardinality of sets has now been summarized in a new section at the start of that chapter, making the chapter both self-contained and more accessible than it previously was. 4) The section on families of sets has been thoroughly revised, with the focus being on families of sets in general, not necessarily thought of as indexed. 5) A new section about the convergence of sequences has been added to the chapter on selected topics. This new section, which treats a topic from real analysis, adds some diversity to the chapter, which had hitherto contained selected topics of only an algebraic or combinatorial nature. 6) A new section called ``You Are the Professor'' has been added to the end of the last chapter. This new section, which includes a number of attempted proofs taken from actual homework exercises submitted by students, offers the reader the opportunity to solidify her facility for writing proofs by critiquing these submissions as if she were the instructor for the course. 7) All known errors have been corrected. 8) Many minor adjustments of wording have been made throughout the text, with the hope of improving the exposition.",Mathematics,378,N/A,0,en

How to Prove It,Daniel J. Velleman,Cambridge University Press,2006-01-16,"Many students have trouble the first time they take a mathematics course in which proofs play a significant role. This new edition of Velleman's successful text will prepare students to make the transition from solving problems to proving theorems by teaching them the techniques needed to read and write proofs. The book begins with the basic concepts of logic and set theory, to familiarize students with the language of mathematics and how it is interpreted. These concepts are used as the basis for a step-by-step breakdown of the most important techniques used in constructing proofs. The author shows how complex proofs are built up from these smaller steps, using detailed 'scratch work' sections to expose the machinery of proofs about the natural numbers, relations, functions, and infinite sets. To give students the opportunity to construct their own proofs, this new edition contains over 200 new exercises, selected solutions, and an introduction to Proof Designer software.

Rich tasks, collaborative work, number talks, problem-based learning, direct instruction...with so many possible approaches, how do we know which ones work the best? In Visible Learning for Mathematics, six acclaimed educators assert it’s not about which one—it’s about when—and show you how to design high-impact instruction so all students demonstrate more than a year’s worth of mathematics learning for a year spent in school. That’s a high bar, but with the amazing K-12 framework here, you choose the right approach at the right time, depending upon where learners are within three phases of learning: surface, deep, and transfer. This results in ""visible"" learning because the effect is tangible. The framework is forged out of current research in mathematics combined with John Hattie’s synthesis of more than 15 years of education research involving 300 million students. Chapter by chapter, and equipped with video clips, planning tools, rubrics, and templates, you get the inside track on which instructional strategies to use at each phase of the learning cycle: Surface learning phase: When—through carefully constructed experiences—students explore new concepts and make connections to procedural skills and vocabulary that give shape to developing conceptual understandings. Deep learning phase: When—through the solving of rich high-cognitive tasks and rigorous discussion—students make connections among conceptual ideas, form mathematical generalizations, and apply and practice procedural skills with fluency. Transfer phase: When students can independently think through more complex mathematics, and can plan, investigate, and elaborate as they apply what they know to new mathematical situations. To equip students for higher-level mathematics learning, we have to be clear about where students are, where they need to go, and what it looks like when they get there.

Mathematics and Music,David Wright,American Mathematical Soc.,2009,"Many people intuitively sense that there is a connection between mathematics and music. If nothing else, both involve counting. There is, of course, much more to the association. David Wright's book is an investigation of the interrelationships between mathematics and music, reviewing the needed background concepts in each subject as they are encountered. Along the way, readers will augment their understanding of both mathematics and music. The text explores the common foundations of the two subjects, which are developed side by side. Musical and mathematical notions are brought together, such as scales and modular arithmetic, intervals and logarithms, tone and trigonometry, and timbre and harmonic analysis. When possible, discussions of musical and mathematical notions are directly interwoven. Occasionally the discourse dwells for a while on one subject and not the other, but eventually the connection is established, making this an integrative treatment of the two subjects. The book is a text for a freshman level college course suitable for musically inclined or mathematically inclined students, with the intent of breaking down any apprehension that either group might have for the other subject. Exercises are given at the end of each chapter. The mathematical prerequisites are a high-school level familiarity with algebra, trigonometry, functions, and graphs. Musically, the student should have had some exposure to musical staffs, standard clefs, and key signatures, though all of these are explained in the text.",Mathematics,178,N/A,0,en

We realized that in ten years what matters will be how students approach a problem using the tools they carry with them—common sense and common knowledge—not the particular mathematics we chose for the curriculum. Using our text, students work regularly with real data in moderately complex everyday contexts, using mathematics as a tool and common sense as a guide. The focus is on problems suggested by the news of the day and topics that matter to students, like inflation, credit card debt, and loans. We use search engines, calculators, and spreadsheet programs as tools to reduce drudgery, explore patterns, and get information. Technology is an integral part of today's world—this text helps students use it thoughtfully and wisely. This second edition contains revised chapters and additional sections, updated examples and exercises, and complete rewrites of critical material based on feedback from students and teachers who have used this text.

"Teaching Math to Multilingual Students, Grades K-8","Kathryn B. Chval, Erin Smith, Lina Trigos-Carrillo, Rachel J. Pinnow",Corwin,2020-12-21,"Using strengths-based approaches to support development in mathematics It’s time to re-imagine what’s possible and celebrate the brilliance multilingual learners bring to today’s classrooms. Innovative teaching strategies can position these learners as leaders in mathematics. Yet, as the number of multilingual learners in North American schools grows, many teachers have not had opportunities to gain the competencies required to teach these learners effectively, especially in disciplines such as mathematics. Multilingual learners—historically called English Language Learners—are expected to interpret the meaning of problems, analyze, make conjectures, evaluate their progress, and discuss and understand their own approaches and the approaches of their peers in mathematics classrooms. Thus, language plays a vital role in mathematics learning, and demonstrating these competencies in a second (or third) language is a challenging endeavor. Based on best practices and the authors’ years of research, this guide offers practical approaches that equip grades K-8 teachers to draw on the strengths of multilingual learners, partner with their families, and position these learners for success. Readers will find: • A focus on multilingual students as leaders • A strength-based approach that draws on students’ life experiences and cultural backgrounds • An emphasis on maintaining high expectations for learners’ capacity for mastering rigorous content • Strategies for representing concepts in different formats • Stop and Think questions throughout and reflection questions at the end of each chapter • Try It!

Carpenter This highly anticipated follow-up volume to the landmark Children's Mathematics: Cognitively Guided Instruction addresses the urgent need to help teachers understand and teach fraction concepts. Fractions remain one of the key stumbling blocks in math education, and here Empson and Levi lay a foundation for understanding fractions and decimals in ways that build conceptual learning. They show how the same kinds of intuitive knowledge and sense making that provides the basis for children's learning of whole number arithmetic can be extended to fractions and decimals. Just as they did in Children's Mathematics and Thinking Mathematically, Empson and Levi provide important insights into children's thinking and alternative approaches to solving problems. Three themes appear throughout the book: building meaning for fractions and decimals through discussing and solving word problems the progression of children's strategies for solving fraction word problems and equations from direct modeling through relational thinking designing instruction that capitalizes on students' relational thinking strategies to integrate algebra into teaching and learning fractions. With illuminating examples of student work, classroom vignettes, ""Teacher Commentaries"" from the field, sample problems and instructional guides provided in each chapter, you'll have all the tools you need to teach fractions and decimals with understanding and confidence.",Education,0,N/A,0,en

The Brilliance of Black Children in Mathematics,"Jacqueline Leonard, Danny B. Martin",IAP,2013-03-01,"This book is a critically important contribution to the work underway to transform schooling for students who have historically been denied access to a quality education, specifically African American children. The first section of the book provides some historical perspective critical to understanding the current state of education in the U.S., specifically for the education of African American children. The following sections include chapters on policy, learning, ethnomathematics, student identity, and teacher preparation as it relates to the mathematical education of Black children. Through offering “counternarratives” about mathematically successful Black youth, advocating for a curriculum that is grounded in African American culture and ways of thinking, providing shining examples of the brilliance of Blacks students, and promoting high expectations for all rather than situating students as the problem, the authors of this book provide powerful insights related to the teaching and learning of mathematics for African American students. As is made evident in this book, effective teaching involves much more than just engaging students in inquiry-based pedagogy (Kitchen, 2003). The chapters offered in this book demonstrate how mathematics instruction for African American students needs to take into account historical marginalization and present-day policies that do harm to Black students (Kunjufu, 2005). Empowering mathematics instruction for African American students needs to take into consideration and promote students’ cultural, spiritual, and historical identities. Furthermore, mathematics instruction for African American students should create opportunities for students to express themselves and the needs of their communities as a means to promote social justice both within their classrooms and communities.",Social Science,397,N/A,0,en

Mathematics via Problems: Part 2: Geometry,"Alexey A. Zaslavsky, Mikhail B. Skopenkov",American Mathematical Soc.,2021-08-24,"This book is a translation from Russian of Part II of the book Mathematics Through Problems: From Olympiads and Math Circles to Profession. Part I, Algebra, was recently published in the same series. Part III, Combinatorics, will be published soon. The main goal of this book is to develop important parts of mathematics through problems. The authors tried to put together sequences of problems that allow high school students (and some undergraduates) with strong interest in mathematics to discover and recreate much of elementary mathematics and start edging into more sophisticated topics such as projective and affine geometry, solid geometry, and so on, thus building a bridge between standard high school exercises and more intricate notions in geometry. Definitions and/or references for material that is not standard in the school curriculum are included. To help students that might be unfamiliar with new material, problems are carefully arranged to provide gradual introduction into each subject. Problems are often accompanied by hints and/or complete solutions. The book is based on classes taught by the authors at different times at the Independent University of Moscow, at a number of Moscow schools and math circles, and at various summer schools. It can be used by high school students and undergraduates, their teachers, and organizers of summer camps and math circles. In the interest of fostering a greater awareness and appreciation of mathematics and its connections to other disciplines and everyday life, MSRI and the AMS are publishing books in the Mathematical Circles Library series as a service to young people, their parents and teachers, and the mathematics profession.",Education,200,N/A,0,en

An Invitation to Abstract Mathematics,Béla Bajnok,Springer Nature,2020-10-27,"This undergraduate textbook promotes an active transition to higher mathematics. Problem solving is the heart and soul of this book: each problem is carefully chosen to demonstrate, elucidate, or extend a concept. More than 300 exercises engage the reader in extensive arguments and creative approaches, while exploring connections between fundamental mathematical topics. Divided into four parts, this book begins with a playful exploration of the building blocks of mathematics, such as definitions, axioms, and proofs. A study of the fundamental concepts of logic, sets, and functions follows, before focus turns to methods of proof. Having covered the core of a transition course, the author goes on to present a selection of advanced topics that offer opportunities for extension or further study. Throughout, appendices touch on historical perspectives, current trends, and open questions, showing mathematics as a vibrant and dynamic human enterprise. This second edition has been reorganized to better reflect the layout and curriculum of standard transition courses. It also features recent developments and improved appendices. An Invitation to Abstract Mathematics is ideal for those seeking a challenging and engaging transition to advanced mathematics, and will appeal to both undergraduates majoring in mathematics, as well as non-math majors interested in exploring higher-level concepts. From reviews of the first edition: Bajnok’s new book truly invites students to enjoy the beauty, power, and challenge of abstract mathematics. ... The book can be used as a text for traditional transition or structure courses ... but since Bajnok invites all students, not just mathematics majors, to enjoy the subject, he assumes very little background knowledge. Jill Dietz, MAA Reviews The style of writing is careful, but joyously enthusiastic.... The author’s clear attitude is that mathematics consists of problem solving, and that writing a proof falls into this category. Students of mathematics are, therefore, engaged in problem solving, and should be given problems to solve, rather than problems to imitate. The author attributes this approach to his Hungarian background ... and encourages students to embrace the challenge in the same way an athlete engages in vigorous practice.

Powell, Sharon Nelson-Barber",Routledge,2009-05-20,"At a time of rapid demographic change and amidst the many educational challenges facing the US, this critical new collection presents mathematics education from a culturally responsive perspective. It tackles the most crucial issues of teaching mathematics to an ethnically diverse school population, including the political dimension of mathematics education within the context of governmental efforts to improve achievement in school mathematics. Culturally Responsive Mathematics Education moves beyond a point of view that is internal to mathematics education as a discipline, and instead offers a broad perspective of mathematics as a significant, liberating intellectual force in our society. The editors of this volume bring together contributions from many of the leading teachers, teacher educators, researchers, scholars, and activists who have been working to reorient mathematics education in ways that reflect mathematics education as accomplished, first and foremost, through human interactions.",Education,468,N/A,0,en

Watson Research Center. An outside to mainstream scientific research, he managed to do what others had thought impossible: develop a new geometry that combines revelatory beauty with a radical way of unfolding formerly hidden scientific laws. In the process he was able to use geometry to solve fresh, real-world problems. With exuberance and an eloquent fluency, Benoit Mandelbrot recounts the high points of his fascinating life, offering us a glimpse into the evolution of his extraordinary mind.

Can you fool an airline into accepting oversize baggage? Recreational mathematics is full of frivolous questions where the mathematician's art can be brought to bear. But play often has a purpose. In mathematics, it can sharpen skills, provide amusement, or simply surprise, and books of problems have been the stock-in-trade of mathematicians for centuries. This collection is designed to be sipped from, rather than consumed in one sitting. The questions range in difficulty: the most challenging offer a glimpse of deep results that engage mathematicians today; even the easiest prompt readers to think about mathematics.

Mathematics via Problems,Arkadiy Skopenkov,"American Mathematical Society, Mathematical Sciences Research Institute",2021-02-11,"This book is a translation from Russian of Part I of the book Mathematics Through Problems: From Olympiads and Math Circles to Profession. The other two parts, Geometry and Combinatorics, will be published soon. The main goal of this book is to develop important parts of mathematics through problems. The author tries to put together sequences of problems that allow high school students (and some undergraduates) with strong interest in mathematics to discover and recreate much of elementary mathematics and start edging into the sophisticated world of topics such as group theory, Galois theory, and so on, thus building a bridge (by showing that there is no gap) between standard high school exercises and more intricate and abstract concepts in mathematics. Definitions and/or references for material that is not standard in the school curriculum are included. However, many topics in the book are difficult when you start learning them from scratch. To help with this, problems are carefully arranged to provide gradual introduction into each subject. Problems are often accompanied by hints and/or complete solutions The book is based on classes taught by the author at different times at the Independent University of Moscow, at a number of Moscow schools and math circles, and at various summer schools. It can be used by high school students and undergraduates, their teachers, and organizers of summer camps and math circles. In the interest of fostering a greater awareness and appreciation of mathematics and its connections to other disciplines and everyday life, MSRI and the AMS are publishing books in the Mathematical Circles Library series as a service to young people, their parents and teachers, and the mathematics profession.",Mathematics,221,N/A,0,en

Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning,George Polya,Lushena Books,2023-02-08,"This two volume classic comprises two titles: ""Patterns of Plausible Inference"" and ""Induction and Analogy in Mathematics"". This is a guide to the practical art of plausible reasoning, particularly in mathematics, but also in every field of human activity. Using mathematics as the example par excellence, Polya shows how even the most rigorous deductive discipline is heavily dependent on techniques of guessing, inductive reasoning, and reasoning by analogy. In solving a problem, the answer must be guessed at before a proof can be given, and guesses are usually made from a knowledge of facts, experience, and hunches. The truly creative mathematician must be a good guesser first and a good prover afterward; many important theorems have been guessed but no proved until much later. In the same way, solutions to problems can be guessed, and a god guesser is much more likely to find a correct solution. This work might have been called ""How to Become a Good Guesser.""-From the Dust Jacket.",Computers,0,N/A,0,en

The authors' decades of teaching experience resulted in a text that reflects how students generally use a textbook-i.e., they start in the exercises and refer back to the narrative for help as needed. The text therefore builds from a foundation of meticulously crafted exercise sets, then draws students into the narrative through writing that reflects the voice of the instructor, examples that are stepped out and thoughtfully annotated, and figures that are designed to teach rather than simply supplement the narrative.

Mindset Mathematics,"Jo Boaler, Jen Munson, Cathy Williams",John Wiley & Sons,2017-08-28,"Engage students in mathematics using growth mindset techniques The most challenging parts of teaching mathematics are engaging students and helping them understand the connections between mathematics concepts. In this volume, you'll find a collection of low floor, high ceiling tasks that will help you do just that, by looking at the big ideas at the first-grade level through visualization, play, and investigation. During their work with tens of thousands of teachers, authors Jo Boaler, Jen Munson, and Cathy Williams heard the same message—that they want to incorporate more brain science into their math instruction, but they need guidance in the techniques that work best to get across the concepts they needed to teach. So the authors designed Mindset Mathematics around the principle of active student engagement, with tasks that reflect the latest brain science on learning. Open, creative, and visual math tasks have been shown to improve student test scores, and more importantly change their relationship with mathematics and start believing in their own potential. The tasks in Mindset Mathematics reflect the lessons from brain science that: There is no such thing as a math person - anyone can learn mathematics to high levels. Mistakes, struggle and challenge are the most important times for brain growth. Speed is unimportant in mathematics. Mathematics is a visual and beautiful subject, and our brains want to think visually about mathematics. With engaging questions, open-ended tasks, and four-color visuals that will help kids get excited about mathematics, Mindset Mathematics is organized around nine big ideas which emphasize the connections within the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and can be used with any current curriculum.",Education,288,N/A,0,en

A Primer of Abstract Mathematics,Robert B. Ash,American Mathematical Soc.,2020-03-02,"The purpose of this book is to prepare the reader for coping with abstract mathematics. The intended audience is both students taking a first course in abstract algebra who feel the need to strengthen their background and those from a more applied background who need some experience in dealing with abstract ideas. Learning any area of abstract mathematics requires not only ability to write formally but also to think intuitively about what is going on and to describe that process clearly and cogently in ordinary English. Ash tries to aid intuition by keeping proofs short and as informal as possible and using concrete examples as illustration. Thus, it is an ideal textbook for an audience with limited experience in formalism and abstraction. A number of expository innovations are included, for example, an informal development of set theory which teaches students all the basic results for algebra in one chapter.",Mathematics,193,N/A,0,en

The Early Mathematics of Leonhard Euler,C.

These early pieces contain some of Euler's greatest work, the Konigsberg bridge problem, his solution to the Basel problem, and his first proof of the Euler-Fermat theorem. It also presents important results that we seldom realize are due to Euler; that mixed partial derivatives are (usually) equal, our f(x) f(x) notation, and the integrating factor in differential equations. The books shows how contributions in diverse fields are related, how number theory relates to series, which, in turn, relate to elliptic integrals and then to differential equations. There are dozens of such strands in this beautiful web of mathematics. At the same time, we see Euler grow in power and sophistication, from a young student when at 18 he published his first work on differential equations (a paper with a serious flaw) to the most celebrated mathematician and scientist of his time. It is a portrait of the world's most exciting mathematics between 1725 and 1741, rich in technical detail, woven with connections within Euler's work and with the work of other mathematicians in other times and places, laced with historical context.",Education,415,N/A,0,la

Good Math,Mark C. Chu-Carroll,Pragmatic Bookshelf,2013-07-18,"Mathematics is beautiful--and it can be fun and exciting as well as practical. Good Math is your guide to some of the most intriguing topics from two thousand years of mathematics: from Egyptian fractions to Turing machines; from the real meaning of numbers to proof trees, group symmetry, and mechanical computation. If you've ever wondered what lay beyond the proofs you struggled to complete in high school geometry, or what limits the capabilities of computer on your desk, this is the book for you. Why do Roman numerals persist? How do we know that some infinities are larger than others? And how can we know for certain a program will ever finish? In this fast-paced tour of modern and not-so-modern math, computer scientist Mark Chu-Carroll explores some of the greatest breakthroughs and disappointments of more than two thousand years of mathematical thought. There is joy and beauty in mathematics, and in more than two dozen essays drawn from his popular ""Good Math"" blog, you'll find concepts, proofs, and examples that are often surprising, counterintuitive, or just plain weird. Mark begins his journey with the basics of numbers, with an entertaining trip through the integers and the natural, rational, irrational, and transcendental numbers. The voyage continues with a look at some of the oddest numbers in mathematics, including zero, the golden ratio, imaginary numbers, Roman numerals, and Egyptian and continuing fractions. After a deep dive into modern logic, including an introduction to linear logic and the logic-savvy Prolog language, the trip concludes with a tour of modern set theory and the advances and paradoxes of modern mechanical computing. If your high school or college math courses left you grasping for the inner meaning behind the numbers, Mark's book will both entertain and enlighten you.",Computers,261,N/A,0,en

The Philosophy of the Young Kant,Martin Schonfeld,Oxford University Press,2000-10-12,"This intellectual biography of Immanuel Kant's early years-- from 1746 when he wrote his first book, to 1766 when he lost his faith in metaphysics --makes an outstanding contribution to Kant scholarship. Schönfeld meticulously examines most of Kant's early works, summarizes their content, and exhibits their shortcomings and strengths. He places the early theories in their historical context and describes the scientific discoveries and philosophical innovations that distinguish Kant's pre-critical works. Schönfeld argues that these works were all aspects of a single project carried out by Kant to reconcile metaphysical and scientific perspectives and combine them into a coherent model of nature.",Philosophy,365,N/A,0,en
C*-Algebras and Operator Theory,Gerald J. Murphy,Academic Press,2014-06-28,"This book constitutes a first- or second-year graduate course in operator theory. It is a field that has great importance for other areas of mathematics and physics, such as algebraic topology, differential geometry, and quantum mechanics. It assumes a basic knowledge in functional analysis but no prior acquaintance with operator theory is required.",Mathematics,297,N/A,0,en
C*-Algebras by Example,Kenneth R. Davidson,"American Mathematical Society, Fields Institute",2023-10-04,"The subject of C*-algebras received a dramatic revitalization in the 1970s by the introduction of topological methods through the work of Brown, Douglas, and Fillmore on extensions of C*-algebras and Elliott's use of $K$-theory to provide a useful classification of AF algebras. These results were the beginning of a marvelous new set of tools for analyzing concrete C*-algebras. This book is an introductory graduate level text which presents the basics of the subject through a detailed analysis of several important classes of C*-algebras. The development of operator algebras in the last twenty years has been based on a careful study of these special classes. While there are many books on C*-algebras and operator algebras available, this is the first one to attempt to explain the real examples that researchers use to test their hypotheses. Topics include AF algebras, Bunce–Deddens and Cuntz algebras, the Toeplitz algebra, irrational rotation algebras, group C*-algebras, discrete crossed products, abelian C*-algebras (spectral theory and approximate unitary equivalence) and extensions. It also introduces many modern concepts and results in the subject such as real rank zero algebras, topological stable rank, quasidiagonality, and various new constructions. These notes were compiled during the author's participation in the special year on C*-algebras at The Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences during the 1994–1995 academic year. The field of C*-algebras touches upon many other areas of mathematics such as group representations, dynamical systems, physics, $K$-theory, and topology. The variety of examples offered in this text expose the student to many of these connections. Graduate students with a solid course in functional analysis should be able to read this book. This should prepare them to read much of the current literature. This book is reasonably self-contained, and the author has provided results from other areas when necessary.",Mathematics,325,N/A,0,en

The book tells the story of a new type of institution that came into being in 1907 with the federation of three older colleges. Imperial College was founded by the state for advanced university-level training in science and technology, and for the promotion of research in support of industry throughout the British Empire. True to its name the college built a wide number of Imperial links and was an outward looking institution from the start.

Survival Math,Mitchell Jackson,Scribner,2020-02-04,"“A vibrant memoir of race, violence, family, and manhood…a virtuosic wail of a book” (The Boston Globe), Survival Math calculates how award-winning author Mitchell S. Jackson survived the Portland, Oregon, of his youth. This “spellbinding” (NPR) book explores gangs and guns, near-death experiences, sex work, masculinity, composite fathers, the concept of “hustle,” and the destructive power of addiction—all framed within the story of Mitchell Jackson, his family, and his community. Lauded for its breathtaking pace, its tender portrayals, its stark candor, and its luminous style, Survival Math reveals on every page the searching intellect and originality of its author. The primary narrative, focused on understanding the antecedents of Jackson’s family’s experience, is complemented by survivor files, which feature photographs and riveting short narratives of several of Jackson’s male relatives. “A vulnerable, sobering look at Jackson’s life and beyond, in all its tragedies, burdens, and faults” (San Francisco Chronicle), the sum of Survival Math’s parts is a highly original whole, one that reflects on the exigencies—over generations—that have shaped the lives of so many disenfranchised Americans. “Both poetic and brutally honest” (Salon), Mitchell S. Jackson’s nonfiction debut is as essential as it is beautiful, as real as it is artful, a singular achievement, not to be missed.",Biography & Autobiography,336,N/A,0,en

Quantum Theory for Mathematicians,Brian C. Hall,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-06-19,"Although ideas from quantum physics play an important role in many parts of modern mathematics, there are few books about quantum mechanics aimed at mathematicians. This book introduces the main ideas of quantum mechanics in language familiar to mathematicians. Readers with little prior exposure to physics will enjoy the book's conversational tone as they delve into such topics as the Hilbert space approach to quantum theory; the Schrödinger equation in one space dimension; the Spectral Theorem for bounded and unbounded self-adjoint operators; the Stone–von Neumann Theorem; the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin approximation; the role of Lie groups and Lie algebras in quantum mechanics; and the path-integral approach to quantum mechanics. The numerous exercises at the end of each chapter make the book suitable for both graduate courses and independent study. Most of the text is accessible to graduate students in mathematics who have had a first course in real analysis, covering the basics of L2 spaces and Hilbert spaces. The final chapters introduce readers who are familiar with the theory of manifolds to more advanced topics, including geometric quantization.",Science,566,N/A,0,en

This book introduces budding mathematicians of all ages to mathematical ways of thinking through a series of chapters that mix episodes from the author's life with explanations of intriguing mathematical concepts and the stories of the mathematicians who discovered them. The chapters can be read independently, and most require only a background in basic high school algebra or geometry to appreciate the topics covered. Part personal memoir, part appreciation of the poetry and humanity inherent in mathematics, this entertaining collection of stories, theorems, and reflections will be of interest to anyone curious about mathematics and the human beings who practice it. In the interest of fostering a greater awareness and appreciation of mathematics and its connections to other disciplines and everyday life, MSRI and the AMS are publishing books in the Mathematical Circles Library series as a service to young people, their parents and teachers, and the mathematics profession.",Juvenile Nonfiction,194,N/A,0,en

United States Code,,N/A,2013,"Preface 2012 edition: The United States Code is the official codification of the general and permanent laws of the United States. The Code was first published in 1926, and a new edition of the code has been published every six years since 1934. The 2012 edition of the Code incorporates laws enacted through the One Hundred Twelfth Congress, Second session, the last of which was signed by the President on January 15, 2013. It does not include laws of the One Hundred Thirteenth Congress, First session, enacted between January 3, 2013, the date it convened, and January 15, 2013. By statutory authority this edition may be cited ""U.S.C. 2012 ed."" As adopted in 1926, the Code established prima facie the general and permanent laws of the United States. The underlying statutes reprinted in the Code remained in effect and controlled over the Code in case of any discrepancy. In 1947, Congress began enacting individual titles of the Code into positive law. When a title is enacted into positive law, the underlying statutes are repealed and the title then becomes legal evidence of the law. Currently, 26 of the 51 titles in the Code have been so enacted. These are identified in the table of titles near the beginning of each volume. The Law Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives continues to prepare legislation pursuant to 2 USC 285b to enact the remainder of the Code, on a title-by-title basis, into positive law. The 2012 edition of the Code was prepared and published under the supervision of Ralph V. Seep, Law Revision Counsel. Grateful acknowledgment is made of the contributions by all who helped in this work, particularly the staffs of the Office of the Law Revision Counsel and the Government Printing Office. -- John. A.

The Mathematics of Marriage,"John M. Gottman, James D. Murray, Catherine C. Swanson, Rebecca Tyson, Kristin R. Swanson",MIT Press,2005-01-14,"Divorce rates are at an all-time high. But without a theoretical understanding of the processes related to marital stability and dissolution, it is difficult to design and evaluate new marriage interventions. The Mathematics of Marriage provides the foundation for a scientific theory of marital relations. The book does not rely on metaphors, but develops and applies a mathematical model using difference equations. The work is the fulfillment of the goal to build a mathematical framework for the general system theory of families first suggested by Ludwig Von Bertalanffy in the 1960s.The book also presents a complete introduction to the mathematics involved in theory building and testing, and details the development of experiments and models. In one ""marriage experiment,"" for example, the authors explored the effects of lowering or raising a couple's heart rates. Armed with their mathematical model, they were able to do real experiments to determine which processes were affected by their interventions. Applying ideas such as phase space, null clines, influence functions, inertia, and uninfluenced and influenced stable steady states (attractors), the authors show how other researchers can use the methods to weigh their own data with positive and negative weights. While the focus is on modeling marriage, the techniques can be applied to other types of psychological phenomena as well.",Psychology,423,N/A,0,en

This work was done both on an individual basis and with a very long list of coauthors. The contributions that Fishburn made can roughly be divided into three major topical areas, and contributions to each of these areas are identi?ed by sections of this monograph. Section 1 deals with topics that are included in the general areas of utility, preference, individual choice, subjective probability, and measurement t- ory. Section 2 covers social choice theory, voting models, and social welfare. S- tion 3 deals with more purely mathematical topics that are related to combinatorics, graph theory, and ordered sets.

Arguing with Numbers,"James Wynn, G. Mitchell Reyes",Penn State Press,2021-05-14,"As discrete fields of inquiry, rhetoric and mathematics have long been considered antithetical to each other. That is, if mathematics explains or describes the phenomena it studies with certainty, persuasion is not needed. This volume calls into question the view that mathematics is free of rhetoric. Through nine studies of the intersections between these two disciplines, Arguing with Numbers shows that mathematics is in fact deeply rhetorical. Using rhetoric as a lens to analyze mathematically based arguments in public policy, political and economic theory, and even literature, the essays in this volume reveal how mathematics influences the values and beliefs with which we assess the world and make decisions and how our worldviews influence the kinds of mathematical instruments we construct and accept. In addition, contributors examine how concepts of rhetoric—such as analogy and visuality—have been employed in mathematical and scientific reasoning, including in the theorems of mathematical physicists and the geometrical diagramming of natural scientists. Challenging academic orthodoxy, these scholars reject a math-equals-truth reduction in favor of a more constructivist theory of mathematics as dynamic, evolving, and powerfully persuasive. By bringing these disparate lines of inquiry into conversation with one another, Arguing with Numbers provides inspiration to students, established scholars, and anyone inside or outside rhetorical studies who might be interested in exploring the intersections between the two disciplines. In addition to the editors, the contributors to this volume are Catherine Chaput, Crystal Broch Colombini, Nathan Crick, Michael Dreher, Jeanne Fahnestock, Andrew C.

An Introduction to Homological Algebra,Charles A.

This book provides a unified account of homological algebra as it exists today. The historical connection with topology, regular local rings, and semi-simple Lie algebras are also described. This book is suitable for second or third year graduate students. The first half of the book takes as its subject the canonical topics in homological algebra: derived functors, Tor and Ext, projective dimensions and spectral sequences. Homology of group and Lie algebras illustrate these topics. Intermingled are less canonical topics, such as the derived inverse limit functor lim1, local cohomology, Galois cohomology, and affine Lie algebras. The last part of the book covers less traditional topics that are a vital part of the modern homological toolkit: simplicial methods, Hochschild and cyclic homology, derived categories and total derived functors. By making these tools more accessible, the book helps to break down the technological barrier between experts and casual users of homological algebra.",Mathematics,470,N/A,0,en

College Geometry,David C. Kay,CRC Press,2011-06-24,"Designed for mathematics majors and other students who intend to teach mathematics at the secondary school level, College Geometry: A Unified Development unifies the three classical geometries within an axiomatic framework. The author develops the axioms to include Euclidean, elliptic, and hyperbolic geometry, showing how geometry has real and far-reaching implications. He approaches every topic as a fresh, new concept and carefully defines and explains geometric principles. The book begins with elementary ideas about points, lines, and distance, gradually introducing more advanced concepts such as congruent triangles and geometric inequalities. At the core of the text, the author simultaneously develops the classical formulas for spherical and hyperbolic geometry within the axiomatic framework. He explains how the trigonometry of the right triangle, including the Pythagorean theorem, is developed for classical non-Euclidean geometries. Previously accessible only to advanced or graduate students, this material is presented at an elementary level. The book also explores other important concepts of modern geometry, including affine transformations and circular inversion. Through clear explanations and numerous examples and problems, this text shows step-by-step how fundamental geometric ideas are connected to advanced geometry.

They date back more than 100 million years. Yet their story has never been fully told. In Feathers, biologist Thor Hanson details a sweeping natural history, as feathers have been used to fly, protect, attract, and adorn through time and place. Applying the research of paleontologists, ornithologists, biologists, engineers, and even art historians, Hanson asks: What are feathers? How did they evolve? What do they mean to us? Engineers call feathers the most efficient insulating material ever discovered, and they are at the root of biology's most enduring debate. They silence the flight of owls and keep penguins dry below the ice. They have decorated queens, jesters, and priests. And they have inked documents from the Constitution to the novels of Jane Austen. Feathers is a captivating and beautiful exploration of this most enchanting object.",Nature,327,N/A,0,en

Classification of Nuclear C*-Algebras. Entropy in Operator Algebras,"M. Rordam, E. Stormer",Springer Science & Business Media,2001-11-20,"to the Encyclopaedia Subseries on Operator Algebras and Non-Commutative Geometry The theory of von Neumann algebras was initiated in a series of papers by Murray and von Neumann in the 1930's and 1940's. A von Neumann algebra is a self-adjoint unital subalgebra M of the algebra of bounded operators of a Hilbert space which is closed in the weak operator topology. According to von Neumann's bicommutant theorem, M is closed in the weak operator topology if and only if it is equal to the commutant of its commutant. Afactor is a von Neumann algebra with trivial centre and the work of Murray and von Neumann contained a reduction of all von Neumann algebras to factors and a classification of factors into types I, II and III. C* -algebras are self-adjoint operator algebras on Hilbert space which are closed in the norm topology. Their study was begun in the work of Gelfand and Naimark who showed that such algebras can be characterized abstractly as involutive Banach algebras, satisfying an algebraic relation connecting the norm and the involution. They also obtained the fundamental result that a commutative unital C* -algebra is isomorphic to the algebra of complex valued continuous functions on a compact space - its spectrum. Since then the subject of operator algebras has evolved into a huge mathematical endeavour interacting with almost every branch of mathematics and several areas of theoretical physics.",Mathematics,212,N/A,0,en

Stories about Maxima and Minima,Vladimir Mikhaĭlovich Tikhomirov,American Mathematical Soc.,1990,"Throughout the history of mathematics, maximum and minimum problems have played an important role in the evolution of the field. Many beautiful and important problems have appeared in a variety of branches of mathematics and physics, as well as in other fields of sciences. The greatest scientists of the past - Euclid, Archimedes, Heron, the Bernoullis, Newton and many others - took part in seeking solutions to these concrete problems. The solutions stimulated the development of the theory, and, as a result, techniques were elaborated that made possible the solution of a tremendous variety of problems by a single method. This book, copublished with the Mathematical Association of America (MAA), presents fifteen ""stories"" designed to acquaint readers with the central concepts of the theory of maxima and minima, as well as with its illustrious history. Unlike most AMS publications, the book is accessible to high school students and would likely be of interest to a wide variety of readers. In Part One, the author familiarizes readers with many concrete problems that lead to discussion of the work of some of the greatest mathematicians of all time. Part Two introduces a method for solving maximum and minimum problems that originated with Lagrange. While the content of this method has varied constantly, its basic conception has endured for over two centuries. The final story is addressed primarily to those who teach mathematics, for it impinges on the question of how and why to teach. Throughout the book, the author strives to show how the analysis of diverse facts gives rise to a general idea, how this idea is transformed, how it is enriched by new content, and how to remains the same in spite of these changes.",Mathematics,201,N/A,0,en

Numerical C,Philip Joyce,Apress,2019-09-20,"Learn applied numerical computing using the C programming language, starting with a quick primer on the C programming language and its SDK. This book then dives into progressively more complex applied math formula for computational methods using C with examples throughout and a larger, more complete application towards the end. Numerical C starts with the quadratic formula for finding solutions to algebraic equations that model things such as price vs. demand or rise vs. run or slip and more. Later in the book, you'll work on the augmented matrix method for simultaneous equations. You’ll also cover Monte Carlo method model objects that could arise naturally as part of the modeling of a real-life system, such as a complex road network, the transport of neutrons, or the evolution of the stock market. Furthermore, the Monte Carlo method of integration examines the area under a curve including rendering or ray tracing and the shading in a region.

Moments in Mathematics,"Henry J. Landau, American Mathematical Society",American Mathematical Soc.,1987,"Function theory, spectral decomposition of operators, probability, approximation, electrical and mechanical inverse problems, prediction of stochastic processes, the design of algorithms for signal-processing VLSI chips--these are among a host of important theoretical and applied topics illuminated by the classical moment problem. To survey some of these ramifications and the research which derives from them, the AMS sponsored the Short Course Moments in Mathematics at the Joint Mathematics Meetings, held in San Antonio, Texas, in January 1987. This volume contains the six lectures presented during that course. The papers are likely to find a wide audience, for they are expository, but nevertheless lead the reader to topics of current research. In his paper, Henry J. Landau sketches the main ideas of past work related to the moment problem by such mathematicians as Caratheodory, Herglotz, Schur, Riesz, and Krein and describes the way the moment problem has interconnected so many diverse areas of research. J. H. B. Kemperman examines the moment problem from a geometric viewpoint which involves a certain natural duality method and leads to interesting applications in linear programming, measure theory, and dilations. Donald Sarason first provides a brief review of the theory of unbounded self-adjoint operators then goes on to sketch the operator-theoretic treatment of the Hamburger problem and to discuss Hankel operators, the Adamjan-Arov-Krein approach, and the theory of unitary dilations. Exploring the interplay of trigonometric moment problems and signal processing, Thomas Kailath describes the role of Szego polynomials in linear predictive coding methods, parallel implementation, one-dimensional inverse scattering problems, and the Toeplitz moment matrices. Christian Berg contrasts the multi-dimensional moment problem with the one-dimensional theory and shows how the theory of the moment problem may be viewed as part of harmonic analysis on semigroups. Starting from a historical survey of the use of moments in probability and statistics, Persi Diaconis illustrates the continuing vitality of these methods in a variety of recent novel problems drawn from such areas as Wiener-Ito integrals, random graphs and matrices, Gibbs ensembles, cumulants and self-similar processes, projections of high-dimensional data, and empirical estimation.",Inequalities,170,3,1,en

Mathematics Learning in Early Childhood,"National Research Council, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Center for Education, Committee on Early Childhood Mathematics",National Academies Press,2009-11-13,"Early childhood mathematics is vitally important for young children's present and future educational success. Research demonstrates that virtually all young children have the capability to learn and become competent in mathematics. Furthermore, young children enjoy their early informal experiences with mathematics. Unfortunately, many children's potential in mathematics is not fully realized, especially those children who are economically disadvantaged. This is due, in part, to a lack of opportunities to learn mathematics in early childhood settings or through everyday experiences in the home and in their communities. Improvements in early childhood mathematics education can provide young children with the foundation for school success. Relying on a comprehensive review of the research, Mathematics Learning in Early Childhood lays out the critical areas that should be the focus of young children's early mathematics education, explores the extent to which they are currently being incorporated in early childhood settings, and identifies the changes needed to improve the quality of mathematics experiences for young children. This book serves as a call to action to improve the state of early childhood mathematics. It will be especially useful for policy makers and practitioners-those who work directly with children and their families in shaping the policies that affect the education of young children.",Education,399,N/A,0,en
Mathematics in Medicine and the Life Sciences,"Frank C. Hoppensteadt, Charles S. Peskin",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-03-09,"The aim of this book is to introduce the subject of mathematical modeling in the life sciences. It is intended for students of mathematics, the physical sciences, and engineering who are curious about biology. Additionally, it will be useful to students of the life sciences and medicine who are unsatisfied with mere description and who seek an understanding of biological mechanism and dynamics through the use of mathematics. The book will be particularly useful to premedical students, because it will introduce them not only to a collection of mathematical methods but also to an assortment of phenomena involving genetics, epidemics, and the physiology of the heart, lung, and kidney. Because of its introductory character, mathematical prerequisites are kept to a minimum; they involve only what is usually covered in the first semester of a calculus sequence. The authors have drawn on their extensive experience as modelers to select examples which are simple enough to be understood at this elementary level and yet realistic enough to capture the essence of significant biological phenomena drawn from the areas of population dynamics and physiology. Because the models presented are realistic, the book can serve not only as an introduction to mathematical methods but also as a mathematical introduction to the biological material itself. For the student, who enjoys mathematics, such an introduction will be far more stimulating and satisfying than the purely descriptive approach that is traditional in the biological sciences.",Mathematics,257,N/A,0,en
Encyclopaedia of Mathematics,Michiel Hazewinkel,Springer,1988-07-31,"This ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF MATHEMATICS aims to be a reference work for all parts of mathematics. It is a translation with updates and editorial comments of the Soviet Mathematical En cyclopaedia published by 'Soviet Encyclopaedia Publishing House' in five volumes in 1977 - 1985. The annotated translation consists of ten volumes including a special index volume. There are three kinds of articles in this ENCYCLOPAEDIA. First of all there are survey-type articles dealing with the various main directions in mathematics (where a rather fine subdivision has been used). The main requirement for these articles has been that they should give a reasonably complete up-to-date account of the current state of affairs in these areas and that they should be maximally accessible. On the whole, these articles should be understandable to mathe matics students in their first specialization years, to graduates from other mathematical areas and, depending on the specific subject, to specialists in other domains of science, engineers and teachers of mathematics. These articles treat their material at a fairly general level and aim to give an idea of the kind of problems, techniques and concepts involved in the area in question. They also contain background and motivation rather than precise statements of precise theorems with detailed definitions and technical details on how to carry out proofs and constructions. The second kind of article, of medium length, contains more detailed concrete problems, results and techniques.",Mathematics,508,N/A,0,en

In calling mathematics a science he implies that it has a factual subject-matter and that mathematical knowledge is on a par with other scientific knowledge; in calling it a science of patterns he expresses his commitment to a structuralist philosophy of mathematics. He links this to a defence of realism about the metaphysics of mathematics--the view that mathematics is about things that really exist. Resnik's distinctive philosophy of mathematics is here presented in an accessible and systematic form: it will be of value not only to specialists in this area, but to philosophers, mathematicians, and logicians interested in the relationship between these three disciplines, or in truth, realism, and epistemology.",Mathematics,300,N/A,0,en

It builds a story about the power of teachers, feedback, and a model of learning and understanding. The research involves many millions of students and represents the largest ever evidence based research into what actually works in schools to improve learning. Areas covered include the influence of the student, home, school, curricula, teacher, and teaching strategies. A model of teaching and learning is developed based on the notion of visible teaching and visible learning. A major message is that what works best for students is similar to what works best for teachers – an attention to setting challenging learning intentions, being clear about what success means, and an attention to learning strategies for developing conceptual understanding about what teachers and students know and understand. Although the current evidence based fad has turned into a debate about test scores, this book is about using evidence to build and defend a model of teaching and learning.

Psychology and Mathematics Education,"Gila Hanna, Laura Macchi, Karin Binder, Laura Martignon, Katharina Loibl",Frontiers Media SA,2023-09-05,"Modern Mathematics is constructed rigorously through proofs, based on truths, which are either axioms or previously proven theorems. Thus, it is par excellence a model of rational inquiry. Links between Cognitive Psychology and Mathematics Education have been particularly strong during the last decades. Indeed, the Enlightenment view of the rational human mind that reasons, makes decisions and solves problems based on logic and probabilities, was shaken during the second half of the twentieth century. Cognitive psychologists discovered that humans' thoughts and actions often deviate from rules imposed by strict normative theories of inference. Yet, these deviations should not be called ""errors"": as Cognitive Psychologists have demonstrated, these deviations may be either valid heuristics that succeed in the environments in which humans have evolved, or biases that are caused by a lack of adaptation to abstract information formats. Humans, as the cognitive psychologist and economist Herbert Simon claimed, do not usually optimize, but rather satisfice, even when solving problem. This Research Topic aims at demonstrating that these insights have had a decisive impact on Mathematics Education. We want to stress that we are concerned with the view of bounded rationality that is different from the one espoused by the heuristics-and-biases program. In Simon’s bounded rationality and its direct descendant ecological rationality, rationality is understood in terms of cognitive success in the world (correspondence) rather than in terms of conformity to content-free norms of coherence (e.g., transitivity).",Science,552,N/A,0,en

The Mathematical Heritage of Hermann Weyl,Raymond O'Neil Wells,American Mathematical Soc.,1988,"Hermann Weyl was one of the most influential mathematicians of the twentieth century. Viewing mathematics as an organic whole rather than a collection of separate subjects, Weyl made profound contributions to a wide range of areas, including analysis, geometry, number theory, Lie groups, and mathematical physics, as well as the philosophy of science and of mathematics. The topics he chose to study, the lines of thought he initiated, and his general perspective on mathematics have proved remarkably fruitful and have formed the basis for some of the best of modern mathematical research. This volume contains the proceedings of the AMS Symposium on the Mathematical Heritage of Hermann Weyl, held in May 1987 at Duke University. In addition to honoring Weyl's great accomplishments in mathematics, the symposium also sought to stimulate the younger generation of mathematicians by highlighting the cohesive nature of modern mathematics as seen from Weyl's ideas. The symposium assembled a brilliant array of speakers and covered a wide range of topics. All of the papers are expository and will appeal to a broad audience of mathematicians, theoretical physicists, and other scientists.",Mathematics,358,N/A,0,en

Math with Bad Drawings,Ben Orlin,Black Dog & Leventhal,2018-09-18,"A hilarious reeducation in mathematics-full of joy, jokes, and stick figures-that sheds light on the countless practical and wonderful ways that math structures and shapes our world. In Math With Bad Drawings, Ben Orlin reveals to us what math actually is; its myriad uses, its strange symbols, and the wild leaps of logic and faith that define the usually impenetrable work of the mathematician. Truth and knowledge come in multiple forms: colorful drawings, encouraging jokes, and the stories and insights of an empathetic teacher who believes that math should belong to everyone. Orlin shows us how to think like a mathematician by teaching us a brand-new game of tic-tac-toe, how to understand an economic crises by rolling a pair of dice, and the mathematical headache that ensues when attempting to build a spherical Death Star. Every discussion in the book is illustrated with Orlin's trademark ""bad drawings,"" which convey his message and insights with perfect pitch and clarity. With 24 chapters covering topics from the electoral college to human genetics to the reasons not to trust statistics, Math with Bad Drawings is a life-changing book for the math-estranged and math-enamored alike.",Mathematics,556,4,1,en

Mathematics for Human Flourishing,Francis Su,Yale University Press,2020-01-07,"Winner of the Mathematics Association of America's 2021 Euler Book Prize, this is an inclusive vision of mathematics—its beauty, its humanity, and its power to build virtues that help us all flourish“This is perhaps the most important mathematics book of our time. Francis Su shows mathematics is an experience of the mind and, most important, of the heart.”—James Tanton, Global Math Project""A good book is an entertaining read. A great book holds up a mirror that allows us to more clearly see ourselves and the world we live in. Francis Su’s Mathematics for Human Flourishing is both a good book and a great book.""—MAA Reviews For mathematician Francis Su, a society without mathematical affection is like a city without concerts, parks, or museums. To miss out on mathematics is to live without experiencing some of humanity’s most beautiful ideas.In this profound book, written for a wide audience but especially for those disenchanted by their past experiences, an award‑winning mathematician and educator weaves parables, puzzles, and personal reflections to show how mathematics meets basic human desires—such as for play, beauty, freedom, justice, and love—and cultivates virtues essential for human flourishing. These desires and virtues, and the stories told here, reveal how mathematics is intimately tied to being human. Some lessons emerge from those who have struggled, including philosopher Simone Weil, whose own mathematical contributions were overshadowed by her brother’s, and Christopher Jackson, who discovered mathematics as an inmate in a federal prison. Christopher’s letters to the author appear throughout the book and show how this intellectual pursuit can—and must—be open to all.",Mathematics,287,N/A,0,en

Overall, the anthology links evolutionary theory to form generation in both scientific and cultural domains. It offers a close look at the ways cells, organisms, and rules become generative in fields often otherwise disconnected. United by Thompson's original exploration of how physical forces propel and shape living and nonliving forms, essays range from art, art history, and neuroscience to architecture, design, and biology. Contributors explore how translations are made from the discipline of biology to the cultural arena. They reflect on how Thompson's study relates to the current sciences of epigenesis, self-organization, biological complex systems, and the expanded evolutionary synthesis. Cross-disciplinary contributors explore the wide-ranging aesthetic ramifications of these sciences.

Number Theory,,Academic Press,1986-05-05,"This book is written for the student in mathematics. Its goal is to give a view of the theory of numbers, of the problems with which this theory deals, and of the methods that are used. We have avoided that style which gives a systematic development of the apparatus and have used instead a freer style, in which the problems and the methods of solution are closely interwoven. We start from concrete problems in number theory. General theories arise as tools for solving these problems. As a rule, these theories are developed sufficiently far so that the reader can see for himself their strength and beauty, and so that he learns to apply them. Most of the questions that are examined in this book are connected with the theory of diophantine equations - that is, with the theory of the solutions in integers of equations in several variables. However, we also consider questions of other types; for example, we derive the theorem of Dirichlet on prime numbers in arithmetic progressions and investigate the growth of the number of solutions of congruences.",Mathematics,449,5,1,en

How to Write Mathematics,Norman Earl Steenrod,American Mathematical Soc.,1973-12-31,"This classic guide contains four essays on writing mathematical books and papers at the research level and at the level of graduate texts. The authors are all well known for their writing skills, as well as their mathematical accomplishments. The first essay, by Steenrod, discusses writing books, either monographs or textbooks. He gives both general and specific advice, getting into such details as the need for a good introduction. The longest essay is by Halmos, and contains many of the pieces of his advice that are repeated even today: In order to say something well you must have something to say; write for someone; think about the alphabet. Halmos's advice is systematic and practical. Schiffer addresses the issue by examining four types of mathematical writing: research paper, monograph, survey, and textbook, and gives advice for each form of exposition. Dieudonne's contribution is mostly a commentary on the earlier essays, with clear statements of where he disagrees with his coauthors. The advice in this small book will be useful to mathematicians at all levels.",Mathematics,76,N/A,0,en
Exploring Combinatorial Mathematics,"Oscar Levin, Richard Grassl",N/A,2019-08-15,"This mid-level combinatorics textbook was originally written to be used in a MA level course for current secondary math teachers. Topics have been selected to illustrate larger concepts of interest to secondary teachers, and would also be appropriate for an upper-level undergraduate course for future teachers. There is an emphasis on understanding simple concepts deeply and in more than one way. Although some topics intersect secondary curriculum, most of the questions here are at a higher level. Still, the problem solving strategies and big ideas illustrated by our questions have applications to secondary mathematics. This emphasis is quite different than other mid-level discrete and combinatorics textbooks, since the goal is not to prepare readers to begin a career in research mathematics. Little is assumed about the reader's previous work in the subject, beyond a general understanding of how abstract mathematics proceeds, as well as some basic ability with mathematical proof. For the reader completely unfamiliar with these and the basic objects of mathematical study (sets and functions), background material is included in an Appendix. While the book does not address how to teach mathematics, it tries to model good pedagogical practice. Almost all of the textbook consists of Activities and Exercises that guide readers to discover mathematics for themselves. This will require quite a bit more work, both from students and instructors, but the authors strongly believe that the best way to learn mathematics is by doing mathematics. Most of all, discovering mathematics is fun.",,306,N/A,0,en

Riemannian Geometric Statistics in Medical Image Analysis,"Xavier Pennec, Stefan Sommer, Tom Fletcher",Academic Press,2019-09-02,"Over the past 15 years, there has been a growing need in the medical image computing community for principled methods to process nonlinear geometric data. Riemannian geometry has emerged as one of the most powerful mathematical and computational frameworks for analyzing such data. Riemannian Geometric Statistics in Medical Image Analysis is a complete reference on statistics on Riemannian manifolds and more general nonlinear spaces with applications in medical image analysis. It provides an introduction to the core methodology followed by a presentation of state-of-the-art methods. Beyond medical image computing, the methods described in this book may also apply to other domains such as signal processing, computer vision, geometric deep learning, and other domains where statistics on geometric features appear. As such, the presented core methodology takes its place in the field of geometric statistics, the statistical analysis of data being elements of nonlinear geometric spaces. The foundational material and the advanced techniques presented in the later parts of the book can be useful in domains outside medical imaging and present important applications of geometric statistics methodology Content includes: - The foundations of Riemannian geometric methods for statistics on manifolds with emphasis on concepts rather than on proofs - Applications of statistics on manifolds and shape spaces in medical image computing - Diffeomorphic deformations and their applications As the methods described apply to domains such as signal processing (radar signal processing and brain computer interaction), computer vision (object and face recognition), and other domains where statistics of geometric features appear, this book is suitable for researchers and graduate students in medical imaging, engineering and computer science. - A complete reference covering both the foundations and state-of-the-art methods - Edited and authored by leading researchers in the field - Contains theory, examples, applications, and algorithms - Gives an overview of current research challenges and future applications",Computers,636,N/A,0,en

The Greatest Story Ever Told--So Far,Lawrence M. Krauss,Simon and Schuster,2017-03-21,"From award-winning physicist, public intellectual, and the bestselling author of A Universe from Nothing Lawrence Krauss, comes “a masterful blend of history, modern physics, and cosmic perspective that empowers the reader to not only embrace our understanding of the universe, but also revel in what remains to be discovered” (Neil deGrasse Tyson, American Museum of Natural History). In this grand poetic vision of the universe, Lawrence Krauss tells the dramatic story of the discovery of the hidden world that underlies reality—and our place within it. Reality is not what you think or sense—it’s weird, wild, and counterintuitive, and its inner workings seem at least as implausible as the idea that something can come from nothing. With his trademark wit and accessible style, Krauss leads us to realms so small that they are invisible to microscopes, to the birth and rebirth of light, and into the natural forces that govern our existence. His unique blend of rigorous research and engaging storytelling invites us into the lives and minds of remarkable scientists who have helped unravel the unexpected fabric of reality with reasoning rather than superstition and dogma, and to explain how everything we see—and can’t see—came about. A passionate advocate for reason, Krauss gives the rationale for the seemingly irrational—and the mysteries and apparent contradictions of quantum physics, and explores what that means for our lives here on Earth—and beyond. At its core, The Greatest Story Ever Told—So Far is about the best of what it means to be human—an epic history of our ultimately purposeless universe that addresses the question, “Why are we here?”",Science,336,N/A,0,en

Foundations of Analysis,Joseph L. Taylor,American Mathematical Soc.,2012,"Foundations of Analysis has two main goals. The first is to develop in students the mathematical maturity and sophistication they will need as they move through the upper division curriculum. The second is to present a rigorous development of both single and several variable calculus, beginning with a study of the properties of the real number system. The presentation is both thorough and concise, with simple, straightforward explanations. The exercises differ widely in level of abstraction and level of difficulty. They vary from the simple to the quite difficult and from the computational to the theoretical. Each section contains a number of examples designed to illustrate the material in the section and to teach students how to approach the exercises for that section. --Book cover.",Mathematics,411,N/A,0,en

Philosophy of Mathematics,,Elsevier,2009-07-08,"One of the most striking features of mathematics is the fact that we are much more certain about the mathematical knowledge we have than about what mathematical knowledge is knowledge of. Are numbers, sets, functions and groups physical entities of some kind? Are they objectively existing objects in some non-physical, mathematical realm? Are they ideas that are present only in the mind? Or do mathematical truths not involve referents of any kind? It is these kinds of questions that have encouraged philosophers and mathematicians alike to focus their attention on issues in the philosophy of mathematics. Over the centuries a number of reasonably well-defined positions about the nature of mathematics have been developed and it is these positions (both historical and current) that are surveyed in the current volume. Traditional theories (Platonism, Aristotelianism, Kantianism), as well as dominant modern theories (logicism, formalism, constructivism, fictionalism, etc.), are all analyzed and evaluated. Leading-edge research in related fields (set theory, computability theory, probability theory, paraconsistency) is also discussed. The result is a handbook that not only provides a comprehensive overview of recent developments but that also serves as an indispensable resource for anyone wanting to learn about current developments in the philosophy of mathematics.-Comprehensive coverage of all main theories in the philosophy of mathematics-Clearly written expositions of fundamental ideas and concepts-Definitive discussions by leading researchers in the field-Summaries of leading-edge research in related fields (set theory, computability theory, probability theory, paraconsistency) are also included",Philosophy,735,N/A,0,en

Quantum Field Theory: A Tourist Guide for Mathematicians,Gerald B. Folland,American Mathematical Soc.,2021-02-03,"Quantum field theory has been a great success for physics, but it is difficult for mathematicians to learn because it is mathematically incomplete. Folland, who is a mathematician, has spent considerable time digesting the physical theory and sorting out the mathematical issues in it. Fortunately for mathematicians, Folland is a gifted expositor. The purpose of this book is to present the elements of quantum field theory, with the goal of understanding the behavior of elementary particles rather than building formal mathematical structures, in a form that will be comprehensible to mathematicians. Rigorous definitions and arguments are presented as far as they are available, but the text proceeds on a more informal level when necessary, with due care in identifying the difficulties. The book begins with a review of classical physics and quantum mechanics, then proceeds through the construction of free quantum fields to the perturbation-theoretic development of interacting field theory and renormalization theory, with emphasis on quantum electrodynamics. The final two chapters present the functional integral approach and the elements of gauge field theory, including the Salam–Weinberg model of electromagnetic and weak interactions.",Education,342,N/A,0,en

Elementary Concepts of Topology,Paul Alexandroff,Courier Corporation,1961-06-01,"Alexandroff's beautiful and elegant introduction to topology was originally published in 1932 as an extension of certain aspects of Hilbert's Anschauliche Geometrie. The text has long been recognized as one of the finest presentations of the fundamental concepts, vital for mathematicians who haven't time for extensive study and for beginning investigators. The book is not a substitute for a systematic text, but an unusually useful intuitive approach to the basic concepts. Its aim is to present these concepts in a clear, elementary fashion without sacrificing their profundity or exactness and to give some indication of how they are useful in increasingly more areas of mathematics. The author proceeds from the basics of set-theoretic topology, through those topological theorems and questions which are based upon the concept of the algebraic complex, to the concept of Betti groups which binds together central topological theories in a whole and upon which applications of topology largely rest. Wholly consistent with current investigations, in which a larger and larger part of topology is governed by the concept of homology, the book deals primarily with the concepts of complex, cycle, and homology. It points the way toward a systematic and entirely geometrically oriented theory of the most general structures of space. First English translation, prepared for Dover by Alan E. Farley.

A Biologist's Guide to Mathematical Modeling in Ecology and Evolution,"Sarah P. Otto, Troy Day",Princeton University Press,2011-09-19,"Thirty years ago, biologists could get by with a rudimentary grasp of mathematics and modeling. Not so today. In seeking to answer fundamental questions about how biological systems function and change over time, the modern biologist is as likely to rely on sophisticated mathematical and computer-based models as traditional fieldwork. In this book, Sarah Otto and Troy Day provide biology students with the tools necessary to both interpret models and to build their own. The book starts at an elementary level of mathematical modeling, assuming that the reader has had high school mathematics and first-year calculus. Otto and Day then gradually build in depth and complexity, from classic models in ecology and evolution to more intricate class-structured and probabilistic models. The authors provide primers with instructive exercises to introduce readers to the more advanced subjects of linear algebra and probability theory. Through examples, they describe how models have been used to understand such topics as the spread of HIV, chaos, the age structure of a country, speciation, and extinction. Ecologists and evolutionary biologists today need enough mathematical training to be able to assess the power and limits of biological models and to develop theories and models themselves. This innovative book will be an indispensable guide to the world of mathematical models for the next generation of biologists.

TEACHING AND LEARNING WITH EMERGING TECHNOLOGY: A Future Perspective,"Dr. P. Muthukumar, Dr. A.R.S. Kannan, Dr. K. Malini",Shanlax Publications,N/A,"This edited book focuses on the possible education responses that can be implemented in future education times. The impact of technology on learning and teaching is often at the forefront of demands, particularly from those who dictate the funding available to pay for technology within education systems. This is not an unreasonable request and there is merit in impact evaluations of educational technologies including emergingtechnologies. Besides, it also shows how emerging technologies, including Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Educational Games and Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality, will reshape the future of education to provide efficient learning/teaching experiences and assessments. Furthermore, the book discusses innovative teaching and learning approaches (e.g., the use of open educational practices and peer-to-peer learning) that can be applied in this rapidly moving technological era to maintain education, including in unconditional times. Particularly, new instructional methods, such as game-based learning, should be designed based on integrated technologies to provide an effective learning experience, resulting in better learning outcomes. Future education should not solely focus on technology and psychology, but also on the applied instructional methods, as well as the human touch to maintain authentic and effective learning experiences. The book also discusses how teaching and learning can be designed to meet the growing tendency of Open and Distance Education, where thousands of learners can be taken the same course from different cultures, backgrounds and learning needs. This book aims to establish itself, through the published books/textbooks and research, as a medium to provide guidelines and recommendations for different stakeholders, including policymakers, educational designers, teachers, and students on how to enhance both learning and teaching experiences in the future for better learning outcomes, as well as how to maintain education in emergency times. It also provides one step ahead towards future education to prepare different stakeholders for the rapid evolution of education, even in times of emergency and difficult situations.",Education,338,N/A,0,en

Mathematical Models for Dental Materials Research,"Alex Fok, Hooi Pin Chew",Springer Nature,2020-02-24,"This book presents a mechanistic approach—mathematical modeling—for carrying out dental materials research. This approach allows researchers to go beyond the null hypothesis and obtain a solution that is more general and therefore predictive for conditions other than those considered in a study. Hence it can be used either on its own or to complement the commonly used statistical approach. Through a series of practical problems with wide-ranging application, the reader will be guided on: How to construct a mathematical model for the behavior of dental materials by making informed assumptions of the physical, chemical, or mechanical situation How to simplify the model by making suitable simplifications How to calibrate the model by calculating the values of key parameters using experimental results How to refine the model when there are discrepancies between predictions and experiments Only elementary calculus is required to follow the examples and all the problems can be solved by using MS Excel© spreadsheets. This is an ideal book for dental materials researchers without a strong mathematical background who are interested in applying a more mechanistic approach to their research to give deeper insight into the problem at hand. Advance praise for Mathematical Models for Dental Materials Research: “This is a nice addition for research students on how to conduct their work and how to manage data analysis. It brings together a number of important aspects of dental materials investigations which has been missing in the literature. The practical examples make it much easier to understand.” – Michael F. Burrow, Clinical Professor in Prosthodontics, The University of Hong Kong “The great strengths of this volume are the real world examples of dental materials research in the successive chapters.

Mathematics Education Research: A Guide for the Research Mathematician,Curtis C. McKnight,American Mathematical Soc.,2000,"Mathematics education research in undergraduate mathematics has increased significantly in the last decade and shows no signs of abating in the near future. Thus far, this research has often been associated with innovations in curriculum such as calculus reform, statistics education, and the use of computational and graphing technology in instruction. Mathematics education research, carefully conducted, is something far more fundamental and widely useful than might be implied by its use by the advocates of innovation in undergraduate mathematics education. Most simply, mathematics education research is inquiry by carefully developed research methods aimed at providing evidence about the nature and relationships of many mathematics learning and teaching phenomena. It seeks to clarify the phenomena, illuminate them, explain how they are related to other phenomena, and explain how this may be related to undergraduate mathematics course organization and teaching. This book-the collaborative effort of a research mathematician, mathematics education researchers who work in a research mathematics department and a professional librarian-introduces research mathematicians to education research. The work presents a non-jargon introduction for educational research, surveys the more commonly used research methods, along with their rationales and assumptions, and provides background and careful discussions to help research mathematicians read or listen to education research more critically. This guide is of practical interest to university-based research mathematicians, as it introduces the methodology of quantitative and qualitative research in education; provides critical guidelines for assessing the reliability and validity of mathematics education research; and explains how to use online database resources to locate education research. The book will also be valuable to graduate students in mathematics who are planning academic careers, and to mathematics department chairs and their deans.",Education,120,N/A,0,en

Introduction to Mathematics for Life Scientists,E. Batschelet,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"A few decades ago mathematics played a modest role in life sciences. Today, however, a great variety of mathematical methods is applied in biology and medicine. Practically every mathematical procedure that is useful in physics, chemistry, engineering, and economics has also found an important application in the life sciences. The past and present training of life scientists does by no means reflect this development. However, the impact ofthe fast growing number of applications of mathematical methods makes it indispensable that students in the life sciences are offered a basic training in mathematics, both on the undergraduate and the graduate level. This book is primarily designed as a textbook for an introductory course. Life scientists may also use it as a reference to find mathematical methods suitable to their research problems. Moreover, the book should be appropriate for self-teaching. It will also be a guide for teachers. Numerous references are included to assist the reader in his search for the pertinent literature.",Mathematics,657,N/A,0,en
World of Patterns,Rens Bod,JHU Press,2022-05-10,"A comprehensive account of the methods of knowledge production throughout human history and across the globe. The idea that the world can be understood through patterns and the principles that govern them is one of the most important human insights—it may also be our greatest survival strategy. Our search for patterns and principles began 40,000 years ago, when striped patterns were engraved on mammoths' bones to keep track of the moon's phases. What routes did human knowledge take to grow from these humble beginnings through many detours and dead ends into modern understandings of nature and culture? In this work of unprecedented scope, Rens Bod removes the Western natural sciences from their often-central role to bring us the first global history of human knowledge. Having sketched the history of the humanities in his ground-breaking A New History of the Humanities, Bod now adopts a broader perspective, stepping beyond classical antiquity back to the Stone Age to answer the question: Where did our knowledge of the world today begin and how did it develop? Drawing on developments from all five continents of the inhabited world, World of Patterns offers startling connections. Focusing on a dozen fields—ranging from astronomy, philology, medicine, law, and mathematics to history, botany, and musicology—Bod examines to what degree their progressions can be considered interwoven and to what degree we can speak of global trends. In this pioneering work, Bod aims to fulfill what he sees as the historian's responsibility: to grant access to history's goldmine of ideas. Bod discusses how inoculation was invented in China rather than Europe; how many of the fundamental aspects of modern mathematics and astronomy were first discovered by the Indian Kerala school; and how the study of law provided fundamental models for astronomy and linguistics from Roman to Ottoman times. The book flies across continents and eras. The result is an enlightening symphony, a stirring chorus of human inquisitiveness extending through the ages.",History,396,N/A,0,en

Refining the Mathematics Knowledge Base,Bindu Elizabeth Pothen,Stanford University,2011,"Understanding the knowledge that teachers must bring to their classrooms is critical to the advancement of the field of teacher education. Understanding how teacher knowledge impacts various aspects of teacher practice is also critical. Understanding the interplay between teacher knowledge and practice, and consequently the result that this relationship has on student learning is most important. This dissertation attempts to advance our collective understanding of the complex relationship between teacher knowledge, teacher practice, and student learning in the field of elementary mathematics. Four third-grade teachers were followed as they taught a subset of lessons in a unit on fractions. The study first investigates the types of knowledge that the teachers brought to their classrooms. Then, an examination is conducted of the way in which these types of knowledge impacted their teaching practice. Finally, the student learning that resulted over the course of these lessons is discussed. This study supports the widespread belief that teacher knowledge is important to instruction. The descriptions of the case study teachers highlight that their varying levels of knowledge resulted in unique aspects of practice being emphasized in their classrooms. This dissertation documents the differences in teaching practice and the trade-offs that produce differences in student learning. Interesting student learning patterns emerged, based on qualitative student interviews. Medium students from classrooms in which teachers focused for more sustained periods on mathematical concepts seemed to demonstrate greater procedural fluency and deeper conceptual understanding than their peers in the other classrooms. Low students in classrooms where fluency was the focus seemed to show slightly greater procedural fluency, though less conceptual understanding, than their peers in the classrooms that spent more time on concepts. High students showed no appreciable difference across all classrooms. This study adds to the field by introducing a new construct, the conceptual threshold, to offer an explanation of these student learning trends.",,253,N/A,0,en

Fields Medallists' Lectures,"Michael Atiyah, Daniel Iagolnitzer",World Scientific,1997-10-13,"Although the Fields Medal does not have the same public recognition as the Nobel Prizes, they share a similar intellectual standing. It is restricted to one field - that of mathematics - and an age limit of 40 has become an accepted tradition. Mathematics has in the main been interpreted as pure mathematics, and this is not so unreasonable since major contributions in some applied areas can be (and have been) recognized with Nobel Prizes. The restriction to 40 years is of marginal significance, since most mathematicians have made their mark long before this age.A list of Fields Medallists and their contributions provides a bird's eye view of mathematics over the past 60 years. It highlights the areas in which, at various times, greatest progress has been made. This volume does not pretend to be comprehensive, nor is it a historical document. On the other hand, it presents contributions from 22 Fields Medallists and so provides a highly interesting and varied picture.The contributions themselves represent the choice of the individual Medallists. In some cases the articles relate directly to the work for which the Fields Medals were awarded. In other cases new articles have been produced which relate to more current interests of the Medallists. This indicates that while Fields Medallists must be under 40 at the time of the award, their mathematical development goes well past this age. In fact the age limit of 40 was chosen so that young mathematicians would be encouraged in their future work.The Fields Medallists' Lectures is now available on CD-ROM. Sections can be accessed at the touch of a button, and similar topics grouped together using advanced keyword searches.",Mathematics,644,N/A,0,en

Engineering Mathematics with Examples and Applications,Xin-She Yang,Academic Press,2016-12-29,"Engineering Mathematics with Examples and Applications provides a compact and concise primer in the field, starting with the foundations, and then gradually developing to the advanced level of mathematics that is necessary for all engineering disciplines. Therefore, this book's aim is to help undergraduates rapidly develop the fundamental knowledge of engineering mathematics. The book can also be used by graduates to review and refresh their mathematical skills. Step-by-step worked examples will help the students gain more insights and build sufficient confidence in engineering mathematics and problem-solving. The main approach and style of this book is informal, theorem-free, and practical. By using an informal and theorem-free approach, all fundamental mathematics topics required for engineering are covered, and readers can gain such basic knowledge of all important topics without worrying about rigorous (often boring) proofs. Certain rigorous proof and derivatives are presented in an informal way by direct, straightforward mathematical operations and calculations, giving students the same level of fundamental knowledge without any tedious steps. In addition, this practical approach provides over 100 worked examples so that students can see how each step of mathematical problems can be derived without any gap or jump in steps. Thus, readers can build their understanding and mathematical confidence gradually and in a step-by-step manner. - Covers fundamental engineering topics that are presented at the right level, without worry of rigorous proofs - Includes step-by-step worked examples (of which 100+ feature in the work) - Provides an emphasis on numerical methods, such as root-finding algorithms, numerical integration, and numerical methods of differential equations - Balances theory and practice to aid in practical problem-solving in various contexts and applications",Mathematics,402,1,1,en

International Perspectives on Gender and Mathematics Education,"Olof Steinthorsdottir, Helen J. Forgasz, Joanne Rossi Becker, Kyeonghwa Lee",IAP,2010-06-01,"Why a book on gender issues in mathematics in the 21st century? Several factors have influenced the undertaking of this project by the editors. First, an international volume focusing on gender and mathematics has not appeared since publication of papers emerging from the 1996 International Congress on Mathematical Education (Keitel, 1998). Surely it was time for an updated look at this critical area of mathematics education. Second, we have had lively discussion and working groups on gender issues at conferences of the International Group for the Psychology of Mathematics Education [PME] for the past four years, sessions at which stimulating and ground-breaking research has been discussed by participants from many different countries. Some publication seemed essential to share this new knowledge emerging from a wider variety of countries and from different cultural perspectives. Third, some western countries such as Australia and the USA have experienced in recent years a focus on the “boy problem,” with an underlying assumption that issues of females and mathematics have been solved and are no longer worthy of interest. Thus it seemed timely to look more closely at the issue of gender and mathematics internationally. When the idea for this volume first emerged, invitations were issued to those regularly attending the working and discussion groups at PME. Potential authors were charged to focus on gender issues in mathematics and were given wide scope to hone in on the issues that were central to their own research efforts, or were in receipt or in need of close attention in their own national or regional contexts.",Education,467,N/A,0,en

A Most Elegant Equation,David Stipp,Hachette UK,2017-11-07,"An award-winning science writer introduces us to mathematics using the extraordinary equation that unites five of mathematics' most important numbers Bertrand Russell wrote that mathematics can exalt ""as surely as poetry."" This is especially true of one equation: ei(pi) + 1 = 0, the brainchild of Leonhard Euler, the Mozart of mathematics. More than two centuries after Euler's death, it is still regarded as a conceptual diamond of unsurpassed beauty. Called Euler's identity or God's equation, it includes just five numbers but represents an astonishing revelation of hidden connections. It ties together everything from basic arithmetic to compound interest, the circumference of a circle, trigonometry, calculus, and even infinity. In David Stipp's hands, Euler's identity formula becomes a contemplative stroll through the glories of mathematics. The result is an ode to this magical field.",Mathematics,204,N/A,0,en
Euclidean Geometry in Mathematical Olympiads,Evan Chen,American Mathematical Soc.,2021-08-23,"This is a challenging problem-solving book in Euclidean geometry, assuming nothing of the reader other than a good deal of courage. Topics covered included cyclic quadrilaterals, power of a point, homothety, triangle centers; along the way the reader will meet such classical gems as the nine-point circle, the Simson line, the symmedian and the mixtilinear incircle, as well as the theorems of Euler, Ceva, Menelaus, and Pascal. Another part is dedicated to the use of complex numbers and barycentric coordinates, granting the reader both a traditional and computational viewpoint of the material. The final part consists of some more advanced topics, such as inversion in the plane, the cross ratio and projective transformations, and the theory of the complete quadrilateral. The exposition is friendly and relaxed, and accompanied by over 300 beautifully drawn figures. The emphasis of this book is placed squarely on the problems. Each chapter contains carefully chosen worked examples, which explain not only the solutions to the problems but also describe in close detail how one would invent the solution to begin with. The text contains a selection of 300 practice problems of varying difficulty from contests around the world, with extensive hints and selected solutions. This book is especially suitable for students preparing for national or international mathematical olympiads or for teachers looking for a text for an honor class.",Education,329,N/A,0,en

This first volume focuses primarily on algebraic questions: categories and functors, groups, rings, modules and algebra. Notions are introduced in a general framework and then studied in the context of commutative and homological algebra; their application in algebraic topology and geometry is therefore developed. These notions play an essential role in algebraic analysis (analytico-algebraic systems theory of ordinary or partial linear differential equations). The book concludes with a study of modules over the main types of rings, the rational canonical form of matrices, the (commutative) theory of elemental divisors and their application in systems of linear differential equations with constant coefficients. - Part of the New Mathematical Methods, Systems, and Applications series - Presents the notions, results, and proofs necessary to understand and master the various topics - Provides a unified notation, making the task easier for the reader. - Includes several summaries of mathematics for engineers",Mathematics,270,N/A,0,en

The Alphabet Not Unlike the World,Katrina Vandenberg,Milkweed Editions,2012-07-03,"In her highly ambitious second collection of poems, Katrina Vandenberg takes her inspiration from the alphabet. A meditation on the hump of a camel, and what it hides. A reminder that tomatoes belong to the nightshade family, and a vision of the plant as Adam’s downfall. The Book of Kells, gold-leafed and extravagantly decorated by monks. Titled for letters of the Phoenician alphabet, and employing such innovative forms as the ancient ghazal, these poems are richly grounded in objects both humble and exotic. Vandenberg explores the intersection of power and forgiveness, and deciphers the seemingly indecipherable in emotionally poignant ways. “What will protect us?” one poem asks. “The words will be our weapons. In the end.” Moving between the physical and the abstract, the individual and the collective, The Alphabet Not Unlike the World unearths meaning—with astonishing beauty—from the pain of loss and separation.",Poetry,105,N/A,0,en

Everyday Calculus,Oscar E. Fernandez,Princeton University Press,2017-03-07,"A fun look at calculus in our everyday lives Calculus. For some of us, the word conjures up memories of ten-pound textbooks and visions of tedious abstract equations. And yet, in reality, calculus is fun and accessible, and surrounds us everywhere we go. In Everyday Calculus, Oscar Fernandez demonstrates that calculus can be used to explore practically any aspect of our lives, including the most effective number of hours to sleep and the fastest route to get to work. He also shows that calculus can be both useful—determining which seat at the theater leads to the best viewing experience, for instance—and fascinating—exploring topics such as time travel and the age of the universe. Throughout, Fernandez presents straightforward concepts, and no prior mathematical knowledge is required. For advanced math fans, the mathematical derivations are included in the appendixes. The book features a new preface that alerts readers to new interactive online content, including demonstrations linked to specific figures in the book as well as an online supplement.

Geometric Constructions,George E. Martin,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Geometric constructions have been a popular part of mathematics throughout history. The first chapter here is informal and starts from scratch, introducing all the geometric constructions from high school that have been forgotten or were never learned. The second chapter formalises Plato's game, and examines problems from antiquity such as the impossibility of trisecting an arbitrary angle. After that, variations on Plato's theme are explored: using only a ruler, a compass, toothpicks, a ruler and dividers, a marked rule, or a tomahawk, ending in a chapter on geometric constructions by paperfolding. The author writes in a charming style and nicely intersperses history and philosophy within the mathematics, teaching a little geometry and a little algebra along the way. This is as much an algebra book as it is a geometry book, yet since all the algebra and geometry needed is developed within the text, very little mathematical background is required.

It is for teachers, principals, superintendents, school leaders and policymakers. For too long, many children have not achieved their best potential in mathematics at both primary and secondary schools. Although scholarly interest in students' attitudes towards mathematics and achievement in mathematics has increased, there is scant research which explores the explanatory potential of Bourdieu's trilogy of habitus, cultural capital and social field in investigating students' attitudes towards mathematics. The content is based on a rich empirical study of 1106 students aged 14-16 and gives a detailed account drawing on both quantitative and qualitative data to show the intersection of social class, gender and ethnicity on students' aspiration, attitudes towards mathematics and mathematical achievement at GCSE in secondary schools in England.",Education,304,N/A,0,en

Theory and Practice: An Interface or A Great Divide? The Mathematics Education for the Future Project – Proceedings of the 15th International Conference,"Alan Rogerson, Janina Morska",WTM-Verlag Münster,N/A,"This volume contains the papers presented at the International Conference on Theory and Practice: An Interface or A Great Divide? and held from August 4-9, 2019 at Maynooth University, Kildare, Ireland. The Conference was organized by The Mathematics Education for the Future Project – an international educational project founded in 1986 and dedicated to innovation in mathematics, statistics, science and computer education world-wide. Oouder, Fouze Abu; Amit, Miriam: Incorporating Ethnomathematical Research in Classroom Practice – The Case of Geometrical Shapes in Bedouin Traditional Embroidery. pp 1 – 4 Ethnomathematics asserts that in addition to the formal mathematics taught in schools, there are other forms of mathematics, which have been taught in different societies and cultures around the world. Research and educational experience has shown that combining ethnomathematics with the formal mathematics curriculum in the classroom can improve students’ academic achievement, since it strengthens their self-image and reinforces their motivation for studying mathematics. We adopted this approach with Bedouin students who are defined as ‘underachievers’ in national mathematics tests. In this paper, we offer an ethnomathematical analysis of Bedouin embroidery samples taken from traditional dresses made by Bedouin women. We then describe how ethnomathematical elements were incorporated in the teaching of mathematics for Bedouin students, and how doing so contributed to their learning. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.01 Adams, Nadine; Hayes, Clinton: Providing Synchronous Mathematics Instruction to Distance Students- Workshop. pp 5 – 8 In theory technology breaks down boundaries and allows us to more easily connect to our students. But in practice despite all of the technology available mathematics instruction is still best given in a “talk and chalk” format. The use of instructional videos, where the student is able to watch handwritten instruction, has become standard. These are great in that they provide asynchronous instruction and allow the student to learn at a time that suits them. What these videos lack is the interactive component that makes face-toface teaching preferable. To overcome this online lectures are conducted using a combination of Zoom, PDF Annotator and a Tablet PC. Students are provided with an experience much closer to that of face-to-face. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.02 Adenegan, Kehinde Emmanuel: Managing Pupils with Dysgraphia in Early Child Numeracy. pp 9 – 13 Dysgraphia is a specific learning difficulty which is a brain-based disorder that impacts on writing skills whereby affected individuals have difficulty with forming letters, writing figures, spacing words and even organizing text into complete sentences. Early child numeracy is a competence built in the young child at an early childhood stage in the mathematical skills needed to cope with everyday life and an understanding of information presented mathematically. To this end, this paper presents dysgraphia, its symptoms in pupils, offers measures on how to manage dysgraphia pupils by teachers and parents and highlights strong recommendations to assist such pupils in performing and competing favourably in Mathematics and other subjects with other pupils in the classroom.

Specific ways of thinking necessary in modeling are identified by contrasting Pólya’s general problem-solving framework, which may be familiar worldwide. These ways of thinking are developed through mathematical activities that promote dispositions for eventual success in modeling. We posit that mathematical modeling thinking (MMT) is necessary for building modeling competency. This paper describes MMT and illustrates how it can be developed through a well-known problem of universal human cultural greeting exchange. While connecting to world cultures, we examine ways to promote MMT practices such as making useful simplifications, looking for patterns, utilizing multiple representations, mathematizing the situation, and reflecting on the solution. We conclude with practical ways to effect MMT as the foundation for developing mathematical modeling competency. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.04 Ashleigh, Glenda Jean: Individual Differences in Cognition and Affect in Multiplicative Knowledge in Basic Mathematics Problems. pp 20 – 25 This paper discusses the roles that individual differences in cognitive and affective variables play in the formation of increasingly complex multiplicative knowledge structures in basic mathematics problems. The effectiveness of learner strategies and teaching strategies to optimise the development of authentic multiplicative knowledge will vary according to these individual differences. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.05 Banach, Katarzyna: Ok Notebook as an Untypical Form of Student´s Notebook – Own Experience. pp 26 – 28 In recent years, the methods of work at the Polish school have been evaluated. From the Prussian school model, we are slowly moving to the model of a modern school meeting contemporary challenges. At the present time, much attention is devoted to the search for new working methods and teaching tools. We draw on the experience of other countries. We test our own solutions. This paper deals with the use of formative assessment in association with the untypical formula of a student’s notebook. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.06 Bateiha, Summer; Mir, Sadia: Engaging with Mathematics through Three Types of Storytelling. pp 29 – 33 Throughout history, storytelling has been used as a way to appeal to people’s imagination and emotions. When stories are told in the mathematics classroom, the subject comes to life. Students begin to understand the purpose of learning the content, and mathematics becomes something greater than a plethora of irrelevant facts and formulas that are meant to be memorized, applied, and repeated. This workshop focuses on the use of storytelling as a way to engage students in a nontraditional and pertinent form of learning mathematics. In this session, participants will listen to stories used with predominantly Arab students in an American university in Qatar and partake in doing mathematical tasks related to the stories presented. Although the stories in this workshop were applied in an Arab context, the ideas can be edited for use in any cultural context. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.07 Bedwell, Mike: Freedom of Speech. pp 34 – 35 This paper rues the fact that submissions to some academic journals are treated increasingly badly by the publishers, with little succour offered by the editor. The writer gives an example where changes in terminology, spelling and punctuation were introduced after the paper had been accepted by the peer appraisers. This paper also argues for rigid ruling on the graphical presentation of quantitative data, such as the dimensionless labelling of the axes in Cartesian graphs, and the default rule for ordering the nominal variables on a bar-chart. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.08 Bentley, Brianna: College Studens´ Views of Fraction Arithmetic. pp 36 – 41 College students view mathematics, specifically fraction arithmetic, as a series of tricks that can lead them to the correct answer. This view of mathematics is a direct reflection of their lack of conceptual understanding of fraction arithmetic and their reliance on procedural understanding. College students have an imprecise remembrance of fraction arithmetic and instead rely on tricks they vaguely remember and cannot explain. This reliance on procedural processes that they do not fully understand causes them to make mistakes in their arithmetic. If we do not require students to think critically about the mathematical processes they are completing when first taught a subject and require this critical thought as students progress through mathematics courses, mathematics loses meaning and our students will not have the ability to think critically or conceptually about mathematics. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.09 Betts, Paul; et al: Foundational Experiences as a Design Principle for Mathematics Curriculum for Children. pp 42 – 47 Students must make sense of the mathematics they are learning, if they are to understand it. When students are encountering a mathematics topic primarily through that topic’s mathematical forms—its symbols, terminology, definitions, operations, and algorithms—the richness, potency, and completeness of their understanding will depend on their prior, pre-formal experiences with that topic. Foundational experiences activities enable students to construct images, patterns, and ideas—in a word, memories—that will enable them to see the sensibility of the topic’s mathematical forms when they learn them. We invite participants to explore some examples of instructional activities designed to provide foundational experiences for multiplication. What are the qualities that we should invest in foundational experience activities? How can such activities be positioned within curriculum design, with the goal of increasing the quality of students’ understandings of mathematics topics, in pursuit of success for all participants in school math? https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.10 Billings, Esther; Kasmer, Lisa: Learning via Teaching: Examples of Mediated Field Experiences in Early Coursework of Pre-Service Teachers. pp 48 – 53 Twenty years ago, Ball and Cohen (1999) described a vision for practicebased professional education in which teachers’ learning is situated within practice. We have purposefully designed practice-based educational experiences early in teacher preparation coursework around McDonald et al.’s (2013) learning cycle to include mediated field experiences. Such experiences are structured to explicitly connect coursework and fieldwork and are organized around core practices; preservice teachers (PSTs) deepen their learning of mathematics and ways to teach mathematics by doing the work of teachers within authentic K-12 classroom settings. In this paper we describe examples of mediated field experiences structured on McDonald et al.’s (2013) learning cycle that occur early in PSTs‘ coursework, prior to student teaching. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.11 Brahier, Daniel J.: Research into Practice: 29 Years of Classroom Teaching. pp 54 – 59 The preparation and professional development of mathematics teachers requires instructors who are not only proficient in their content and pedagogy but can bring successful teaching experiences to the classroom. In this paper, the author shares his experience of 29 years of simultaneously teaching in a K-12 secondary school, while also serving as a university professor who teaches mathematics methods courses. Examples of classroom experiences that enhanced university methods courses are described, as are some of the benefits of teaching in both settings to connect research and practice in mathematics teaching. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.12 Browning, Sandra: Elementary Preservice Teachers and Questioning Strategies in Mathematics. pp 60 – 65 Research has demonstrated an interest in the relationship between teachers’ questioning strategies and children’s ability to reason and learn (Baroody & Ginsburg, 1990; Buschman, 2001; Fennema, Franke, Carpenter & Carey, 1993). Helping preservice teachers develop effective questioning strategies is an important component of a teacher education program. This session describes an exploration designed to determine if EC-6 preservice teachers can (a) recognize effective questioning strategies when observing inservice teachers and (b) use Hess’s Cognitive Rigor Matrix to analyze the level and effectiveness of their own questioning strategies during field experiences. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.13 Burrill, Gail: Statistical Literacy and Quantitative Reasoning. pp 66 – 71 Given a world awash with data, students of today will be consumers of statistical information whatever their future. What can we do to make them critical consumers as articulated by researchers such as Gal and Steen and as suggested in the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics Catalyzing Change, able to process information, ask the right questions and make informed decisions? This paper explores what it means to be statistically literate able to reason with quantitative information in today’s world and why it is important from both a personal and professional perspective. Examples from several fields illustrate features of essential core concepts that should be components of the curriculum for all students if we are to have statistically literate citizens capable of thinking and reasoning in quantitative situations. The discussion will also address some of the challenges we face in making this recommendation a reality. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.14 Cametti, Cristina; et al: Advantages, Challenges and Opportunities in Teaching Statistics in Doctoral Training to a Heterogeneous Group: the Case of FLAMES Summer School. pp 72 – 77 FLAMES is an inter-university doctoral training network in which all Flemish universities of Belgium collaborate. It aims to support young researchers, in need of methodological and statistical insights and skills, by offering them high quality training at basic, intermediate and advanced levels. One of our most successful activities is a yearly two-week summer school which features a range of modules on research design, statistical methodology and data analysis. Each module connects theory with hands-on exercises, focusing on various disciplines and using different software packages. In this paper, we discuss the FLAMES approach in teaching statistics to a heterogeneous group of young researchers from various disciplines with a different background in statistics and methodology. FLAMES’ ‘measuring is knowing’ principle is used to evaluate the content, applicability and educational aspects of the current modules and to receive suggestions for future topics. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.15 Castro Miguez, Luis Alexander; et al: Diagrammatic Reasoning from Reflections on Peircean Semiotics. pp 78 – 83 The document illustrates some elements of reflection on Peirce’s semiotics focused on reasoning through diagrams. The solution of a Euclidean geometry problem is taken as a reference in which mathematical diagrams are recognized as epistemological tools in the learning and teaching of geometry. This is how an interpreter, who systematically observes and experiments with a geometric diagram, generates different interpretants by means of abductive, inductive and deductive reasoning. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.16 Chapman, Olive; Babb, Paulino Preciado: Prospective Secondary Mathematics Teachers´ Development of Knowledge of Modelling for Teaching. pp 84 – 89 Given the growing attention on modelling in school mathematics curriculum, prospective teachers are likely to need special help to develop a rich sense of mathematical modelling [MM] and effective classroom practices to support students’ development of MM competencies. This paper is based on a study involving the use of inquiry-based activities to engage prospective secondary mathematics teachers [PTs] in developing such knowledge of MM for teaching. Participants were students in a mathematics education course. Data sources included course work and field notes. We report findings related to the inquirybased activities and the learning they afforded in the participants’ understanding of specific components of problem-solving [PS] and MM knowledge for teaching and the relationship between them. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.17 Chin, Kin Eng; Jiew, Fui Fong: Misconceptions or Preconceptions in Making Sense of Decimals. pp 90 – 95 This paper aims to explore the root causes of students’ misconceptions in decimals. A set of decimal tasks and follow-up interviews were used to gather the relevant data. Eight Year Six primary school students participated in this study on a voluntary basis. In this paper, data collected from two students were reported because they showed qualitatively distinct responses and could cover the spectrum of responses of this group of participants. Findings revealed that students’ misconceptions maybe regarded as preconceptions that were developed from work experiences in other contexts such as integers. This shows that the learning experiences from other contexts may impede future learning of students in new contexts. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.18 Civil, Marta; Hunter, Roberta: Supporting Mathematics Teachers to Build Deep Understandings of the Home Contexts of their Students. pp 96 – 99 Teachers face many challenges in meeting the cultural diversity they encounter in current mathematics classrooms. To avoid marginalisation of specific groups of students we advocate for a strength-based approach in which teachers are supported to build deep understandings of the lived home context of their students. We discuss findings from our research projects with immigrant students (Pāsifika) in New Zealand and with Mexican American students in the United States. While our contexts are quite different, our approaches have much in common, in particular through their focus on teachers learning from and about their students’ communities to then build on this learning in their mathematics teaching. Bridging theory and practice, we share specific strategies that we have used to support teachers as learners of their students’ home contexts (e.g., home visits; parents’ classroom visits; school meetings led by parents). https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.19 Clemmer, Katharine; et al: Collaborative Solution Discovery: A Problem Solving Process. pp 100 – 103 Loyola Marymount University (LMU) has developed a new approach to problem solving, Collaborative Solution Discovery (CSD), to help practitioners in a school system leverage their individual passions in a way that grows students’ positive math identity through mathematical thinking, problem solving, and self-regulation. By focusing on how students and teachers interact with each other in real-time in an ideal classroom, practitioners take ownership of a process to guide their students in growing their positive math identity and thus taking ownership of their own math learning. Practitioners measure progress along the way through metrics that are created, defined, used, and continually refined by themselves to attain their ideal math learning environment. The entire CSD process results in a system that owns ist improvement efforts—improvement efforts that are flexible, adaptable, and sustainable. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.20 Coggins, Porter; et al: The Mathematical Culture of Ojibwe Students – An Ethnographic Study. pp 104 – 109 Human beings have an innate capacity to communicate, count, detect patterns, locate, and create. With these capacities we invent, design, play, and explain. Regardless of academic background, we also have the innate capacity to use mathematics in meaningful ways. However, in spite of this innate capacity, there is a large disconnect between innate function and success in academic mathematics. Our research is based on interviews of 14 Ojibwe-identifying tribal college students. The instrument was constructed based on Bishop’s (1988) set of six universals or activities people have always done. We present the development of the instrument, interview process, and initial findings. Findings include common ethnomathematical threads found among the interviewed students. Our goal is to use this research to improve ourpreK-12 professional education teacher program and positively impact Ojibwe student learning. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.21 Collins, Ken: Using CAS to Improve Student Understanding of Calculus Concepts. pp 110 – 114 This session will explore two areas of application of CAS: one focusing on how teachers can improve student learning using CAS, the other focusing on how students can use CAS directly to help them improve their understanding of calculus concepts. We will illustrate the first area by sharing some examples of calculus teaching lessons that use CAS to help students understand or apply a particular concept. We will illustrate the second area by sharing some examples of student explorations that utilize CAS. These allow students to explore some relationships and applications we use in calculus that would be difficult to do otherwise. For example, the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) is one of the most important theorems in calculus. Many first year calculus students have difficulties really understanding or applying the MVT. Using CAS, a student can explore how to apply the MVT to a differentiable function and develop a better understanding of the MVT and its graphical interpretation. This session will focus on first year calculus topics. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.22 Curry, Marjorie: Culturally Responsive Math. pp 115 – 117 Using the Ready for Rigor framework, Zaretta Hammond’s book Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain: Promoting Authentic Engagement and Rigor Among Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Students gives educators a neuroscience-based approach to closing the achievement gap. The Ready for Rigor framework consists of four strands: awareness, learning partnerships, information processing, and community building. Acknowledging that all four strands are paramount to culturally responsive teaching but restricting focus to information processing, this session will give participants examples of and strategies for making their mathematics lessons more culturally responsive. More specifically, participants will learn to game-ify it, story-ify it, and make it social. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.23 Czarnocha, Bronislaw: Constructivist Teaching Experiment: Constructivist Research and Constructivist Teaching. pp 118 – 123 The aim of the discussion is twofold: first, we formulate and present examples of the creative bisociativity inherent in teaching-research TR/NYCity model (Section 1). Second, we bring the creative model of teaching-research as the precise solution to the difficulties experienced by Common Curriculum Standards in Mathematics (CCSM). Section 2 analyzes the reason for extraordinary difficulties in successful introduction of the curriculum into practice, which manifest themselves among others, by the necessity of scripted lessons telling teachers exactly what to do in all different moments of the lesson time. The root reason for the contemporary difficulties is the absence of teachers involvement in the design process It is in contradiction with the irreducible presence of teaching within the central constructivist instrument of research- constructivist teaching experiment of Cobb and Steffe (1983). https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.24 Das, Mili: Curriculum for Mathematics Education – An Approach to Discuss Relation Between Theory and Practice. pp 124 – 129 A new curriculum has been introduced in Teachers’ Training course as the course is shifted from one year to two-year course in West Bengal, a state of India. In this curriculum in each course-paper theory and practicum are given equal importance so is in mathematics education also. In this new approach most of the educational experiences in mathematics education, gathered by the trainees are set and organized by combining theory and practicum. So, instead of only theory in this paper relationship is discussed on intertwined function of theory and practicum with practice. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.25 De Lange, Jan: Curious Minds: Serious Play. pp 130 – 135 We describe the background, theory, implementation and results so far of the Curious Minds Project, carried out by seven Dutch and Belgian Universities. The present article focuses on the Utrecht University’s involvement and results. Issues addressed are: hypothesis, role of manipulatives (toys), designing student activities from pre-primary to primary, creativity and curiosity, the role of adults and the challenges for professional development.

The goal of this project is to develop students’ skills to understand and interpret graphs, tables, Math concepts as absolute value and percent change by showing them how Math is connected with real life issues. Also, is to engage students with the topic and through that how to use their Math knowledge of reading tables, complete tables, calculate the absolute and percent change, construct and interpret graphs. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.27 Dick, Thomas P.; Pilgrim, Mary E.: Learning (and Learning Teaching) by Doing Problems. pp 139 – 144 Active learning is often a challenge to find in mathematics classrooms at the post-secondary level. Still, teachers are expected to be experts in studentcentered approaches despite not having experiences with such approaches as students. The aim of this workshop is to introduce participants to a totally problem-based instructional experience, with the opportunity to actively engage in mathematics as students. During the workshop, participants will engage in discourse and reflection – reflection on both mathematics as well as the impact such a problem-based instructional experience could have on their practice. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.28 Dorrington, Pam: Family Maths: Experiential Learning. pp 145 – 149 The international Family Maths programme adopts an inquiry teaching and learning approach and it encourages learners, often from diverse backgrounds, to participate fully in the learning process. The programme also aims to develop the vocabulary necessary for meaningful communication in mathematics, develop problem solving skills and increase confidence and enjoyment of mathematics. The programme has proven to be a powerful catalyst in this regard and holds important lessons for both curriculum development and developing positive attitudes towards mathematics teaching and learning. This experiential learning, interactive work-session focuses on primary school mathematics curricula (for pupils approximately 9 – 13 years of age) and aims at giving participating conference delegates an opportunity to engage with and experience some of the hands-on problem solving activities used in the Family Maths programme. Discussion will be encouraged around the relevance of these activities for the teaching and learning of mathematics. Our conference organisers encourage presenters to consider the relationship between research and classroom teaching, and how, and if, these relate to each other in practice. Can the Family Maths philosophy and practice be a catalyst in narrowing the divide between the theory and practice of effective mathematics teaching and learning? https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.29 Ferrarello, Daniela; et al: Serious Games in Teaching/learning Mathematics: the Experience of FunGo. pp 150 – 155 In this paper we present a general overview of serious games and their educational potential. We focus in particular on serious games for the teaching/learning of mathematics, highlighting how the method of horizontal teaching is effective in enabling students to achieve the learning objectives set by the teacher. FunGo, a serious game designed by the authors (researchers in mathematics education) in synergy with a group of graphic designers and computer scientists, is part of this line of ideas. We will show how FunGo has a multiple usability: it has, in fact, a double didactic use and has been used in public events of dissemination of mathematics, reporting in both cases positive results. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.30 Fine, Benjamin; et al: The Impact of Mathematics and Mathematicians. pp 156 – 160 The 1600’s ushered in our modern world, but not in the way most people learn in school. There was a revolution; started by Kepler, continued by Galileo, Descartes and Fermat and culminating in Newton and Leibniz. This revolution allowed for the development of modern mathematics which in turn led to modern science and engineering to advance. Hence, the technological revolution occurred which has shaped our present-day existence much more than anything else. In this article we examine these developments during the amazing seventeenth century. We keep an eye on the fact that for whatever reason human beings for the most part seem not to do hard engineering until the hard science is developed and not to do the hard science until the correct mathematics has been discovered. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.31 Fox, Courtney: Clean Water for Women and Children. pp 161 – 163 This workshop gives participants an outline of a full unit in Trigonometry that covers right triangle trigonometry, the law of sines, and the law of cosines. Attendees will participate in abbreviated student tasks. In the unit students are introduced to the world water crisis and how it affects women and children the most and why this is. Using their knowledge of trigonometry and the Desmos (or other graphing) calculator to “solve” a water crisis in a town and bring clean sanitation to a remote island. This unit helps students develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, numerical literacy, and global awareness. Students make connections to the “real world” using mathematics and become world citizens. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.32 Galluzzo, Ben; Kavanagh, Katie: Getting Started Getting Students Modeling: Designing and Facilitating Open-ended Math Modeling Experiences. pp 164 – 167 “Modeling” is a term that has several meanings in general, but particularly in mathematics. Here math modeling refers to the process of creating a mathematical representation of a real-world scenario to make a prediction or provide insight. There is a distinction between using a formula that arises from an application (for example, distance equals rate times time) and the actual creation of a mathematical relationship itself that can be useful in an applied setting. In this two part workshop, we demonstrate how to develop authentic math modeling challenge problems that are accessible and relevant to students. In the second part of the workshop we talk about how to facilitate math modeling so that students have an opportunity to be creative and innovative in their modeling process while having ownership over their solution. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.33 Gazit, Avikam: Mathe Teachers´ Attitudes toward integrating Humor in Math Lessons. pp 168 – 172 The purpose of this study was to examine the attitudes mathematics teachers toward integrating humor in math lessons. Mathematics and humor are not seen as consistent with each other. Mathematics is seen as a subject is difficult to understand and its subject matter is isolated without any humanistic elements. Integrating humor in math lessons may create a pleasant atmosphere and reduce math anxiety. Humor can increase motivation as well as promoting creative thinking. A sample of 25 math teachers, most of them from elementary schools, answered a questionnaire. An important conclusion to be drawn from the findings is the positive attitudes of the teachers regarding the integration of humor in math lessons. It recommended strengthen math teacher to integrate humor in their lessons. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.34 Gill, Eoin: Maths Week Ireland: Promoting a Positive Attitude to Mathematics in Ireland. pp 173 – 176 Maths Week Ireland is an annual festival established in 2006 by people in the STEM community as an all-island event including the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Particular effort is made to highlight maths for life, for careers and as part of our culture. While the core principle is “Maths for All” the main engagement is with schools. In 2018 teachers reported 354,000 primary and second level pupils participating through in-school activities, online activities and events at partner centres. Maths Week creates an opportunity to disseminate new ideas in maths education. It also creates a space whereby teachers can try out new ideas and invent and create new activities with their pupils. This paper describes the organisation and activities of Maths Week and discusses the impact of the initiative with particular reference to evaluation with teachers. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.35 Goodell, Joanne E.: Learning to Teach Mathematics Through Project-Based Instruction. pp 177 – 182 Project-based instruction (PBI) is gaining prominence in the USA as an instructional innovation that promotes deep and connected understanding in mathematics. In this paper, I describe a program developed at the University of Texas at Austin known as UTeach that is being replicated in 45 universities across the USA. Concepts of inquiry teaching, problem-based and projectbased instruction are developed across the program. In this paper I argue that the structure, timing and location of student teaching impacts whether or not pre-service teachers are able to implement PBI during student teaching, which in turn impacts satisfaction with the student teaching experience and ultimately the intention to enter and continue in the teaching profession. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.36 Gordon, John; et al: A Problem-Solving Approach to the Introduction to Ordinary Differential Equations for Undergraduate Students at an American Two-year College. pp 183 – 188 Undergraduate students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) at City University of New York (CUNY)-Queensborough Community College (QCC) working toward a baccalaureate degree at one of CUNY’s senior colleges are required to take an introductory course in ordinary differential equations (ODE). Faculty in the Mathematics Department at QCC are experimenting with a problem-solving approach to this course in which students engage in learning course material through the development of mathematical models of real-world problems. The results seem promising and we outline them in this paper.

The students were mathematics student teachers. The main goal of the course was to demonstrate the potential of digital technologies in teaching mathematics and to provide the students with basic skills in the intellectual use of these technologies. During the course the students, after getting acquainted with various mathematical software packages, build and present their own teaching units. We were interested to analyse the students’ attitudes towards the course. A multiple-choice questioner was formulated, and the collected data were analysed. We observed that most of the students found the course being helpful for their future teaching. The obtained results indicated that the described course provided them a didactic model to emulate. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.39 Hansen, Heidi B.; Magiera, Marta T.: Working Together: A Cross-cultural Study Addressing Mathematics Anxiety in K-8 Pre-service Teachers. pp 199 – 204 This study will present data from research on K-8 pre-service teachers’ math anxiety across three universities: one public, one private and one non-U.S. The article discusses background rationale, literature, tools used and results of this study. The results of the study indicated that similar math anxiety levels exist in students in all three types of academic institutions. The paper also incorporates discussion of the importance of including the topic in pre-service teacher training, and possible interventions for alleviating math anxiety. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.40 Hansen-Smith, Bradford: Why the Circle cannot be Squared. pp 205 – 210 Squaring the circle using compass and straight edge in such a way that both have the same area is not possible. The question is, why not? Math logic assumes there must be an area equal to both. Presumably there is a need to make these very different 2-D shapes equal, possibly to find a geometric proof to an inverse mathematical concept about differences. To “square the circle” gives preference to the square, four straight lines and four 90° angles, over a single line of the circle without angles. Maybe the emphasis more correctly is about the relationship of difference. Logically the truncation process suggests the circle is origin to the square, meaning there can be no polygon equal to the circle. Folding the circle gives a unique perspective about the relationship of circle to square, revealing 90° to be an angle of change, of directional movement between two points before any construction of a fixed angle or measuring of lines and areas. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.41 Herrelko, Janet M.: Change the Paradigm of Solitary Lesson Planning to Collaborative Planning that Unites Research and Practice. pp 211 – 216 Teachers are planning mathematics lessons using a basic protocol created in the 17th century. The results of the Programme for International Student Assessment provide evidence that this is not a successful approach to teaching students mathematical concepts today. Research in cognitive sciences has established how people attend to, sort, and store new content. Educational research provides case studies of successful pedagogical methods that help students learn. It is time for mathematics educators to unite these resources to create integrated lessons that focus on problem solving with experiential learning. This is a proposal to have teachers integrate educational and cognitive research creating lessons that improve access and equity to help students learn mathematics. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.42 Horwitz, Kenneth: Utilizing Analytics to show Representations used in Comparing and Ordering Unit Fractions. pp 217 – 222 Video Analytics bring together the world of educational research and classroom teaching with technology and the internet. Through use of more than 4500 hours of video data, an open source analytic creation tool, this study creates a video analytic that supports a research paper. In addition to supporting research, analytics can be a reflective tool for teachers, as well as support professional development as all levels. This report illustrates the video analytic, Using Meredith’s models to reason about comparing and ordering unit fractions, (Horwitz, 2015, available at http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.7282/T33J3FQG), as well as the methods used in the creation of the analytic used to support research in student use of representations to make sense of fractions. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.43 Huang, Hsin-Mei E.; et al: Investigating Junior High School Students´ Length Estimation Ability and Strategies. pp 223 – 228 This study investigated junior high school students’ length estimation ability with respect to everyday objects with lengths between 1 millimetre and 1 meter. Students’ strategies used for estimating the length of the longer side of a basketball court in school were analysed. A total of 240 Grade 7-9 students from cities in northern Taiwan completed a paper-and-pencil test assessing length estimation abilities. Results showed a significant gender effect on length estimation, but neither effects of grade level nor any interaction between grade level and gender on length estimation. About 40% of the students used effective strategies for estimating length measures, including visualizing, utilizing body parts, applying previous experiences, using a mental ruler, and making use of objects nearby. Still, about 60% of the students used ineffective strategies such as guessing. Implications for research and education practices are discussed. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.44 Humarán Martínez, Yuitza T.: Using Manipulatives to Develop the Understanding of the Concept of the Fraction of Preservice Elementary Teachers: The Meaning of Measure. pp 229 – 234 Manipulatives are a tool when that well-implemented can contribute to the development of mathematical concepts and processes, and is a popular strategy in elementary school. However, educators usually don’t use this technique efficiently for several reasons. For example, they had never used manipulatives before starting to work at school. In this quasi-experimental research, the understanding of preservice elementary school teachers of the concept of the fraction, specifically, the meaning of measure, was studied. Statistically significant evidence was gathered to conclude that the understanding of the meaning of measure improves after the implementation of the lesson with tangible manipulatives. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.45 Hydorn, Debra L.: Tools for Modern Mathematics: A Course to Introduce Experimental Mathematics. pp 235 – 239 The accessibility of computational methods and resources has made it easier to include undergraduates in mathematical research projects. However, based on the traditional form of mathematics education, many students aren’t confident in developing their own research questions or conjectures. Originally created to introduce students to programming tools (R, Mathematica and MATLAB), this course has evolved into an introduction to experimental mathematics. Students first learn the fundamentals of programming along with algorithmic structures and methods of simulation. Then, following the approach used by the Summer Undergraduate Research Institute in Experimental Mathematics at Michigan State University, students participate in (1) an experimental phase, where they use algorithms and simulations to produce output, (2) a conjecture phase, where they review their output to identify potential relationships and patterns, and (3) a 2nd experimental phase where additional output is produce to determine if any of their conjectures are still viable. The focus of the course is on developing students’ ability to pose research questions and their ability to use computational tools to address those questions. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.46 Iji, Clement O.; Andortan, Joseph A.: Brandishing Ethno-Mathematics Approach as an Interface for Improving Upper Basic Education (UBE) Students´ Interest and Achievement in Number and Numeration. pp 240 – 244 The study considered how ethno-Mathematics approach could be brandished to serve as an interface to improving UBE students’ interest and achievement in number and numeration (NN). The study was carried out in Obudu, a rural community in Cross River State of Nigeria. It adopted a quasi-experimental of pre-test post-test control groups design with intact classes used. Population of study comprised all the 6,226 upper basic education students from the 23 government controlled basic education schools in the study area. Two instruments were used for data collection. The study found among other things that when ethnomathematics was properly brandished, the UBE students improved in their interest and achievement in the NN concepts taught during the period of this study. It was also found that the initial noted gap between the male and female UBE students’ interest and achievement in NN was drastically reduced.

According to this theory, students have to experience patterns of variation for learning to take place. This paper highlights the patterns of variation that can be found in the work of the “Mathematics in the City” (MitC) project. Some examples are presented, and a research question is proposed related to using VT as a tool to analyze students’ learning in the MitC classrooms. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.48 Jackson, Colin: Going Against the Grain: Critical Thinking in and Beyond Mathematics. pp 251 – 256 In the UK, it is almost universal that secondary mathematics is taught in classes organised on the basis of differential ‘ability’: all-attainment teaching is rare. This paper is based on data collected from in-depth interviews with a small number of teachers whose beliefs and practices defy this norm. A number of themes emerged in their teaching, but in this paper I explore, very briefly, how the teachers enacted their belief in the importance of developing their students’ critical thinking skills as well as their mathematics. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.49 Jiew, Fui Fong; Chin, Kin Eng: The Embodiment of Mathematical Meanings with Special Reference to Multiplication: Issues and Challenges. pp 257 – 262 This paper aims to illustrate how two primary school teachers (Doreen and Edwin – pseudonyms) make sense of mathematics in particular the multiplication of fractions and decimals. The meaning of a particular mathematical expression and symbol could be conveyed through language however a mathematical procedure that is performed for a purpose may be difficult to make sense sometimes. Data were collected through semistructured interviews. Findings revealed that Doreen recognised the meaning of multiplication as the notion “of” in the contexts of fractions. Both of them rote learned the mathematical procedures in the multiplication of fractions and decimals and they could not make sense of them. One of the main reasons for this was because they were not aware of the changes of mathematical meanings across different contexts. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.50 Johnston, Peter; et al: Supporting Transition for Mathematics and Science Students under an Assumed Knowledge Approach. pp 263 – 268 In Australia there is concern over the poor mathematical skills of students entering University STEM degrees (King & Cattlin, 2015). Challenged by the introduction of an assumed knowledge approach for mathematics dependent university degrees, we noted diagnostic testing approaches (Ní Fhloinn et al., 2014) and sought to adapt the successful GetSet2 quiz that previously had been applied only to pre-requisite mathematics university entry (Burton et al., 2013). We introduced the on-line self-assessment Get Ready Maths/Science quizzes for commencing science and mathematics students. This allowed students to receive timely personalised feedback on their level of knowledge and skills compared with the expected assumed/pre-requisite knowledge for university entry. This paper reviews the design, development and initial implementation of transition quizzes under the challenges of an assumed knowledge framework, instead of a pre-requisite framework. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.51 Johnston-Wilder, Sue; Lee, Clare: How can we Address Mathematics Anxiety more Efficiently as a Community? pp 269 – 274 Mathematics anxiety has been discussed for over 60 years. The majority of those suffering belong to an identifiable subgroup, often identified as ‘female’, or learners with a ‘feeling’ rather than a ‘thinking’ preference, or empathisers. These learners prefer to understand the value, meaning, purpose and narrative of the mathematical tools they are required to learn. Ten years ago, we planted a seed for a change in practices that engender anxiety to those that build a positive stance. This seed has grown into a group of teacher and research practitioners working to overcome mathematics anxiety and build mathematical resilience. The paper discusses what is known, by these researchers and teachers, and how to develop innovative communication in order to work internationally toward elimination of the acquired, disabling condition of mathematics anxiety. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.52 Kaino, Luckson Muganyizi: Enhancing Mathematical Modeling Activities in Classroom Instruction. pp 275 – 280 The ability of students in mathematical modeling was enhanced through activities that involved systems of linear equations with two variables. Students involved were in form four, at the final year of the ordinary secondary school level where they were expected to have mastered the knowledge on systems of linear equations with two variables. Students’ knowledge on ill-conditioned linear systems was explored as well as their knowledge on practical problems in linear equations. Then after, mathematics subject teachers guided students to identify practical problems in linear equations of two variables. Students were put into groups to think of problems in real life and come up with solutions. The solutions were related to the real situations in the environment and each group had to make a presentation in the class. Problems in transportation, manufacturing, production and diet were identified by students and the results presented for discussion. It came out clearly that students acquired knowledge on solving real life problems at the end of the activities. Before these activities, students had theoretical knowledge on solving problems with two unknowns without relating these to real life problems. While knowledge on independent and inconsistent systems was known to students, enthusiasm was noted among students at the end of the activities when they got involved in real aspects of solutions obtained. It was concluded that with more time availed in the school curricula, students can acquire useful knowledge on mathematical modeling to achieve problem-thinking skills that involve real life situations. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.53 Kania, Sylwia: Solving Mathematical Problems in the Context of Some Obstacles between Teachers and Students. pp 281 – 286 Great mathematical discoveries are mostly based on huge knowledge of their explorers and long, solid work leading slowly to the finding. There are also well known cases of the “accidental” discoveries that happened quickly, intense and their founders did not even realize the range of the discovery, because they were working on something else at the time. Nevertheless, each finding requires energy, devotion and concentration of its discoverer. Solving mathematical problems demands quite the same things, thus teachers may find some opportunities to create curious, open-minded young discoverers. It is not an easy job to do though, because there is a great risk of killing pupils’ enthusiasm by teacher’s skepticism, there is a large chance to nip pupils’ energy in the bud by routine operations and there is a huge possibility to discourage pupils’ endeavors by giving them wrong-chosen problems to solve. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.54 Kennedy, Tierney: Exploring the Nature of Teacher Questioning withing Challenging Tasks for Inducing Conceptual Change. pp 287 – 292 Recent research has considered how to support teachers using challenging tasks in mathematicswith students who struggle. Teacher questioning in response to correct or incorrect answers has been identified as an important element for maintaining the cognitive load. This paper examines the nature of teacher questioning within challenging tasksin which struggling students were noted to change their own conceptionsand proposes a minor change to includea questioning phasewithin the Launch-Explore-Summarise structure by Lappan et al. (2006). It presents evidence from a two-year study in which the combination of conceptual change questioning with challenging tasks led to substantial gains for low-performing students across six primary schools on standardised tests compared with Education Department expectations (d = 0.7). https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.55 Klymchuk, Sergiy; Wilson, David: Integrating Pen-enabled Tablet PCs in Teaching Engineering Mathematics. pp 293 – 298 The paper analyses the attitudes and experiences of two university lecturers involved in integrating pen-enabled Tablet PCs (penTPCs) in teaching engineering mathematics. The first lecturer has an engineering background and teaches an advanced engineering mathematics course (year four). The second lecturer has a mathematics background and teaches a second year engineering mathematics course. Two rounds of interviews with the lecturers on using penTPCs were conducted in 2015 and 2019. Analysis of these interviews suggests that, for the lecturer in mathematical disciplines, a key factor in their initial adoption of penTPC technology may be their perception of the usefulness of the technology in enhancing delivery within the context of existing pedagogical approaches in a classroom/lecture setting. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.56 Krevisky, Steve: Using Sports Data in Statistics and Math Classes: An Overview and Update. pp 299 – 300 Sports data can be a very good way to motivate students, in both statistics and math classes.

The following four perspectives are discussed: (1) Proportion of the tasks related to the real world via the introduction of new learning content (2) Proportion of problem solving exercises related to the real world (3) Categorization of the situation of the tasks and problems related to the real world (4) Appearance of socially open-ended problems and their content. As a result, we found that there are few problems which are related directly to the real world in the Mozambican primary mathematics textbooks. The content of the problems related to the real world are about the tax system and salaries, which means students are given opportunities to view and think mathematically about their social system right from the primary school age. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.58 Laskasky, Katie; et al: Innovative Problem Solving: What happens when Math Education, Business, and Engineering Perspectives Interact. pp 306 – 311 For years, practitioners and researchers have attempted to solve the same math education problem. Though the approach varies, they use outdated processes and see few results. Thus, there is an overall need to use new strategies. This paper explores how one K-12 school district uses an innovative, collaborative, problem solving process to understand its math learning problem. Stakeholders engage diverse viewpoints, use researchbased recommendations to define success in how students learn mathematics, develop context-sensitive solution options, and evaluate those options’ adaptability. This innovative problem solving process’ foundation emerges from research and best practice recommendations found at the intersection of multiple disciplines: math education, business, systems engineering, and implementation science. The current observation and interview data indicate that stakeholders feel a sense of ownership, embrace variability in problem solving, and understand how to collect data about students’ math learning. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.59 Lemieux, Collette; Roettger, Eric: Students´ Reasoning During a Calculus Two-Stage Exam. pp 312 – 317 For a two-stage exam, students first write their exam individually and then repeat it in a small group. This study analyzed the discussions that students had during the group stage of a two-stage exam in a first-year calculus course in order to investigate students’ reasoning and how they arrived at their answers. Data, consisting of 14 transcripts of audio-recordings of the students’ discussions, were analyzed qualitatively, guided by Lithner’s (2007) conceptual framework on mathematical reasoning. The results suggest that, though students primarily used imitative reasoning or rote learning to answer many questions, they also demonstrated creative reasoning by using a novel & plausible approach and grounding their reasoning in mathematics. Further, though the imitative reasoning relied primarily on remembering a theorem or term in calculus, creative reasoning was demonstrated in multiple ways. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.60 Corredor, Olga León; et al: Integrating Technology and Didactic Resources for Enhancing Learning Processes. An Exploratory Study. pp 318 – 323 Some limitations that affect the learning of mathematics are related to two dysfunctional issues: lack of acknowledgment of students‘ differences in the didactic designs and of the students’ awareness about their learning skills. Accessible and affective didactic designs aim to overcome such dysfunctional issues. In this direction, the document presents three contributions: first, the exploration of technological relationships that foster cognitive convergence between the student and tools; second, a revision of hypotheses that give support to accessible and affective didactic designs; and third, the documentation of the learning trajectories that some diverse Colombian populations made while they were playing the game called The Jumper.

In the western world, the ancient Greek philosopher, Socrates (469 – 399 B.C.) had utilized IBL to engage his interlocutors in dialogue for discovering basic truth and principles. In the Eastern world, the ancient Chinese philosopher and educator Confucius (551 -479 B.C.) had also raised the idea of IBL approach for teaching and learning. Confucius had said: “I hear, I forget; I see, I remember; I do, I understand”. Active learning is the essence of IBL way of teaching. The IBL discussed in the paper is guided IBL. In the research literature, many research showed evidence that guided IBL produced better learning outcomes comparing to pure lecture approach. In recent years, promoting IBL in the field of education becomes a trend, because researchers believe that the features of IBL can fulfill the 21st century education through cultivating students’ critical and creative thinking, nurturing inquiry mind of problem-solving, and preparing life-long learners, for our society. However, in reality, the traditional way of teaching – lecture is still dominated at school teaching. Why has IBL been promoted in the educational research but most teachers still never employ it in their teaching practice yet? In this paper, I will discuss the challenging we are facing and propose some ideas for IBL implementation. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.62 Lipovec, Alenka; Ferme, Jasmina: Some Factors Influencing Effectiveness of Mathematics Homework. pp 330 – 335 Empirical research, which examines the relationship between mathematical achievement of elementary school students and mathematics homework assignments, gives inconsistent results. We present the results of the crosscultural study (N = 1061) with 12-15 years old students from Slovenia, Croatia and Slovakia. The results show that homework frequency, teacher responses, and the support of parents are not related to students’ mathematics achievements; but parental control and the time spent doing homework are negatively related to those achievements. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.63 Lousis, Michael: Recommendations for Instructional Designers and Textbook Writers Concerning the Correction of Significant and Pesistent Errors in Arithmetic and Algebra. pp 336 – 342 An error analysis of the 200 English and 150 Greek learners’ tests in arithmetic and algebra was accomplished. Those tests stemmed from the Kassel Project. Following this error analysis, specific recommendations are presented in each domain of arithmetic and algebra that should be taken into account by instructional designers and textbook writers. These recommendations were founded on terms of psychology and cognitive science as applied to information-processing. The study has shown the educational media (textbooks etc.), as being responsible for the emergence and persistence of these errors in the learners’ minds too, since instruction is mostly based on the use of those media. Key words: error analysis, Kassel Project, textbooks, educational media, recommendations. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.64 Marchand, Patricia: Interface between Theoretical Guidelines and Classroom Practices to Create Activities that Enhance the Development of Spatial Reasoning in Elementary School. pp 343 – 346 The spatial reasoning has been identified by many researchers as being linked to positive mathematical performance and, therefore, is a determining factor in mathematics and scientific success at elementary, secondary and upper levels (Davis & The spatial reasoning study group, 2015). Also, spatial reasoning has been proven to be a type of reasoning that is malleable and can be develop, implying that teachers are empowered in this development (Moss, Bruce, Caswell, Flynn & Hawes, 2016; Wai, Lubinski & Benbow, 2009; Marchand, 2009a; Berthelot & Salin, 1992). The goal of this workshop is to expose theoretical guidelines to analyse and to create classroom activities focusing on developing spatial reasoning in elementary school. The interface between these theoretical guidelines and classrooms activities allows us to unfold new ideas to deal with spatial reasoning at the elementary level. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.65 Markun, Urska; Kos, Jasna: Research Work in a Secondary School Classroom: How Well are Teachers Equipped for it? pp 347 – 352 A university degree is not enough in itself to equip a mathematics teacher for successful secondary school-teaching in the longer term. Without continuous training and career-long learning, a teacher will not be able to provide adequate support for students in activities such as extended essays or explorations, both of which are compulsory components of the IB programme. In this paper, we present some examples of such work by IB students at our school. In addition, some Slovenian secondary school students regularly participate in a national research competition for which they must submit project-based work in various fields. The present article describes how university departments co-operated with our secondary school in the course of such research. Examples of research carried out by a number of 16-year-old students at our school are also presented here. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.66 Mart, Malgorzata: The Impact of Teacher Self-Efficacy on the Level of Implementation of Graphing Technology in Teaching Factoring Quadratic Functions in Introductory Algebra. pp 353 – 357 The purpose of the study was to determine whether there is a relationship between self-efficacy of global and local algebra teachers and their level of incorporating technology in teaching factoring quadratic functions to introductory algebra students. The participants (54 mathematics educators form 15 countries and five continents) replied to the UVGIA survey instrument. Quantitative analysis of data brought the conclusion that there is a strong positive relationship between the level of self-efficacy of teachers and their level of implementations of technology regardless of country of origin. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.67 Mason, Ralph; et al: Foundational Experiences as a Curriculum Design Principle for Secondary Mathematics. pp 358 – 363 Students must make sense of the mathematics they are learning, if they are to understand it. When students are encountering a mathematics topic primarily through that topic’s mathematical forms—its symbols, terminology, definitions, operations, and algorithms—the richness, potency, and completeness of their understanding will depend on their prior, pre-formal experiences with that topic. Foundational experiences activities enable students to construct images, patterns, and ideas—in a word, memories—that will enable them to see the sensibility of the topic’s mathematical forms when they learn them. We invite participants to explore some examples of instructional activities designed to provide foundational experiences for the mathematics of powers, from power laws through geometric sequences to exponential functions. With these examples, participants will consider these questions: How can foundational experiences contribute to students’ understandings of the math behind the topic’s formal content? What are the qualities that we should invest when designing foundational experience activities? https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.68 May, Bernie (Dov): Engage Students More Hopscotch Mathe has Students Jumping for Joy. pp 364 – 367 The goal was to create a system to teach children deep thinking skills, as well as problem solving skills which they could later use in tomorrow’s innovation economy. The by-product is they learn the Times Table. We cover more in less time…under 5 hours, we go up to 20×20, and introduce the children to complex algebraic equations, too. Guess what? They love it – and ask for more! The times table represents the problem to be solved. Each intersection represents a smaller aspect of the problem. They learn various techniques. No dumb sing-song melodies. They build on what they know. We do not go linearly through the table. We jump around…and cover whatever we can. When we are through I show them that if they only knew 7×4 = 28, they have the problem solving skills where they can solve the whole table. The idea behind Kinestetic Math is to get into their world, and reach them at their level. Children like to run, jump, colour and move around – so do we. We use our fingers, our knuckles, and our legs to learn the Times Table. This paper covers a small section of the program, Magic Squares and Hopscotch Math, as an introduction to a different kind of thinking and how innovative thinking can be applied to teaching. I introduce the program with a 10×10 grid representing the times table. Every time we solve one of the blocks on the table, they get to color the block however they want. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.69 Menz, Petra; Mulberry, Nicola: Open Source Differential and Integral Calculus Material Development to Support Student Accessibility and Learning. pp 368 – 373 Educational resources in mathematics are an important aspect of the teaching and learning landscape. Moreover, resources have come a long way from the spoken word with such inventions as paper and the computer to the point where there is now an infrastructure around open educational resources (OER) that has matured into viable alternatives to traditional resources. The newfound prevalence of these materials provides opportunities to customize OER to the specific needs of students and institutions. We designed open source material for the social science strand of differential and integral calculus by adopting an open source textbook and adapting it for our needs. Along with the course notes, we developed lecture notes, student notes based on the Cornell note-taking system, and assignments with solutions. Students are appreciative of free material, but moreover, the cohesiveness and interconnectivity among the various course materials provides for a smoother learning journey through our courses. This paper presents our philosophy, an overview of our open source material, and the operation of both courses. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.70 Michelsen, Claus: The MACAS Symposiums 2005 – 2019. Mathematics Education in an Interdisciplinary Context. pp 374 – 379 The symposium series Mathematics and its Connections to the Arts and Sciences (MACAS) has been held since 2005. The vision which the MACASinitiative is based upon is to develop a humanistic approach to education that combines various disciplines in a single curriculum. According to this vision the aim is to educate students by enabling them to pursue diverse fields of research, while at the same time exploring the aesthetic and scientific connections between the arts and science. In view of the challenges of the 21st century, a modern approach to education with a focus on multi- and interdisciplinarity is more important than ever. Five MACAS symposiums have been held since 2005, and the proceedings of the symposiums provide an insight into ideas, experiences, conceptual frameworks, and theories to connect mathematics education to the arts and sciences. Based on the symposiums proceedings we provide an overview of five main themes addressed at the MACAS symposiums (i) mathematics and science (ii) mathematics and art (iii) mathematics and technology, (iv) mathematics and literature, and (v) educational perspectives on interdisciplinarity. The overview highlights the need for joint empirical investigations that operationalize, model and study the rich ideas presented in at the symposiums. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.71 Miheso-O´Connor, Marguerite K.: Teaching Mathematics through Historic Environment. A Time-Travel Grounded Pedagogy. pp 380 – 385 Mathematics has been used by generations to make important decisions for a long period of time. History is littered with problem solving events which are results of mathematization of tasks based on available tools in any given generation. While History of mathematics focuses on what each culture contributed to present day conventional mathematics as taught in schools as a subject, Mathematics in a Historic environment focuses on identifying mathematical thinking that exists in all historical events. Historical events when enacted through the Time Travel approach learners get the opportunity to relive past events in the present context. Teaching mathematics in historic environment uses the time travel events that are practised by bridging ages international, to provide a reflective meaningful conceptualization of mathematics is a living subject. The strategy illuminates the centrality of mathematical thinking in all historical events. This paper shares findings from a study carried out on the effectiveness of this approach for teaching mathematics and provides an opportunity to discuss the approach as a viable pedagogic strategy that can be replicated across the curriculum https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.72 Missen, Jenny: Researching and Implementing in the Mathematics Classroom Australian Curriculum General Capabilities. pp 386 – 391 The Australian Curriculum (AC) provides teachers with a great amount of detail in each curriculum area. In addition to teaching these curricula, the AC requires incorporation of Cross-Curriculum Priorities and General Capabilities. This paper documents the work done on an action research project considering ways in which the General Capabilities (GCs) of the Australian Curriculum could be incorporated into teaching Mathematics and the difficulties I faced as a teacher researching during the teaching term. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.73 Morge, Shelby: Addressing Teachers´ Culturally Responsive Teaching Beliefs through Course Activities. pp 392 – 397 Making data-based decisions about course content is a difficult process for teacher educators. This difficulty is amplified when considering complex issues focused on diversity. In order to understand and address pre- and in-service teachers’ culturally responsive teaching beliefs, the Culturally Responsive Teaching Outcome Expectancy Scale (Siwatu, 2007) was administered during graduate and undergraduate courses in mathematics education at two southeastern US universities. From the survey results instructors identified items with high and low means (on a 100 point scale). The lowest items provided a basis for constructing future course activities. In this paper we share the expectancy scale results and course activities that were implemented. We also discuss opportunities for improving the culturally relevant practices and activities in our courses in order to ensure the transferto classroom practice. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.74 Morska, Janina: From the Purpose oft he Lesson to Success. pp 398 – 400 This paper deals with efficiency in teaching. The purpose of the lesson and the criterion of success are complex elements in the didactic process. Between these elements are theory and practice, various forms of work, feedback and student self – evaluation. I would like to share my professional experience as an apprenticeship teacher, as well as a deputy head teacher (vice-director) observing the work of other teachers in formative assessment. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.75 Moscardini, Lio; et al: Collaborating Across the Pond: Cognitively Guided Instruction Project. pp 401 – 405 This paper describes a primary-school (ages 5-11) project implemented in Scotland, based on the United States research from Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), and as envisioned by Dr. Lio Moscardini. Three schools, two public and one private, participated in this two-year long initial study that focused on helping teachers to understand the developmental stages pupils naturally progress through in order to understand the mathematics for their class level as defined by the Scottish government. This project provides evidence that a rise in attainment can occur by focusing on teachers’ knowledge, pedagogy, and pedagogical content knowledge in relation to mathematics rather than by focusing on attainment itself. Additionally, this project addresses the teaching and learning of a diverse group of students, i.e. inclusion, low socio-economics. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.76 Movshovitz-Hadar, Nitsa; et al: Bridging between School Mathematics and Contemporary Mathematics: Turning a Dream into Reality. pp 406 – 411 In many countries, school mathematics curriculum does not go beyond the 18th century mathematics. Any solution for bridging this gap must consider students’ limited background, as well as teachers’ time constrains. Our ‘bridge’ consists of periodically interweaving Mathematics-News Snapshots (MNSs), i.e., short descriptive presentations of recent mathematical results, throughout the teaching of the ordinary math curriculum during the three years of senior high school. More than 20 MNSs are already available (see https://MNS.co.il). Our two-part workshop is aimed at sharing our solution. This will include a discussion of its underlying principles, a reverse engineering analysis of sample MNSs vis-à-vie the MNS authoring guidelines, an overview of three teacher preparation models, and results of our implementation follow-up studies. Finally, in the spirit of the conference, we’ll invite attendees to adopt our solution, and possibly also to participate in developing more MNSs, thus turning our dream of bridging the gap into reality. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.77 Narayanan, Ajayagosh: Peer Tutoring: Developing and Sustaining Effective Teaching Practices with Mathematics Teachers in Lesotho. pp 412 – 417 This paper shows how a group of educators initiated in-service workshops for primary and secondary mathematics teachers since 2012 in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and Training (MoET) in Lesotho. The prime focus of these workshops was to develop teachers’ capacity building in mathematics through peer-support. The paper also narrates how a chain of these workshops evolved to a capacity building program with innovative approaches in classrooms. These workshops explored ideas on numbers, shapes (through the use of origami) and problem solving for effective teaching/learning of mathematics. The concept of peer tutoring/learning had emerged from these workshops as an idea that suits Lesotho education system. A capacity building program was thus recommended for the sustainability of these activities. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.78 Navarro Robles, María Estela: Variation Theory used to make a Personalized Diagnostic in the Level of Knowledge of Fundamental Concepts about Rational Numbers and their Operations in Undergraduate Students. pp 418 – 421 This lecture explains how through Marton Variation Theory was designed and evaluated a test about rational numbers to identify for each student the specific knowledge and skills about the theme to solve problems and to make operations and thus which concepts theyneed to learn or what skills they need to develop. The variation theory was used in the sense of one problem, multiple changes. The test was answered by 115 students of 7 groups of a private university, who are enrolled in a leveling course. From the answers of the students it was characterized the lived object of learning and this was the start point to classify the conceptual or operational needs of each student. With the detailed results it was possible to design a personalized route of learning. Key words: Rational numbers, variation theory, undergraduate student, personalized course https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.79 Niess, Margaret L.: Online Strategies Enhancing Mathematics Teacher Knowledge for the Digital Age: Discourse and Critical Reflection. pp 422 – 427 This study designed online graduate courses to enrich inservice mathematics teachers’ Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). The effort identified key experiences to engage teachers in discourse and critical reflections for relearning, rethinking, and redefining teaching and learning as they know and learned it, transforming their TPACK with respect to teaching with digital technologies. The experiences modeled inquiry tasks merging content, technology and pedagogy as described in TPACK, connecting teachers with experiences as students learning about and with technologies. Critical reflections on the experiences as learners and as teachers combined with the online community of learners’ discourse, transforming their teacher knowledge. The collection of strategies involving discourse and critical reflection did enhance the participants’ TPACK, providing recommendations for designing online inservice teacher education courses. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.80 O´Dell, Jenna R.; Frauenholtz, Todd R.: An Unsolved Graph Theory Problem: Comparing Solutions of Grades 4, 6, & 8. pp 428 – 433 This study investigated how students in Grades 4, 6, and 8 reasoned through a non-routine, unsolved problem. The study took place at a K-8 school in the Midwestern United States. Each grade participated in two or three task-based sessions lasting between 45 and 60 minutes with the researchers. During the sessions, students engaged in the Graceful Tree Conjecture where they examined graceful labelling for Star, Path, and Caterpillar Graphs. We examined differences in students’ generalized solutions across the grades and how they were able to provide justifications and state generalizations of a graceful labelling for the graphs in the Path Class. Descriptions of students’ generalized solutions are included for each grade level. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.81 O´Meara, Niamh; Faulkner, Fiona: Professional Development for Out-of-field Post-primary Teachers of Mathematics: A pre and post Analysis of the Impact of Mathematics Specific Pedagogical Training. pp 434 – 439 The Professional Diploma in Mathematics for Teaching is a 2-year part-time programme dedicated to out of field teachers of mathematics in second level education in Ireland. The programme was introduced in Ireland after a report highlighted that 48% of second level teachers of mathematics in Ireland were not qualified to teach mathematics (Ní Ríordáin & Hannigan 2011). The programme has been running since 2012 and is currently upskilling its 6th cohort of out-of-field teachers. As part of the programme, teachers are required to undertake mathematics content modules as well as mathematics specific pedagogy modules. One such mathematics specific pedagogy module requires students to undertake five 3-hour workshops which examine mathematics content contained on the second level curriculum and offers suggestions on how to teach it for conceptual understanding. Teachers in Cohort 5 of the programme completed a questionnaire prior to completing the 5 workshops to outline how confident they felt teaching particular aspects of the second level mathematics curriculum. They were also asked to best describe the teaching approaches that they favoured at that point in time. Upon completion of the 5 workshops, this same cohort of teachers completed a similar questionnaire investigating their level of confidence in teaching the curriculum and any changes in their teaching practices that occurred as a result of participation in this module. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.82 Pagge, Jenny: Effective Use of ICT and Storytelling to Teach Statistics in the Preschool Classroom. pp 440 – 444 New school curricula and modern teachers are trying to get the child engaged and interested in statistics through accessibility and enjoyment. This has been backed up by much research into the correlation of a child’s engagement and their academic achievement (Gunuc, & Kuzu, 2014). Using storytelling as a teaching method, teachers can provide a meaningful context for statistics which can change this prejudice from a young age (Casey et al., 2004, Walters et al 2018) and is shown to have many educational benefits for children (Sherwood, 2018). In the last years ICT tools, games and storytelling have been used to achieve this engagement (Lekka et al, 2017, Walters 2018). ICT provides children with the opportunity to enhance their communication skills, creativity, high-order thinking and practical technological skills which are needed in a modern society (Corel, 2019). This paper includes a brief overview of research that looks at the use of ICT applications, and use of storytelling to teach descriptive statistics in the preschool classroom. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.83 Paolucci, Catherine: Supporting Pre-service Mathematics Teacher Development through Transformative Community Engagement. pp 445 – 449 Opportunities for field-based transformative learning are a critical part of mathematics teacher education, yet several factors limit the extent to which teacher preparation programs can offer them. This paper discusses the value of transformative learning for pre-service mathematics teachers and presents an example of an international community engagement program that was specifically designed to support transformative learning for pre-service teachers in both the United States and South Africa. It highlights evidence of key aspects of transformative learning in the reflections of both the pre-service teachers and the students in the program and discusses the implications of this for future research and program development. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.84 Pearn, Catherine; et al: Developing and Assessing Algebraic Reasoning in the Middle Years. pp 450 – 455 New school curricula and modern teachers are trying to get the child engaged and interested in statistics through accessibility and enjoyment.

The STEPS program has served thousands of youth over the past two decades to provide academic support and mentoring to minorities and women students. The STEPS program focuses on demonstrating a connected learning approach to STEM academics. Students participate in mentoring through the STEM pipeline of course choices, extra-curricular activities, and exposure to STEM practitioners. Students learn to overcome the challenges that prevent successful matriculation into STEM fields. Minority and women students in elementary through college in the Boston and greater Boston areas learn how to navigate from a desire for a STEM career to achieving one. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.86 Pilgrim, Mary E.; Dick, Thomas P.: Actively Engaging in Calculus to Support all Students. pp 462 – 466 Research findings support the use of active engagement in the mathematics classroom. Active learning not only has the potential to positively impact student learning, it also helps to address equity issues in the mathematics classroom. However, with limited experiences in student-centered instruction and little to no pedagogical training, mathematics faculty are often underprepared to meet the needs to today’s STEM majors. In addition, content-specific professional development is typically not readily available to faculty on their campuses. With a focus on calculus, this workshop aims to fill this professional development gap by providing participants with the opportunity to engage in student-centered activities as well as reflect and discuss the implications for their own mathematics classrooms. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.87 Pomuczné Nagy, Ildikó-Anna: How and wherer can a Mathematics Teacher Utilize his 33 Years of Teaching Experience? A Math Teacher about Teaching Mathematics-Excerpt from 33 Years of Teaching Experience. pp 467 – 472 This paper shows how a mathematics teacher can utilize his teaching experience. I have been working as a mathematics and physics teacher in Hungary for 33 years. I have taught at various levels of the education system: at elementary school, high school, teacher training college, and in teacher training too, but at most time of my job I taught at high school. I am currently working on the series of a new mathematics textbook for 10 to 14-year-old students. It is based on the traditions of the Hungarian mathematics education, but using the opportunities offered by the 21st century, it also includes modern sample tasks that fit into the curriculum, for example Geogebra files, written by me. I would like to share how I use my teaching experience in textbook writing and how I focus primarily on the didactic aspects of teaching mathematics. I pursue my PhD research in the topic of problem-solving thinking, so I study the mathematical thinking of my students studying in different school types. In my lecture, I analyse different tasks by focusing on mathematical methodological aspects. For example I will tell that I believe it is advantageous to introduce mathematical definitions with examples which are astonishing for students in order to draw attention to maths as much as possible. I will give examples of how I build my experience into the textbook in order to make the system of mathematical concepts optimal for pupils. I would like it if give you an insight into a segment the current Hungarian mathematics education, the current teaching of problem-solving thinking and the different ways of students’ thinking. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.88 Povey, Hilary: Moral and Political Dilemmas in Working with the Concept of Citizenship within Mathematics Teaching in Schools: a Personal Perspective. pp 473 – 478 This paper springs out of my engagement with a curriculum development project framed in response to a European Union call for action on global citizenship. But citizenship is a complex and elusive concept – slippery, dangerous and contested. Inevitably, tensions arise as we seek to find a way of acting in the world and trying to find, however limited and partial, an answer to the question: „what is to be done?“. In this paper, I identify and offer a personal response to some of moral and political dilemmas we have identified during the design and implementation of the project. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.89 Prendergast, Mark; et al: Incentivising the Study of Higher Level Mathematics. pp 479 – 484 In Ireland, mathematics has been assigned a special status within the postprimary school curriculum with the introduction of a Bonus Points initiative (BPI) in 2012. Students are now awarded an extra 25 points in their upper post-primary school state examination results if they achieve a passing grade at Higher Level (HL) mathematics. The culmination of points that student achieve in six different subjects acts as a gatekeeper to tertiary level education. Mathematics is the only subject in which there are extra points awarded. The initiative was introduced to encourage more students to study the subject at an advanced level. Anecdotally there have been many mixed reviews about the success of the BPI. While the numbers taking HL mathematics have steadily increased, there have been concerns expressed that many students who are not mathematically capable of performing up to the standard required are now opting for the HL paper and that the difficulty of this examination and the marking schemes have been adjusted accordingly. This paper investigates the advantages and disadvantages associated with the BPI from the perspective of mathematics teachers (n=266). https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.90 Raja, Shagufta; et al: Using GIS to Develop Spatial Reasoning and Analysis of Data. pp 485 – 490 The Geographic Information System (GIS) is a spatial analysis tool that allows users to capture, store, analyze, and visualize data related to real-world problems. GIS is used daily in multiple STEM fields to solve complex problems. Educators find GIS useful for students to be able to interpret data in a spatial context. Students develop quantitative and spatial analysis reasoning using GIS to understand and develop solutions for many current scientific concerns. This paper presents two cases highlighting middle grade students’ use of GIS. The cases illustrate how GIS promotes students’ development of spatial reasoning as they think about patterns and relationships made evident through data visualization. The cases demonstrate how students engage in finding relative and absolute mapped features, geographic patterns, and changes over time as they make decisions using geographic inquiry, spatial thinking and problem solving. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.91 Ramsay, John R.: Mentored Teams of Undergraduates in Real World Consulting. pp 491 – 496 One of the difficulties in mathematics education is providing a good answer to the “What can I do with mathematics?” question. Applied examples and projects within existing mathematics courses can help answer this but often aren’t close enough to real world applications and they can consume considerable course time. We have addressed this difficulty with a summer program that employs students to solve actual applied problems. The College of Wooster Applied Methods & Research Experience is a summer program that puts teams of students to work as consultants in the local community. Student teams are usually composed of three students with a mathematics or computer science faculty member acting as mentor. Clients of the program come from business, industry, government agencies, and service organizations. The program also includes a significant professional development component in order to increase the educational benefit to the participants. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.92 Rugelj, Marina: Counting with 10 Fingers as a Man, with 8 fingers as a Hen or with 2 Switches as a Computer. pp 497 – 502 In the high school curriculum of mathematics in Slovenia one of the goals is “Students can convert from decimal to binary number”. In most high schools, an algorithm for conversion is presented, which the students learn by heart like a cooking recipe, without proper understanding. A different method will be presented, where pupils play, explore and find certain conclusions on their own. This helps students to understand and learn the new concept much more efficiently, comparing to when they only listen to the instruction. Hence, the knowledge gained this way is hopefully more solid and lasting. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.93 Sack, Jacqueline; Quander, Judith: Secondary Math Teacher Candidates´ Perspectives on a Co-Taught Blended Content & Methods Geometry Course. pp 503 – 508 Two faculty, from the mathematics and education departments in an urban university, co-teach a blended methods and content geometry course for preservice secondary teachers who are also math majors. The course is entirely inquiry-based, a departure from traditional instructor-centered maths courses, and utilizes design-based trajectories developed by one of the authors over 12 years. We conducted two individual clinical interviews and one focus-group interview with 6 volunteer students, to ascertain their perspectives on how they best learn mathematics; to gauge how they perceived the inquiry-based experiences from this course; and, their reflections on inquiry-based instruction in mathematics as they move forward in their goals to become teachers. We used narrative inquiry as a research method to study the experiences of these students individually and collectively. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.94 Sáenz-Ludlow, Adalira; Jiménez, Alexandra Jiménez: Linkages between a Teacher´s Preparation and the Potential for Students´ Learning. pp 509 – 514 From the Peircean perspective of diagrammatic reasoning, the paper presents a teacher’s analysis of a task with a square array of dots. She conceptualizes different partitions of the array and transforms it into different tasks of sequences of squares to facilitate her inductive thinking and the emergence of different generalizations pertaining square numbers. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.95 Santhanam, S. R.: Welcome 2019 – A Workshop on Framing Non-Routine Problems in Mathematics for all Levels. pp 515 – 516 The main aspect of mathematics is problem solving. A non-routine problem is any complex problem that requires some degree of creativity to solve. There are no standardised methods to solve a non-routine problem, if there is one then it becomes a routine problem. What about framing a non-routine problem? It is all the more difficult. In this workshop the author attempts to make the audience to understand non-routine problems and their solutions and further to frame problems of this nature. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.96 Shamash, Josephine: From Equations to Structures: Linking Abstract Algebra and High-School Algebra for Secondary School Teachers. pp 517 – 522 The high-school curriculum in algebra deals mainly with the solution of different types of equations. Modern algebra has a completely different viewpoint and is concerned with algebraic structures and operations. The course Algebra: From Equations to Structures is part of an M.Sc. programme for Israeli secondary school mathematics teachers. It provides an introduction to algebraic structures and modern abstract algebra, and links abstract algebra to the high-school curriculum in algebra. It follows the historical attempts of mathematicians to solve polynomial equations of higher degrees, attempts which resulted in the development of group theory and field theory by Galois and Abel. This approach leads naturally to examining topics and fundamental theorems in both group theory and field theory. Along the historical “journey”, many other major results in algebra in the past 150 years are introduced, and current research in algebra is highlighted. We examine the relevance of the course to the teachers‘ work. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.97 Showers, Dennis: Real-world Maths: Preparing Teachers to use Real-life Contexts for Teaching Maths. pp 523 – 525 Common Core Mathematics in the US promotes eight Standards for Mathematical Practice to guide instructional reform. Standard 2 includes the practice of “decontextualizing” or abstracting a given situation and representing it symbolically to solve real-world problems. Preparing teachers to employ this practice in classrooms requires knowledge and skill to apply technology to bring the real world into the classroom and the ability to discuss personal experiences in a mathematical way. Professional development with New York teacher candidates and in-service teachers in Nicaragua, China, and the US indicates the need for further dissemination with a research program to evaluate its efficacy. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.98 Shriki, Atara; Lavy, Ilana: Shedding New Light on Common Algorithms: What can we Learn from Vedic Mathematics? pp 526 – 528 In Sanskrit, the ancient Hinduism language, ‘Vedas’ means ‘knowledge’. The Vedas are a corpus of more than 1,000,000 ancient philosophical writings divided into Sutras, some of which deal with mathematics. These mathematics Sutras, termed ‘Vedic Mathematics’, concern various fields of mathematics. The Vedic methods are coherent, logical and simple, and students enjoy practicing them. Besides ’spicing up‘ the regular mathematics lessons by integrating some of the Vedic algorithms, engaging students in proving them supports the development of their insights regarding the rationale underlying the formal rules and algorithms included in the curriculum. In this workshop, we present some of the basic Vedic arithmetic and algebraic algorithms, involve the participants in proving the them and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of integrating Vedic mathematics into classes at different age groups and study levels. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.99 Sibbald, Timothy: The Confluence of Numeracy with Interdisciplinary Mathematics. pp 529 – 534 Interdisciplinary mathematics, such as STEM, but not limited to it, has received considerable attention in recent years. Its role in mathematics is the provision of practical circumstances that support learning mathematical concepts. The validation of concepts through the adoption to interdisciplinary purposes has a broad base of examples. Furthermore, among the concepts bridging mathematics and another discipline is a group of concepts that transcend a variety of other disciplines and, within that scope, numeracy emerges. Since this is not a traditional definition of numeracy it is reconciled with other definitions of numeracy and the implications of that reconciliation with interdisciplinary instructional approaches is examined. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.100 Siemon, Dianne: Connecting Research and Practice – The Case of Multiplicative Thinking. pp 535 – 540 There is very little of any substance that can be achieved in school mathematics, and beyond without the capacity to recognise, represent and reason about relationships between quantities, that is, to think multiplicatively. However, research has consistently found that while most students in the middle years of schooling (i.e., Years 5 to 9) are able to solve simple multiplication and division problems involving small whole numbers, they rely on additive strategies to solve more complex problems involving larger numbers, fractions, decimals, and/or proportion. This paper describes how this situation can be addressed through the use of evidence-based formative assessment tools and teaching advice specifically designed to support the development of multiplicative thinking. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.101 Smith, Raymond; et al: Insights Gained from Implementing Teaching Toolkits: A Case of Activating Prior Knowledge. pp 541 – 546 In designing teaching toolkits for teachers the effectiveness of such a resource depends on mutual enactment and engagement by the designer, the teacher and the learners. It is a recursive process and illuminates the tensions between the intended outcomes envisaged by the designer and the realised outcomes in the classroom. In the qualitative research tradition, the exploratory investigation captured in this paper employed a descriptive phenomenological approach. With this orientation, and along the theoretical trajectory led by Todres (2005:107), this study sought to collect detailed descriptive accounts of personal experience. Data were gathered by collecting samples of learners’ work, teacher interviews and classroom observations. This paper draws attention to the practical disjuncture between assessing and activating prior knowledge. Insights acquired may contribute both to the design approach and to teaching practice. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.102 Spooner, Kerri: Authentic Mathematical Modelling Behaviours for Secondary School Students. pp 547 – 551 Mathematical modelling is part of many curricula around the world. Some of these curriculum statements are vague and general. There is a need for statements to be more specific with supporting examples for implementation of curriculums. There is also a need for further development of activities focused on authentic mathematical modelling behaviour. To address this problem, an ethnographic study in New Zealand was carried out to identify the behaviours of a real world mathematical modelling team. These behaviours were then explored to determine what they could look like for a sixteen-year-old student. This paper will present the modelling behaviours of the real world modelling team and the potential authentic mathematical modelling behaviours of a secondary school student. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.103 Stephens, Max: Developing Algorithmic Thinking in Mathematics in the Primary and Junior Secondary Years. pp 552 – 557 The fourth industrial revolution is already changing what we mean by mathematical reasoning in its different forms, such as algebraic, spatial and geometric, and statistical. Algorithmic thinking is one particular form of mathematical reasoning, emphasizing decomposition (breaking a complex problem down into component sub-problems and sub-tasks), pattern recognition, generalization and abstraction. With a growing global emphasis on using algorithmic thinking in coding and computing programs in schools, it is necessary to examine how algorithmic thinking should be included more explicitly in the teaching and learning of mathematics. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.104 Takahashi, Tadashi: Proving in Mathematics Education – On the Proof using ATP. pp 558 – 563 The aim of the mathematics education is the acquisition of “knowledge/skill of the mathematics” and “the mathematical thinking”. Proving is a chain of the logic in mathematics and is “mathematical thinking” itself. So, proving is the domain that is important from a point of view that can evaluate the acquisition of enough “mathematical thinking”. There is a variety of sense of values in the present situation of the proof using the ATP (Automated theorem proving). We should establish a clear vision as mathematics education in this situation. That is, in mathematics education, we should build sense of values for proof using the ATP newly. To that end, we fix contents of the mathematics, and it is necessary to prove them by using ATP. We would like to assume the aim the theorems of Euclid’s Elements. Because the contents are the basics of the mathematical thinking. The proving is an important aim in the mathematics education, it is necessary to clarify new value by using the ATP as mathematics education. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.105 Tannor, David: Effective Mathematics Instruction: Two-Year College Mathematics Instructors´ Knowledge and Self-Efficacy. pp 564 – 569 In this article are findings from a 2017 mixed methods study on two-year college mathematics instructors’ knowledge and self-efficacy on effective pedagogy. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.106 Temple, Barbara Ann; et al: Designing a Transdisciplinary Approach to Elementary Math Literacy Learning through Science & the Arts. pp 570 – 574 Engaging with subject matter in isolation stymies creativity, promotes rote learning, and limits development of divergent thinking skills. Conversely, a transdisciplinary approach to math develops critical and creative thinking skills, strengthens problem solving capacity, and promotes metacognition. In this pilot study, the design-based research process began with sharing initial intervention ideas for elementary Math lessons with participants at an international elementary Math conference. Utilizing participant feedback as part of the iterative process, three specific interventions for second-grade Math concepts were designed with intentional infusion of Science and the Arts. The ultimate goal for this research is the design of an effective elementary Math curriculum offering authentic, real-world learning through a transdisciplinary approach. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.107 Thomas, Jeffrey: Learning through Self-Assessment towards Understanding the New B.Ed. Curriculum in South Africa: Experiences from the new B.Ed. Programme at Sol Plaatje University. pp 575 – 580 The mismatch between instruction and learning could pose a serious barrier to effective teaching and learning. Effective teaching should be a dynamic alignment and realignment of teaching and learning styles to optimise achievement. When teaching and learning styles do not complement each other students may become anxious, frustrated and disengaged which may have negative effects on their performance. The focus of the study is to gather evidence on how students perceive their own learning in order to adapt the teaching approach which will accommodate the students’ preferred way of learning. The main findings in this study showed that students prefer to work independently and that elements of metacognition are present during their efforts to learn. This study therefore suggests that self-assessment activities should become an integral part of the teaching and learning process. Thus, students are afforded the opportunity to advance personal learning through the development of metacognition as self-monitoring and corrective actions. Key words: Self-assessment, metacognition, self-regulated learning https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.108 Toro-Clarke, José A.: A Participative and Individualized Laboratory: A Strategy for Increasing Student Success in College-Level Mathe Courses. pp 581 – 586 This research was carried out within a qualitative research paradigm. The objective was to observe, analyze and enrich pedagogical practice through the use of pedagogical learning strategies. The learning strategy was a participative and individualized laboratory carried out during a research project in a non-Traditional Laboratory (LnT, abbreviated in Spanish form). The primary aim of this research was to observe if the LnT assists the students and in this way maximizes success and knowledge in the Introductory Math course (MATE3001) on the University of Puerto Rico campus. The LnT contributed to: (1) students improved their study habits; (2) the students had greater participation in the solution of math problems, their practice and discussion; (3) they accepted that the research professor supervise their work as it was carried out and understood that the presence was for their benefit. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.109 Vacaretu, Ariana-Stanca: Developing High-School Students´ Competences through Math Research Workshops – the M&L Project. pp 587 – 592 Mathematics is or it should be about problem solving and math thinking. However, what mathematics students learn in schools is more about procedures for solving different types of math exercises and problems. In many cases, students learn by heart algorithms and words (math concepts) and use them for solving different math tasks. School math is very far from what mathematicians do and, in many cases, doesn’t motivate students for learning math. This paper presents the way we organized the assessment of the students’ skills developed through math research workshops and some of the assessment results. Even though we didn’t assess all the competences the students develop through the math research workshop, the findings show that the students certainly develop their problem-solving skills. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.110 Walsh Jr., Thomas: Exploring Computer Science with MicroworldsEX to Learn Geometry and Logo Programming Code. pp 593 – 598 Future employment of computer-programming jobs will be best for applicants with experience in different languages and coding tools (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2018).

Posthumanism presents a challenge to Enlightenment rationality and the privileged position and potential capability of the human mind. Posthuman perspectives present knowledge and knowing as an embodied and experiential process. Learning, then, is not simply about the acquisition of knowledge and skills, it is an embodied experience in which the learner acts within an environment and comes to make sense of this experience through a reflective process. As well as presenting a theoretical account of mathematics professional learning and the implications of the posthuman to this field, I illustrate this with my own research in mathematics teachers’ preservice education and the professional development of practising teachers. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.114 Webb, Lyn; et al: Enabling Grade 3 Teachers to Transform an Intended Curriculum into an Enacted Curriculum in Mathematics Classrooms. pp 613 – 617 The introduction of a new mathematics curriculum is usually heralded by the production of a plethora of learner workbooks and teacher aids. In South Africa this study researches the effect of curriculum change on Grade 3 mathematics teachers in an endeavour to understand what elements enable the transition from an intended curriculum to an enacted curriculum. The theoretical framing for this paper is Fullan’s (2006) change theory that focuses on new materials, new practices and new beliefs. The research identifies that current South African curriculum documents and workbooks focus on mathematical content almost exclusively, and give minimal guidance concerning pedagogical content knowledge and teacher agency. A tri-level system is suggested to narrow the gap between policy and praxis. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.115 Webb, Paul: Towards Unifying Logic for the Pedagoy of Mathematics in South Africa. pp 618 – 622 South Africa’s performance in mathematics at school level is not impressive, even when measured against countries with fewer resources. As a country, it is one of the lowest performers in the world with a wide range of achievement between schools, with historically white schools achieving results much closer to the international average compared to historically-black African schools. The South African National Planning Commission has identified mathematics education as a key area of concern, particularly amongst poor children. In response, the Mapungubwe Institute for Strategic Reflection (MISTRA) initiated a research project to explore the possibility of a ‘unifying pedagogy’ that could help improve mathematics teaching across the range of schools in the country. This paper presents a summary of the ‘cumulative resonances’ of ‘sagacious’ members of the mathematics education community in South Africa and abroad. The data generated by these ‘sagacious’ sources’ in academia and governmental and non-governmental organisations were analysed thematically in order to explore the possibility of framing a unifying pedagogy of mathematics for South African conditions. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.116 Wickliff, Gregory A.; et al: Communicating Mathematics and Science: Teaching and Tutoring Writing in a Summer Program for High School Students. pp 623 – 628 Supplemental instruction and tutoring in writing, genre, and document design and illustration, can improve the quality of formal mathematics and science papers and presentations composed by rising high school junior and senior students in a four-week summer program. This paper discusses the program history and goals, its structure, the methods of instruction and tutoring, and the professional and student writing samples delivered through the University of North Carolina at Charlotte’s Summer Ventures in Science and Mathematics program. The program is a no-cost, state-funded program for academically talented students who aspire to careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Participants reside on the university campus for four weeks and conduct research around topics of their own interest individually or in collaboration with like-minded peers. Participants engage in research under the supervision of university faculty. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.117 Willson, Ian: Formative Assessment and Middle-School Classroom Tasks with the Wolfram Language. pp 629 – 630 Middle-school classroom tasks with the Wolfram Language can play a very significant role in the growth and development of mathematical competence. This can occur at the intersection of challenging Mathematical tasks, coding skills, exploration, discovery, collaboration and formative assessment. This workshop will reference all of these elements as they informed and underpinned classroom activities conducted at several different secondary schools in Melbourne Australia. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.118 Woodcock, Stephen: Not all Equals are Equal: Decoupling Thinking Processes and Results in Mathematical Assessments. pp 631 – 636 One of the greatest challenges in mathematics education is in fostering an understanding of what mathematicians would recognise as “mathematical thought.” We seek to encourage students to develop the transferable skills of abstraction, problem generalization and scalability as opposed to simply answering the specific question posed. This difference is perhaps best illustrated by the famous – but likely apocryphal – tale of Gauss’s school days and his approach to summing all positive integers up to and including 100, rather than just summing each sequentially. Especially with the rise of technology-enabled marking and results-focussed tutoring services, the onus is on the educator to develop new types of question which encourage and reward the development of mathematical processes and deprioritise results alone. Some initial work in this area is presented here. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.119 Zell, Simon: Weekly 10-minute-tasks to Promote Students Solving Equations in a Content-oriented Manner. pp 637 – 642 When solving equations in school, students often rely on routines and do not consider alternative ways of solving. Even basic equations which could be solved quite fast using common sense are regularly solved in a complicated way. To overcome this reliance on routine, a study with 17 classes of grade 10 students was carried out. Weekly 10-minute-tasks, which contained appropriate subtasks to enhance content-oriented solving, were solved by students over the course of one school year. These tasks were designed with the purpose of reducing the dominance of routines and the aim of using insight in the solving of equations. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.120 Zollman, Alan: Collective Participation: A Story of Business, Community, Schools, and University Partnering in STEM Education. pp 643 – 648 The quality of the public school teacher has the greatest in-school impact on nurturing cognitive abilities, developing content knowledge, and increasing motivation of students (Ferguson & Ladd 1996; Haycock 1998; Rivkin, Hanushek, & Kain 2005; Rice 2003; Sanders & Rivers, 1996; Zollman, Tahernezhadi, & Billman, 2012). We also know from educational research (Johnson & Sondergeld, 2015) that traditional professional development formats do not result in improvement of teacher practices nor substantial gain in student achievement. This paper reports on a shift in the traditional professional development project – one to enhance the quality of the public school teacher in STEM education projects through a synergy of business, community, and school districts partners with education and science university faculty. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.121 Zonnefeld, Ryan G.; Zonnefeld, Valorie L.: Innovative Pathways in STEM Teacher Preparation: Bridging the Gap between University Expectations & Secondary School Needs. pp 649 – 651 Innovative teacher preparation programs for STEM education are essential for meeting the goal of ensuring that secondary school students receive instruction from a certified teacher. This exploratory workshop examines the role that interdisciplinary STEM and mathematics programs can have to increase the number of certified teachers prepared to teach STEM classes from an interdisciplinary approach. https://doi.org/10.37626/GA9783959871129.0.122",Education,671,N/A,0,en

Mathematical Analysis,"Mariano Giaquinta, Giuseppe Modica",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"For more than two thousand years some familiarity with mathematics has been regarded as an indispensable part of the intellectual equipment of every cultured person. Today the traditional place of mathematics in education is in grave danger. Unfortunately, professional representatives of mathematics share in the reponsibiIity. The teaching of mathematics has sometimes degen erated into empty drill in problem solving, which may develop formal ability but does not lead to real understanding or to greater intellectual indepen dence. Mathematical research has shown a tendency toward overspecialization and over-emphasis on abstraction. Applications and connections with other fields have been neglected . . . But . . . understanding of mathematics cannot be transmitted by painless entertainment any more than education in music can be brought by the most brilliant journalism to those who never have lis tened intensively. Actual contact with the content of living mathematics is necessary. Nevertheless technicalities and detours should be avoided, and the presentation of mathematics should be just as free from emphasis on routine as from forbidding dogmatism which refuses to disclose motive or goal and which is an unfair obstacle to honest effort.

Izraeli",Transaction Publishers,1993-01-01,"This series of the Israel Sociological Association, whose object is to identify and clarify the major themes that occupy social research in Israel today, gathers together the best of Israeli social science investigation that was previously scattered in a wide variety of international journals. Volume VI presents a composite portrait of women's lives in Israel, analyzing their status hi the family, at work, in the military, and in political life. The editors start from the premise that Israel is simultaneously a modem industrial society and a traditional one with regard to the structure and centrality of family life. It is governed by both secular law based on the principle of equality between men and women, and religious law that imposes a different legal status between the sexes. Many of the contributors analyze the social contradictions of this paradox and how they shape women's options and experiences. This is the first compendium offering a comprehensive account of women in Israeli society. As such it should be of great interest to people hi women's studies, sociology, and Middle Eastern affairs.

Multilingual Education in South Asia,"Lina Adinolfi, Usree Bhattacharya, Prem Phyak",Routledge,2022-05-17,"Spanning scholarly contributions from India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, this edited volume seeks to capture and elucidate the distinct challenges, approaches and possible solutions associated with interpreting, adapting and applying language-in-education policies in a range of linguistically complex teaching and learning environments across South Asia. Centring on-the-ground perspectives of scholars, practitioners, pupils, parents and the larger community, the volume offers new insights into one of the most complex, populous, and diverse multilingual educational contexts in the world. Language-in-education policies and practices within this setting represent particularly high stakes issues, playing a pivotal role in determining access to literacy, thereby forming a critical pivot in the reproduction of educational inequality. The broad aim of the collection is thus to highlight the pedagogical, practical, ideological and identity-related implications arising from current language-in-education policies in this region, with the aim of illustrating how systemic inequality is intertwined with such policies and their associated interpretations. Aimed at both academics and practitioners - whether researchers and students in the fields of education, linguistics, sociology, anthropology or South Asian studies, on the one hand, or language policy advisors, curriculum developers, teacher educators, teachers, and members of funding bodies, aid providers or NGOs, on the other - it is anticipated that the accounts in this volume will offer their readership opportunities to consider their wider implications and applications across other rich multilingual settings – be these local, regional, national or global.",Education,161,N/A,0,en

Introduction to the Economics and Mathematics of Financial Markets,"Jaksa Cvitanic, Fernando Zapatero",MIT Press,2004-02-27,"An innovative textbook for use in advanced undergraduate and graduate courses; accessible to students in financial mathematics, financial engineering and economics. Introduction to the Economics and Mathematics of Financial Markets fills the longstanding need for an accessible yet serious textbook treatment of financial economics. The book provides a rigorous overview of the subject, while its flexible presentation makes it suitable for use with different levels of undergraduate and graduate students. Each chapter presents mathematical models of financial problems at three different degrees of sophistication: single-period, multi-period, and continuous-time. The single-period and multi-period models require only basic calculus and an introductory probability/statistics course, while an advanced undergraduate course in probability is helpful in understanding the continuous-time models. In this way, the material is given complete coverage at different levels; the less advanced student can stop before the more sophisticated mathematics and still be able to grasp the general principles of financial economics. The book is divided into three parts. The first part provides an introduction to basic securities and financial market organization, the concept of interest rates, the main mathematical models, and quantitative ways to measure risks and rewards. The second part treats option pricing and hedging; here and throughout the book, the authors emphasize the Martingale or probabilistic approach. Finally, the third part examines equilibrium models—a subject often neglected by other texts in financial mathematics, but included here because of the qualitative insight it offers into the behavior of market participants and pricing.",Business & Economics,528,4,2,en

Approximate Number System and Mathematics,"Jingguang Li, Xinlin Zhou, Marcus Lindskog",Frontiers Media SA,2019-11-25,"Humans process quantity information without the aid of language or symbols to guide a variety of everyday life decisions. The cognitive system that supports this intuitive skill is often referred to as the approximate number system (ANS). It has been argued that the ANS serves as the foundation of the formal symbolic number system—mathematics. Abundant empirical evidence is supportive of this view: acuity of the ANS is positively correlated with symbolic math performance, training of the ANS may cause improvements in symbolic math performance, and the ANS and symbolic number processing may share a common neural underpinning. However, recently several theories and empirical data cast doubt on the role of the ANS in symbolic math processing. This e-book aims to advance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the overlap between the ANS and mathematics.",,176,N/A,0,en

Optimal Transport for Applied Mathematicians,Filippo Santambrogio,Birkhäuser,2015-10-17,"This monograph presents a rigorous mathematical introduction to optimal transport as a variational problem, its use in modeling various phenomena, and its connections with partial differential equations. Its main goal is to provide the reader with the techniques necessary to understand the current research in optimal transport and the tools which are most useful for its applications. Full proofs are used to illustrate mathematical concepts and each chapter includes a section that discusses applications of optimal transport to various areas, such as economics, finance, potential games, image processing and fluid dynamics. Several topics are covered that have never been previously in books on this subject, such as the Knothe transport, the properties of functionals on measures, the Dacorogna-Moser flow, the formulation through minimal flows with prescribed divergence formulation, the case of the supremal cost, and the most classical numerical methods. Graduate students and researchers in both pure and applied mathematics interested in the problems and applications of optimal transport will find this to be an invaluable resource.",Mathematics,376,N/A,0,en

The Mathematics That Every Secondary School Math Teacher Needs to Know,"Alan Sultan, Alice F. Artzt",Routledge,2017-07-20,"Designed to help pre-service and in-service teachers gain the knowledge they need to facilitate students' understanding, competency, and interest in mathematics, the revised and updated Second Edition of this popular text and resource bridges the gap between the mathematics learned in college and the mathematics taught in secondary schools. Highlighting multiple types of mathematical understanding to deepen insight into the secondary school mathematics curriculum, it addresses typical areas of difficulty and common student misconceptions so teachers can involve their students in learning mathematics in a way that is interesting, interconnected, understandable, and often surprising and entertaining. Six content strands are discussed—Numbers and Operations; Algebra; Geometry; Measurement; Data Analysis and Probability; and Proof, Functions, and Mathematical Modeling. The informal, clear style supports an interactive learner-centered approach through engaging pedagogical features: Launch Questions at the beginning of each section capture interest and involve readers in learning the mathematical concepts. Practice Problems provide opportunities to apply what has been learned and complete proofs. Questions from the Classroom bring the content to life by addressing the deep ""why"" conceptual questions that middle or secondary school students are curious about, and questions that require analysis and correction of typical student errors and misconceptions; focus on counter intuitive results; and contain activities and/or tasks suitable for use with students. Changes in the Second Edition New sections on Robotics, Calculators, Matrix Operations, Cryptography, and the Coefficient of Determination New problems, simpler proofs, and more illustrative examples Answers and hints for selected problems provided",Education,789,N/A,0,en

Open Middle Math,Robert Kaplinsky,Taylor & Francis,2023-10-10,"This book is an amazing resource for teachers who are struggling to help students develop both procedural fluency and conceptual understanding.. --Dr. Margaret (Peg) Smith, co-author of5 Practices for Orchestrating Productive Mathematical Discussions Robert Kaplinsky, the co-creator of Open Middle math problems, brings hisnew class of tasks designed to stimulate deeper thinking and lively discussion among middle and high school students in Open Middle Math: Problems That Unlock Student Thinking, Grades 6-12. The problems are characterized by a closed beginning,- meaning all students start with the same initial problem, and a closed end,- meaning there is only one correct or optimal answer. The key is that the middle is open- in the sense that there are multiple ways to approach and ultimately solve the problem. These tasks have proven enormously popular with teachers looking to assess and deepen student understanding, build student stamina, and energize their classrooms. Professional Learning Resource for Teachers: Open Middle Math is an indispensable resource for educators interested in teaching student-centered mathematics in middle and high schools consistent with the national and state standards. Sample Problems at Each Grade: The book demonstrates the Open Middle concept with sample problems ranging from dividing fractions at 6th grade to algebra, trigonometry, and calculus. Teaching Tips for Student-Centered Math Classrooms: Kaplinsky shares guidance on choosing problems, designing your own math problems, and teaching for multiple purposes, including formative assessment, identifying misconceptions, procedural fluency, and conceptual understanding. Adaptable and Accessible Math: The tasks can be solved using various strategies at different levels of sophistication, which means all students can access the problems and participate in the conversation.

A History of Mathematics,Florian Cajori,American Mathematical Soc.,1999,"This Fifth Edition (1991) of a book first published in 1893 covers the period from antiquity to the close of World War I, with major emphasis on advanced mathematics and, in particular, the advanced mathematics of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In one concise volume this unique book presents an interesting and reliable account of mathematics history for those who cannot devote themselves to an intensive study. The book is a must for personal and departmental librariesalike.Cajori has mastered the art of incorporating an enormous amount of specific detail into a smooth-flowing narrative. The Index--for example--contains not just the 300 to 400 names one would expect to find, but over 1,600. And, for example, one will not only find John Pell, but will learn who he was and some specifics of what he did (and that the Pell equation was named erroneously after him). In addition, one will come across Anna J. Pell and learn of her work on biorthogonal systems; one willfind not only H. Lebesgue but the not unimportant (even if not major) V.A. Lebesgue. Of the Bernoullis one will find not three or four but all eight. One will find R. Sturm as well as C. Sturm; M. Ricci as well as G. Ricci; V. Riccati as well as J.F. Riccati; Wolfgang Bolyai as well as J. Bolyai; themathematician Martin Ohm as well as the physicist G.S. Ohm; M. Riesz as well as F. Riesz; H.G. Grassmann as well as H. Grassmann; H.P.

Lost in Math,Sabine Hossenfelder,Basic Books,2018-06-12,"In this ""provocative"" book (New York Times), a contrarian physicist argues that her field's modern obsession with beauty has given us wonderful math but bad science. Whether pondering black holes or predicting discoveries at CERN, physicists believe the best theories are beautiful, natural, and elegant, and this standard separates popular theories from disposable ones. This is why, Sabine Hossenfelder argues, we have not seen a major breakthrough in the foundations of physics for more than four decades. The belief in beauty has become so dogmatic that it now conflicts with scientific objectivity: observation has been unable to confirm mindboggling theories, like supersymmetry or grand unification, invented by physicists based on aesthetic criteria. Worse, these ""too good to not be true"" theories are actually untestable and they have left the field in a cul-de-sac. To escape, physicists must rethink their methods. Only by embracing reality as it is can science discover the truth.",Science,286,3.5,2,en

Second Year Calculus,David M. Bressoud,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Second Year Calculus: From Celestial Mechanics to Special Relativity covers multi-variable and vector calculus, emphasizing the historical physical problems which gave rise to the concepts of calculus. The book guides us from the birth of the mechanized view of the world in Isaac Newton's Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy in which mathematics becomes the ultimate tool for modelling physical reality, to the dawn of a radically new and often counter-intuitive age in Albert Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity in which it is the mathematical model which suggests new aspects of that reality. The development of this process is discussed from the modern viewpoint of differential forms. Using this concept, the student learns to compute orbits and rocket trajectories, model flows and force fields, and derive the laws of electricity and magnetism. These exercises and observations of mathematical symmetry enable the student to better understand the interaction of physics and mathematics.",Mathematics,399,N/A,0,en

Introduction to Probability,"David F. Anderson, Timo Seppäläinen, Benedek Valkó",Cambridge University Press,2017-11-02,"This classroom-tested textbook is an introduction to probability theory, with the right balance between mathematical precision, probabilistic intuition, and concrete applications. Introduction to Probability covers the material precisely, while avoiding excessive technical details. After introducing the basic vocabulary of randomness, including events, probabilities, and random variables, the text offers the reader a first glimpse of the major theorems of the subject: the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. The important probability distributions are introduced organically as they arise from applications. The discrete and continuous sides of probability are treated together to emphasize their similarities. Intended for students with a calculus background, the text teaches not only the nuts and bolts of probability theory and how to solve specific problems, but also why the methods of solution work.",Mathematics,448,N/A,0,en

A Course in Arithmetic,J-P. Serre,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This book is divided into two parts. The first one is purely algebraic. Its objective is the classification of quadratic forms over the field of rational numbers (Hasse-Minkowski theorem). It is achieved in Chapter IV. The first three chapters contain some preliminaries: quadratic reciprocity law, p-adic fields, Hilbert symbols. Chapter V applies the preceding results to integral quadratic forms of discriminant ± I. These forms occur in various questions: modular functions, differential topology, finite groups. The second part (Chapters VI and VII) uses ""analytic"" methods (holomor phic functions). Chapter VI gives the proof of the ""theorem on arithmetic progressions"" due to Dirichlet; this theorem is used at a critical point in the first part (Chapter Ill, no. 2.2). Chapter VII deals with modular forms, and in particular, with theta functions. Some of the quadratic forms of Chapter V reappear here. The two parts correspond to lectures given in 1962 and 1964 to second year students at the Ecole Normale Superieure. A redaction of these lectures in the form of duplicated notes, was made by J.-J. Sansuc (Chapters I-IV) and J.-P. Ramis and G. Ruget (Chapters VI-VII). They were very useful to me; I extend here my gratitude to their authors.",Mathematics,126,N/A,0,en

Fractals: A Very Short Introduction,Kenneth Falconer,OUP Oxford,2013-09-26,"Many are familiar with the beauty and ubiquity of fractal forms within nature. Unlike the study of smooth forms such as spheres, fractal geometry describes more familiar shapes and patterns, such as the complex contours of coastlines, the outlines of clouds, and the branching of trees. In this Very Short Introduction, Kenneth Falconer looks at the roots of the 'fractal revolution' that occurred in mathematics in the 20th century, presents the 'new geometry' of fractals, explains the basic concepts, and explores the wide range of applications in science, and in aspects of economics. This is essential introductory reading for students of mathematics and science, and those interested in popular science and mathematics.

"Games, Gambling, and Probability",David G. Taylor,CRC Press,2021-06-22,"Many experiments have shown the human brain generally has very serious problems dealing with probability and chance. A greater understanding of probability can help develop the intuition necessary to approach risk with the ability to make more informed (and better) decisions. The first four chapters offer the standard content for an introductory probability course, albeit presented in a much different way and order. The chapters afterward include some discussion of different games, different ""ideas"" that relate to the law of large numbers, and many more mathematical topics not typically seen in such a book. The use of games is meant to make the book (and course) feel like fun! Since many of the early games discussed are casino games, the study of those games, along with an understanding of the material in later chapters, should remind you that gambling is a bad idea; you should think of placing bets in a casino as paying for entertainment. Winning can, obviously, be a fun reward, but should not ever be expected. Changes for the Second Edition: New chapter on Game Theory New chapter on Sports Mathematics The chapter on Blackjack, which was Chapter 4 in the first edition, appears later in the book. Reorganization has been done to improve the flow of topics and learning. New sections on Arkham Horror, Uno, and Scrabble have been added. Even more exercises were added! The goal for this textbook is to complement the inquiry-based learning movement. In my mind, concepts and ideas will stick with the reader more when they are motivated in an interesting way. Here, we use questions about various games (not just casino games) to motivate the mathematics, and I would say that the writing emphasizes a ""just-in-time"" mathematics approach. Topics are presented mathematically as questions about the games themselves are posed. Table of Contents Preface 1. Mathematics and Probability 2. Roulette and Craps: Expected Value 3.

Combinatorial Optimization,Gerard Cornuejols,SIAM,2001-01-01,"This monograph presents new and elegant proofs of classical results and makes difficult results accessible. The integer programming models known as set packing and set covering have a wide range of applications. Sometimes, owing to the special structure of the constraint matrix, the natural linear programming relaxation yields an optimal solution that is integral, thus solving the problem. Sometimes, both the linear programming relaxation and its dual have integral optimal solutions. Under which conditions do such integrality conditions hold? This question is of both theoretical and practical interest. Min-max theorems, polyhedral combinatorics, and graph theory all come together in this rich area of discrete mathematics.

Teaching to the Math Common Core State Standards,F. D. Rivera,Springer Science & Business Media,2014-02-05,"This is a methods book for elementary majors and preservice/beginning elementary teachers. It takes a very practical approach to learning to teach elementary school mathematics in an emerging Age of the Common Core State Standards. The Common Core State Standards in Mathematics (CCSSM) is not meant to be “the” official mathematics curriculum; it was purposefully developed primarily to provide clear learning expectations of mathematics content that are appropriate at every grade level and to help prepare all students to be ready for college and the workplace. A quick glance at the Table of Contents in this book indicates a serious engagement with the recommended mathematics underlying the kindergarten through grade 5 portions of the CCSSM first, with issues in content-practice assessment, learning, teaching, and classroom management pursued next and in that order. In this book we explore what it means to teach to the CCSSM within an alignment mindset involving content-practice learning, teaching, and assessment. The CCSSM content standards, which pertain to mathematical knowledge, skills, and applications, have been carefully crafted so that they are teachable, learnable, coherent, fewer, clearer, and higher. The practice standards, which refer to institutionally valued mathematical actions, processes, and habits, have been conceptualized in ways that will hopefully encourage all elementary students to engage with the content standards more deeply than merely acquiring mathematical knowledge by rote and imitation. Thus, in the CCSSM, proficiency in content alone is not sufficient, and so does practice without content, which is limited. Content and practice are both equally important and, thus, must come together in teaching, learning, and assessment in order to support authentic mathematical understanding. This blended, multisourced text is a “getting smart” book. It helps elementary majors and preservice/beginning elementary teachers work within the realities of accountable pedagogy and develop a proactive disposition that is capable of supporting all elementary students in order for them to experience growth in mathematical understanding necessary for middle school and beyond, including future careers.",Education,189,N/A,0,en

A multiple Dirichlet series is said to be perfect if it satisfies a finite group of functional equations and has meromorphic continuation everywhere. The earliest examples came from Mellin transforms of metaplectic Eisenstein series and have been intensively studied over the last twenty years. More recently, many other examples have been discovered and it appears that all the classical theorems on moments of $L$-functions as well as the conjectures (such as those predicted by random matrix theory) can now be obtained via the theory of multiple Dirichlet series. Furthermore, new results, not obtainable by other methods, are just coming to light. This volume offers an account of some of the major research to date and the opportunities for the future. It includes an exposition of the main results in the theory of multiple Dirichlet series, and papers on moments of zeta- and $L$-functions, on new examples of multiple Dirichlet",Mathematics,320,N/A,0,en

Chun,CRC Press,2024-12-24,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a complicated science that combines philosophy, cognitive psychology, neuroscience, mathematics and logic (logicism), economics, computer science, computability, and software. Meanwhile, robotics is an engineering field that compliments AI. There can be situations where AI can function without a robot (e.g., Turing Test) and robotics without AI (e.g., teleoperation), but in many cases, each technology requires each other to exhibit a complete system: having ""smart"" robots and AI being able to control its interactions (i.e., effectors) with its environment. This book provides a complete history of computing, AI, and robotics from its early development to state‐of‐the‐art technology, providing a roadmap of these complicated and constantly evolving subjects. Divided into two volumes covering the progress of symbolic logic and the explosion in learning/deep learning in natural language and perception, this first volume investigates the coming together of AI (the mind) and robotics (the body), and discusses the state of AI today. Key Features: Provides a complete overview of the topic of AI, starting with philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and logicism, and extending to the action of the robots and AI needed for a futuristic society Provides a holistic view of AI, and touches on all the misconceptions and tangents to the technologies through taking a systematic approach Provides a glossary of terms, list of notable people, and extensive references Provides the interconnections and history of the progress of technology for over 100 years as both the hardware (Moore’s Law, GPUs) and software, i.e., generative AI, have advanced Intended as a complete reference, this book is useful to undergraduate and postgraduate students of computing, as well as the general reader.

The author investigates efficiency properties (is there another partition that would make everyone at least as happy, and would make at least one player happier, than the present partition?) and fairness properties (do all players think that their piece is at least as large as every other player's piece?). He focuses exclusively on abstract existence results rather than algorithms, and on the geometric objects that arise naturally in this context.

Arranged into three topical sections (Geo- and Physical Sciences; Life Sciences, Ecology and Evolution; Socio-economics and Infrastructure), thirteen chapters address questions such as how to measure biodiversity, what mathematics can say about the sixth mass extinction, how to optimize the long-term human use of natural capital, and the impact of data on infrastructure management. The book also treats the subject of infectious diseases with new examples and presents an introduction to the mathematics of food systems and food security. Each chapter functions as an introduction that can be studied independently, offering source material for graduate student seminars and self-study. The range of featured research topics provides mathematical scientists with starting points for the study of our planet and the impact of human activities. At the same time, it offers application scientists a plethora of modern mathematical tools and techniques to address the various topics in practice. Including hundreds of references to the vast literature associated with each topic, this book serves as an inspiration for further research.",Mathematics,385,N/A,0,en
Learning How to Teach Mathematical Modeling in School and Teacher Education,Rita Borromeo Ferri,Springer,2017-11-26,"This timely resource fills a gap in existing literature on mathematical modeling by presenting both theory- and evidence-based ideas for its teaching and learning. The book outlines four key professional competencies that must be developed in order to effectively and appropriately teach mathematical modeling, and in so doing it seeks to reduce the discrepancies between educational policy and educational research versus everyday teaching practice. Among the key competencies covered are: Theoretical competency for practical work. Task competency for instructional flexibility. Instructional competency for effective and quality lessons. Diagnostic competency for assessment and grading. Learning How to Teach Mathematical Modeling in School and Teacher Education is relevant to practicing and future mathematics teachers at all levels, as well as teacher educators, mathematics education researchers, and undergraduate and graduate mathematics students interested in research based methods for teaching mathematical modeling.",Education,163,N/A,0,en

Chaos: A Mathematical Introduction,"John Banks, Valentina Dragan, Arthur Jones",Cambridge University Press,2003-05-08,"When new ideas like chaos first move into the mathematical limelight, the early textbooks tend to be very difficult. The concepts are new and it takes time to find ways to present them in a form digestible to the average student. This process may take a generation, but eventually, what originally seemed far too advanced for all but the most mathematically sophisticated becomes accessible to a much wider readership. This book takes some major steps along that path of generational change. It presents ideas about chaos in discrete time dynamics in a form where they should be accessible to anyone who has taken a first course in undergraduate calculus. More remarkably, it manages to do so without discarding a commitment to mathematical substance and rigour. The book evolved from a very popular one-semester middle level undergraduate course over a period of several years and has therefore been well class-tested.",Mathematics,310,N/A,0,en

Value Distribution Theory and Related Topics,"Grigor A. Barsegian, Ilpo Laine, Chung-Chun Yang",Springer Science & Business Media,2006-05-02,"The Nevanlinna theory of value distribution of meromorphic functions, one of the milestones of complex analysis during the last century, was c- ated to extend the classical results concerning the distribution of of entire functions to the more general setting of meromorphic functions. Later on, a similar reasoning has been applied to algebroid functions, subharmonic functions and meromorphic functions on Riemann surfaces as well as to - alytic functions of several complex variables, holomorphic and meromorphic mappings and to the theory of minimal surfaces. Moreover, several appli- tions of the theory have been exploited, including complex differential and functional equations, complex dynamics and Diophantine equations. The main emphasis of this collection is to direct attention to a number of recently developed novel ideas and generalizations that relate to the - velopment of value distribution theory and its applications. In particular, we mean a recent theory that replaces the conventional consideration of counting within a disc by an analysis of their geometric locations. Another such example is presented by the generalizations of the second main theorem to higher dimensional cases by using the jet theory. Moreover, s- ilar ideas apparently may be applied to several related areas as well, such as to partial differential equations and to differential geometry. Indeed, most of these applications go back to the problem of analyzing zeros of certain complex or real functions, meaning in fact to investigate level sets or level surfaces.",Mathematics,331,N/A,0,en

Mathematics of Finance,Donald G. Saari,Springer Nature,2019-08-31,"This textbook invites the reader to develop a holistic grounding in mathematical finance, where concepts and intuition play as important a role as powerful mathematical tools. Financial interactions are characterized by a vast amount of data and uncertainty; navigating the inherent dangers and hidden opportunities requires a keen understanding of what techniques to apply and when. By exploring the conceptual foundations of options pricing, the author equips readers to choose their tools with a critical eye and adapt to emerging challenges. Introducing the basics of gambles through realistic scenarios, the text goes on to build the core financial techniques of Puts, Calls, hedging, and arbitrage. Chapters on modeling and probability lead into the centerpiece: the Black–Scholes equation. Omitting the mechanics of solving Black–Scholes itself, the presentation instead focuses on an in-depth analysis of its derivation and solutions. Advanced topics that follow include the Greeks, American options, and embellishments. Throughout, the author presents topics in an engaging conversational style. “Intuition breaks” frequently prompt students to set aside mathematical details and think critically about the relevance of tools in context. Mathematics of Finance is ideal for undergraduates from a variety of backgrounds, including mathematics, economics, statistics, data science, and computer science. Students should have experience with the standard calculus sequence, as well as a familiarity with differential equations and probability. No financial expertise is assumed of student or instructor; in fact, the text’s deep connection to mathematical ideas makes it suitable for a math capstone course. A complete set of the author’s lecture videos is available on YouTube, providing a comprehensive supplementary resource for a course or independent study.",Mathematics,155,N/A,0,en

Handbook of Diversity Issues in Health Psychology,"Pamela M. Kato, Traci Mann",Springer Science & Business Media,2007-07-27,"The field of health psychology has grown dramatically in the last decade, with exciting new developments in the study of how psychological and psychosocial processes contribute to risk for and disease sequelae for a variety of medical problems. In addition, the quality and effectiveness of many of our treatments, and health promotion and disease prevention efforts, have been significantly enhanced by the contributions of health psychologists (Taylor, 1995). Unfortunately, however, much of the theo rizing in health psychology and the empirical research that derives from it continue to reflect the mainstream bias of psychology and medicine, both of which have a primary focus on white, heterosexual, middle-class American men. This bias pervades our thinking despite the demographic heterogeneity of American society (U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1992) and the substantial body of epidemiologic evidence that indicates significant group differences in health status, burden of morbidity and mortality, life expectancy, quality of life, and the risk and protective factors that con tribute to these differences in health outcomes (National Center for Health Statistics, 1994; Myers, Kagawa-Singer, Kumanyika, Lex, & M- kides, 1995). There is also substantial evidence that many of the health promotion and disease prevention efforts that have proven effective with more affluent, educated whites, on whom they were developed, may not yield comparable results when used with populations that differ by eth nicity, social class, gender, or sexual orientation (Cochran & Mays, 1991; Castro, Coe, Gutierres, & Saenz, this volume; Chesney & Nealey, this volume).",Psychology,453,N/A,0,en

Integrating Differentiated Instruction and Understanding by Design,"Carol Ann Tomlinson, Jay McTighe",ASCD,2006-01-15,"Teachers struggle every day to bring quality instruction to their students. Beset by lists of content standards and accompanying ""high-stakes"" accountability tests, many educators sense that both teaching and learning have been redirected in ways that are potentially impoverishing for those who teach and those who learn. Educators need a model that acknowledges the centrality of standards but also ensures that students truly understand content and can apply it in meaningful ways. For many educators, Understanding by Design addresses that need. Simultaneously, teachers find it increasingly difficult to ignore the diversity of the learners who populate their classrooms. Few teachers find their work effective or satisfying when they simply ""serve up"" a curriculum—even an elegant one—to students with no regard for their varied learning needs. For many educators, Differentiated Instruction offers a framework for addressing learner variance as a critical component of instructional planning. In this book the two models converge, providing readers fresh perspectives on two of the greatest contemporary challenges for educators: crafting powerful curriculum in a standards-dominated era and ensuring academic success for the full spectrum of learners. Each model strengthens the other. Understanding by Design is predominantly a curriculum design model that focuses on what we teach. Differentiated Instruction focuses on whom we teach, where we teach, and how we teach. Carol Ann Tomlinson and Jay McTighe show you how to use the principles of backward design and differentiation together to craft lesson plans that will teach essential knowledge and skills for the full spectrum of learners. Connecting content and kids in meaningful ways is what teachers strive to do every day. In tandem, UbD and DI help educators meet that goal by providing structures, tools, and guidance for developing curriculum and instruction that bring to students the best of what we know about effective teaching and learning.",Education,209,N/A,0,en
Advanced Engineering Mathematics with MATLAB,Dean G. Duffy,CRC Press,2021-12-30,"In the four previous editions the author presented a text firmly grounded in the mathematics that engineers and scientists must understand and know how to use. Tapping into decades of teaching at the US Navy Academy and the US Military Academy and serving for twenty-five years at (NASA) Goddard Space Flight, he combines a teaching and practical experience that is rare among authors of advanced engineering mathematics books. This edition offers a smaller, easier to read, and useful version of this classic textbook. While competing textbooks continue to grow, the book presents a slimmer, more concise option. Instructors and students alike are rejecting the encyclopedic tome with its higher and higher price aimed at undergraduates. To assist in the choice of topics included in this new edition, the author reviewed the syllabi of various engineering mathematics courses that are taught at a wide variety of schools. Due to time constraints an instructor can select perhaps three to four topics from the book, the most likely being ordinary differential equations, Laplace transforms, Fourier series and separation of variables to solve the wave, heat, or Laplace's equation. Laplace transforms are occasionally replaced by linear algebra or vector calculus. Sturm-Liouville problem and special functions (Legendre and Bessel functions) are included for completeness. Topics such as z-transforms and complex variables are now offered in a companion book, Advanced Engineering Mathematics: A Second Course by the same author. MATLAB is still employed to reinforce the concepts that are taught. Of course, this Edition continues to offer a wealth of examples and applications from the scientific and engineering literature, a highlight of previous editions.

In addition, they will develop an appreciation of the different methods of proof (contradiction, induction), the value of a proof, and the beauty of an elegant argument. The authors emphasize that mathematics is an ongoing, vibrant disciplineits long, fascinating history continually intersects with territory still uncharted and questions still in need of answers. The authors extensive background in teaching mathematics shines through in this balanced, explicit, and engaging text, designed as a primer for higher- level mathematics courses. They elegantly demonstrate process and application and recognize the byproducts of both the achievements and the missteps of past thinkers. Chapters 1-5 introduce the fundamentals of abstract mathematics and chapters 6-8 apply the ideas and techniques, placing the earlier material in a real context. Readers interest is continually piqued by the use of clear explanations, practical examples, discussion and discovery exercises, and historical comments.",Mathematics,344,N/A,0,en

A Mathematician's Apology,G. H. Hardy,Cambridge University Press,1992-01-31,"G. H. Hardy was one of this century's finest mathematical thinkers, renowned among his contemporaries as a 'real mathematician ... the purest of the pure'. He was also, as C. P. Snow recounts in his Foreword, 'unorthodox, eccentric, radical, ready to talk about anything'. This 'apology', written in 1940 as his mathematical powers were declining, offers a brilliant and engaging account of mathematics as very much more than a science; when it was first published, Graham Greene hailed it alongside Henry James's notebooks as 'the best account of what it was like to be a creative artist'. C. P. Snow's Foreword gives sympathetic and witty insights into Hardy's life, with its rich store of anecdotes concerning his collaboration with the brilliant Indian mathematician Ramanujan, his aphorisms and idiosyncrasies, and his passion for cricket. This is a unique account of the fascination of mathematics and of one of its most compelling exponents in modern times.",Mathematics,158,4.5,10,en

Essential Mathematics for Undergraduates,Simon G. Chiossi,Springer,2022-02-17,"This textbook covers topics of undergraduate mathematics in abstract algebra, geometry, topology and analysis with the purpose of connecting the underpinning key ideas. It guides STEM students towards developing knowledge and skills to enrich their scientific education. In doing so it avoids the common mechanical approach to problem-solving based on the repetitive application of dry formulas. The presentation preserves the mathematical rigour throughout and still stays accessible to undergraduates. The didactical focus is threaded through the assortment of subjects and reflects in the book’s structure. Part 1 introduces the mathematical language and its rules together with the basic building blocks. Part 2 discusses the number systems of common practice, while the backgrounds needed to solve equations and inequalities are developed in Part 3. Part 4 breaks down the traditional, outdated barriers between areas, exploring in particular the interplay between algebra and geometry. Two appendices form Part 5: the Greek etymology of frequent terms and a list of mathematicians mentioned in the book. Abundant examples and exercises are disseminated along the text to boost the learning process and allow for independent work. Students will find invaluable material to shepherd them through the first years of an undergraduate course, or to complement previously learnt subject matters.

"The New Era in American Mathematics, 1920–1950",Karen Hunger Parshall,Princeton University Press,2022-02-22,"A meticulously researched history on the development of American mathematics in the three decades following World War I As the Roaring Twenties lurched into the Great Depression, to be followed by the scourge of Nazi Germany and World War II, American mathematicians pursued their research, positioned themselves collectively within American science, and rose to global mathematical hegemony. How did they do it? The New Era in American Mathematics, 1920–1950 explores the institutional, financial, social, and political forces that shaped and supported this community in the first half of the twentieth century. In doing so, Karen Hunger Parshall debunks the widely held view that American mathematics only thrived after European émigrés fled to the shores of the United States. Drawing from extensive archival and primary-source research, Parshall uncovers the key players in American mathematics who worked together to effect change and she looks at their research output over the course of three decades. She highlights the educational, professional, philanthropic, and governmental entities that bolstered progress. And she uncovers the strategies implemented by American mathematicians in their quest for the advancement of knowledge. Throughout, she considers how geopolitical circumstances shifted the course of the discipline. Examining how the American mathematical community asserted itself on the international stage, The New Era in American Mathematics, 1920–1950 shows the way one nation became the focal point for the field.",Mathematics,640,N/A,0,en

Mathematics of Big Data,"Jeremy Kepner, Hayden Jananthan",MIT Press,2018-08-07,"The first book to present the common mathematical foundations of big data analysis across a range of applications and technologies. Today, the volume, velocity, and variety of data are increasing rapidly across a range of fields, including Internet search, healthcare, finance, social media, wireless devices, and cybersecurity. Indeed, these data are growing at a rate beyond our capacity to analyze them. The tools—including spreadsheets, databases, matrices, and graphs—developed to address this challenge all reflect the need to store and operate on data as whole sets rather than as individual elements. This book presents the common mathematical foundations of these data sets that apply across many applications and technologies. Associative arrays unify and simplify data, allowing readers to look past the differences among the various tools and leverage their mathematical similarities in order to solve the hardest big data challenges. The book first introduces the concept of the associative array in practical terms, presents the associative array manipulation system D4M (Dynamic Distributed Dimensional Data Model), and describes the application of associative arrays to graph analysis and machine learning. It provides a mathematically rigorous definition of associative arrays and describes the properties of associative arrays that arise from this definition. Finally, the book shows how concepts of linearity can be extended to encompass associative arrays. Mathematics of Big Data can be used as a textbook or reference by engineers, scientists, mathematicians, computer scientists, and software engineers who analyze big data.",Computers,443,N/A,0,en

Applied Mathematics for Physical Chemistry,James R. Barrante,Waveland Press,2016-02-10,"By the time chemistry students are ready to study physical chemistry, they’ve completed mathematics courses through calculus. But a strong background in mathematics doesn’t necessarily equate to knowledge of how to apply that mathematics to solving physicochemical problems. In addition, in-depth understanding of modern concepts in physical chemistry requires knowledge of mathematical concepts and techniques beyond introductory calculus, such as differential equations, Fourier series, and Fourier transforms. This results in many physical chemistry instructors spending valuable lecture time teaching mathematics rather than chemistry. Barrante presents both basic and advanced mathematical techniques in the context of how they apply to physical chemistry. Many problems at the end of each chapter test students’ mathematical knowledge. Designed and priced to accompany traditional core textbooks in physical chemistry, Applied Mathematics for Physical Chemistry provides students with the tools essential for answering questions in thermodynamics, atomic/molecular structure, spectroscopy, and statistical mechanics.",Science,256,N/A,0,en

A Mathematics Course for Political and Social Research,"Will H. Moore, David A. Siegel",Princeton University Press,2013-08-11,"Political science and sociology increasingly rely on mathematical modeling and sophisticated data analysis, and many graduate programs in these fields now require students to take a ""math camp"" or a semester-long or yearlong course to acquire the necessary skills. Available textbooks are written for mathematics or economics majors, and fail to convey to students of political science and sociology the reasons for learning often-abstract mathematical concepts. A Mathematics Course for Political and Social Research fills this gap, providing both a primer for math novices in the social sciences and a handy reference for seasoned researchers. The book begins with the fundamental building blocks of mathematics and basic algebra, then goes on to cover essential subjects such as calculus in one and more than one variable, including optimization, constrained optimization, and implicit functions; linear algebra, including Markov chains and eigenvectors; and probability. It describes the intermediate steps most other textbooks leave out, features numerous exercises throughout, and grounds all concepts by illustrating their use and importance in political science and sociology.

Numerical Mathematics,Jeffrey S. Ovall ,SIAM,2024-10-24,"This textbook introduces key numerical algorithms used for problems arising in three core areas of scientific computing: calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra. Theoretical results supporting the derivation and error analysis of algorithms are given rigorous justification in the text and exercises, and a wide variety of detailed computational examples further enhance the understanding of key concepts. Numerical Mathematics includes topics not typically discussed in similar texts at this level, such as a Fourier-based analysis of the trapezoid rule, finite volume methods for the 2D Poisson problem, the Nyström method for approximating the solution of integral equations, and the relatively new FEAST method for targeting clusters of eigenvalues and their eigenvectors. An early emphasis is given to recognizing or deducing orders of convergence in practice, which is essential for assessing algorithm performance and debugging computational software. Numerical experiments complement many of the theorems concerning convergence, illustrating typical behavior of the associated algorithms when the assumptions of the theorems are satisfied and when they are not. This book is intended for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students in mathematics seeking a solid foundation in the theory and practice of scientific computing. Students and researchers in other disciplines who want a fuller understanding of the principles underlying these algorithms will also find it useful. The text is divided into three parts, corresponding to numerical methods for problems in calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra. Each part can be used for a one-term course (quarter or semester), making the book suitable for a two- or three-term sequence in numerical analysis or for largely independent courses on any of the three main topics.",Mathematics,629,N/A,0,en

Following this turn, the interest in scientific practices continued to increase and had an indelible influence in the various fields of science studies. No doubt, the practice turn changed our conceptions and approaches of science, but what did it really teach us? What does it mean to study scientific practices? What are the general lessons, implications, and new challenges? This volume explores questions about the practice turn using both case studies and theoretical analysis.

Developing Mathematical Proficiency for Elementary Instruction is organized to probe the specifics of mathematical proficiency that are important to elementary teachers during two separate but inter-connected professional stages: as pre-service teachers in a preparation program, and as in-service teachers teaching mathematics in elementary classrooms. From this rich and inspiring collection, readers may better understand, and possibly rethink, their own practices and research in empowering elementary teachers mathematically and pedagogically, as educators or researchers.",Education,305,N/A,0,en

An Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming in C++,Graham M. Seed,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Why Another Book on c++ and why Programming and Graphics? Anyone who has browsed through the 'Computing' section of a bookshop (assuming it has one) will not need much convincing that there are a lot of C++ books out there. So why add yet another to the shelf! This book attempts to introduce you to the C++ language via computer graphics because the object-oriented programming features of C++ naturally lend themselves to graphics. Thus, this book is based around a central theme: computer graphics and the development of 'real' object-oriented tools for graphical modelling. This approach is adopted (as opposed to learning by small, unrelated, often hypothetical, examples) because I didn't want to introduce C++ as a collection oflanguage features. While introducing the syntax and features of C++, it is just as important to demonstrate simultaneously the reason for such features and when to apply them - in otherwords,language and design are given equal priority. Also, a key objective in writing this book is to present you with a comprehensive introductory text on programming in the C++ language.",Computers,1072,N/A,0,en
Microelectronics Education,"B. Courtois, N. Guillemot, G. Kamarinos, G. Stéhelin",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-03-09,"This is the third edition of the European Workshop on Microelectronics Education (EWME). A steady-state regime has now been reached. An international community of university teachers is constituted; they exchange their experience and their pedagogical tools. They discuss the best ways to transfer the rapidly changing techniques to their students, and to introduce them to the new physical and mathematical concepts and models for the innovative techniques, devices, circuits and design methods. The number of abstracts submitted to EWME 2000 (about one hundred) enabled the scientific committee to proceed to a clear selection. EWME is a European meeting. Indeed, authors from 20 different European countries contribute to this volume. Nevertheless, the participation of authors from Brazil, Canada, China, New Zealand, and USA, shows that the workshop gradually attains an international dimension. th The 20 century can be characterized as the ""century of electron"". The electron, as an elementary particle, was discovered by J.J. Thomson in 1897, and was rapidly used to transfer energy and information. Thanks to electron, universe and micro-cosmos could be explored. Electron became the omnipotent and omnipresent, almost immaterial, angel of our W orId. This was made possible thanks to electronics and, for the last 30 years, to microelectronics. Microelectronics not only modified and even radically transformed the industrial and the every-day landscapes, but it also led to the so-called ""information revolution"" with which begins the 21 st century.",Technology & Engineering,315,N/A,0,en

Social History of Nineteenth Century Mathematics,"Mehrtens, Hendrik (Short form: Henk) Hendriks, Ivo Schneider",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"During the last few decades historians of science have shown a growing interest in science as a cultural activity and have regarded science more and more as part of the gene ral developments that have occurred in society. This trend has been less evident arnong historians of mathematics, who traditionally concentrate primarily on tracing the develop ment of mathematical knowledge itself. To some degree this restriction is connected with the special role of mathematics compared with the other sciences; mathematics typifies the most objective, most coercive type of knowledge, and there fore seems to be least affected by social influences. Nevertheless, biography, institutional history and his tory of national developments have long been elements in the historiography of mathematics. This interest in the social aspects of mathematics has widened recently through the stu dy of other themes, such as the relation of mathematics to the development of the educational system. Some scholars have begun to apply the methods of historical sociology of knowledge to mathematics; others have attempted to give a ix x Marxist analysis of the connection between mathematics and productive forces, and there have been philosophical studies about the communication processes involved in the production of mathematical knowledge. An interest in causal analyses of historical processes has led to the study of other factors influencing the development of mathematics, such as the f- mation of mathematical schools, the changes in the profes- onal situation of the mathematician and the general cultural milieu of the mathematical scientist.",Mathematics,307,N/A,0,en

Inventing the Mathematician,Sara N. Hottinger,State University of New York Press,2016-03-01,"Where and how do we, as a culture, get our ideas about mathematics and about who can engage with mathematical knowledge? Sara N. Hottinger uses a cultural studies approach to address how our ideas about mathematics shape our individual and cultural relationship to the field. She considers four locations in which representations of mathematics contribute to our cultural understanding of mathematics: mathematics textbooks, the history of mathematics, portraits of mathematicians, and the field of ethnomathematics. Hottinger examines how these discourses shape mathematical subjectivity by limiting the way some groups—including women and people of color—are able to see themselves as practitioners of math. Inventing the Mathematician provides a blueprint for how to engage in a deconstructive project, revealing the limited and problematic nature of the normative construction of mathematical subjectivity.",Mathematics,217,N/A,0,en

Mathematics as an Educational Task,Hans Freudenthal,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Like preludes, prefaces are usually composed last. Putting them in the front of the book is a feeble reflection of what, in the style of mathe matics treatises and textbooks, I usually call thf didactical inversion: to be fit to print, the way to the result should be the inverse of the order in which it was found; in particular the key definitions, which were the finishing touch to the structure, are put at the front. For many years I have contrasted the didactical inversion with the thought-experiment. It is true that you should not communicate your mathematics to other people in the way it occurred to you, but rather as it could have occurred to you if you had known then what you know now, and as it would occur to the student if his learning process is being guided. This in fact is the gist of the lesson Socrates taught Meno's slave. The thought-experi ment tries to find out how a student could re-invent what he is expected to learn. I said about the preface that it is a feeble reflection of the didactical inversion. Indeed, it is not a constituent part of the book. It can even be torn out. Yet it is useful.

Advanced Mathematics,"John H. Saxon, Jr., Saxon",Saxon Pub,1999-07,"Saxon math programs produce confident students who are not only able to correctly compute, but also to apply concepts to new situations. These materials gently develop concepts, and the practice of those concepts is extended over a considerable period of time. This is called ""incremental development and continual review."" Material is introduced in easily understandable pieces (increments), allowing students to grasp one facet of a concept before the next one is introduced. Both facets are then practiced together until another one is introduced. This feature is combined with continual review in every lesson throughout the year. Topics are never dropped but are increased in complexity and practiced every day, providing the time required for concepts to become totally familiar. Advanced Mathematics, second edition is made up of five instructional components: Introduction of the New Increment, Examples with complete Solutions, Practice of the Increment, Daily Problem Set, and Cumulative Tests. In Advanced Mathematics, topics from algebra, geometry, trigonometry, discrete mathematics, and mathematical analysis are interwoven to form a fully integrated text. A rigorous treatment of Euclidean geometry is also presented. Word problems are developed throughout the problem sets and become progressively more elaborate. With this practice, students will be able to solve challenging problems such as rate problems and work problems involving abstract quantities. A graphing calculator is used to graph functions and perform data analysis. Conceptually-oriented problems that prepare students for college entrance exams (such as the ACT and SAT) are included in the problem sets. This set contains a student text, answer key and test forms. A solutions manual is sold separately. Grade 11.",Education,0,N/A,0,en

An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography,"Jeffrey Hoffstein, Jill Pipher, Joseph H. Silverman",Springer,2014-09-11,"This self-contained introduction to modern cryptography emphasizes the mathematics behind the theory of public key cryptosystems and digital signature schemes. The book focuses on these key topics while developing the mathematical tools needed for the construction and security analysis of diverse cryptosystems. Only basic linear algebra is required of the reader; techniques from algebra, number theory, and probability are introduced and developed as required. This text provides an ideal introduction for mathematics and computer science students to the mathematical foundations of modern cryptography. The book includes an extensive bibliography and index; supplementary materials are available online. The book covers a variety of topics that are considered central to mathematical cryptography. Key topics include: classical cryptographic constructions, such as Diffie–Hellmann key exchange, discrete logarithm-based cryptosystems, the RSA cryptosystem, and digital signatures; fundamental mathematical tools for cryptography, including primality testing, factorization algorithms, probability theory, information theory, and collision algorithms; an in-depth treatment of important cryptographic innovations, such as elliptic curves, elliptic curve and pairing-based cryptography, lattices, lattice-based cryptography, and the NTRU cryptosystem. The second edition of An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography includes a significant revision of the material on digital signatures, including an earlier introduction to RSA, Elgamal, and DSA signatures, and new material on lattice-based signatures and rejection sampling. Many sections have been rewritten or expanded for clarity, especially in the chapters on information theory, elliptic curves, and lattices, and the chapter of additional topics has been expanded to include sections on digital cash and homomorphic encryption. Numerous new exercises have been included.",Mathematics,549,N/A,0,en

The Construction of New Mathematical Knowledge in Classroom Interaction,Heinz Steinbring,Springer Science & Business Media,2006-03-30,"Mathematics is generally considered as the only science where knowledge is uni form, universal, and free from contradictions. „Mathematics is a social product - a 'net of norms', as Wittgenstein writes. In contrast to other institutions - traffic rules, legal systems or table manners -, which are often internally contradictory and are hardly ever unrestrictedly accepted, mathematics is distinguished by coherence and consensus. Although mathematics is presumably the discipline, which is the most differentiated internally, the corpus of mathematical knowledge constitutes a coher ent whole. The consistency of mathematics cannot be proved, yet, so far, no contra dictions were found that would question the uniformity of mathematics"" (Heintz, 2000, p. 11). The coherence of mathematical knowledge is closely related to the kind of pro fessional communication that research mathematicians hold about mathematical knowledge. In an extensive study, Bettina Heintz (Heintz 2000) proposed that the historical development of formal mathematical proof was, in fact, a means of estab lishing a communicable „code of conduct"" which helped mathematicians make themselves understood in relation to the truth of mathematical statements in a co ordinated and unequivocal way.",Education,242,N/A,0,en

Revisiting Mathematics Education,Hans Freudenthal,Springer Science & Business Media,2005-12-08,"This book is a product of love and respect. If that sounds rather odd I initially apologise, but let me explain why I use those words. The original manuscript was of course Freudenthal’s, but his colleagues have carried the project through to its conclusion with love for the man, and his ideas, and with a respect developed over years of communal effort. Their invitation to me to write this Preface e- bles me to pay my respects to the great man, although I am probably incurring his wrath for writing a Preface for his book without his permission! I just hope he understands the feelings of all colleagues engaged in this particular project. Hans Freudenthal died on October 13th, 1990 when this book project was well in hand. In fact he wrote to me in April 1988, saying “I am thinking about a new book. I have got the sub-title (China Lectures) though I still lack a title”. I was astonished. He had retired in 1975, but of course he kept working. Then in 1985 we had been helping him celebrate his 80th birthday, and although I said in an Editorial Statement in Educational Studies in Mathematics (ESM) at the time “we look forward to him enjoying many more years of non-retirement” I did not expect to see another lengthy manuscript.",Education,209,N/A,0,en

Imagining the Mathematician,Sara N. Hottinger,N/A,2017-01-02,"Where and how do we, as a culture, get our ideas about mathematics and about who can engage with mathematical knowledge? Sara N. Hottinger uses a cultural studies approach to address how our ideas about mathematics shape our individual and cultural relationship to the field. She considers four locations in which representations of mathematics contribute to our cultural understanding of mathematics: mathematics textbooks, the history of mathematics, portraits of mathematicians, and the field of ethnomathematics. Hottinger examines how these discourses shape mathematical subjectivity by limiting the way some groups including women and people of color are able to see themselves as practitioners of math. Inventing the Mathematician provides a blueprint for how to engage in a deconstructive project, revealing the limited and problematic nature of the normative construction of mathematical subjectivity.""",Education,215,N/A,0,en

The Applicability of Mathematics as a Philosophical Problem,Mark Steiner,Harvard University Press,2009-07-01,"This book analyzes the different ways mathematics is applicable in the physical sciences, and presents a startling thesis--the success of mathematical physics appears to assign the human mind a special place in the cosmos. Mark Steiner distinguishes among the semantic problems that arise from the use of mathematics in logical deduction; the metaphysical problems that arise from the alleged gap between mathematical objects and the physical world; the descriptive problems that arise from the use of mathematics to describe nature; and the epistemological problems that arise from the use of mathematics to discover those very descriptions. The epistemological problems lead to the thesis about the mind. It is frequently claimed that the universe is indifferent to human goals and values, and therefore, Locke and Peirce, for example, doubted science's ability to discover the laws governing the humanly unobservable. Steiner argues that, on the contrary, these laws were discovered, using manmade mathematical analogies, resulting in an anthropocentric picture of the universe as ""user friendly"" to human cognition--a challenge to the entrenched dogma of naturalism.",Mathematics,224,N/A,0,en

The Mathematics of Paul Erdös I,"Ronald Lewis Graham, Jaroslav Nesetril",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"In 1992, when Paul Erdos was awarded a Doctor Honoris Causa by Charles University in Prague, a small conference was held, bringing together a distin guished group of researchers with interests spanning a variety of fields related to Erdos' own work. At that gathering, the idea occurred to several of us that it might be quite appropriate at this point in Erdos' career to solicit a col lection of articles illustrating various aspects of Erdos' mathematical life and work. The response to our solicitation was immediate and overwhelming, and these volumes are the result. Regarding the organization, we found it convenient to arrange the papers into six chapters, each mirroring Erdos' holistic approach to mathematics. Our goal was not merely a (random) collection of papers but rather a thor oughly edited volume composed in large part by articles explicitly solicited to illustrate interesting aspects of Erdos and his life and work. Each chap ter includes an introduction which often presents a sample of related ErdOs' problems ""in his own words"". All these (sometimes lengthy) introductions were written jointly by editors. We wish to thank the nearly 70 contributors for their outstanding efforts (and their patience). In particular, we are grateful to Bela Bollobas for his extensive documentation of Paul Erdos' early years and mathematical high points (in the first part of this volume); our other authors are acknowledged in their respective chapters.

Algebra and Geometry,"Hung-Hsi Wu, Hongxi Wu",American Mathematical Soc.,2020-09-08,"This is the second of three volumes that, together, give an exposition of the mathematics of grades 9–12 that is simultaneously mathematically correct and grade-level appropriate. The volumes are consistent with CCSSM (Common Core State Standards for Mathematics) and aim at presenting the mathematics of K–12 as a totally transparent subject. The first part of this volume is devoted to the study of standard algebra topics: quadratic functions, graphs of equations of degree 2 in two variables, polynomials, exponentials and logarithms, complex numbers and the fundamental theorem of algebra, and the binomial theorem. Having translations and the concept of similarity at our disposal enables us to clarify the study of quadratic functions by concentrating on their graphs, the same way the study of linear functions is greatly clarified by knowing that their graphs are lines. We also introduce the concept of formal algebra in the study of polynomials with complex coefficients. The last three chapters in this volume complete the systematic exposition of high school geometry that is consistent with CCSSM. These chapters treat the geometry of the triangle and the circle, ruler and compass constructions, and a general discussion of axiomatic systems, including non-Euclidean geometry and the celebrated work of Hilbert on the foundations. This book should be useful for current and future teachers of K–12 mathematics, as well as for some high school students and for education professionals.",Education,417,N/A,0,en

Introduction to the Foundations of Applied Mathematics,Mark H. Holmes,Springer,2020-10-15,"The objective of this textbook is the construction, analysis, and interpretation of mathematical models to help us understand the world we live in. Rather than follow a case study approach it develops the mathematical and physical ideas that are fundamental in understanding contemporary problems in science and engineering. Science evolves, and this means that the problems of current interest continually change. What does not change as quickly is the approach used to derive the relevant mathematical models, and the methods used to analyze the models. Consequently, this book is written in such a way as to establish the mathematical ideas underlying model development independently of a specific application. This does not mean applications are not considered, they are, and connections with experiment are a staple of this book. The book, as well as the individual chapters, is written in such a way that the material becomes more sophisticated as you progress. This provides some flexibility in how the book is used, allowing consideration for the breadth and depth of the material covered. Moreover, there are a wide spectrum of exercises and detailed illustrations that significantly enrich the material. Students and researchers interested in mathematical modelling in mathematics, physics, engineering and the applied sciences will find this text useful. The material, and topics, have been updated to include recent developments in mathematical modeling. The exercises have also been expanded to include these changes, as well as enhance those from the first edition. Review of first edition: ""The goal of this book is to introduce the mathematical tools needed for analyzing and deriving mathematical models. ... Holmes is able to integrate the theory with application in a very nice way providing an excellent book on applied mathematics. ... One of the best features of the book is the abundant number of exercises found at the end of each chapter. ... I think this is a great book, and I recommend it for scholarly purposes by students, teachers, and researchers.""

How People Learn,"National Research Council, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Board on Behavioral, Cognitive, and Sensory Sciences, Committee on Developments in the Science of Learning with additional material from the Committee on Learning Research and Educational Practice",National Academies Press,2000-08-11,"First released in the Spring of 1999, How People Learn has been expanded to show how the theories and insights from the original book can translate into actions and practice, now making a real connection between classroom activities and learning behavior. This edition includes far-reaching suggestions for research that could increase the impact that classroom teaching has on actual learning. Like the original edition, this book offers exciting new research about the mind and the brain that provides answers to a number of compelling questions. When do infants begin to learn? How do experts learn and how is this different from non-experts? What can teachers and schools do-with curricula, classroom settings, and teaching methodsâ€""to help children learn most effectively? New evidence from many branches of science has significantly added to our understanding of what it means to know, from the neural processes that occur during learning to the influence of culture on what people see and absorb. How People Learn examines these findings and their implications for what we teach, how we teach it, and how we assess what our children learn. The book uses exemplary teaching to illustrate how approaches based on what we now know result in in-depth learning. This new knowledge calls into question concepts and practices firmly entrenched in our current education system. Topics include: How learning actually changes the physical structure of the brain. How existing knowledge affects what people notice and how they learn. What the thought processes of experts tell us about how to teach. The amazing learning potential of infants. The relationship of classroom learning and everyday settings of community and workplace. Learning needs and opportunities for teachers.

Lectures on Numerical Mathematics,H.

Rutishauser held at the E.T.H. in Zurich. The first-named course was newly conceived in the spring semester of 1970, and intended for beginners, while the two others were given repeatedly as elective courses in the sixties. For an understanding of most chapters the funda mentals of linear algebra and calculus suffice. In some places a little complex variable theory is used in addition. However, the reader can get by without any knowledge of functional analysis. The first seven chapters discuss the direct solution of systems of linear equations, the solution of nonlinear systems, least squares prob lems, interpolation by polynomials, numerical quadrature, and approxima tion by Chebyshev series and by Remez' algorithm. The remaining chapters include the treatment of ordinary and partial differential equa tions, the iterative solution of linear equations, and a discussion of eigen value problems. In addition, there is an appendix dealing with the qd algorithm and with an axiomatic treatment of computer arithmetic.",Mathematics,559,N/A,0,en

Teaching School Mathematics: Pre-Algebra,Hung-Hsi Wu:,American Mathematical Soc.,2016-06-29,"This is a systematic exposition of a major part of the mathematics of grades 5 to 8 (excluding statistics), written specifically for Common Core era teachers. It differs from other books for teachers in that the mathematics is correct, in the sense that all the concepts are clearly and correctly defined, and a grade-appropriate explanation (that is, proof) is given for every assertion. For example, it gives a precise definition of percent and explains how to use the definition to do all the standard problems about percent in an entirely routine manner. It also gives a leisurely explanation for “negative times negative is positive”. Another key feature is an intuitive introduction to plane geometry via rotations, translations, reflections, and dilations that, instead of treating these transformations as merely fun activities, shows how they make sense of the usual geometric topics in middle school, including congruence, similarity, length, area, and volume. In short, the readers will find in this volume a clear explanation of whatever was once puzzling to them in the mathematics of grades 5 to 8.",Education,407,N/A,0,en

Mathematics and Mechanics - The Interplay,Luigi Morino,Springer Nature,2021-06-19,"Mathematics plays an important role in mechanics and other human endeavours. Validating examples in this first volume include, for instance: the connection between the golden ratio (the “divine proportion"" used by Phidias and many other artists and enshrined in Leonardo's Vitruvian Man, shown on the front cover), and the Fibonacci spiral (observable in botany, e.g., in the placement of sunflower seeds); is the coast of Tuscany infinitely long?; the equal-time free fall of a feather and a lead ball in a vacuum; a simple diagnostic for changing your car's shocks; the Kepler laws of the planets; the dynamics of the Sun-Earth-Moon system; the tides' mechanism; the laws of friction and a wheel rolling down a partially icy slope; and many more. The style is colloquial. The emphasis is on intuition - lengthy but intuitive proofs are preferred to simple non-intuitive ones. The mathematical/mechanical sophistication gradually increases, making the volume widely accessible. Intuition is not at the expense of rigor. Except for grammar-school material, every statement that is later used is rigorously proven. Guidelines that facilitate the reading of the book are presented. The interplay between mathematics and mechanics is presented within a historical context, to show that often mechanics stimulated mathematical developments - Newton comes to mind. Sometimes mathematics was introduced independently of its mechanics applications, such as the absolute calculus for Einstein's general theory of relativity. Bio-sketches of all the scientists encountered are included and show that many of them dealt with both mathematics and mechanics.",Technology & Engineering,1019,N/A,0,en

Mathematics Rebooted,Lara Alcock,Oxford University Press,2017-09-29,"Would you like to understand more mathematics? Many people would. Perhaps at school you liked mathematics for a while but were then put off because you missed a key idea and kept getting stuck. Perhaps you always liked mathematics but gave it up because your main interest was music or languages or science or philosophy. Or perhaps you studied mathematics to advanced levels, but have now forgotten most of what you once knew. Whichever is the case, this book is for you. It aims to build on what you know, revisiting basic ideas with a focus on meaning. Each chapter starts with an idea from school mathematics - often primary school mathematics - and gradually builds up a network of links to more advanced material. It explores fundamental ideas in depth, using insights from research in mathematics education and psychology to explain why people often get confused, and how to overcome that confusion. For nervous readers, it will build confidence by clarifying basic ideas. For more experienced readers, it will highlight new connections to more advanced material. Throughout, the book explains how mathematicians think, and how ordinary people can understand and enjoy mathematical ideas and arguments.

Resnik,Clarendon Press,1997-07-31,"Mathematics as a Science of Patterns is the definitive exposition of a system of ideas about the nature of mathematics which Michael Resnik has been elaborating for a number of years. In calling mathematics a science he implies that it has a factual subject-matter and that mathematical knowledge is on a par with other scientific knowledge; in calling it a science of patterns he expresses his commitment to a structuralist philosophy of mathematics. He links this to a defence of realism about the metaphysics of mathematics—the view that mathematics is about things that really exist. Resnik's distinctive philosophy of mathematics is here presented in an accessible and systematic form: it will be of value not only to specialists in this area, but to philosophers, mathematicians, and logicians interested in the relationship between these three disciplines, or in truth, realism, and epistemology.",Philosophy,300,N/A,0,en

The Politics of Mathematics Education,Stieg Mellin-Olsen,Springer Science & Business Media,1987-03-31,"The development of knowledge is never easy. One doesn’t want to go over old ground again, but yet one needs to establish the new in the context of the old. One is also anxious about the novelty of the ideas are they new enough, or are they too ‘way out’ to be acceptable? In some fields perhaps these criteria are less important than in others. In education, I sense that ‘novelty’ is a tricky criterion, varying in value from society to society. In some societies the new ideas have to justify their adoption in the face to the old, tried and tested ideas. (Better the devil you know than the devil you don’t!) In other societies the old ways have to justify their continuation in the face of the new, promising and exciting ideas. (I can’t find a good proverb for this! Perhaps proverbs are all about preserving the past?) In any case, some people will argue, there is nothing new to be said about education anyway the problems are the same and it is only the context which changes. Mellin Olsen develops the reader’s knowledge through this book in ways that are both novel and challenging. Their novelty is not in question, judging by reactions to them which vary from “they have nothing to do with mathematics education” to “they concern everything that is done in mathematics education”.",Education,265,N/A,0,en

Math Lessons for a Living Education Level 1,Angela O'Dell,New Leaf Publishing Group,2016-04-06,"Have you ever noticed that we tend to compartmentalize when teaching our children? In real life, there aren’t artificial barriers between “subjects.” For example, when you are cooking or baking, you have to use the skills of reading, logical thinking, and measuring, just to name a few. In driving a car, you see and read road signs, read maps, and count miles. It has become quite clear that there is an abundance of math curriculums available that are nothing but monotonous drill sheets dressed up in pretty colors. Pretty colors do not make a living book. Content, story, and the ability to show math in real life make a living math book. Math Level 1: Teach math lessons through the creative means of a life storyProvides a link for the downloadable answer keyHas a scope and sequence that contains learning numbers 0 to 100, circles and patterns, counting and addition, days of the week, and telling time. This book was written to be used by you and your young student together. It is the story of a twin brother and sister, Charlie and Charlotte, who are visiting their grandparents’ farm. They soon learn that the farm is full of learning opportunities! As you read their story, your students will be drawn into the adventure along with the twins. They will learn about numbers, shapes, place value, adding, and subtracting. They will also learn about gardening, baby animals on the farm, nature, and the love of family. They will hear exciting stories from Grandpa and Grandma, and they will be invited to join the twins on their living math adventures. We hope you have a grand time on this adventure!",Juvenile Nonfiction,42,N/A,0,en

You're on the Crazy Train and I'm Driving,William Means ,Dorrance Publishing,2021-03-10,"You’re on the Crazy Train and I’m Driving By: William Means You’re on the Crazy Train and I’m Driving is a story of author William Means’s life so far (age sixty-seven). Means had a very tough time early in his years growing up in a big family in Pittsburgh, PA. In those years he encountered some very trying times. As Means met his future wife things turned for the better. His friends tell him that his stories seem not believable but he can assure you they are real. Means came close to making some very bad decisions along the way and took some wrong turns, but with help from his wife, he stayed on track. Everyone that has listened to his stories has told him to write a book about them, so that’s what he did! Means easily could have ended up on the wrong side of the law but something told him to go with what his wife was telling him and it worked. His stories remind him of the TV show This Is Us but his stories probably are a little juicier. Means is a hard guy Yinzer from Pittsburgh that somehow ended up in Cincinnati with a great family. His readers will learn the true meaning of the phrase",Biography & Autobiography,594,N/A,0,en

The World As I Found It,Bruce Duffy,New York Review of Books,2011-12-28,"This “wicked, melancholy, and . . . astonishing” novel reimagines the lives of three wildly different men adrift in the 20th century: Ludwig Wittgenstein, Bertrand Russell, and G. E. Moore (Newsday). When Bruce Duffy’s The World As I Found It was first published, critics and readers were bowled over by its daring reimagining of the lives of three very different men, the philosophers Bertrand Russell, G. E. Moore, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. A brilliant group portrait with the vertiginous displacements of twentieth-century life looming large in the background, Duffy’s novel depicts times and places as various as Vienna 1900, the trenches of World War I, Bloomsbury, and the colleges of Cambridge, while the complicated main characters appear not only in thought and dispute but in love and despair. Wittgenstein, a strange, troubled, and troubling man of gnawing contradictions, is at the center of a novel that reminds us that the apparently abstract and formal questions that animate philosophy are nothing less than the intractable matters of life and death.",Fiction,496,N/A,0,en

Since math builds on itself, students in even older grades can also use the book as a review to help them get a firm foundation for upper-level concepts. Because of the format and structure, you can easily take or modify the information for your particular child's ability and interests. Includes examples of modifying a typical curriculum presentation. Each chapter (with the exception of counting) walks through modifying a typical curriculum presentation, illustrating ways you could modify your textbook to convey the principles and goals discussed. - Publisher.",Home schooling,205,N/A,0,en
Transform Your Math Class Using Asset-Based Teaching for Grades 6-12,"Michael D. Steele, Joleigh Honey",Corwin Press,2024-07-19,"Foster a love of mathematics by creating a more inclusive and empowering learning environment through asset-based teaching! An asset-based perspective on math education means starting with what students already know instead of focusing on what’s missing. This approach elevates student thinking and reasoning skills. In this way, educators acknowledge that all students bring prior experiences, strengths, talents, and resources to the learning process and can contribute meaningfully in an authentic learning environment. Transform Your Math Class Using Asset-Based Teaching for Grades 6-12 provides insight into asset-based perspectives in mathematics education to create an environment where all students feel valued and capable of being doers of mathematics. In the book, Michael Steele and Joleigh Honey highlight the importance of using language, instructional routines, and systemic structure that positively impact student engagement, their math identity, and ultimately their outcomes. Providing a wealth of knowledge and practical strategies that can be used to transform math classrooms into inclusive, supportive, and empowering learning environments, this book: Introduces an asset-based perspective that focuses on students′ strengths, assets, and potential to learn mathematics Includes a variety of frameworks and tools that teachers can use to build and grow their sense of asset-based perspectives Offers strategies for promoting a growth mindset in mathematics, encouraging productive struggle in math, and promoting equitable math instruction Supports teachers in reflecting on their decisions, self-awareness, and self-management Includes a companion online study guide to support teachers individually or as part of a professional learning community Adopting asset-based perspectives is about movement over time, not about flipping a switch. This book paves the path for an asset-based journey that ultimately helps to transform our math classrooms and advance all students’ learning and development.",Education,157,N/A,0,en

Understanding Emotions in Mathematical Thinking and Learning,Ulises Xolocotzin,Academic Press,2017-05-12,"Emotions play a critical role in mathematical cognition and learning. Understanding Emotions in Mathematical Thinking and Learning offers a multidisciplinary approach to the role of emotions in numerical cognition, mathematics education, learning sciences, and affective sciences. It addresses ways in which emotions relate to cognitive processes involved in learning and doing mathematics, including processing of numerical and physical magnitudes (e.g. time and space), performance in arithmetic and algebra, problem solving and reasoning attitudes, learning technologies, and mathematics achievement. Additionally, it covers social and affective issues such as identity and attitudes toward mathematics. - Covers methodologies in studying emotion in mathematical knowledge - Reflects the diverse and innovative nature of the methodological approaches and theoretical frameworks proposed by current investigations of emotions and mathematical cognition - Includes perspectives from cognitive experimental psychology, neuroscience, and from sociocultural, semiotic, and discursive approaches - Explores the role of anxiety in mathematical learning - Synthesizes unifies the work of multiple sub-disciplines in one place",Psychology,476,N/A,0,en
Current and Future Perspectives of Ethnomathematics as a Program,"Milton Rosa, Ubiratan D’Ambrosio, Daniel Clark Orey, Lawrence Shirley, Wilfredo V. Alangui, Pedro Palhares, Maria Elena Gavarrete",Springer,2016-04-05,"This survey on the modernity of ethnomathematics addresses numerous themes related to both ethnomathematics and mathematics education. It offers a broader view of mathematics, including ideas, procedures, concepts, processes, methods, and practices rooted in distinct cultural environments. In addition, by reflecting on the social and political dimensions of ethnomathematics, another important aspect of this research program is the development of innovative approaches for a dynamic and glocalized society. Ethnomathematics recognizes that members of different cultures develop unique mathematical techniques, methods, and explanations that allow for an alternative understanding and transformation of societal norms. The theoretical basis of ethnomathematics offers a valid alternative to traditional studies of history, philosophy, cognition, and pedagogical aspects of mathematics. The current agenda for ethnomathematics is to continue an ongoing, progressive trajectory that contributes to the achievement of social justice, peace, and dignity for all. The debates outlined in this book share a few of the key ideas that provide for a clearer understanding of the field of ethnomathematics and its current state of the art by discussing its pedagogical actions, its contributions for teacher education, and its role in mathematics education.",Education,50,N/A,0,en

Quality Research in Literacy and Science Education,"Mack C. Shelley, Larry D. Yore, Brian B. Hand",Springer Science & Business Media,2008-12-30,"Statistical models attempt to describe and quantify relationships between variables. In the models presented in this chapter, there is a response variable (sometimes called dependent variable) and at least one predictor variable (sometimes called independent or explanatory variable). When investigating a possible cause-and-effect type of relationship, the response variable is the putative effect and the predictors are the hypothesized causes. Typically, there is a main predictor variable of interest; other predictors in the model are called covariates. Unknown covariates or other independent variables not controlled in an experiment or analysis can affect the dependent or outcome variable and mislead the conclusions made from the inquiry (Bock, Velleman, & De Veaux, 2009). A p value (p) measures the statistical significance of the observed relationship; given the model, p is the probability that a relationship is seen by mere chance. The smaller the p value, the more confident we can be that the pattern seen in the data 2 is not random. In the type of models examined here, the R measures the prop- tion of the variation in the response variable that is explained by the predictors 2 specified in the model; if R is close to 1, then almost all the variation in the response variable has been explained. This measure is also known as the multiple correlation coefficient. Statistical studies can be grouped into two types: experimental and observational.",Education,667,N/A,0,en

In this book, multilevel analysis is applied by linking student performance to the structure and processes of both the family and the school, the two major social contexts that exert powerful influence on young people. Essential/important policy issues including parental involvement, school decentralization, and medium of instruction are examined, and the possible relationship between these policies and student's achievement in light of the evidence collected in the first three cycles of the PISA study is explored. Besides, appreciating how researchers have used multilevel analysis in a variety of ways would be an effective path to learn it. The analysis in this book will add significantly to the storehouse of knowledge about the application of multilevel analysis in assessing the quality and equality of education in East Asian societies. The findings thereof would also serve as useful references for researchers, policymakers, school administrators, and teachers.",Education,292,N/A,0,en

Math for Everyone,Nathaniel Max Rock,Team Rock Press,2007,"Tired of ten pound math textbooks? Tired of math textbooks with 700 to 1,000 pages? Tired of massive student failure in gatekeeper math courses like Algebra I? Tired of math phobic students (and their parents) exclaiming, ""I hate math!""? Maybe it is time to try a different curriculum. Math For Everyone is a curriculum designed to promote massive student (and teacher) math success. Each year's content in the six math courses (7th Grade Math, Algebra I, Geometry I, Algebra II, Math Analysis and Calculus) is boiled down into its essential vocabulary and 5-7 key concepts with particular attention paid to clarity and articulation between courses. Assessment includes old favorites as well as authentic assessment with rubrics and grading advice included. No text is longer than 80 pages as the 5-7 key concepts can be amply demonstrated and practiced in this amount of space. Math For Everyone is not only great for new math teachers and struggling math students, but great for everyone. Nathaniel Max Rock is an educator since 2001 and the author of more than a dozen education books. He has taught the following courses: 7th Grade Math, Algebra I, Geometry I, Algebra II, Math Analysis, Calculus, as well as California High School Exit Exam (CAHSEE) Prep Classes, AVID Elective (9th & 10th grade), and Carnegie Computer classes.

"An Inquiry into Science Education, Where the Rubber Meets the Road",Richard N. Steinberg,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-01-01,"An inquiry into science education is an exploration into education in a context that is grounded and significant. It is written by a college professor of Physics and Science Education who spent sabbatical year as a full time science teacher in a neighborhood high school in a poor area of New York City. His varied experiences highlight the contrast of what science education is and what it can be. The framework through which the book is written is that science education should be an active, purposeful process which promotes functional understanding and critical thinking. Science learners should be given the opportunity to build an understanding of benchmark principals of science based on their own observations and reasoning. In much the same way, this book explores benchmark principals of science education through real classroom experiences. Standard approaches of teaching and assessment are presented and alternative opportunities are described. Theories and strategies of science education emerge from analysis of classroom observations. Although the focus is on the teaching and learning of science, the subtext is implications of a failing educational system and what can be done about it. The primary intended audience is educators of all capacities, but particularly science teachers. An inquiry into science education integrates critical topics of science education in a contextualized, accessible, and easy to read narrative. The secondary intended audience is non-fiction readers. This book examines educational issues relevant to a general audience from the perspective of a scientist with a focus on inquiry and reasoning. Critical issues are addressed through case histories, some with touches of humor, but all with insight into children and learning.",Science,127,N/A,0,en
Mind-Blowing Math,Nansea Cross,iUniverse,2016-08-15,"Nansea Cross, a math teacher and tutor, shares discoveries that make math easier to teach and more exciting to learn. Beginning with the multiplication table, she found that all the multiples of all the numberstaken through a simple processreveal different patterns. Looking deeper, she realized that these patterns repeat, have symmetry, and all add up to the same reduced number. The patterns occur horizontally, vertically, and diagonally in both directions and there are also patterns with perfect squares, perfect cubes, exponents, triangular numbers, and the hundreds board. Throughout the book, youll find charts, diagrams, and directions on where you can find additional resources to help students learn. Youll also find ideas for exciting class projects and tips on engaging students. Even veteran teachers will be impressed by the new dimension you can add to math by focusing on simple patterns that will inspire, motivate, and energize students at all levels.

The Power of Middle School,Keen J.

This maze can be an adventure of achievement and opportunity, or it can be a struggle of difficulty and disappointment. As these experiences are the impetus or foundation for many later achievements in academics, careers, and personal life, it is imperative that educators maximize these formative years by helping middle school students successfully travel through this maze despite its ups and downs, its twists and turns, and its new challenges to master and the old issues to resolve. For instance, educators must support students who have fallen behind, so as to thwart their reduced likelihood of turnaround in high school. Likewise, educators must challenge exceptional students, in order to perpetuate their enthusiasm for learning and prepare them for college studies. By discussing the comprehensive roles and duties of school administrators, counselors, and teachers, The Power of Middle School addresses how to maximize middle school curriculum and extra-curricular activities for the academic, personal, and professional benefits of all students.",Education,187,N/A,0,en

Equations from God,Daniel J. Cohen,JHU Press,2007-04-08,"Throughout history, application rather than abstraction has been the prominent driving force in mathematics. From the compass and sextant to partial differential equations, mathematical advances were spurred by the desire for better navigation tools, weaponry, and construction methods. But the religious upheaval in Victorian England and the fledgling United States opened the way for the rediscovery of pure mathematics, a tradition rooted in Ancient Greece. In Equations from God, Daniel J. Cohen captures the origins of the rebirth of abstract mathematics in the intellectual quest to rise above common existence and touch the mind of the deity. Using an array of published and private sources, Cohen shows how philosophers and mathematicians seized upon the beautiful simplicity inherent in mathematical laws to reconnect with the divine and traces the route by which the divinely inspired mathematics of the Victorian era begot later secular philosophies.",History,274,N/A,0,en

Constructive Analysis,"E. Bishop, Douglas Bridges",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This work grew out of Errett Bishop's fundamental treatise 'Founda tions of Constructive Analysis' (FCA), which appeared in 1967 and which contained the bountiful harvest of a remarkably short period of research by its author. Truly, FCA was an exceptional book, not only because of the quantity of original material it contained, but also as a demonstration of the practicability of a program which most ma thematicians believed impossible to carry out. Errett's book went out of print shortly after its publication, and no second edition was produced by its publishers. Some years later, 'by a set of curious chances', it was agreed that a new edition of FCA would be published by Springer Verlag, the revision being carried out by me under Errett's supervision; at the same time, Errett gener ously insisted that I become a joint author. The revision turned out to be much more substantial than we had anticipated, and took longer than we would have wished. Indeed, tragically, Errett died before the work was completed. The present book is the result of our efforts. Although substantially based on FCA, it contains so much new material, and such full revision and expansion of the old, that it is essentially a new book. For this reason, and also to preserve the integrity of the original, I decided to give our joint work a title of its own. Most of the new material outside Chapter 5 originated with Errett.",Mathematics,490,N/A,0,en

Building the Foundation: Whole Numbers in the Primary Grades,"Maria G.

One of the main challenges of designing the first ICMI primary school study of this kind is the complex nature of mathematics at the early level. Accordingly, a focus area that is central to the discussion was chosen, together with a number of related questions. The broad area of Whole Number Arithmetic (WNA), including operations and relations and arithmetic word problems, forms the core content of all primary mathematics curricula. The study of this core content area is often regarded as foundational for later mathematics learning. However, the principles and main goals of instruction on the foundational concepts and skills in WNA are far from universally agreed upon, and practice varies substantially from country to country. As such, this study presents a meta-level analysis and synthesis of what is currently known about WNA, providing a useful base from which to gauge gaps and shortcomings, as well as an opportunity to learn from the practices of different countries and contexts.",Education,548,N/A,0,en
Winning the Math Wars,"Martin L. Abbott, Brian Ferriso, Karen Smith",University of Washington Press,2011-07-01,"Washington State is about to enter a new phase of the ""math wars."" Since the late 1980s, the debate over how best to teach mathematics to schoolchildren has raged worldwide among educators, politicians, and parents. The stakes are high. To operate effectively in a global, twenty-first-century economy and polity, the United states must provide an education in mathematics that is both excellent and equitable. In this volume, four scholars at the Washington School Research Center (WSRC) at Seattle Pacific University present original research drawn from statistical studies of state educational data and from thousands of classroom observations carried out by The BERC Group. They assess the current state of math education and review its history and development. The authors also provide a dispassionate review of the extensive international, national, and state literature. The in-depth observational research in Winning the Math Wars confirms that the real issue is neither the approach to teaching--traditional or reform--nor the type of curriculum. If America's goal of educational equity and excellence is to be achieved, then math teachers everywhere must be fully supported in developing the specific skills that are ideal for educating all students. The authors discussion focus on four principles for improving math teaching and learning: fidelity to reform efforts by all involved; an emphasis on instruction and instructional tools; the critical nature of mathematical knowledge; and the need for transformational change. Winning the Math Wars is an important book for policy makers, school leaders, practitioners of mathematics education, parents, and anyone who wants to make sense of the ""math wars.""",Education,176,N/A,0,en

Yet with so many students and big concepts to cover, it can be hard to slow down enough to look for those moments when students’ responses tell us what we need to know about next best steps. In this remarkable book, John SanGiovanni and Jennifer Rose Novak help us value our students’ misconceptions and incomplete understandings as much as their correct ones—because it’s the gap in their understanding today that holds the secrets to planning tomorrow’s best teaching. The authors lay out 180 high-quality tasks aligned to the standards and big ideas of Grades 6–8 mathematics, including number systems, integers, ratio and proportion, equations and expressions, geometry, and statistics and probability. The tasks are all downloadable so you can use or modify them for instruction and assessment. Each big idea offers a starting task followed by: what makes it a high-quality task what you might anticipate before students work with the task four student examples of the completed task showcasing a distinct ""gap"" commentary on what precisely counts for mathematical understanding and the next instructional steps commentary on the misconception or incomplete understanding so you learn why the student veered off course three additional tasks aligned to the mathematics topic and ideas about what students might do with these additional tasks It’s time to break our habit of rushing into re-teaching for correctness and instead get curious about the space between right and wrong answers.

A History of Mathematics in the United States and Canada,"David E. Zitarelli, Della Dumbaugh, Stephen F. Kennedy",American Mathematical Society,2022-07-28,"This is the first truly comprehensive and thorough history of the development of a mathematical community in the United States and Canada. This second volume starts at the turn of the twentieth century with a mathematical community that is firmly established and traces its growth over the next forty years, at the end of which the American mathematical community is pre-eminent in the world. In the preface to the first volume of this work Zitarelli reveals his animating philosophy, I find that the human factor lends life and vitality to any subject. History of mathematics, in the Zitarelli conception, is not just a collection of abstract ideas and their development. It is a community of people and practices joining together to understand, perpetuate, and advance those ideas and each other. Telling the story of mathematics means telling the stories of these people: their accomplishments and triumphs; the institutions and structures they built; their interpersonal and scientific interactions; and their failures and shortcomings. One of the most hopeful developments of the period 19001941 in American mathematics was the opening of the community to previously excluded populations. Increasing numbers of women were welcomed into mathematics, many of whomincluding Anna Pell Wheeler, Olive Hazlett, and Mayme Logsdonare profiled in these pages. Black mathematicians were often systemically excluded during this period, but, in spite of the obstacles, Elbert Frank Cox, Dudley Woodard, David Blackwell, and others built careers of significant accomplishment that are described here. The effect on the substantial community of European immigrants is detailed through the stories of dozens of individuals.

Parallel to this, new capabilities such as pervasive sensing, multimedia sensing, machine learning, deep learning, unmanned aerial vehicles, cloud and edge computing, energy efficiency/harvesting, and computing power open the way to new domains, services, and business models beyond the traditional mobile Internet. The new areas in turn come with various requirements in terms of reliability, quality of service, and energy efficiency. These are only some examples of the challenges that are of interest to researchers in Forthcoming Networks and Sustainability in the IoT Era (FoNeS-IoT). It will explore the latest developments, innovations, and best practices within the IoT and the impact it has on industries including: manufacturing, transport, supply chain, communication, government, legal sectors, financial services, energy utilities, insurance, health care, retail, and many others. It provides opportunities for academicians and scientists along with professionals, policymakers, and practitioners from various fields in a global realm to present their research, contributions, and views, on one forum, and interact with members inside and outside their own particular disciplines. Papers describing applications of IoT in e-Health, Smart Systems & Management, Communication, and Education are also included, but the focus is mainly on how new and novel techniques advance the performance in application areas, rather than a presentation of yet another application of conventional tool. Papers on such applications describe a principled solution, emphasize its novelty, and present an in-depth evaluation of the techniques being exploited.",Technology & Engineering,394,N/A,0,en
Model Theoretic Methods in Finite Combinatorics,"Martin Grohe, Johann A. Makowsky",American Mathematical Soc.,2011-11-28,"This volume contains the proceedings of the AMS-ASL Special Session on Model Theoretic Methods in Finite Combinatorics, held January 5-8, 2009, in Washington, DC. Over the last 20 years, various new connections between model theory and finite combinatorics emerged. The best known of these are in the area of 0-1 laws, but in recent years other very promising interactions between model theory and combinatorics have been developed in areas such as extremal combinatorics and graph limits, graph polynomials, homomorphism functions and related counting functions, and discrete algorithms, touching the boundaries of computer science and statistical physics. This volume highlights some of the main results, techniques, and research directions of the area. Topics covered in this volume include recent developments on 0-1 laws and their variations, counting functions defined by homomorphisms and graph polynomials and their relation to logic, recurrences and spectra, the logical complexity of graphs, algorithmic meta theorems based on logic, universal and homogeneous structures, and logical aspects of Ramsey theory.",Mathematics,529,N/A,0,en

Children's Fractional Knowledge,"Leslie P. Steffe, John Olive",Springer Science & Business Media,2009-12-02,"Children’s Fractional Knowledge elegantly tracks the construction of knowledge, both by children learning new methods of reasoning and by the researchers studying their methods. The book challenges the widely held belief that children’s whole number knowledge is a distraction from their learning of fractions by positing that their fractional learning involves reorganizing—not simply using or building upon—their whole number knowledge. This hypothesis is explained in detail using examples of actual grade-schoolers approaching problems in fractions including the schemes they construct to relate parts to a whole, to produce a fraction as a multiple of a unit part, to transform a fraction into a commensurate fraction, or to combine two fractions multiplicatively or additively. These case studies provide a singular journey into children’s mathematics experience, which often varies greatly from that of adults. Moreover, the authors’ descriptive terms reflect children’s quantitative operations, as opposed to adult mathematical phrases rooted in concepts that do not reflect—and which in the classroom may even suppress—youngsters’ learning experiences. Highlights of the coverage: Toward a formulation of a mathematics of living instead of being Operations that produce numerical counting schemes Case studies: children’s part-whole, partitive, iterative, and other fraction schemes Using the generalized number sequence to produce fraction schemes Redefining school mathematics This fresh perspective is of immediate importance to researchers in mathematics education. With the up-close lens onto mathematical development found in Children’s Fractional Knowledge, readers can work toward creating more effective methods for improving young learners’ quantitative reasoning skills.",Education,379,5,1,en

How Economics Became a Mathematical Science,E. Roy Weintraub,Duke University Press,2002-05-28,"In How Economics Became a Mathematical Science E. Roy Weintraub traces the history of economics through the prism of the history of mathematics in the twentieth century. As mathematics has evolved, so has the image of mathematics, explains Weintraub, such as ideas about the standards for accepting proof, the meaning of rigor, and the nature of the mathematical enterprise itself. He also shows how economics itself has been shaped by economists’ changing images of mathematics. Whereas others have viewed economics as autonomous, Weintraub presents a different picture, one in which changes in mathematics—both within the body of knowledge that constitutes mathematics and in how it is thought of as a discipline and as a type of knowledge—have been intertwined with the evolution of economic thought. Weintraub begins his account with Cambridge University, the intellectual birthplace of modern economics, and examines specifically Alfred Marshall and the Mathematical Tripos examinations—tests in mathematics that were required of all who wished to study economics at Cambridge. He proceeds to interrogate the idea of a rigorous mathematical economics through the connections between particular mathematical economists and mathematicians in each of the decades of the first half of the twentieth century, and thus describes how the mathematical issues of formalism and axiomatization have shaped economics. Finally, How Economics Became a Mathematical Science reconstructs the career of the economist Sidney Weintraub, whose relationship to mathematics is viewed through his relationships with his mathematician brother, Hal, and his mathematician-economist son, the book’s author.",Business & Economics,329,N/A,0,en

Perturbation Methods in Applied Mathematics,"J. Kevorkian, J.D. Cole",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-03-09,"This book is a revised and updated version, including a substantial portion of new material, of J. D. Cole's text Perturbation Methods in Applied Mathe matics, Ginn-Blaisdell, 1968. We present the material at a level which assumes some familiarity with the basics of ordinary and partial differential equations. Some of the more advanced ideas are reviewed as needed; therefore this book can serve as a text in either an advanced undergraduate course or a graduate level course on the subject. The applied mathematician, attempting to understand or solve a physical problem, very often uses a perturbation procedure. In doing this, he usually draws on a backlog of experience gained from the solution of similar examples rather than on some general theory of perturbations. The aim of this book is to survey these perturbation methods, especially in connection with differ ential equations, in order to illustrate certain general features common to many examples. The basic ideas, however, are also applicable to integral equations, integrodifferential equations, and even to_difference equations. In essence, a perturbation procedure consists of constructing the solution for a problem involving a small parameter B, either in the differential equation or the boundary conditions or both, when the solution for the limiting case B = 0 is known. The main mathematical tool used is asymptotic expansion with respect to a suitable asymptotic sequence of functions of B.",Mathematics,569,N/A,0,en

Handbook of Quantum Logic and Quantum Structures,"Kurt Engesser, Dov M. Gabbay, Daniel Lehmann",Elsevier,2009-06-16,"Quantum mechanics is said to be the most successful physical theory ever. It is, in fact, unique in its success when applied to concrete physical problems. On the other hand, however, it raises profound conceptual problems that are equally unprecedented. Quantum logic, the topic of this volume, can be described as an attempt to cast light on the puzzle of quantum mechanics from the point of view of logic. Since its inception in the famous 1936 paper by Birkhoff and von Neumann entitled, ""The logic of quantum mechanics, quantum logic has undergone an enormous development. Various schools of thought and approaches have emerged, and there are a variety of technical results. The chapters of this volume constitute a comprehensive presentation of the main schools, approaches and results in the field of quantum logic. - Authored by eminent scholars in the field - Material presented is of recent origin representing the frontier of the subject - Provides the most comprehensive and varied discussion of Quantum Mechanics available",Mathematics,727,N/A,0,en

"The Mathematics of Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, India, and Islam","Victor J. Katz, Annette Imhausen",Princeton University Press,2007-08-05,"In recent decades it has become obvious that mathematics has always been a worldwide activity. But this is the first book to provide a substantial collection of English translations of key mathematical texts from the five most important ancient and medieval non-Western mathematical cultures, and to put them into full historical and mathematical context. The Mathematics of Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, India, and Islam gives English readers a firsthand understanding and appreciation of these cultures' important contributions to world mathematics. The five section authors--Annette Imhausen (Egypt), Eleanor Robson (Mesopotamia), Joseph Dauben (China), Kim Plofker (India), and J. Lennart Berggren (Islam)--are experts in their fields. Each author has selected key texts and in many cases provided new translations. The authors have also written substantial section introductions that give an overview of each mathematical culture and explanatory notes that put each selection into context. This authoritative commentary allows readers to understand the sometimes unfamiliar mathematics of these civilizations and the purpose and significance of each text. Addressing a critical gap in the mathematics literature in English, this book is an essential resource for anyone with at least an undergraduate degree in mathematics who wants to learn about non-Western mathematical developments and how they helped shape and enrich world mathematics. The book is also an indispensable guide for mathematics teachers who want to use non-Western mathematical ideas in the classroom.",Mathematics,712,3,1,en

Perturbation Methods in Applied Mathematics,"J. Kevorkian, J.D. Cole",Springer Science & Business Media,1981,"This book is a revised and updated version, including a substantial portion of new material, of J. D. Cole's text Perturbation Methods in Applied Mathe matics, Ginn-Blaisdell, 1968. We present the material at a level which assumes some familiarity with the basics of ordinary and partial differential equations. Some of the more advanced ideas are reviewed as needed; therefore this book can serve as a text in either an advanced undergraduate course or a graduate level course on the subject. The applied mathematician, attempting to understand or solve a physical problem, very often uses a perturbation procedure. In doing this, he usually draws on a backlog of experience gained from the solution of similar examples rather than on some general theory of perturbations. The aim of this book is to survey these perturbation methods, especially in connection with differ ential equations, in order to illustrate certain general features common to many examples. The basic ideas, however, are also applicable to integral equations, integrodifferential equations, and even to_difference equations. In essence, a perturbation procedure consists of constructing the solution for a problem involving a small parameter B, either in the differential equation or the boundary conditions or both, when the solution for the limiting case B = 0 is known. The main mathematical tool used is asymptotic expansion with respect to a suitable asymptotic sequence of functions of B.",Mathematics,598,N/A,0,en

The Mathematics of Encryption,"Margaret Cozzens,  Steven J. Miller",American Mathematical Soc.,2013-09-05,"How quickly can you compute the remainder when dividing by 120143? Why would you even want to compute this? And what does this have to do with cryptography? Modern cryptography lies at the intersection of mathematics and computer sciences, involving number theory, algebra, computational complexity, fast algorithms, and even quantum mechanics. Many people think of codes in terms of spies, but in the information age, highly mathematical codes are used every day by almost everyone, whether at the bank ATM, at the grocery checkout, or at the keyboard when you access your email or purchase products online. This book provides a historical and mathematical tour of cryptography, from classical ciphers to quantum cryptography. The authors introduce just enough mathematics to explore modern encryption methods, with nothing more than basic algebra and some elementary number theory being necessary. Complete expositions are given of the classical ciphers and the attacks on them, along with a detailed description of the famous Enigma system. The public-key system RSA is described, including a complete mathematical proof that it works. Numerous related topics are covered, such as efficiencies of algorithms, detecting and correcting errors, primality testing and digital signatures. The topics and exposition are carefully chosen to highlight mathematical thinking and problem solving. Each chapter ends with a collection of problems, ranging from straightforward applications to more challenging problems that introduce advanced topics.

"Advancing Research on Teachers' Professional Vision: Implementing novel Technologies, Methods and Theories","Christian Kosel, Tina Seidel , Christian Hartmann, Ann-Sophie Grub",Frontiers Media SA,2024-07-25,"A classroom full of students can be overwhelming for teachers. It is critical that teachers are able to filter and meaningfully interpret the relevant information in this complex scenario. Much of this filtering and interpretation occurs through selective visual perception. Over the last decade, a rapidly growing number of studies in empirical educational research used eye tracking to investigate teachers' selective visual perceptual processes in the classroom. Theoretically, visual attention and perception are often conceptualized as knowledge-based noticing coupled with knowledge-based reasoning about what is visually perceived. Recent eye-tracking studies have shown that experienced teachers, in particular, show improved selective attention of classroom events through faster detection of relevant information and improved monitoring of learning-relevant situations. Researchers agree that a critical driver of selective attention processes is the professional knowledge (declarative, procedural, and metacognitive) of (experienced) teachers, which controls selective perceptual processes in a top-down process. The findings are significant and provide important insights for research on teacher professionalization.",Education,213,N/A,0,en

Across the Board,John J. Watkins,Princeton University Press,2011-09-19,"Across the Board is the definitive work on chessboard problems. It is not simply about chess but the chessboard itself--that simple grid of squares so common to games around the world. And, more importantly, the fascinating mathematics behind it. From the Knight's Tour Problem and Queens Domination to their many variations, John Watkins surveys all the well-known problems in this surprisingly fertile area of recreational mathematics. Can a knight follow a path that covers every square once, ending on the starting square? How many queens are needed so that every square is targeted or occupied by one of the queens? Each main topic is treated in depth from its historical conception through to its status today. Many beautiful solutions have emerged for basic chessboard problems since mathematicians first began working on them in earnest over three centuries ago, but such problems, including those involving polyominoes, have now been extended to three-dimensional chessboards and even chessboards on unusual surfaces such as toruses (the equivalent of playing chess on a doughnut) and cylinders. Using the highly visual language of graph theory, Watkins gently guides the reader to the forefront of current research in mathematics. By solving some of the many exercises sprinkled throughout, the reader can share fully in the excitement of discovery. Showing that chess puzzles are the starting point for important mathematical ideas that have resonated for centuries, Across the Board will captivate students and instructors, mathematicians, chess enthusiasts, and puzzle devotees.",Mathematics,270,N/A,0,en

This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, deep learning, survival analysis, multiple testing, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike, who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. Four of the authors co-wrote An Introduction to Statistical Learning, With Applications in R (ISLR), which has become a mainstay of undergraduate and graduate classrooms worldwide, as well as an important reference book for data scientists. One of the keys to its success was that each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in the R scientific computing environment. However, in recent years Python has become a popular language for data science, and there has been increasing demand for a Python-based alternative to ISLR. Hence, this book (ISLP) covers the same materials as ISLR but with labs implemented in Python.

An important additional feature of this book is the detailed discussion of the mathematical principles used in building optimal MRI systems and for sequence design. The mathematical discussion is very suitable for undergraduates attending medical physics courses. It is also more complete than usually found in alternative books for physical scientists or more clinically orientated works.",Technology & Engineering,188,N/A,0,en
A Generalization of Bohr-Mollerup's Theorem for Higher Order Convex Functions,"Jean-Luc Marichal, Naïm Zenaïdi",Springer Nature,2022-07-06,"In 1922, Harald Bohr and Johannes Mollerup established a remarkable characterization of the Euler gamma function using its log-convexity property. A decade later, Emil Artin investigated this result and used it to derive the basic properties of the gamma function using elementary methods of the calculus. Bohr-Mollerup's theorem was then adopted by Nicolas Bourbaki as the starting point for his exposition of the gamma function. This open access book develops a far-reaching generalization of Bohr-Mollerup's theorem to higher order convex functions, along lines initiated by Wolfgang Krull, Roger Webster, and some others but going considerably further than past work. In particular, this generalization shows using elementary techniques that a very rich spectrum of functions satisfy analogues of several classical properties of the gamma function, including Bohr-Mollerup's theorem itself, Euler's reflection formula, Gauss' multiplication theorem, Stirling's formula, and Weierstrass' canonical factorization. The scope of the theory developed in this work is illustrated through various examples, ranging from the gamma function itself and its variants and generalizations (q-gamma, polygamma, multiple gamma functions) to important special functions such as the Hurwitz zeta function and the generalized Stieltjes constants. This volume is also an opportunity to honor the 100th anniversary of Bohr-Mollerup's theorem and to spark the interest of a large number of researchers in this beautiful theory.",Mathematics,325,N/A,0,en

It's no wonder some children develop very interesting and perhaps incorrect ideas about mathematical concepts.

Math Misconceptions answers these questions by: identifying the most common errors relative to the five NCTM content strands (number and operations, algebra, geometry, measurement, and data analysis and probability); investigating the source of these misunderstandings; proposing ways to avoid as well as ""undo"" misconceptions. Using classroom vignettes that highlight common misconceptions in each content area, followed by applicable research about the root causes of the confusion, the authors offer numerous instructional ideas and interventions designed to prevent or correct the misconception. --Publisher's description.",Education,186,N/A,0,en

Étale Cohomology,James S. Milne,Princeton University Press,2025-04-08,"An authoritative introduction to the essential features of étale cohomology A. Grothendieck’s work on algebraic geometry is one of the most important mathematical achievements of the twentieth century. In the early 1960s, he and M. Artin introduced étale cohomology to extend the methods of sheaf-theoretic cohomology from complex varieties to more general schemes. This work found many applications, not only in algebraic geometry but also in several different branches of number theory and in the representation theory of finite and p-adic groups. In this classic book, James Milne provides an invaluable introduction to étale cohomology, covering the essential features of the theory. Milne begins with a review of the basic properties of flat and étale morphisms and the algebraic fundamental group. He then turns to the basic theory of étale sheaves and elementary étale cohomology, followed by an application of the cohomology to the study of the Brauer group. After a detailed analysis of the cohomology of curves and surfaces, Milne proves the fundamental theorems in étale cohomology—those of base change, purity, Poincaré duality, and the Lefschetz trace formula—and applies these theorems to show the rationality of some very general L-series.",Mathematics,337,N/A,0,en

Iterative Methods and Preconditioners for Systems of Linear Equations,"Gabriele Ciaramella, Martin J. Gander ",SIAM,2022-02-08,"Iterative methods use successive approximations to obtain more accurate solutions. This book gives an introduction to iterative methods and preconditioning for solving discretized elliptic partial differential equations and optimal control problems governed by the Laplace equation, for which the use of matrix-free procedures is crucial. All methods are explained and analyzed starting from the historical ideas of the inventors, which are often quoted from their seminal works. Iterative Methods and Preconditioners for Systems of Linear Equations grew out of a set of lecture notes that were improved and enriched over time, resulting in a clear focus for the teaching methodology, which derives complete convergence estimates for all methods, illustrates and provides MATLAB codes for all methods, and studies and tests all preconditioners first as stationary iterative solvers. This textbook is appropriate for undergraduate and graduate students who want an overview or deeper understanding of iterative methods. Its focus on both analysis and numerical experiments allows the material to be taught with very little preparation, since all the arguments are self-contained, and makes it appropriate for self-study as well. It can be used in courses on iterative methods, Krylov methods and preconditioners, and numerical optimal control. Scientists and engineers interested in new topics and applications will also find the text useful.",Mathematics,285,N/A,0,en

Pinnow",Corwin Press,2021-01-07,"Using strengths-based approaches to support development in mathematics It’s time to re-imagine what’s possible and celebrate the brilliance multilingual learners bring to today’s classrooms. Innovative teaching strategies can position these learners as leaders in mathematics. Yet, as the number of multilingual learners in North American schools grows, many teachers have not had opportunities to gain the competencies required to teach these learners effectively, especially in disciplines such as mathematics. Multilingual learners—historically called English Language Learners—are expected to interpret the meaning of problems, analyze, make conjectures, evaluate their progress, and discuss and understand their own approaches and the approaches of their peers in mathematics classrooms. Thus, language plays a vital role in mathematics learning, and demonstrating these competencies in a second (or third) language is a challenging endeavor. Based on best practices and the authors’ years of research, this guide offers practical approaches that equip grades K-8 teachers to draw on the strengths of multilingual learners, partner with their families, and position these learners for success. Readers will find: • A focus on multilingual students as leaders • A strength-based approach that draws on students’ life experiences and cultural backgrounds • An emphasis on maintaining high expectations for learners’ capacity for mastering rigorous content • Strategies for representing concepts in different formats • Stop and Think questions throughout and reflection questions at the end of each chapter • Try It!

"Mindset Mathematics: Visualizing and Investigating Big Ideas, Grade K","Jo Boaler, Jen Munson, Cathy Williams",John Wiley & Sons,2020-08-14,"Engage students in mathematics using growth mindset techniques The most challenging parts of teaching mathematics are engaging students and helping them understand the connections between mathematics concepts. In this volume, you'll find a collection of low floor, high ceiling tasks that will help you do just that, by looking at the big ideas at the kindergarten-grade level through visualization, play, and investigation. During their work with tens of thousands of teachers, authors Jo Boaler, Jen Munson, and Cathy Williams heard the same message—that they want to incorporate more brain science into their math instruction, but they need guidance in the techniques that work best to get across the concepts they needed to teach. So the authors designed Mindset Mathematics around the principle of active student engagement, with tasks that reflect the latest brain science on learning. Open, creative, and visual math tasks have been shown to improve student test scores, and more importantly change their relationship with mathematics and start believing in their own potential. The tasks in Mindset Mathematics reflect the lessons from brain science that: There is no such thing as a math person - anyone can learn mathematics to high levels. Mistakes, struggle and challenge are the most important times for brain growth. Speed is unimportant in mathematics. Mathematics is a visual and beautiful subject, and our brains want to think visually about mathematics.

Comprehending Math,Arthur A. Hyde,Heinemann Educational Books,2006,"For those who devour Comprehending Math as I did, their teaching will be clearer, bolder, more connected. And for the ultimate beneficiaries, they will have a chance to understand just how integrally our world is connected. Ellin Oliver Keene, author of Mosaic of Thought No matter the content area, students need to develop clear ways of thinking about and understanding what they learn. But this kind of conceptual thinking seems more difficult in math than in language arts and social studies. Fortunately we now know how to help kids understand more about mathematics than ever before, and in Comprehending Math you'll find out that much of math's conceptual difficulty can be alleviated by adapting what we have learned from research on language and cognition. In Comprehending Math Arthur Hyde (coauthor of the popular Best Practice) shows you how to adapt some of your favorite and most effective reading comprehension strategies to help your students with important mathematical concepts. Emphasizing problem solving, Hyde and his colleagues demonstrate how to build into your practice math-based variations of: K - W - L visualizing asking questions inferring predicting making connections determining importance synthesizing He then presents a practical way to ""braid"" together reading comprehension, math problemsolving, and thinking to improve math teaching and learning. Elaborating on this braided model of approach to problem solving, he shows how it can support planning as well as instruction. Comprehending Math is based on current cognitive research and features more than three dozen examples that range from traditional story problems to open-ended or extended-response problems and mathematical tasks. It gives you step-by-step ideas for instruction and smart, specific advice on planning strategy-based teaching. Help students do math and get it at the same time.

The Impact of Identity in K-8 Mathematics Learning and Teaching,"Julia Aguirre, Danny Bernard Martin",N/A,2013,"Each teacher and student brings many identities to the classroom. What is their impact on the student’s learning and the teacher’s teaching of mathematics? This book invites K–8 teachers to reflect on their own and their students’ multiple identities. Rich possibilities for learning result when teachers draw on these identities to offer high-quality, equity-based teaching to all students. Reflecting on identity and re-envisioning learning and teaching through this lens especially benefits students who have been marginalized by race, class, ethnicity, or gender. The authors encourage teachers to reframe instruction by using five equity-based mathematics teaching practices: Going deep with mathematics; leveraging multiple mathematical competencies; affirming mathematics learners’ identities; challenging spaces of marginality; and drawing on multiple resources of knowledge.

"Mindset Mathematics: Visualizing and Investigating Big Ideas, Grade 1","Jo Boaler, Jen Munson, Cathy Williams",John Wiley & Sons,2021-03-02,"Engage students in mathematics using growth mindset techniques The most challenging parts of teaching mathematics are engaging students and helping them understand the connections between mathematics concepts. In this volume, you'll find a collection of low floor, high ceiling tasks that will help you do just that, by looking at the big ideas at the first-grade level through visualization, play, and investigation. During their work with tens of thousands of teachers, authors Jo Boaler, Jen Munson, and Cathy Williams heard the same message—that they want to incorporate more brain science into their math instruction, but they need guidance in the techniques that work best to get across the concepts they needed to teach. So the authors designed Mindset Mathematics around the principle of active student engagement, with tasks that reflect the latest brain science on learning. Open, creative, and visual math tasks have been shown to improve student test scores, and more importantly change their relationship with mathematics and start believing in their own potential. The tasks in Mindset Mathematics reflect the lessons from brain science that: There is no such thing as a math person - anyone can learn mathematics to high levels. Mistakes, struggle and challenge are the most important times for brain growth. Speed is unimportant in mathematics. Mathematics is a visual and beautiful subject, and our brains want to think visually about mathematics. With engaging questions, open-ended tasks, and four-color visuals that will help kids get excited about mathematics, Mindset Mathematics is organized around nine big ideas which emphasize the connections within the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and can be used with any current curriculum.",Education,352,N/A,0,en

Successful K-12 STEM Education,"National Research Council, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Board on Testing and Assessment, Board on Science Education, Committee on Highly Successful Schools or Programs for K-12 STEM Education",National Academies Press,2011-06-22,"Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are cultural achievements that reflect our humanity, power our economy, and constitute fundamental aspects of our lives as citizens, consumers, parents, and members of the workforce. Providing all students with access to quality education in the STEM disciplines is important to our nation's competitiveness. However, it is challenging to identify the most successful schools and approaches in the STEM disciplines because success is defined in many ways and can occur in many different types of schools and settings. In addition, it is difficult to determine whether the success of a school's students is caused by actions the school takes or simply related to the population of students in the school. Successful K-12 STEM Education defines a framework for understanding ""success"" in K-12 STEM education. The book focuses its analysis on the science and mathematics parts of STEM and outlines criteria for identifying effective STEM schools and programs. Because a school's success should be defined by and measured relative to its goals, the book identifies three important goals that share certain elements, including learning STEM content and practices, developing positive dispositions toward STEM, and preparing students to be lifelong learners. A successful STEM program would increase the number of students who ultimately pursue advanced degrees and careers in STEM fields, enhance the STEM-capable workforce, and boost STEM literacy for all students. It is also critical to broaden the participation of women and minorities in STEM fields. Successful K-12 STEM Education examines the vast landscape of K-12 STEM education by considering different school models, highlighting research on effective STEM education practices, and identifying some conditions that promote and limit school- and student-level success in STEM. The book also looks at where further work is needed to develop appropriate data sources. The book will serve as a guide to policy makers; decision makers at the school and district levels; local, state, and federal government agencies; curriculum developers; educators; and parent and education advocacy groups.",Education,44,N/A,0,en

"Mine the Gap for Mathematical Understanding, Grades K-2",John SanGiovanni,Corwin Press,2016-10-31,"Being an effective math educator is one part based on the quality of the tasks we give, one part how we diagnose what we see, and one part what we do with what we find. Yet with so many students and big concepts to cover, it can be hard to slow down enough to look for those moments when students’ responses tell us what we need to know about next best steps. In this remarkable book, John SanGiovanni helps us value our young learners’ misconceptions and incomplete understandings as much as their correct ones—because it’s the gap in their understanding today that holds the secrets to planning tomorrow’s best teaching. SanGiovanni lays out 160 high-quality tasks aligned to the standards and big ideas of grades K-2 mathematics, including counting and representing numbers, number relationships and comparison, addition and subtraction within 100 and 1000, money and time, and multiplication and division. The tasks are all downloadable so you can use or modify them for instruction and assessment. Each big idea offers a starting task followed by: what makes it a high-quality taskwhat you might anticipate before students work with the task 4 student examples of the completed task showcasing a distinct ""gap"" commentary on what precisely counts for mathematical understanding and the next instructional steps commentary on the misconception or incomplete understanding so you learn why the student veered off course three additional tasks aligned to the mathematics topic and ideas about what students might do with these additional tasks. It’s time to break our habit of rushing into re-teaching for correctness and instead get curious about the space between right and wrong answers. Mine the Gap for Mathematical Understanding is a book you will return to again and again to get better at selecting tasks that will uncover students’ reasoning—better at discerning the quality and clarity of students’ understanding—and better at planning teaching based on the gaps you see.",Education,385,N/A,0,en

Lecture Notes on Motivic Cohomology,"Carlo Mazza, Vladimir Voevodsky, Charles A. Weibel",American Mathematical Soc.,2006,"The notion of a motive is an elusive one, like its namesake ""the motif"" of Cezanne's impressionist method of painting. Its existence was first suggested by Grothendieck in 1964 as the underlying structure behind the myriad cohomology theories in Algebraic Geometry. We now know that there is a triangulated theory of motives, discovered by Vladimir Voevodsky, which suffices for the development of a satisfactory Motivic Cohomology theory. However, the existence of motives themselves remains conjectural. This book provides an account of the triangulated theory of motives. Its purpose is to introduce Motivic Cohomology, to develop its main properties, and finally to relate it to other known invariants of algebraic varieties and rings such as Milnor K-theory, etale cohomology, and Chow groups. The book is divided into lectures, grouped in six parts. The first part presents the definition of Motivic Cohomology, based upon the notion of presheaves with transfers. Some elementary comparison theorems are given in this part. The theory of (etale, Nisnevich, and Zariski) sheaves with transfers is developed in parts two, three, and six, respectively. The theoretical core of the book is the fourth part, presenting the triangulated category of motives. Finally, the comparison with higher Chow groups is developed in part five. The lecture notes format is designed for the book to be read by an advanced graduate student or an expert in a related field. The lectures roughly correspond to one-hour lectures given by Voevodsky during the course he gave at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton on this subject in 1999-2000. In addition, many of the original proofs have been simplified and improved so that this book will also be a useful tool for research mathematicians.

Assessment Standards for School Mathematics,National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,1995,"This document was created because of the need for new assessment strategies and practices to be developed to enable teachers and others to assess students' performance in a manner that reflects the NCTM's reform vision for school mathematics. Instead of assuming that the purpose of assessment is to rank students on a particular trait, the new approach assumes that high public expectations can be set that every student can strive for and achieve, that different performances can and will meet agreed-on expectations, and that teachers can be fair and consistent judges of diverse student performances. The first sections of the document discuss six mathematics assessment standards: (1) The Mathematics Standard, (2) The Learning Standard, (3) The Equity Standard, (4) The Openness Standard, (5) The Inferences Standard, and (6) The Coherence Standard. The use of the assessment standards is then discussed in the context of different purposes such as monitoring students' progress, making instructional decisions, evaluating students' achievement, and evaluating programs. The next section discusses what should happen next with regard to mathematical assessment. The document concludes with a glossary and a selected assessment bibliography with 116 citations. Contains 28 references. (MKR)",Education,120,N/A,0,en

"Mindset Mathematics: Visualizing and Investigating Big Ideas, Grade 6","Jo Boaler, Jen Munson, Cathy Williams",John Wiley & Sons,2019-01-09,"Engage students in mathematics using growth mindset techniques The most challenging parts of teaching mathematics are engaging students and helping them understand the connections between mathematics concepts. In this volume, you'll find a collection of low floor, high ceiling tasks that will help you do just that, by looking at the big ideas at the sixth-grade level through visualization, play, and investigation. During their work with tens of thousands of teachers, authors Jo Boaler, Jen Munson, and Cathy Williams heard the same message—that they want to incorporate more brain science into their math instruction, but they need guidance in the techniques that work best to get across the concepts they needed to teach. So the authors designed Mindset Mathematics around the principle of active student engagement, with tasks that reflect the latest brain science on learning. Open, creative, and visual math tasks have been shown to improve student test scores, and more importantly change their relationship with mathematics and start believing in their own potential. The tasks in Mindset Mathematics reflect the lessons from brain science that: There is no such thing as a math person - anyone can learn mathematics to high levels. Mistakes, struggle and challenge are the most important times for brain growth. Speed is unimportant in mathematics. Mathematics is a visual and beautiful subject, and our brains want to think visually about mathematics. With engaging questions, open-ended tasks, and four-color visuals that will help kids get excited about mathematics, Mindset Mathematics is organized around nine big ideas which emphasize the connections within the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and can be used with any current curriculum.",Education,276,N/A,0,en

The Norm Residue Theorem in Motivic Cohomology,"Christian Haesemeyer, Charles A. Weibel",Princeton University Press,2019-06-11,"This book presents the complete proof of the Bloch-Kato conjecture and several related conjectures of Beilinson and Lichtenbaum in algebraic geometry. Brought together here for the first time, these conjectures describe the structure of étale cohomology and its relation to motivic cohomology and Chow groups. Although the proof relies on the work of several people, it is credited primarily to Vladimir Voevodsky. The authors draw on a multitude of published and unpublished sources to explain the large-scale structure of Voevodsky’s proof and introduce the key figures behind its development. They proceed to describe the highly innovative geometric constructions of Markus Rost, including the construction of norm varieties, which play a crucial role in the proof. The book then addresses symmetric powers of motives and motivic cohomology operations. Comprehensive and self-contained, The Norm Residue Theorem in Motivic Cohomology unites various components of the proof that until now were scattered across many sources of varying accessibility, often with differing hypotheses, definitions, and language.",Mathematics,316,N/A,0,en

"Visible Learning for Mathematics, Grades K-12","John Hattie, Douglas Fisher, Nancy Frey, Linda M. Gojak, Sara Delano Moore, William Mellman",Corwin Press,2016-09-15,"Rich tasks, collaborative work, number talks, problem-based learning, direct instruction…with so many possible approaches, how do we know which ones work the best? In Visible Learning for Mathematics, six acclaimed educators assert it’s not about which one—it’s about when—and show you how to design high-impact instruction so all students demonstrate more than a year’s worth of mathematics learning for a year spent in school. That’s a high bar, but with the amazing K-12 framework here, you choose the right approach at the right time, depending upon where learners are within three phases of learning: surface, deep, and transfer. This results in “visible” learning because the effect is tangible. The framework is forged out of current research in mathematics combined with John Hattie’s synthesis of more than 15 years of education research involving 300 million students. Chapter by chapter, and equipped with video clips, planning tools, rubrics, and templates, you get the inside track on which instructional strategies to use at each phase of the learning cycle: Surface learning phase: When—through carefully constructed experiences—students explore new concepts and make connections to procedural skills and vocabulary that give shape to developing conceptual understandings. Deep learning phase: When—through the solving of rich high-cognitive tasks and rigorous discussion—students make connections among conceptual ideas, form mathematical generalizations, and apply and practice procedural skills with fluency. Transfer phase: When students can independently think through more complex mathematics, and can plan, investigate, and elaborate as they apply what they know to new mathematical situations. To equip students for higher-level mathematics learning, we have to be clear about where students are, where they need to go, and what it looks like when they get there.

Mathematical Mindsets,Jo Boaler,John Wiley & Sons,2015-10-12,"Banish math anxiety and give students of all ages a clear roadmap to success Mathematical Mindsets provides practical strategies and activities to help teachers and parents show all children, even those who are convinced that they are bad at math, that they can enjoy and succeed in math. Jo Boaler—Stanford researcher, professor of math education, and expert on math learning—has studied why students don't like math and often fail in math classes. She's followed thousands of students through middle and high schools to study how they learn and to find the most effective ways to unleash the math potential in all students. There is a clear gap between what research has shown to work in teaching math and what happens in schools and at home. This book bridges that gap by turning research findings into practical activities and advice. Boaler translates Carol Dweck's concept of 'mindset' into math teaching and parenting strategies, showing how students can go from self-doubt to strong self-confidence, which is so important to math learning. Boaler reveals the steps that must be taken by schools and parents to improve math education for all. Mathematical Mindsets: Explains how the brain processes mathematics learning Reveals how to turn mistakes and struggles into valuable learning experiences Provides examples of rich mathematical activities to replace rote learning Explains ways to give students a positive math mindset Gives examples of how assessment and grading policies need to change to support real understanding Scores of students hate and fear math, so they end up leaving school without an understanding of basic mathematical concepts.

Teaching for Thinking,"Grace Kelemanik, Amy Lucenta",N/A,2022-01-24,"Teaching our children to think and reason mathematically is a challenge, not because students can't learn to think mathematically, but because we must change our own often deeply-rooted teaching habits. This is where instructional routines come in. Their predictable design and repeatable nature support both teachers and students to develop new habits. In Teaching for Thinking, Grace Kelemanik and Amy Lucenta pick up where their first book, Routines for Reasoning, left off. They draw on their years of experience in the classroom and as instructional coaches to examine how educators can make use of routines to make three fundamental shifts in teaching practice: Focus on thinking: Shift attention away from students' answers and toward their thinking and reasoning Step out of the middle: Shift the balance from teacher-student interactions toward student-student interactions Support productive struggle: Help students do the hard thinking work that leads to real learning With three complete new routines, support for designing your own routine, and ideas for using routines in your professional learning as well as in your classroom teaching, Teaching for Thinking will help you build new teaching habits that will support all your students to become and see themselves as capable mathematicians.",,184,N/A,0,en
"Mindset Mathematics: Visualizing and Investigating Big Ideas, Grade 7","Jo Boaler, Jen Munson, Cathy Williams",John Wiley & Sons,2019-08-27,"Engage students in mathematics using growth mindset techniques The most challenging parts of teaching mathematics are engaging students and helping them understand the connections between mathematics concepts. In this volume, you'll find a collection of low floor, high ceiling tasks that will help you do just that, by looking at the big ideas at the seventh-grade level through visualization, play, and investigation. During their work with tens of thousands of teachers, authors Jo Boaler, Jen Munson, and Cathy Williams heard the same message—that they want to incorporate more brain science into their math instruction, but they need guidance in the techniques that work best to get across the concepts they needed to teach. So the authors designed Mindset Mathematics around the principle of active student engagement, with tasks that reflect the latest brain science on learning. Open, creative, and visual math tasks have been shown to improve student test scores, and more importantly change their relationship with mathematics and start believing in their own potential. The tasks in Mindset Mathematics reflect the lessons from brain science that: There is no such thing as a math person - anyone can learn mathematics to high levels. Mistakes, struggle and challenge are the most important times for brain growth. Speed is unimportant in mathematics. Mathematics is a visual and beautiful subject, and our brains want to think visually about mathematics. With engaging questions, open-ended tasks, and four-color visuals that will help kids get excited about mathematics, Mindset Mathematics is organized around nine big ideas which emphasize the connections within the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and can be used with any current curriculum.",Education,304,N/A,0,en

Organized by grade level around the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics, Small shares approaches that will lead to a deeper and richer understanding of algebra for both teachers and students. The book opens with a clear discussion of algebraic thinking and current requirements for algebraic understanding within standards-based learning environments. The book then launches with Kindergarten, where the first relevant standard is found in the operations and algebraic thinking domain, and ends with Grade 8, where the focus is on working with linear equations and functions. In each section the relevant standard is presented, followed by a discussion of important underlying ideas associated with that standard, as well as thoughtful, concept-based questions that can be used for classroom instruction, practice, or assessment. The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics challenges students to become mathematical thinkers, not just mathematical ""doers.""

The Language of Mathematics,Robert L. Baber,John Wiley & Sons,2011-09-09,"A new and unique way of understanding the translation of concepts and natural language into mathematical expressions Transforming a body of text into corresponding mathematical expressions and models is traditionally viewed and taught as a mathematical problem; it is also a task that most find difficult. The Language of Mathematics: Utilizing Math in Practice reveals a new way to view this process—not as a mathematical problem, but as a translation, or language, problem. By presenting the language of mathematics explicitly and systematically, this book helps readers to learn mathematics¿and improve their ability to apply mathematics more efficiently and effectively to practical problems in their own work. Using parts of speech to identify variables and functions in a mathematical model is a new approach, as is the insight that examining aspects of grammar is highly useful when formulating a corresponding mathematical model. This book identifies the basic elements of the language of mathematics, such as values, variables, and functions, while presenting the grammatical rules for combining them into expressions and other structures. The author describes and defines different notational forms for expressions, and also identifies the relationships between parts of speech and other grammatical elements in English and components of expressions in the language of mathematics. Extensive examples are used throughout that cover a wide range of real-world problems and feature diagrams and tables to facilitate understanding. The Language of Mathematics is a thought-provoking book of interest for readers who would like to learn more about the linguistic nature and aspects of mathematical notation. The book also serves as a valuable supplement for engineers, technicians, managers, and consultants who would like to improve their ability to apply mathematics effectively, systematically, and efficiently to practical problems.",Mathematics,350,N/A,0,en

This book is the result of the seventh conference ICHME (International Conference on the History of Mathematics Education) that took place at Erbacher Hof, Mainz (Germany) from 19th to 23rd of September 2022. Nowadays, the history of education is of the utmost importance for assessing the general development of the educational system(s) in which mathematics education occurs. Usually, the history of education is confined to history within a given civilization, country or nation. However, the quality of the research for a given nation is enhanced when situated among various specific cases, and comparative studies provide essential tools to broaden the perspectives to an international level. Moreover, mathematics, as a school discipline, has always functioned at the crossroads between general education and professional training, thus relating its teaching history to professional working environments as well. The 24 chapters in this book reflect this wide area of research.",Mathematics,386,N/A,0,en

The Mathematics of Love,Hannah Fry,Simon and Schuster,2015-02-03,"In this must-have for anyone who wants to better understand their love life, a mathematician pulls back the curtain and reveals the hidden patterns—from dating sites to divorce, sex to marriage—behind the rituals of love. The roller coaster of romance is hard to quantify; defining how lovers might feel from a set of simple equations is impossible. But that doesn’t mean that mathematics isn’t a crucial tool for understanding love. Love, like most things in life, is full of patterns. And mathematics is ultimately the study of patterns—from predicting the weather to the fluctuations of the stock market, the movement of planets or the growth of cities. These patterns twist and turn and warp and evolve just as the rituals of love do. In The Mathematics of Love, Dr. Hannah Fry takes the reader on a fascinating journey through the patterns that define our love lives, applying mathematical formulas to the most common yet complex questions pertaining to love: What’s the chance of finding love? What’s the probability that it will last? How do online dating algorithms work, exactly? Can game theory help us decide who to approach in a bar? At what point in your dating life should you settle down? From evaluating the best strategies for online dating to defining the nebulous concept of beauty, Dr. Fry proves—with great insight, wit, and fun—that math is a surprisingly useful tool to negotiate the complicated, often baffling, sometimes infuriating, always interesting, mysteries of love.",Family & Relationships,128,N/A,0,en

Semiotics in Mathematics Education,"Norma Presmeg, Luis Radford, Wolff-Michael Roth, Gert Kadunz",Springer,2016-04-11,"This volume discusses semiotics in mathematics education as an activity with a formal sign system, in which each sign represents something else. Theories presented by Saussure, Peirce, Vygotsky and other writers on semiotics are summarized in their relevance to the teaching and learning of mathematics. The significance of signs for mathematics education lies in their ubiquitous use in every branch of mathematics. Such use involves seeing the general in the particular, a process that is not always clear to learners. Therefore, in several traditional frameworks, semiotics has the potential to serve as a powerful conceptual lens in investigating diverse topics in mathematics education research. Topics that are implicated include (but are not limited to): the birth of signs; embodiment, gestures and artifacts; segmentation and communicative fields; cultural mediation; social semiotics; linguistic theories; chains of signification; semiotic bundles; relationships among various sign systems; intersubjectivity; diagrammatic and inferential reasoning; and semiotics as the focus of innovative learning and teaching materials.",Education,45,N/A,0,en
The 'Resource' Approach to Mathematics Education,"Luc Trouche, Ghislaine Gueudet, Birgit Pepin",Springer Nature,2019-11-29,"This edited volume will help educators better analyze methodological and practical tools designed to aid classroom instruction. It features papers that explore the need to create a system in order to fully meet the uncertainties and developments of modern educational phenomena. These have emerged due to the abundance of digital resources and new forms of collective work. The collected papers offer new perspectives to a rising field of research known as the Documentational Approach to Didactics. This framework was first created by the editors of this book. It seeks to develop a deeper understanding of mathematics teaching expertise. Readers will gain insight into how to meet the theoretical questions brought about by digitalization. These include: how to analyze teachers’ work when they prepare for their teaching, how to conceptualize the relationships between individual and collective work, and how to follow the related processes over the long term. The contributors also provide a comparative view in terms of contrasting selected phenomena across different educational cultures and education systems. For instance, they consider how differences in curriculum resources are available to teachers and how teachers make use of them to shape instruction. Coverage also considers the extent to which teachers make use of additional material, particularly those available through the global marketplace on the Internet.

At that gathering, the idea occurred to several of us that it might be quite appropriate at this point in Erdos' career to solicit a col lection of articles illustrating various aspects of Erdos' mathematical life and work. The response to our solicitation was immediate and overwhelming, and these volumes are the result. Regarding the organization, we found it convenient to arrange the papers into six chapters, each mirroring Erdos' holistic approach to mathematics. Our goal was not merely a (random) collection of papers but rather a thor oughly edited volume composed in large part by articles explicitly solicited to illustrate interesting aspects of Erdos and his life and work. Each chap ter includes an introduction which often presents a sample of related Erdos' problems ""in his own words"". All these (sometimes lengthy) introductions were written jointly by editors. We wish to thank the nearly 70 contributors for their outstanding efforts (and their patience). In particular, we are grateful to Bela Bollobas for his extensive documentation of Paul Erdos' early years and mathematical high points (in the first part of this volume); our other authors are acknowledged in their respective chapters.

The Tower of Hanoi – Myths and Maths,"Andreas M. Hinz, Sandi Klavžar, Uroš Milutinović, Ciril Petr",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-01-31,"This is the first comprehensive monograph on the mathematical theory of the solitaire game “The Tower of Hanoi” which was invented in the 19th century by the French number theorist Édouard Lucas. The book comprises a survey of the historical development from the game’s predecessors up to recent research in mathematics and applications in computer science and psychology. Apart from long-standing myths it contains a thorough, largely self-contained presentation of the essential mathematical facts with complete proofs, including also unpublished material. The main objects of research today are the so-called Hanoi graphs and the related Sierpiński graphs. Acknowledging the great popularity of the topic in computer science, algorithms and their correctness proofs form an essential part of the book. In view of the most important practical applications of the Tower of Hanoi and its variants, namely in physics, network theory, and cognitive (neuro)psychology, other related structures and puzzles like, e.g., the “Tower of London”, are addressed. Numerous captivating integer sequences arise along the way, but also many open questions impose themselves. Central among these is the famed Frame-Stewart conjecture. Despite many attempts to decide it and large-scale numerical experiments supporting its truth, it remains unsettled after more than 70 years and thus demonstrates the timeliness of the topic. Enriched with elaborate illustrations, connections to other puzzles and challenges for the reader in the form of (solved) exercises as well as problems for further exploration, this book is enjoyable reading for students, educators, game enthusiasts and researchers alike.",Mathematics,340,N/A,0,en

Evolution of Mathematical Concepts,Raymond L. Wilder,Courier Corporation,2013-01-01,"Accessible to students and relevant to specialists, this remarkable book by a prominent educator offers a unique perspective on the evolutionary development of mathematics. Rather than conducting a survey of the history or philosophy of mathematics, Raymond L. Wilder envisions mathematics as a broad cultural phenomenon. His treatment examines and illustrates how such concepts as number and length were affected by historic and social events. Starting with a brief consideration of preliminary notions, this study explores the early evolution of numbers, the evolution of geometry, and the conquest of the infinite as embodied by real numbers. A detailed look at the processes of evolution concludes with an examination of the evolutionary aspects of modern mathematics.",Mathematics,242,N/A,0,en
Mathematical Work in Educational Context,"Alain Kuzniak, Elizabeth Montoya-Delgadillo, Philippe R. Richard",Springer Nature,2022-03-31,"This book is a friendly and complete introduction to one of the most comprehensive contemporary theories of mathematics teaching and learning. By focusing on mathematical work performed by students and teachers during mathematics session, the theory of Mathematical Workings Spaces (MWS) has opened up new perspectives and avenues on mathematics education and mathematical thinking. In particular, it enables the identification of students' knowledge production processes and helps teachers to shape them. The first part of the book explores the heart of the theory and aims to further describe and understand epistemological and cognitive aspects of mathematical work. The second part develops the different MWS dedicated to observing how this work depends on the expectations of educational systems, how it is formed and taught, and how individuals appropriate it. In the last part, some applications and perspectives are discussed regarding topics of major importance today in mathematics education which relate to technological and digital tools, teacher training and modeling activities. In line with the spirit of the theory, the book was written to reflect the conceptual unity at the heart of the theory of MWS and, at the same time, to show the freedom and diversity of approaches given space therein. Written for researchers and professionals in mathematics education, it offers plenty of concrete examples from different educational systems around the world to illustrate the theoretical concepts and show the applicability of the theory to practice and research.",Education,285,N/A,0,en

Mathematics and the Divine,"Teun Koetsier, Luc Bergmans",Elsevier,2004-12-09,"Mathematics and the Divine seem to correspond to diametrically opposed tendencies of the human mind. Does the mathematician not seek what is precisely defined, and do the objects intended by the mystic and the theologian not lie beyond definition? Is mathematics not Man's search for a measure, and isn't the Divine that which is immeasurable ?The present book shows that the domains of mathematics and the Divine, which may seem so radically separated, have throughout history and across cultures, proved to be intimately related. Religious activities such as the building of temples, the telling of ritual stories or the drawing of enigmatic figures all display distinct mathematical features. Major philosophical systems dealing with the Absolute and theological speculations focussing on our knowledge of the Ultimate have been based on or inspired by mathematics. A series of chapters by an international team of experts highlighting key figures, schools and trains of thought is presented here. Chinese number mysticism, the views of Pythagoras and Plato and their followers, Nicholas of Cusa's theological geometry, Spinozism and intuitionism as a philosophy of mathematics are treated side by side among many other themes in an attempt at creating a global view on the relation of mathematics and Man's quest for the Absolute in the course of history.·Mathematics and man's quest for the Absolute·A selective history highlighting key figures, schools and trains of thought ·An international team of historians presenting specific new findings as well as general overviews·Confronting and uniting otherwise compartmentalized information",Mathematics,716,N/A,0,en

"Elliptic Curves, Modular Forms, and Their L-functions",Álvaro Lozano-Robledo,American Mathematical Soc.,2011,"Many problems in number theory have simple statements, but their solutions require a deep understanding of algebra, algebraic geometry, complex analysis, group representations, or a combination of all four. The original simply stated problem can be obscured in the depth of the theory developed to understand it. This book is an introduction to some of these problems, and an overview of the theories used nowadays to attack them, presented so that the number theory is always at the forefront of the discussion. Lozano-Robledo gives an introductory survey of elliptic curves, modular forms, and $L$-functions. His main goal is to provide the reader with the big picture of the surprising connections among these three families of mathematical objects and their meaning for number theory. As a case in point, Lozano-Robledo explains the modularity theorem and its famous consequence, Fermat's Last Theorem. He also discusses the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture and other modern conjectures. The book begins with some motivating problems and includes numerous concrete examples throughout the text, often involving actual numbers, such as 3, 4, 5, $\frac{3344161}{747348}$, and $\frac{2244035177043369699245575130906674863160948472041} {8912332268928859588025535178967163570016480830}$. The theories of elliptic curves, modular forms, and $L$-functions are too vast to be covered in a single volume, and their proofs are outside the scope of the undergraduate curriculum. However, the primary objects of study, the statements of the main theorems, and their corollaries are within the grasp of advanced undergraduates. This book concentrates on motivating the definitions, explaining the statements of the theorems and conjectures, making connections, and providing lots of examples, rather than dwelling on the hard proofs. The book succeeds if, after reading the text, students feel compelled to study elliptic curves and modular forms in all their glory.",Mathematics,217,N/A,0,en

Journey into Discrete Mathematics,"Owen D. Byer, Deirdre L. Smeltzer, Kenneth L. Wantz",American Mathematical Soc.,2018-11-13,"Journey into Discrete Mathematics is designed for use in a first course in mathematical abstraction for early-career undergraduate mathematics majors. The important ideas of discrete mathematics are included—logic, sets, proof writing, relations, counting, number theory, and graph theory—in a manner that promotes development of a mathematical mindset and prepares students for further study. While the treatment is designed to prepare the student reader for the mathematics major, the book remains attractive and appealing to students of computer science and other problem-solving disciplines. The exposition is exquisite and engaging and features detailed descriptions of the thought processes that one might follow to attack the problems of mathematics. The problems are appealing and vary widely in depth and difficulty. Careful design of the book helps the student reader learn to think like a mathematician through the exposition and the problems provided. Several of the core topics, including counting, number theory, and graph theory, are visited twice: once in an introductory manner and then again in a later chapter with more advanced concepts and with a deeper perspective. Owen D. Byer and Deirdre L. Smeltzer are both Professors of Mathematics at Eastern Mennonite University. Kenneth L. Wantz is Professor of Mathematics at Regent University.

Mathletics,Wayne L. Winston,Princeton University Press,2012-03-18,"How math can be used to improve performance and predict outcomes in professional sports Mathletics is a remarkably entertaining book that shows readers how to use simple mathematics to analyze a range of statistical and probability-related questions in professional baseball, basketball, and football, and in sports gambling. How does professional baseball evaluate hitters? Is a singles hitter like Wade Boggs more valuable than a power hitter like David Ortiz? Should NFL teams pass or run more often on first downs? Could professional basketball have used statistics to expose the crooked referee Tim Donaghy? Does money buy performance in professional sports? In Mathletics, Wayne Winston describes the mathematical methods that top coaches and managers use to evaluate players and improve team performance, and gives math enthusiasts the practical tools they need to enhance their understanding and enjoyment of their favorite sports—and maybe even gain the outside edge to winning bets. Mathletics blends fun math problems with sports stories of actual games, teams, and players, along with personal anecdotes from Winston's work as a sports consultant. Winston uses easy-to-read tables and illustrations to illuminate the techniques and ideas he presents, and all the necessary math concepts—such as arithmetic, basic statistics and probability, and Monte Carlo simulations—are fully explained in the examples. After reading Mathletics, you will understand why baseball teams should almost never bunt, why football overtime systems are unfair, why points, rebounds, and assists aren't enough to determine who's the NBA's best player—and much, much more. In a new epilogue, Winston discusses the stats and numerical analysis behind some recent sporting events, such as how the Dallas Mavericks used analytics to become the 2011 NBA champions.",Mathematics,391,4,1,en

Knowing and Teaching Elementary Mathematics,Liping Ma,Routledge,2010-03-26,"Studies of teachers in the U.S. often document insufficient subject matter knowledge in mathematics. Yet, these studies give few examples of the knowledge teachers need to support teaching, particularly the kind of teaching demanded by recent reforms in mathematics education. Knowing and Teaching Elementary Mathematics describes the nature and development of the knowledge that elementary teachers need to become accomplished mathematics teachers, and suggests why such knowledge seems more common in China than in the United States, despite the fact that Chinese teachers have less formal education than their U.S. counterparts. The anniversary edition of this bestselling volume includes the original studies that compare U.S and Chinese elementary school teachers’ mathematical understanding and offers a powerful framework for grasping the mathematical content necessary to understand and develop the thinking of school children. Highlighting notable changes in the field and the author’s work, this new edition includes an updated preface, introduction, and key journal articles that frame and contextualize this seminal work.",Education,290,N/A,0,en
The 'Resource' Approach to Mathematics Education,"Luc Trouche, Ghislaine Gueudet, Birgit Pepin",Springer,2020-12-25,"This edited volume will help educators better analyze methodological and practical tools designed to aid classroom instruction. It features papers that explore the need to create a system in order to fully meet the uncertainties and developments of modern educational phenomena. These have emerged due to the abundance of digital resources and new forms of collective work. The collected papers offer new perspectives to a rising field of research known as the Documentational Approach to Didactics. This framework was first created by the editors of this book. It seeks to develop a deeper understanding of mathematics teaching expertise. Readers will gain insight into how to meet the theoretical questions brought about by digitalization. These include: how to analyze teachers’ work when they prepare for their teaching, how to conceptualize the relationships between individual and collective work, and how to follow the related processes over the long term. The contributors also provide a comparative view in terms of contrasting selected phenomena across different educational cultures and education systems. For instance, they consider how differences in curriculum resources are available to teachers and how teachers make use of them to shape instruction. Coverage also considers the extent to which teachers make use of additional material, particularly those available through the global marketplace on the Internet.

Linear Algebra Done Right,Sheldon Axler,Springer Science & Business Media,1997-07-18,"This text for a second course in linear algebra, aimed at math majors and graduates, adopts a novel approach by banishing determinants to the end of the book and focusing on understanding the structure of linear operators on vector spaces. The author has taken unusual care to motivate concepts and to simplify proofs. For example, the book presents - without having defined determinants - a clean proof that every linear operator on a finite-dimensional complex vector space has an eigenvalue. The book starts by discussing vector spaces, linear independence, span, basics, and dimension. Students are introduced to inner-product spaces in the first half of the book and shortly thereafter to the finite- dimensional spectral theorem. A variety of interesting exercises in each chapter helps students understand and manipulate the objects of linear algebra. This second edition features new chapters on diagonal matrices, on linear functionals and adjoints, and on the spectral theorem; some sections, such as those on self-adjoint and normal operators, have been entirely rewritten; and hundreds of minor improvements have been made throughout the text.",Mathematics,276,N/A,0,en

Deleuze and the History of Mathematics,Simon Duffy,A&amp;C Black,2013-05-09,"Gilles Deleuze's engagements with mathematics, replete in his work, rely upon the construction of alternative lineages in the history of mathematics, which challenge some of the self imposed limits that regulate the canonical concepts of the discipline. For Deleuze, these challenges provide an opportunity to reconfigure particular philosophical problems - for example, the problem of individuation - and to develop new concepts in response to them. The highly original research presented in this book explores the mathematical construction of Deleuze's philosophy, as well as addressing the undervalued and often neglected question of the mathematical thinkers who influenced his work. In the wake of Alain Badiou's recent and seemingly devastating attack on the way the relation between mathematics and philosophy is configured in Deleuze's work, Simon B.Duffy offers a robust defence of the structure of Deleuze's philosophy and, in particular, the adequacy of the mathematical problems used in its construction. By reconciling Badiou and Deleuze's seemingly incompatible engagements with mathematics, Duffy succeeds in presenting a solid foundation for Deleuze's philosophy, rebuffing the recent challenges against it.",Philosophy,225,N/A,0,en
"The Continuous, the Discrete and the Infinitesimal in Philosophy and Mathematics",John L. Bell,Springer Nature,2019-09-09,"This book explores and articulates the concepts of the continuous and the infinitesimal from two points of view: the philosophical and the mathematical. The first section covers the history of these ideas in philosophy. Chapter one, entitled ‘The continuous and the discrete in Ancient Greece, the Orient and the European Middle Ages,’ reviews the work of Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, and other Ancient Greeks; the elements of early Chinese, Indian and Islamic thought; and early Europeans including Henry of Harclay, Nicholas of Autrecourt, Duns Scotus, William of Ockham, Thomas Bradwardine and Nicolas Oreme. The second chapter of the book covers European thinkers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: Galileo, Newton, Leibniz, Descartes, Arnauld, Fermat, and more. Chapter three, 'The age of continuity,’ discusses eighteenth century mathematicians including Euler and Carnot, and philosophers, among them Hume, Kant and Hegel. Examining the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the fourth chapter describes the reduction of the continuous to the discrete, citing the contributions of Bolzano, Cauchy and Reimann. Part one of the book concludes with a chapter on divergent conceptions of the continuum, with the work of nineteenth and early twentieth century philosophers and mathematicians, including Veronese, Poincaré, Brouwer, and Weyl. Part two of this book covers contemporary mathematics, discussing topology and manifolds, categories, and functors, Grothendieck topologies, sheaves, and elementary topoi.

Number Theory and Geometry: An Introduction to Arithmetic Geometry,Álvaro Lozano-Robledo,American Mathematical Soc.,2019-03-21,"Geometry and the theory of numbers are as old as some of the oldest historical records of humanity. Ever since antiquity, mathematicians have discovered many beautiful interactions between the two subjects and recorded them in such classical texts as Euclid's Elements and Diophantus's Arithmetica. Nowadays, the field of mathematics that studies the interactions between number theory and algebraic geometry is known as arithmetic geometry. This book is an introduction to number theory and arithmetic geometry, and the goal of the text is to use geometry as the motivation to prove the main theorems in the book. For example, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic is a consequence of the tools we develop in order to find all the integral points on a line in the plane. Similarly, Gauss's law of quadratic reciprocity and the theory of continued fractions naturally arise when we attempt to determine the integral points on a curve in the plane given by a quadratic polynomial equation. After an introduction to the theory of diophantine equations, the rest of the book is structured in three acts that correspond to the study of the integral and rational solutions of linear, quadratic, and cubic curves, respectively. This book describes many applications including modern applications in cryptography; it also presents some recent results in arithmetic geometry. With many exercises, this book can be used as a text for a first course in number theory or for a subsequent course on arithmetic (or diophantine) geometry at the junior-senior level.",Mathematics,506,N/A,0,en

Mathematics and Art,Lynn Gamwell,Princeton University Press,2016,"This is a cultural history of mathematics and art, from antiquity to the present. Mathematicians and artists have long been on a quest to understand the physical world they see before them and the abstract objects they know by thought alone. Taking readers on a tour of the practice of mathematics and the philosophical ideas that drive the discipline, Lynn Gamwell points out the important ways mathematical concepts have been expressed by artists. Sumptuous illustrations of artworks and cogent math diagrams are featured in Gamwell's comprehensive exploration. Gamwell begins by describing mathematics from antiquity to the Enlightenment, including Greek, Islamic, and Asian mathematics. Then focusing on modern culture, Gamwell traces mathematicians' search for the foundations of their science, such as David Hilbert's conception of mathematics as an arrangement of meaning-free signs, as well as artists' search for the essence of their craft, such as Aleksandr Rodchenko's monochrome paintings. She shows that self-reflection is inherent to the practice of both modern mathematics and art, and that this introspection points to a deep resonance between the two fields: Kurt Gödel posed questions about the nature of mathematics in the language of mathematics and Jasper Johns asked ""What is art?"" in the vocabulary of art. Throughout, Gamwell describes the personalities and cultural environments of a multitude of mathematicians and artists, from Gottlob Frege and Benoît Mandelbrot to Max Bill and Xu Bing. Mathematics and Art demonstrates how mathematical ideas are embodied in the visual arts and will enlighten all who are interested in the complex intellectual pursuits, personalities, and cultural settings that connect these vast disciplines.",Art,576,N/A,0,en

Now in its 25th year, the program has undergone both a business reorganization and a long-awaited revision of the Level One Teacher's Manual by the original author, Jan Semple. Semple Math materials were formerly distributed by Stevenson Learning Skills, Inc. Moving forward, Semple Math, Inc., a new company founded by members of the Semple family, will actively market our program while safeguarding the integrity ofthis tried and true process.

A First Course in Mathematical Logic and Set Theory,Michael L. O'Leary,John Wiley & Sons,2015-09-14,"A mathematical introduction to the theory and applications of logic and set theory with an emphasis on writing proofs Highlighting the applications and notations of basic mathematical concepts within the framework of logic and set theory, A First Course in Mathematical Logic and Set Theory introduces how logic is used to prepare and structure proofs and solve more complex problems. The book begins with propositional logic, including two-column proofs and truth table applications, followed by first-order logic, which provides the structure for writing mathematical proofs. Set theory is then introduced and serves as the basis for defining relations, functions, numbers, mathematical induction, ordinals, and cardinals. The book concludes with a primer on basic model theory with applications to abstract algebra. A First Course in Mathematical Logic and Set Theory also includes: Section exercises designed to show the interactions between topics and reinforce the presented ideas and concepts Numerous examples that illustrate theorems and employ basic concepts such as Euclid’s lemma, the Fibonacci sequence, and unique factorization Coverage of important theorems including the well-ordering theorem, completeness theorem, compactness theorem, as well as the theorems of Löwenheim–Skolem, Burali-Forti, Hartogs, Cantor–Schröder–Bernstein, and König An excellent textbook for students studying the foundations of mathematics and mathematical proofs, A First Course in Mathematical Logic and Set Theory is also appropriate for readers preparing for careers in mathematics education or computer science. In addition, the book is ideal for introductory courses on mathematical logic and/or set theory and appropriate for upper-undergraduate transition courses with rigorous mathematical reasoning involving algebra, number theory, or analysis.",Mathematics,464,N/A,0,en
The Foundations of Mathematics,Kenneth Kunen,N/A,2009,"Mathematical logic grew out of philosophical questions regarding the foundations of mathematics, but logic has now outgrown its philosophical roots, and has become an integral part of mathematics in general. This book is designed for students who plan to specialize in logic, as well as for those who are interested in the applications of logic to other areas of mathematics. Used as a text, it could form the basis of a beginning graduate-level course. There are three main chapters: Set Theory, Model Theory, and Recursion Theory. The Set Theory chapter describes the set-theoretic foundations of all of mathematics, based on the ZFC axioms. It also covers technical results about the Axiom of Choice, well-orderings, and the theory of uncountable cardinals. The Model Theory chapter discusses predicate logic and formal proofs, and covers the Completeness, Compactness, and Lowenheim-Skolem Theorems, elementary submodels, model completeness, and applications to algebra. This chapter also continues the foundational issues begun in the set theory chapter. Mathematics can now be viewed as formal proofs from ZFC. Also, model theory leads to models of set theory. This includes a discussion of absoluteness, and an analysis of models such as H( ) and R( ). The Recursion Theory chapter develops some basic facts about computable functions, and uses them to prove a number of results of foundational importance; in particular, Church's theorem on the undecidability of logical consequence, the incompleteness theorems of Godel, and Tarski's theorem on the non-definability of truth.",Mathematics,251,N/A,0,en
The Mathematics of Paul Erdős I,"Ronald L. Graham, Jaroslav Nešetřil, Steve Butler",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-08-04,"This is the most comprehensive survey of the mathematical life of the legendary Paul Erdős (1913-1996), one of the most versatile and prolific mathematicians of our time. For the first time, all the main areas of Erdős' research are covered in a single project. Because of overwhelming response from the mathematical community, the project now occupies over 1000 pages, arranged into two volumes. These volumes contain both high level research articles as well as key articles that survey some of the cornerstones of Erdős' work, each written by a leading world specialist in the field. A special chapter ""Early Days"", rare photographs, and art related to Erdős complement this striking collection. A unique contribution is the bibliography on Erdős' publications: the most comprehensive ever published. This new edition, dedicated to the 100th anniversary of Paul Erdős' birth, contains updates on many of the articles from the two volumes of the first edition, several new articles from prominent mathematicians, a new introduction, more biographical information about Paul Erdős, and an updated list of publications. The first volume contains the unique chapter ""Early Days"", which features personal memories of Paul Erdős by a number of his colleagues. The other three chapters cover number theory, random methods, and geometry. All of these chapters are essentially updated, most notably the geometry chapter that covers the recent solution of the problem on the number of distinct distances in finite planar sets, which was the most popular of Erdős' favorite geometry problems.",Mathematics,564,N/A,0,en

The Fundamentals of Mathematical Analysis,G. M. Fikhtengol'ts,Elsevier,2014-08-01,"The Fundamentals of Mathematical Analysis, Volume 2 is a continuation of the discussion of the fundamentals of mathematical analysis, specifically on the subject of curvilinear and surface integrals, with emphasis on the difference between the curvilinear and surface """"integrals of first kind"""" and """"integrals of second kind."""" The discussions in the book start with an introduction to the elementary concepts of series of numbers, infinite sequences and their limits, and the continuity of the sum of a series. The definition of improper integrals of unbounded functions and that of uniform convergence of integrals are explained. Curvilinear integrals of the first and second kinds are analyzed mathematically. The book then notes the application of surface integrals, through a parametric representation of a surface, and the calculation of the mass of a solid. The text also highlights that Green's formula, which connects a double integral over a plane domain with curvilinear integral along the contour of the domain, has an analogue in Ostrogradski's formula. The periodic values and harmonic analysis such as that found in the operation of a steam engine are analyzed. The volume ends with a note of further developments in mathematical analysis, which is a chronological presentation of important milestones in the history of analysis.

Mathematical Reasoning,Raymond Nickerson,Psychology Press,2011-02-25,"The development of mathematical competence -- both by humans as a species over millennia and by individuals over their lifetimes -- is a fascinating aspect of human cognition. This book explores when and why the rudiments of mathematical capability first appeared among human beings, what its fundamental concepts are, and how and why it has grown into the richly branching complex of specialties that it is today. It discusses whether the ‘truths’ of mathematics are discoveries or inventions, and what prompts the emergence of concepts that appear to be descriptive of nothing in human experience. Also covered is the role of esthetics in mathematics: What exactly are mathematicians seeing when they describe a mathematical entity as ‘beautiful’? There is discussion of whether mathematical disability is distinguishable from a general cognitive deficit and whether the potential for mathematical reasoning is best developed through instruction. This volume is unique in the vast range of psychological questions it covers, as revealed in the work habits and products of numerous mathematicians. It provides fascinating reading for researchers and students with an interest in cognition in general and mathematical cognition in particular. Instructors of mathematics will also find the book’s insights illuminating.",Psychology,628,N/A,0,en

Math Without Numbers,Milo Beckman,Penguin UK,2021-01-07,"'The whizz-kid making maths supercool. . . A brilliant book that takes everything we know (and fear) about maths out of the equation - starting with numbers' The Times 'A cheerful, chatty, and charming trip through the world of mathematics. . . Everyone should read this delightful book' Ian Stewart, author of Do Dice Play God? The only numbers in this book are the page numbers. The three main branches of abstract math - topology, analysis, and algebra - turn out to be surprisingly easy to grasp. Or at least, they are when our guide is a math prodigy. With forthright wit and warm charm, Milo Beckman upends the conventional approach to mathematics, inviting us to think creatively about shape and dimension, the infinite and the infinitesimal, symmetries, proofs, and all how all these concepts fit together. Why is there a million dollar prize for counting shapes? Is anything bigger than infinity? And how is the 'truth' of mathematics actually decided? A vivid and wholly original guide to the math that makes the world tick and the planets revolve, Math Without Numbers makes human and understandable the elevated and hypothetical, allowing us to clearly see abstract math for what it is: bizarre, beautiful, and head-scratchingly wonderful.",Mathematics,224,N/A,0,en

Transformational Change Efforts: Student Engagement in Mathematics through an Institutional Network for Active Learning,"Wendy M. Smith, Matthew Voigt, April Ström, David C. Webb, W.

We report findings from the Student Engagement in Mathematics through an Institutional Network for Active Learning (SEMINAL) study. SEMINAL's purpose is to help change agents, those looking to (or currently attempting to) enact change within mathematics departments and beyond—trying to reform the instruction of their lower division mathematics courses in order to promote high achievement for all students. SEMINAL specifically studies the change mechanisms that allow postsecondary institutions to incorporate and sustain active learning in Precalculus to Calculus 2 learning environments. Out of the approximately 2.5 million students enrolled in collegiate mathematics courses each year, over 90% are enrolled in Precalculus to Calculus 2 courses. Forty-four percent of mathematics departments think active learning mathematics strategies are important for Precalculus to Calculus 2 courses, but only 15 percnt state that they are very successful at implementing them. Therefore, insights into the following research question will help with institutional transformations: What conditions, strategies, interventions and actions at the departmental and classroom levels contribute to the initiation, implementation, and institutional sustainability of active learning in the undergraduate calculus sequence (Precalculus to Calculus 2) across varied institutions?",Education,372,N/A,0,en

A Decade of the Berkeley Math Circle,"Zvezdelina Stankova, Tom Rike",American Mathematical Soc.,2008-11-26,"Many mathematicians have been drawn to mathematics through their experience with math circles: extracurricular programs exposing teenage students to advanced mathematical topics and a myriad of problem solving techniques and inspiring in them a lifelong love for mathematics. Founded in 1998, the Berkeley Math Circle (BMC) is a pioneering model of a U.S. math circle, aspiring to prepare our best young minds for their future roles as mathematics leaders. Over the last decade, 50 instructors--from university professors to high school teachers to business tycoons--have shared their passion for mathematics by delivering more than 320 BMC sessions full of mathematical challenges and wonders. Based on a dozen of these sessions, this book encompasses a wide variety of enticing mathematical topics: from inversion in the plane to circle geometry; from combinatorics to Rubik's cube and abstract algebra; from number theory to mass point theory; from complex numbers to game theory via invariants and monovariants. The treatments of these subjects encompass every significant method of proof and emphasize ways of thinking and reasoning via 100 problem solving techniques. Also featured are 300 problems, ranging from beginner to intermediate level, with occasional peaks of advanced problems and even some open questions. The book presents possible paths to studying mathematics and inevitably falling in love with it, via teaching two important skills: thinking creatively while still ``obeying the rules,'' and making connections between problems, ideas, and theories. The book encourages you to apply the newly acquired knowledge to problems and guides you along the way, but rarely gives you ready answers. ``Learning from our own mistakes'' often occurs through discussions of non-proofs and common problem solving pitfalls. The reader has to commit to mastering the new theories and techniques by ``getting your hands dirty'' with the problems, going back and reviewing necessary problem solving techniques and theory, and persistently moving forward in the book. The mathematical world is huge: you'll never know everything, but you'll learn where to find things, how to connect and use them. The rewards will be substantial. In the interest of fostering a greater awareness and appreciation of mathematics and its connections to other disciplines and everyday life, MSRI and the AMS are publishing books in the Mathematical Circles Library series as a service to young people, their parents and teachers, and the mathematics profession.",Mathematics,346,N/A,0,en

Do I Count?,Gunter M. Ziegler,CRC Press,2013-07-22,"The subject of mathematics is not something distant, strange, and abstract that you can only learn about—and often dislike—in school. It is in everyday situations, such as housekeeping, communications, traffic, and weather reports. Taking you on a trip into the world of mathematics, Do I Count? Stories from Mathematics describes in a clear and captivating way the people behind the numbers and the places where mathematics is made. Written by top scientist and engaging storyteller Günter M. Ziegler and translated by Thomas von Foerster, the book presents mathematics and mathematicians in a manner that you have not previously encountered. It guides you on a scenic tour through the field, pointing out which beds were useful in constructing which theorems and which notebooks list the prizes for solving particular problems. Forgoing esoteric areas, the text relates mathematics to celebrities, history, travel, politics, science and technology, weather, clever puzzles, and the future. Can bees count? Is 13 bad luck? Are there equations for everything? What’s the real practical value of the Pythagorean Theorem? Are there Sudoku puzzles with fewer than 17 entries and just one solution? Where and how do mathematicians work? Who invented proofs and why do we need them? Why is there no Nobel Prize for mathematics? What kind of life did Paul Erdős lead? Find out the answers to these and other questions in this entertaining book of stories. You’ll see that everyone counts, but no computation is needed.",Mathematics,228,N/A,0,en

Discrete Mathematics and Computing,Malik Magdon-Ismail,N/A,2019-12-14,"This text is a semester course in the basic mathematical and theoretical foundations of computer science. Students who make heavy use of computing should learn these foundations well, setting a base for a follow-on course in algorithms. A solid theoretical and algorithmic foundation in computer science sets the stage for developing good programs, programs that work, always and efficiently.Each chapter is a lecture that has been taught as such. Part I starts with basic logic, proofs and discrete mathematics, including: induction, recursion, summation, asymptotics and number theory. We then continue with graphs, counting and combinatorics, and wrap up the coverage of discrete mathematics with discrete probability. Part II presents the blockbuster application of discrete mathematics: the digital computer and a theory of computing. The goal is to understand what a computer can and cannot do. We start small, with automata, and end big with Turing Machines.Our approach is Socratic. The reader is encouraged to participate actively in the learning process by doing the quizzes and exercises that are liberally sprinkled through the text. The pace and level is appropriate for readers with one year of training in programming and calculus (college sophomores).",,0,N/A,0,en

American Mathematics 1890-1913,Steve Batterson,The Mathematical Association of America,2017-06-29,"At the turn of the twentieth century, mathematical scholarship in the United States underwent a stunning transformation. In 1890 no American professor was producing mathematical research worthy of international attention. Graduate students were then advised to pursue their studies abroad. By the start of World War I the standing of American mathematics had radically changed. George David Birkhoff, Leonard Dickson, and others were turning out cutting edge investigations that attracted notice in the intellectual centers of Europe. Harvard, Chicago, and Princeton maintained graduate programs comparable to those overseas. This book explores the people, timing, and factors behind this rapid advance. Through the mid-nineteenth century most American colleges followed a classical curriculum that, in mathematics, rarely reached beyond calculus. With no doctoral programs of any sort in the United States until 1860, mathematical scholarship lagged far behind that in Europe. After the Civil War, visionary presidents at Harvard and Johns Hopkins broadened and deepened the opportunities for study. The breakthrough for mathematics began in 1890 with the hiring, in consecutive years, of William F. Osgood and Maxime Bôcher at Harvard and E. H. Moore at Chicago. Each of these young men had studied in Germany where they acquired vital mathematical knowledge and taste. Over the next few years Osgood, Bôcher, and Moore established their own research programs and introduced new graduate courses. Working with other like-minded individuals through the nascent American Mathematical Society, the infrastructure of meetings and journals were created. In the early twentieth century Princeton dramatically upgraded its faculty to give the United States the stability of a third mathematics center. The publication by Birkhoff, in 1913, of the solution to a famous conjecture served notice that American mathematics had earned consideration with the European powers of Germany, France, Italy, England, and Russia.",Mathematics,244,N/A,0,en

Love and Math,Edward Frenkel,Basic Books,2013-10-01,"An awesome, globe-spanning, and New York Times bestselling journey through the beauty and power of mathematics What if you had to take an art class in which you were only taught how to paint a fence? What if you were never shown the paintings of van Gogh and Picasso, weren't even told they existed? Alas, this is how math is taught, and so for most of us it becomes the intellectual equivalent of watching paint dry. In Love and Math, renowned mathematician Edward Frenkel reveals a side of math we've never seen, suffused with all the beauty and elegance of a work of art. In this heartfelt and passionate book, Frenkel shows that mathematics, far from occupying a specialist niche, goes to the heart of all matter, uniting us across cultures, time, and space. Love and Math tells two intertwined stories: of the wonders of mathematics and of one young man's journey learning and living it. Having braved a discriminatory educational system to become one of the twenty-first century's leading mathematicians, Frenkel now works on one of the biggest ideas to come out of math in the last 50 years: the Langlands Program. Considered by many to be a Grand Unified Theory of mathematics, the Langlands Program enables researchers to translate findings from one field to another so that they can solve problems, such as Fermat's last theorem, that had seemed intractable before. At its core, Love and Math is a story about accessing a new way of thinking, which can enrich our lives and empower us to better understand the world and our place in it. It is an invitation to discover the magic hidden universe of mathematics.",Mathematics,314,N/A,0,en

Discovering Discrete Dynamical Systems,"Aimee Johnson, Kathleen Madden, Ayse Sahin",American Mathematical Soc.,2017-12-31,"Discovering Discrete Dynamical Systems is a mathematics textbook designed for use in a student-led, inquiry-based course for advanced mathematics majors. Fourteen modules each with an opening exploration, a short exposition and related exercises, and a concluding project guide students to self-discovery on topics such as fixed points and their classifications, chaos and fractals, Julia and Mandelbrot sets in the complex plane, and symbolic dynamics. Topics have been carefully chosen as a means for developing student persistence and skill in exploration, conjecture, and generalization while at the same time providing a coherent introduction to the fundamentals of discrete dynamical systems. This book is written for undergraduate students with the prerequisites for a first analysis course, and it can easily be used by any faculty member in a mathematics department, regardless of area of expertise. Each module starts with an exploration in which the students are asked an open-ended question. This allows the students to make discoveries which lead them to formulate the questions that will be addressed in the exposition and exercises of the module. The exposition is brief and has been written with the intent that a student who has taken, or is ready to take, a course in analysis can read the material independently. The exposition concludes with exercises which have been designed to both illustrate and explore in more depth the ideas covered in the exposition. Each module concludes with a project in which students bring the ideas from the module to bear on a more challenging or in-depth problem. A section entitled ""To the Instructor"" includes suggestions on how to structure a course in order to realize the inquiry-based intent of the book. The book has also been used successfully as the basis for an independent study course and as a supplementary text for an analysis course with traditional content.",Mathematics,132,N/A,0,en

A Tour of the Calculus,David Berlinski,Vintage,2011-04-27,"Were it not for the calculus, mathematicians would have no way to describe the acceleration of a motorcycle or the effect of gravity on thrown balls and distant planets, or to prove that a man could cross a room and eventually touch the opposite wall. Just how calculus makes these things possible and in doing so finds a correspondence between real numbers and the real world is the subject of this dazzling book by a writer of extraordinary clarity and stylistic brio. Even as he initiates us into the mysteries of real numbers, functions, and limits, Berlinski explores the furthest implications of his subject, revealing how the calculus reconciles the precision of numbers with the fluidity of the changing universe.

Visual Complex Functions,Elias Wegert,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-08-30,"This book provides a systematic introduction to functions of one complex variable. Its novel feature is the consistent use of special color representations – so-called phase portraits – which visualize functions as images on their domains. Reading Visual Complex Functions requires no prerequisites except some basic knowledge of real calculus and plane geometry. The text is self-contained and covers all the main topics usually treated in a first course on complex analysis. With separate chapters on various construction principles, conformal mappings and Riemann surfaces it goes somewhat beyond a standard programme and leads the reader to more advanced themes. In a second storyline, running parallel to the course outlined above, one learns how properties of complex functions are reflected in and can be read off from phase portraits. The book contains more than 200 of these pictorial representations which endow individual faces to analytic functions. Phase portraits enhance the intuitive understanding of concepts in complex analysis and are expected to be useful tools for anybody working with special functions – even experienced researchers may be inspired by the pictures to new and challenging questions. Visual Complex Functions may also serve as a companion to other texts or as a reference work for advanced readers who wish to know more about phase portraits.",Mathematics,374,N/A,0,en
Mathematize It! [Grades 6-8],"Kimberly Morrow-Leong, Sara Delano Moore, Linda M. Gojak",Corwin,2020-08-21,"Help students reveal the math behind the words ""I don’t get what I’m supposed to do!"" This is a common refrain from students when asked to solve word problems. Solving problems is about more than computation. Students must understand the mathematics of a situation to know what computation will lead to an appropriate solution. Many students often pluck numbers from the problem and plug them into an equation using the first operation they can think of (or the last one they practiced). Students also tend to choose an operation by solely relying on key words that they believe will help them arrive at an answer, without careful consideration of what the problem is actually asking of them. Mathematize It! Going Beyond Key Words to Make Sense of Word Problems, Grades 6–8 shares a reasoning approach that helps students dig into the problem to uncover the underlying mathematics, deeply consider the problem’s context, and employ strong operation sense to solve it. Through the process of mathematizing, the authors provide an explanation of a consistent method—and specific instructional strategies—to take the initial focus off specific numbers and computations and put it on the actions and relationships expressed in the problem. Sure to enhance teachers’ own operation sense, this user-friendly resource for Grades 6–8: · Offers a systematic mathematizing process for students to use when solving word problems · Gives practice opportunities and dozens of problems to leverage in the classroom · Provides specific examples of questions and explorations for multiplication and division, fractions and decimals, as well as operations with rational numbers · Demonstrates the use of visual representations to model problems with dozens of short videos · Includes end-of-chapter activities and reflection questions How can you help your students understand what is happening mathematically when solving word problems?

Mathematics of the 19th Century,"KOLMOGOROV, YUSHKEVICH",Birkhäuser,2013-11-11,"This multi-authored effort, Mathematics of the nineteenth century (to be fol lowed by Mathematics of the twentieth century), is a sequel to the History of mathematics fram antiquity to the early nineteenth century, published in three 1 volumes from 1970 to 1972. For reasons explained below, our discussion of twentieth-century mathematics ends with the 1930s. Our general objectives are identical with those stated in the preface to the three-volume edition, i. e. , we consider the development of mathematics not simply as the process of perfecting concepts and techniques for studying real-world spatial forms and quantitative relationships but as a social process as weIl. Mathematical structures, once established, are capable of a certain degree of autonomous development. In the final analysis, however, such immanent mathematical evolution is conditioned by practical activity and is either self-directed or, as is most often the case, is determined by the needs of society. Proceeding from this premise, we intend, first, to unravel the forces that shape mathe matical progress. We examine the interaction of mathematics with the social structure, technology, the natural sciences, and philosophy. Throughan anal ysis of mathematical history proper, we hope to delineate the relationships among the various mathematical disciplines and to evaluate mathematical achievements in the light of the current state and future prospects of the science.

Vedic Mathematics: A Mathematical Tale From The Ancient Veda To Modern Times,"Giuseppe Dattoli, Silvia Licciardi, Marcello Artioli",World Scientific,2021-05-07,"This is a book about Mathematics but not a book of Mathematics. It is an attempt, between the serious and facetious, of conveying the idea that a mathematical thought is the result of different experiences, geographical and social factors. Even though it is not clear when Mathematics had started, it is evident that it had been used at an early stage of human history and by ancient Babylonians and Egyptians who have already developed a sophisticated corpus of mathematical items, which were the workhorse tools in engineering, navigation, trades and astronomy. The book sweeps across the mathematical minds of the Greek and Arab traditions, concepts by Assyro-Babylonians, and ancient Indian Vedic culture. The mathematical mind has modeled the evolution of societies and has been modeled by it. It is now in the midst of a great revolution and it is not clear where it will bring us.

Mathematics Education as a Research Domain: A Search for Identity,"Anna Sierpinska, Jeremy Kilpatrick",Springer,2013-03-14,"No one disputes how important it is, in today's world, to prepare students to un derstand mathematics as well as to use and communicate mathematics in their future lives. That task is very difficult, however. Refocusing curricula on funda mental concepts, producing new teaching materials, and designing teaching units based on 'mathematicians' common sense' (or on logic) have not resulted in a better understanding of mathematics by more students. The failure of such efforts has raised questions suggesting that what was missing at the outset of these proposals, designs, and productions was a more profound knowledge of the phenomena of learning and teaching mathematics in socially established and culturally, politically, and economically justified institutions - namely, schools. Such knowledge cannot be built by mere juxtaposition of theories in disci plines such as psychology, sociology, and mathematics. Psychological theories focus on the individual learner. Theories of sociology of education look at the general laws of curriculum development, the specifics of pedagogic discourse as opposed to scientific discourse in general, the different possible pedagogic rela tions between the teacher and the taught, and other general problems in the inter face between education and society. Mathematics, aside from its theoretical contents, can be looked at from historical and epistemological points of view, clarifying the genetic development of its concepts, methods, and theories. This view can shed some light on the meaning of mathematical concepts and on the difficulties students have in teaching approaches that disregard the genetic development of these concepts.",Education,244,N/A,0,en

Piaget’s Genetic Epistemology for Mathematics Education Research,"Paul Christian Dawkins, Amy J. Hackenberg, Anderson Norton",Springer Nature,2024-01-22,"The book provides an entry point for graduate students and other scholars interested in using the constructs of Piaget’s genetic epistemology in mathematics education research. Constructs comprising genetic epistemology form the basis for some of the most well-developed theoretical frameworks available for characterizing learning, particularly in mathematics. The depth and complexity of Piaget’s work can make it challenging to find adequate entry points for learners, not least because it requires a reorientation regarding the nature of mathematical knowledge itself. This volume gathers leading scholars to help address that challenge. The main section of the book presents key Piagetian constructs for mathematics education research such as schemes and operations, figurative and operative thought, images and meanings, and decentering. The chapters that discuss these constructs include examples from research and address how these constructs can be used in research. There are two chapters on various types of reflective abstraction, because this construct is Piaget’s primary tool for characterizing the advancement of knowledge. The later sections of the book contain commentaries reflecting on the contributions of the body of theory developed in the first section. They connect genetic epistemology to current research domains such as equity and the latest in educational psychology. Finally, the book closes with short chapters portraying how scholars are using these tools in specific arenas of mathematics education research, including in special education, early childhood education, and statistics education.",Education,620,N/A,0,en
Mathematical Intuitionism and Intersubjectivity,Tomasz Placek,Springer Science & Business Media,1999-06-30,"In 1907 Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer defended his doctoral dissertation on the foundations of mathematics and with this event the modem version of mathematical intuitionism came into being. Brouwer attacked the main currents of the philosophy of mathematics: the formalists and the Platonists. In tum, both these schools began viewing intuitionism as the most harmful party among all known philosophies of mathematics. That was the origin of the now-90-year-old debate over intuitionism. As both sides have appealed in their arguments to philosophical propositions, the discussions have attracted the attention of philosophers as well. One might ask here what role a philosopher can play in controversies over mathematical intuitionism. Can he reasonably enter into disputes among mathematicians? I believe that these disputes call for intervention by a philo sopher. The three best-known arguments for intuitionism, those of Brouwer, Heyting and Dummett, are based on ontological and epistemological claims, or appeal to theses that properly belong to a theory of meaning. Those lines of argument should be investigated in order to find what their assumptions are, whether intuitionistic consequences really follow from those assumptions, and finally, whether the premises are sound and not absurd. The intention of this book is thus to consider seriously the arguments of mathematicians, even if philosophy was not their main field of interest. There is little sense in disputing whether what mathematicians said about the objectivity and reality of mathematical facts belongs to philosophy, or not.",Science,248,N/A,0,en

Patterns in Mathematics Classroom Interaction,Jenni Ingram,Oxford University Press,2021-03-01,"Classroom interaction has a significant influence on teaching and learning. It is through interaction that we solve problems, build ideas, make connections and develop our understanding. Patterns in Mathematics Classroom Interaction describes, exemplifies and considers the implications of patterns and structures of mathematics classroom interaction. Drawing on a Conversation Analytic approach, the book examines how the structures of interactions between teachers and students influence, enable, and constrain the mathematics that students are experiencing and learning in school. In particular, it considers the handling of difficulties or errors and the consequences on both the mathematics students are learning, and the learning of this mathematics. The various roles of silence and the treatment of knowledge and understanding within everyday classroom interactions also reveal the nature of mathematics as it is taught in different classrooms. Examples of students explaining, reasoning and justifying as they interact are also drawn upon to examine how the structures of classroom interaction support students to develop these discursive practices. The approach taken in Patterns in Mathematics Classroom Interaction enables the identification of not only what structures exist and pervade classroom discourse, but also how these structures influence teaching and learning. It is the understanding of how these structures affect students' experiences in the classroom that permits the use and development of practices that can support students' learning. This reflexive relationship between these structures of interactions and student actions and learning is central to the issues explored in this book, alongside the implications these may have for teachers' practice, and students' learning.",Mathematics,209,N/A,0,en

Teachers' Participation in Professional Development,Claudia Krille,Springer Nature,2020-01-14,"This book presents a systematic literature review focusing on studies examining teachers’ participation in professional development (PD) within Germany, Austria, and Switzerland since 1990. It has identified 81 relevant studies and summarizes the results while answering the following research questions: What are teachers’ self-reported reasons participate in formal PD? What barriers do teachers report that prevent them to participate in formal PD? What individual and context characteristics are associated with teachers’ PD behavior? Teachers’ PD is considered to be an important part of the teaching profession. It is seen as a tool for constant further development for teachers to adapt to changing standards in schools and classrooms, requirements for students, and personal challenges associated with the daily work in school. However, it is repeatedly claimed that there is no sufficient research with regard to teachers’ participation in formal PD, as well as of aspects that may influence their PD behavior. In spite of a large number of studies that contribute to this question within Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, only a few of them are cited regularly. Since much of this research is published in German, the results are not accessible for international researchers and comparisons between different countries.

Epistemological Beliefs and Critical Thinking in Mathematics,Benjamin Rott,Springer Nature,2021-08-30,"Epistemological beliefs—i.e. beliefs on the nature of knowledge, its limits, sources, and justification—play an important role both in everyday life and in learning processes. This book comprises several studies dealing with such beliefs in the domain of mathematics; amongst others a qualitative interview study, and quantitative studies for which a new questionnaire has been developed. In this new instrument, belief position (e.g. “mathematical knowledge is certain” vs. “uncertain”) and belief argumentation (the way those positions are justified) are differentiated. Additionally, a test for mathematical critical thinking has been designed.The results show significant correlations between sophisticated belief argumentations and high scores in the critical thinking test, but no correlations regarding belief positions.",Mathematics,175,N/A,0,en

"Self-Concept, Motivation and Identity","Frédéric Guay, Herbert Marsh, Dennis M. McInerney, Rhonda G. Craven",IAP,2015-06-01,"The concept of the Self has a long history that dates back from the ancient Greeks such as Aristotle to more contemporary thinkers such as Wundt, James, Mead, Cooley, Freud, Rogers, and Erikson (Tesser & Felson, 2000). Research on the Self relates to a range of phenomena including self-esteem, self-concept, self-protection, self-verification, self-awareness, identity, self-efficacy, self-determination etc. that could be sharply different or very similar. Despite this long tradition of thinkers and the numerous studies conducted on the Self, this concept is still not very well defined. More precisely, it is not a precise object of study, but rather a collection of loosely related subtopics (Baumesiter, 1998). Also, in the philosophical literature, the legitimacy of the concept of “self” has been brought into question. Some authors have argued that the self is not a psychological entity per se, but rather an illusion created by the complex interplay between cognitive and neurological subsystems (Zahavi, 2005). Although no definitive consensus has been reached regarding the Self, we emphasis in this volume that the Self and its related phenomena including self-concept, motivation, and identity are crucial for understanding consciousness and therefore important to understand human behavior. Self-concept, motivation and identity: Underpinning success with research and practice provides thus a unique insight into self-concept and its relationship to motivation and identity from varied theoretical and empirical perspectives. This volume is intended to develop both theoretical and methodological ideas and to present empirical evidence demonstrating the importance of theory and research to effective practice.",Education,357,N/A,0,en

The aim of the conference was to encourage fruitful and active collaboration between researchers working in the diverse areas of system theory. It was also the hope of the organizers that mathematicians participating in the conference might become interested in the purely mathematical problems being raised by systems theory as a result of their participation. The success of the conference is to be measured by the extent to which these aims were fulfilled. Besides the formal programme of lectures recorded in this volume, many informal seminars were held.

Handbook of International Research in Mathematics Education,Lyn D. English,Routledge,2002-03,"This state-of-the-art Handbook brings together important mathematics education research that makes a difference in both theory and practice--research that: anticipates problems and needed knowledge before they become impediments to progress; interprets future-oriented problems into researchable issues; presents the implications of research and theory development in forms that are useful to practitioners and policymakers; and facilitates the development of research communities to focus on neglected priorities or strategic opportunities. The volume represents a genuine attempt by contributors from around the world to advance the discipline, rather than simply review what has been done and what exists. The Handbook was developed in response to a number of major global catalysts for change, including the impact of national and international mathematics comparative assessment studies; the social, cultural, economic, and political influences on mathematics education and research; the influence of progressively sophisticated and available technology; and the increasing globalization of mathematics education and research. From these catalysts have emerged specific priority themes and issues for mathematics education research in the 21st century. Three key themes were identified for attention in this volume: life-long democratic access to powerful mathematical ideas; advances in research methodologies; and influences of advanced technologies. Each of these themes is examined in terms of learners, teachers, and learning contexts, with theory development as an important component of all these aspects. Dynamic and forward looking, the Handbook of International Research in Mathematics Education is distinguished by its focus on new and emerging theoretical models, perspectives, and research methodologies; its uniformly high standard of scholarship; and its emphasis on the international nature of mathematics education research. It is an essential volume for all researchers, professionals, and students interested in mathematics education research in particular and, more generally, in international developments and future directions in the broad field of educational research.",Education,848,N/A,0,en

Hypoelliptic Estimates and Spectral Theory for Fokker-Planck Operators and Witten Laplacians,"Francis Nier, Bernard Helffer",Springer,2005-01-17,"There has recently been a renewal of interest in Fokker-Planck operators, motivated by problems in statistical physics, in kinetic equations, and differential geometry. Compared to more standard problems in the spectral theory of partial differential operators, those operators are not self-adjoint and only hypoelliptic. The aim of the analysis is to give, as generally as possible, an accurate qualitative and quantitative description of the exponential return to the thermodynamical equilibrium. While exploring and improving recent results in this direction, this volume proposes a review of known techniques on: the hypoellipticity of polynomial of vector fields and its global counterpart, the global Weyl-Hörmander pseudo-differential calculus, the spectral theory of non-self-adjoint operators, the semi-classical analysis of Schrödinger-type operators, the Witten complexes, and the Morse inequalities.",Mathematics,215,N/A,0,en

Competence Oriented Teacher Training,,BRILL,2006-01-01,"Internationally leading experts from four continents provide new views and pathways to teacher education and training. How can teachers be effectively and efficiently trained to master the complexity and the process conditions of teaching-learning situations? The chapters as a whole demonstrate that subtle knowledge of the conditions and variables of instructional processes is necessary. They provide new insight into the classroom. But the chapters also stress the necessity of reflection: Teachers have to learn how to judge and justify that knowledge and its use. Reflective behaviour, thus, is seem as the overall goal of teacher education and training The authors are aware that this goal might be classified as “idealistic” and present, therefore, complex examples for successful conducting instructional processes. They open the view on hidden or neglected dimensions of teaching and learning, discuss standards for teacher behaviour, present critical situations together with possible solutions and give hints for the use of technology. Together, these chapters present new perspectives for successful teacher actions and the corresponding preparation for successful instruction.",Education,314,N/A,0,en

Proof and Proving in Mathematics Education,"Gila Hanna, Michael de Villiers",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-06-14,"*THIS BOOK IS AVAILABLE AS OPEN ACCESS BOOK ON SPRINGERLINK* One of the most significant tasks facing mathematics educators is to understand the role of mathematical reasoning and proving in mathematics teaching, so that its presence in instruction can be enhanced. This challenge has been given even greater importance by the assignment to proof of a more prominent place in the mathematics curriculum at all levels. Along with this renewed emphasis, there has been an upsurge in research on the teaching and learning of proof at all grade levels, leading to a re-examination of the role of proof in the curriculum and of its relation to other forms of explanation, illustration and justification. This book, resulting from the 19th ICMI Study, brings together a variety of viewpoints on issues such as: The potential role of reasoning and proof in deepening mathematical understanding in the classroom as it does in mathematical practice. The developmental nature of mathematical reasoning and proof in teaching and learning from the earliest grades. The development of suitable curriculum materials and teacher education programs to support the teaching of proof and proving.

Research and Development in University Mathematics Education,"Viviane Durand-Guerrier, Reinhard Hochmuth, Elena Nardi, Carl Winsløw",Routledge,2021-04-16,"In the last thirty years or so, the need to address the challenges of teaching and learning mathematics at university level has become increasingly appreciated by university mathematics teachers, and beyond, by educational institutions around the world. Indeed, mathematics is both a condition and an obstacle to success for students in many educational programmes vital to the 21st century knowledge society, for example in pure and applied mathematics, engineering, natural sciences, technology, economics, finance, management and so on. This breadth of impact of mathematics implies the urgency of developing research in university mathematics education, and of sharing results of this research widely. This book provides a bespoke opportunity for an international audience of researchers in didactics of mathematics, mathematicians and any teacher or researcher with an interest in this area to be informed about state-of-the-art developments and to heed future research agendas. This book emerged from the activities of the research project INDRUM (acronym for International Network for Didactic Research in University Mathematics), which aims to contribute to the development of research in didactics of mathematics at all levels of tertiary education, with a particular concern for the development of early-career researchers in the field and for dialogue with university mathematicians. The aim of the book is to provide a deep synthesis of the research field as it appears through two INDRUM conferences organised in 2016 and 2018. It is an original contribution which highlights key research perspectives, addresses seminal theoretical and methodological issues and reports substantial results concerning the teaching and learning of mathematics at university level, including the teaching and learning of specific topics in advanced mathematics across a wide range of university programmes.",Education,249,N/A,0,en

Forcing with Random Variables and Proof Complexity,Jan Krajíček,Cambridge University Press,2010-12-23,"This book introduces a new approach to building models of bounded arithmetic, with techniques drawn from recent results in computational complexity. Propositional proof systems and bounded arithmetics are closely related. In particular, proving lower bounds on the lengths of proofs in propositional proof systems is equivalent to constructing certain extensions of models of bounded arithmetic. This offers a clean and coherent framework for thinking about lower bounds for proof lengths, and it has proved quite successful in the past. This book outlines a brand new method for constructing models of bounded arithmetic, thus for proving independence results and establishing lower bounds for proof lengths. The models are built from random variables defined on a sample space which is a non-standard finite set and sampled by functions of some restricted computational complexity. It will appeal to anyone interested in logical approaches to fundamental problems in complexity theory.",Mathematics,265,N/A,0,en

Reversibility in Dynamics and Group Theory,"Anthony G. O'Farrell, Ian Short",Cambridge University Press,2015-05-28,"Reversibility is a thread woven through many branches of mathematics. It arises in dynamics, in systems that admit a time-reversal symmetry, and in group theory where the reversible group elements are those that are conjugate to their inverses. However, the lack of a lingua franca for discussing reversibility means that researchers who encounter the concept may be unaware of related work in other fields. This text is the first to make reversibility the focus of attention. The authors fix standard notation and terminology, establish the basic common principles, and illustrate the impact of reversibility in such diverse areas as group theory, differential and analytic geometry, number theory, complex analysis and approximation theory. As well as showing connections between different fields, the authors' viewpoint reveals many open questions, making this book ideal for graduate students and researchers. The exposition is accessible to readers at the advanced undergraduate level and above.",Mathematics,295,N/A,0,en

"Creativity, Giftedness, and Talent Development in Mathematics",Bharath Sriraman,IAP,2008-09-01,"Our innovative spirit and creativity lies beneath the comforts and security of today's technologically evolved society. Scientists, inventors, investors, artists and leaders play a vital role in the advancement and transmission of knowledge. Mathematics, in particular, plays a central role in numerous professions and has historically served as the gatekeeper to numerous other areas of study, particularly the hard sciences, engineering and business. Mathematics is also a major component in standardized tests in the U.S., and in university entrance exams in numerous parts of world. Creativity and imagination is often evident when young children begin to develop numeric and spatial concepts, and explore mathematical tasks that capture their interest. Creativity is also an essential ingredient in the work of professional mathematicians. Yet, the bulk of mathematical thinking encouraged in the institutionalized setting of schools is focused on rote learning, memorization, and the mastery of numerous skills to solve specific problems prescribed by the curricula or aimed at standardized testing. Given the lack of research based perspectives on talent development in mathematics education, this monograph is specifically focused on contributions towards the constructs of creativity and giftedness in mathematics. This monograph presents new perspectives for talent development in the mathematics classroom and gives insights into the psychology of creativity and giftedness. The book is aimed at classroom teachers, coordinators of gifted programs, math contest coaches, graduate students and researchers interested in creativity, giftedness, and talent development in mathematics.",Education,312,N/A,0,en

A History in Sum,"Steve Nadis, Shing-Tung Yau",Harvard University Press,2013-11-01,"In the twentieth century, American mathematicians began to make critical advances in a field previously dominated by Europeans. Harvard’s mathematics department was at the center of these developments. A History in Sum is an inviting account of the pioneers who trailblazed a distinctly American tradition of mathematics—in algebraic geometry and topology, complex analysis, number theory, and a host of esoteric subdisciplines that have rarely been written about outside of journal articles or advanced textbooks. The heady mathematical concepts that emerged, and the men and women who shaped them, are described here in lively, accessible prose. The story begins in 1825, when a precocious sixteen-year-old freshman, Benjamin Peirce, arrived at the College. He would become the first American to produce original mathematics—an ambition frowned upon in an era when professors largely limited themselves to teaching. Peirce’s successors—William Fogg Osgood and Maxime Bôcher—undertook the task of transforming the math department into a world-class research center, attracting to the faculty such luminaries as George David Birkhoff. Birkhoff produced a dazzling body of work, while training a generation of innovators—students like Marston Morse and Hassler Whitney, who forged novel pathways in topology and other areas. Influential figures from around the world soon flocked to Harvard, some overcoming great challenges to pursue their elected calling. A History in Sum elucidates the contributions of these extraordinary minds and makes clear why the history of the Harvard mathematics department is an essential part of the history of mathematics in America and beyond.",Mathematics,272,N/A,0,en

A Transition to Abstract Mathematics,Randall Maddox,Academic Press,2008-10-13,"Constructing concise and correct proofs is one of the most challenging aspects of learning to work with advanced mathematics. Meeting this challenge is a defining moment for those considering a career in mathematics or related fields. A Transition to Abstract Mathematics teaches readers to construct proofs and communicate with the precision necessary for working with abstraction. It is based on two premises: composing clear and accurate mathematical arguments is critical in abstract mathematics, and that this skill requires development and support. Abstraction is the destination, not the starting point.Maddox methodically builds toward a thorough understanding of the proof process, demonstrating and encouraging mathematical thinking along the way. Skillful use of analogy clarifies abstract ideas. Clearly presented methods of mathematical precision provide an understanding of the nature of mathematics and its defining structure. After mastering the art of the proof process, the reader may pursue two independent paths. The latter parts are purposefully designed to rest on the foundation of the first, and climb quickly into analysis or algebra. Maddox addresses fundamental principles in these two areas, so that readers can apply their mathematical thinking and writing skills to these new concepts. From this exposure, readers experience the beauty of the mathematical landscape and further develop their ability to work with abstract ideas. - Covers the full range of techniques used in proofs, including contrapositive, induction, and proof by contradiction - Explains identification of techniques and how they are applied in the specific problem - Illustrates how to read written proofs with many step by step examples - Includes 20% more exercises than the first edition that are integrated into the material instead of end of chapter",Mathematics,379,N/A,0,en

The Forgotten Revolution,"Lucio Russo, Silvio (translator) Levy",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-12-01,"The period from the late fourth to the late second century B. C. witnessed, in Greek-speaking countries, an explosion of objective knowledge about the external world. WhileGreek culture had reached great heights in art, literature and philosophyalreadyin the earlier classical era, it is in the so-called Hellenistic period that we see for the ?rst time — anywhere in the world — the appearance of science as we understand it now: not an accumulation of facts or philosophically based speculations, but an or- nized effort to model nature and apply such models, or scienti?ctheories in a sense we will make precise, to the solution of practical problems and to a growing understanding of nature. We owe this new approach to scientists such as Archimedes, Euclid, Eratosthenes and many others less familiar todaybut no less remarkable. Yet, not long after this golden period, much of this extraordinary dev- opment had been reversed. Rome borrowed what it was capable of from the Greeks and kept it for a little while yet, but created very little science of its own. Europe was soon smothered in theobscurantism and stasis that blocked most avenues of intellectual development for a thousand years — until, as is well known, the rediscovery of ancient culture in its fullness paved the way to the modern age.",Science,490,2.5,2,en

Gwynne's Latin,Nevile Gwynne,Random House,2014-04-10,"‘Latin is ""it"", the most wonderful ""thing"". It is mind-enhancing, character-improving, enthralling, exciting, deeply satisfying, and valuable. My solid determination is to spare no pains to do it the justice that its importance demands.’ Mr Gwynne, author of the Sunday Times bestselling phenomenon Gwynne’s Grammar, is just as emphatic about the importance of Latin as he is about the importance of grammar. From the novice to the more well-versed, Gwynne’s Latin is essential for anyone interested in learning Latin; Mr Gwynne promises to teach you more Latin in half an hour than you would learn from years of being taught Latin at school. He also includes a fascinating section on everyday Latin usage, which discusses all the Latin words and idioms we still use today, such as ‘quid pro quo’ and ‘sui generis’. Though we need no further convincing – as we know, Mr Gwynne is never wrong – here are just some of the many reasons why Latin is utterly wonderful: - Latin is an academic subject easy enough for the least intelligent of us to grasp all the basic elements of, and yet difficult enough to be demanding for its greatest scholars. - For well over a thousand years it was the means of communication that united the whole of Europe culturally and in every other significant way. - It is the direct ancestor of, between them, the five most widely-spoken European languages, and both of the official South American languages. - It is the ancestor and source of more than half of the English language, partly directly and partly through French, which for some centuries was England’s official language. Following in the same beautifully designed footsteps of Gwynne’s Grammar, Gwynne’s Latin will teach you all the fundamentals of Latin quickly, thoroughly and better than all the competition.",Language Arts & Disciplines,218,N/A,0,en

The specific topics covered are the Vershik-Kerov–Logan-Shepp limit shape theorem, the Baik–Deift–Johansson theorem, the Tracy–Widom distribution, and the corner growth process. This exciting body of work, encompassing important advances in probability and combinatorics over the last forty years, is made accessible to a general graduate-level audience for the first time in a highly polished presentation.",Mathematics,366,N/A,0,en
Refractions of Mathematics Education,"Christer Bergsten, Bharath Sriraman",IAP,2015-05-01,"The diversity of research in mathematics education has been addressed as both, a problem and a strength. When manifested through adherence to different intellectual roots and theoretical orientations, diversions constitute ‘refractions’ of mathematics education. The collection and analysis of empirical data in a study are by necessity refracted through the specific analytical lens employed, as well as the aim of the study itself. Refractions can also refer to looking at old phenomena through new lenses. The chapters in this book are refracted through philosophical, political, mathematical and personal lenses by distinguished authors in the field, addressing issues about the elusive experience of doing mathematics, purification of texts, refractions, mathematics and ethnomathematics, political messages in textbook tasks, mathematics education policy debate, the political in mathematics education research, philosophy and mathematics, meanings and representations, identity of mathematical modeling, and dilemmas in the teaching of calculus. An ancient Sanskrit adage states that Knowledge is something that grows when shared, but shrinks when hoarded. Academics engaged in the generation of new Knowledge are blessed with both the time and the freedom to engage in pursuits that allow for intellectual pleasure. As a phenomenon of the Zeitgeist many have succumbed to the increased corporatization of academic work, engaging in activities for monetary and self advancement purposes. Are there any real intellectuals left in academia, a là Adorno, Bourdieu, Chomsky, Foucault, among others? This Festschrift is dedicated to academics that don't bother with self promotion or aggrandizement of themselves or their ideas in simplistic terms.",Education,238,N/A,0,en
"Mathematics Of Open Quantum Systems, The: Dissipative And Non-unitary Representations And Quantum Measurements","Konstantin A Makarov, Eduard R Tsekanovskii",World Scientific,2021-12-24,"This book presents new developments in the open quantum systems theory with emphasis on applications to the (frequent) measurement theory.In the first part of the book, the uniqueness theorems for the solutions to the restricted Weyl commutation relations braiding unitary groups and semi-groups of contractions are discussed. The major theme involves an intrinsic characterization of the simplest symmetric operator solutions to the Heisenberg uncertainty relations, the problem posed by Jørgensen and Muhly, followed by the proof of the uniqueness theorems for the simplest solutions to the restricted Weyl commutation relations. The detailed study of unitary invariants of the corresponding dissipative and symmetric operators opens up a look at the classical Stone-von Neumann uniqueness theorem from a new angle and provides an extended version of the uniqueness result relating various realizations of a differentiation operator on the corresponding metric graphs.The second part of the book is devoted to mathematical problems of the quantum measurements under continuous monitoring. Among the topics discussed are the complementarity of the Quantum Zeno effect and Exponential Decay scenario in frequent quantum measurements, and a rigorous treatment, within continuous monitoring paradigm, of the celebrated 'double-slit experiment' where the renowned exclusive and interference measurement alternatives approach in quantum theory is presented in a way that is accessible for mathematicians. One of the striking applications of the generalized (1-stable) central limit theorem is the mathematical evidence of exponential decay of unstable states of the quantum pendulum under continuous monitoring.",Science,300,N/A,0,en
Series and Products in the Development of Mathematics,Ranjan Roy,Cambridge University Press,2021,"""Sources in the Development of Mathematics: Series and Products from the Fifteenth to the Twenty-first Century, my book of 2011, was intended for an audience of graduate students or beyond. However, since much of its mathematics lies at the foundations of the undergraduate mathematics curriculum, I decided to use portions of my book as the text for an advanced undergraduate course. I was very pleased to find that my curious and diligent students, of varied levels of mathematical talent, could understand a good bit of the material and get insight into mathematics they had already studied as well as topics with which they were unfamiliar. Of course, the students could profitably study such topics from good textbooks. But I observed that when they read original proofs, perhaps with gaps or with slightly opaque arguments, students gained very valuable insight into the process of mathematical thinking and intuition. Moreover, the study of the steps, often over long periods of time, by which earlier mathematicians refined and clarified their arguments revealed to my students the essential points at the crux of those results, points that may be more difficult to discern in later streamlined presentations. As they worked to understand the material, my students witnessed the difficulty and beauty of original mathematical work and this was a source of great enjoyment to many of them. I have now thrice taught this course, with extremely positive student response""--",Mathematics,479,N/A,0,en

The Universe in Zero Words,Dana Mackenzie,Princeton University Press,2013-08-25,"Most popular books about science, and even about mathematics, tiptoe around equations as if they were something to be hidden from the reader's tender eyes. Dana Mackenzie starts from the opposite premise: He celebrates equations. No history of art would be complete without pictures. Why, then, should a history of mathematics--the universal language of science--keep the masterpieces of the subject hidden behind a veil? The Universe in Zero Words tells the history of twenty-four great and beautiful equations that have shaped mathematics, science, and society--from the elementary (1+1=2) to the sophisticated (the Black-Scholes formula for financial derivatives), and from the famous (E=mc2) to the arcane (Hamilton's quaternion equations). Mackenzie, who has been called ""a popular-science ace"" by Booklist magazine, lucidly explains what each equation means, who discovered it (and how), and how it has affected our lives. Illustrated in color throughout, the book tells the human and often-surprising stories behind the invention or discovery of the equations, from how a bad cigar changed the course of quantum mechanics to why whales (if they could communicate with us) would teach us a totally different concept of geometry. At the same time, the book shows why these equations have something timeless to say about the universe, and how they do it with an economy (zero words) that no other form of human expression can match. The Universe in Zero Words is the ultimate introduction and guide to equations that have changed the world.",Mathematics,224,N/A,0,en

In addition to these natural processes, human activity has increased to the point where it influences the global climate, impacts the ability of the planet to feed itself and threatens the stability of these systems. Issues such as climate change, sustainability, man-made disasters, control of diseases and epidemics, management of resources, risk analysis and global integration have come to the fore. Written by specialists in several fields of mathematics and applied sciences, this book presents the proceedings of the International Conference and Advanced School Planet Earth, Mathematics of Energy and Climate Change held in Lisbon, Portugal, in March 2013, which was organized by the International Center of Mathematics (CIM) as a partner institution of the international program Mathematics of Planet Earth 2013. The book presents the state of the art in advanced research and ultimate techniques in modeling natural, economical and social phenomena. It constitutes a tool and a framework for researchers and graduate students, both in mathematics and applied sciences.",Mathematics,440,N/A,0,en

Mathematics of Ramsey Theory,"Jaroslav Nesetril, Vojtech Rödl",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"One of the important areas of contemporary combinatorics is Ramsey theory. Ramsey theory is basically the study of structure preserved under partitions. The general philosophy is reflected by its interdisciplinary character. The ideas of Ramsey theory are shared by logicians, set theorists and combinatorists, and have been successfully applied in other branches of mathematics. The whole subject is quickly developing and has some new and unexpected applications in areas as remote as functional analysis and theoretical computer science. This book is a homogeneous collection of research and survey articles by leading specialists. It surveys recent activity in this diverse subject and brings the reader up to the boundary of present knowledge. It covers virtually all main approaches to the subject and suggests various problems for individual research.",Mathematics,279,N/A,0,en

Introduction to the Mathematics of Computer Graphics,Nathan Carter,American Mathematical Soc.,2016-12-31,"This text, by an award-winning [Author];, was designed to accompany his first-year seminar in the mathematics of computer graphics. Readers learn the mathematics behind the computational aspects of space, shape, transformation, color, rendering, animation, and modeling. The software required is freely available on the Internet for Mac, Windows, and Linux. The text answers questions such as these: How do artists build up realistic shapes from geometric primitives? What computations is my computer doing when it generates a realistic image of my 3D scene? What mathematical tools can I use to animate an object through space? Why do movies always look more realistic than video games? Containing the mathematics and computing needed for making their own 3D computer-generated images and animations, the text, and the course it supports, culminates in a project in which students create a short animated movie using free software. Algebra and trigonometry are prerequisites; calculus is not, though it helps. Programming is not required. Includes optional advanced exercises for students with strong backgrounds in math or computer science. Instructors interested in exposing their liberal arts students to the beautiful mathematics behind computer graphics will find a rich resource in this text.",Mathematics,483,N/A,0,en
Topological Aspects of Nonsmooth Optimization,Vladimir Shikhman,Springer Science & Business Media,2011-11-18,"This book deals with nonsmooth structures arising within the optimization setting. It considers four optimization problems, namely, mathematical programs with complementarity constraints, general semi-infinite programming problems, mathematical programs with vanishing constraints and bilevel optimization. The author uses the topological approach and topological invariants of corresponding feasible sets are investigated. Moreover, the critical point theory in the sense of Morse is presented and parametric and stability issues are considered. The material progresses systematically and establishes a comprehensive theory for a rather broad class of optimization problems tailored to their particular type of nonsmoothness. Topological Aspects of Nonsmooth Optimization will benefit researchers and graduate students in applied mathematics, especially those working in optimization theory, nonsmooth analysis, algebraic topology and singularity theory. ​ ​",Mathematics,200,N/A,0,en

The Mathematics of Coordinated Inference,"Christopher S. Hardin, Alan D. Taylor",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-10-17,"Two prisoners are told that they will be brought to a room and seated so that each can see the other. Hats will be placed on their heads; each hat is either red or green. The two prisoners must simultaneously submit a guess of their own hat color, and they both go free if at least one of them guesses correctly. While no communication is allowed once the hats have been placed, they will, however, be allowed to have a strategy session before being brought to the room. Is there a strategy ensuring their release? The answer turns out to be yes, and this is the simplest non-trivial example of a “hat problem.” This book deals with the question of how successfully one can predict the value of an arbitrary function at one or more points of its domain based on some knowledge of its values at other points. Topics range from hat problems that are accessible to everyone willing to think hard, to some advanced topics in set theory and infinitary combinatorics. For example, there is a method of predicting the value f(a) of a function f mapping the reals to the reals, based only on knowledge of f's values on the open interval (a – 1, a), and for every such function the prediction is incorrect only on a countable set that is nowhere dense. The monograph progresses from topics requiring fewer prerequisites to those requiring more, with most of the text being accessible to any graduate student in mathematics. The broad range of readership includes researchers, postdocs, and graduate students in the fields of set theory, mathematical logic, and combinatorics. The hope is that this book will bring together mathematicians from different areas to think about set theory via a very broad array of coordinated inference problems.",Mathematics,114,N/A,0,en

The Mathematics of Shuffling Cards,"Persi Diaconis, Jason Fulman",American Mathematical Society,2023-03-20,"This book gives a lively development of the mathematics needed to answer the question, “How many times should a deck of cards be shuffled to mix it up?” The shuffles studied are the usual ones that real people use: riffle, overhand, and smooshing cards around on the table. The mathematics ranges from probability (Markov chains) to combinatorics (symmetric function theory) to algebra (Hopf algebras). There are applications to magic tricks and gambling along with a careful comparison of the mathematics to the results of real people shuffling real cards. The book explores links between shuffling and higher mathematics—Lie theory, algebraic topology, the geometry of hyperplane arrangements, stochastic calculus, number theory, and more. It offers a useful springboard for seeing how probability theory is applied and leads to many corners of advanced mathematics. The book can serve as a text for an upper division course in mathematics, statistics, or computer science departments and will be appreciated by graduate students and researchers in mathematics, statistics, and computer science, as well as magicians and people with a strong background in mathematics who are interested in games that use playing cards.",Mathematics,360,N/A,0,en

Namely, the creation and study of ""formal systems for constructive mathematics"". The general organization of the book is described in the"" User's Manual"" which follows this introduction, and the contents of the book are described in more detail in the introductions to Part One, Part Two, Part Three, and Part Four. This introduction has a different purpose; it is intended to provide the reader with a general view of the subject. This requires, to begin with, an elucidation of both the concepts mentioned in the phrase, ""formal systems for constructive mathematics"". ""Con structive mathematics"" refers to mathematics in which, when you prove that l a thing exists (having certain desired properties) you show how to find it. Proof by contradiction is the most common way of proving something exists without showing how to find it - one assumes that nothing exists with the desired properties, and derives a contradiction. It was only in the last two decades of the nineteenth century that mathematicians began to exploit this method of proof in ways that nobody had previously done; that was partly made possible by the creation and development of set theory by Georg Cantor and Richard Dedekind.",Mathematics,484,N/A,0,en

On the Use of the Harmonic Linearization Method in the Automatic Control Theory,Egor Paul Popov,N/A,1957,"This paper considers the use of harmonic linearization as applied to the analysis of nonlinear automatic control systems. This approach, which has been proven in practical engineering applications, involves the replacement of a nonlinear equation by a linear equation. In establishing the method a small parameter is considered which makes it possible to speak with some degree of approximation of the solution of the new equation to that of the given linear equation. Thus, the mathematics of nonlinear mechanics is brought to bear on the problem by explaining and extending the usefulness of automatic control theory and nonlinear systems.",Automatic control,14,N/A,0,en

Elements of Mathematics,John Stillwell,Princeton University Press,2017-11-07,"An exciting look at the world of elementary mathematics Elements of Mathematics takes readers on a fascinating tour that begins in elementary mathematics—but, as John Stillwell shows, this subject is not as elementary or straightforward as one might think. Not all topics that are part of today's elementary mathematics were always considered as such, and great mathematical advances and discoveries had to occur in order for certain subjects to become ""elementary."" Stillwell examines elementary mathematics from a distinctive twenty-first-century viewpoint and describes not only the beauty and scope of the discipline, but also its limits. From Gaussian integers to propositional logic, Stillwell delves into arithmetic, computation, algebra, geometry, calculus, combinatorics, probability, and logic. He discusses how each area ties into more advanced topics to build mathematics as a whole. Through a rich collection of basic principles, vivid examples, and interesting problems, Stillwell demonstrates that elementary mathematics becomes advanced with the intervention of infinity. Infinity has been observed throughout mathematical history, but the recent development of ""reverse mathematics"" confirms that infinity is essential for proving well-known theorems, and helps to determine the nature, contours, and borders of elementary mathematics. Elements of Mathematics gives readers, from high school students to professional mathematicians, the highlights of elementary mathematics and glimpses of the parts of math beyond its boundaries.",Mathematics,440,N/A,0,en

Mind and Matter,"John Urschel, Louisa Thomas",Penguin,2020-05-12,"A New York Times bestseller John Urschel, mathematician and former offensive lineman for the Baltimore Ravens, tells the story of a life balanced between two passions For John Urschel, what began as an insatiable appetite for puzzles as a child developed into mastery of the elegant systems and rules of mathematics. By the time he was thirteen, Urschel was auditing a college-level calculus course. But when he joined his high school football team, a new interest began to eclipse the thrill he felt in the classroom. Football challenged Urschel in an entirely different way, and he became addicted to the physical contact of the sport. After he accepted a scholarship to play at Penn State, his love of math was rekindled. As a Nittany Lion, he refused to sacrifice one passion for the other. Against the odds, Urschel found a way to manage his double life as a scholar and an athlete. While he was an offensive lineman for the Baltimore Ravens, he simultaneously pursued his PhD in mathematics at MIT. Weaving together two separate narratives, Urschel relives for us the most pivotal moments of his bifurcated life. He explains why, after Penn State was sanctioned for the acts of former coach Jerry Sandusky, he declined offers from prestigious universities and refused to abandon his team. He describes his parents’ different influences and their profound effect on him, and he opens up about the correlation between football and CTE and the risks he took for the game he loves. Equally at home discussing Georg Cantor’s work on infinities and Bill Belichick’s playbook, Urschel reveals how each challenge—whether on the field or in the classroom—has brought him closer to understanding the two different halves of his own life, and how reason and emotion, the mind and the body, are always working together. “So often, people want to divide the world into two,” he observes. “Matter and energy. Wave and particle. Athlete and mathematician. Why can’t something (or someone) be both?”",Biography & Autobiography,258,N/A,0,en

Introduction to Singular Perturbations,Robert E. Jr. O'Malley,Elsevier,2012-12-02,"Introduction to Singular Perturbations provides an overview of the fundamental techniques for obtaining asymptomatic solutions to boundary value problems. This text explores singular perturbation techniques, which are among the basic tools of several applied scientists. This book is organized into eight chapters, wherein Chapter 1 discusses the method of matched asymptomatic expansions, which has been frequently applied to several physical problems involving singular perturbations. Chapter 2 considers the nonlinear initial value problem to illustrate the regular perturbation method, and Chapter 3 explains how to construct asymptotic solutions for general linear equations. Chapter 4 discusses scalar equations and nonlinear system, whereas Chapters 5 and 6 explain the contrasts for initial value problems where the outer expansion cannot be determined without obtaining the initial values of the boundary layer correction. Chapters 7 and 8 deal with boundary value problem that arises in the study of adiabatic tubular chemical flow reactors with axial diffusion.

Mathematics without Apologies,Michael Harris,Princeton University Press,2017-05-30,"An insightful reflection on the mathematical soul What do pure mathematicians do, and why do they do it? Looking beyond the conventional answers—for the sake of truth, beauty, and practical applications—this book offers an eclectic panorama of the lives and values and hopes and fears of mathematicians in the twenty-first century, assembling material from a startlingly diverse assortment of scholarly, journalistic, and pop culture sources. Drawing on his personal experiences and obsessions as well as the thoughts and opinions of mathematicians from Archimedes and Omar Khayyám to such contemporary giants as Alexander Grothendieck and Robert Langlands, Michael Harris reveals the charisma and romance of mathematics as well as its darker side. In this portrait of mathematics as a community united around a set of common intellectual, ethical, and existential challenges, he touches on a wide variety of questions, such as: Are mathematicians to blame for the 2008 financial crisis? How can we talk about the ideas we were born too soon to understand? And how should you react if you are asked to explain number theory at a dinner party? Disarmingly candid, relentlessly intelligent, and richly entertaining, Mathematics without Apologies takes readers on an unapologetic guided tour of the mathematical life, from the philosophy and sociology of mathematics to its reflections in film and popular music, with detours through the mathematical and mystical traditions of Russia, India, medieval Islam, the Bronx, and beyond.",Mathematics,468,N/A,0,en

Native American Mathematics,Michael P. Closs,University of Texas Press,2010-06-28,"There is no question that native cultures in the New World exhibit many forms of mathematical development. This Native American mathematics can best be described by considering the nature of the concepts found in a variety of individual New World cultures. Unlike modern mathematics in which numbers and concepts are expressed in a universal mathematical notation, the numbers and concepts found in native cultures occur and are expressed in many distinctive ways. Native American Mathematics, edited by Michael P. Closs, is the first book to focus on mathematical development indigenous to the New World. Spanning time from the prehistoric to the present, the thirteen essays in this volume attest to the variety of mathematical development present in the Americas. The data are drawn from cultures as diverse as the Ojibway, the Inuit (Eskimo), and the Nootka in the north; the Chumash of Southern California; the Aztec and the Maya in Mesoamerica; and the Inca and Jibaro of South America. Among the strengths of this collection are this diversity and the multidisciplinary approaches employed to extract different kinds of information.

Mathematics Education and the Legacy of Zoltan Paul Dienes,Bharath Sriraman,IAP,2008-03-01,"The name of Zoltan P. Dienes (1916-) stands with those of Jean Piaget and Jerome Bruner as a legendary figure whose theories of learning have left a lasting impression on the field of mathematics education. Dienes' name is synonymous with the Multi-base blocks (also known as Dienes blocks) which he invented for the teaching of place value. He also is the inventor of Algebraic materials and logic blocks, which sowed the seeds of contemporary uses of manipulative materials in mathematics instruction. Dienes' place is unique in the field of mathematics education because of his theories on how mathematical structures can be taught from the early grades onwards using multiple embodiments through manipulatives, games, stories and dance. Dienes' notion of embodied knowledge presaged other cognitive scientists who eventually came to recognize the importance of embodied knowledge and situated cognition - where knowledge and abilities are organized around experience as much as they are organized around abstractions. Dienes was an early pioneer in what was later to be called sociocultural perspectives and democratization of learning. This monograph compiled and edited by Bharath Sriraman honors the seminal contributions of Dienes to mathematics education and includes several recent unpublished articles written by Dienes himself. These articles exemplify his principles of guided discovery learning and reveal the non-trivial mathematical structures that can be made accessible to any student. The monograph also includes a rare interview with Dienes in which he reflects on his life, his work, the role of context, language and technology in mathematics teaching and learning today. The book finds an important place in any mathematics education library and is vital reading for mathematics education researchers, cognitive scientists, prospective teachers, graduate students and teachers of mathematics.",Mathematics,124,N/A,0,en

The Art of Mathematics,Jerry P. King,Springer,2013-11-11,"The beauty of mathematics eludes all but a small, select handful of people. This monumental classic will illuminate the aesthetic delights of mathematics for all to behold. Why should only a tiny aristocracy hold the key to appreciating the elegance of mathematics? Why should intelligent, cultured people, who can easily articulate the brilliance of Shakespeare's imagery, quake at the prospect of deciphering a simple algebraic formula? Jerry King, a mathematics professor and a poet, razes the barriers between a world of two cultures and hands us the tools for appreciating the art and treasures of this elegant discipline. In his fluid, poetic voice, he initiates us into the splendid wonders of the Mathworld. He provides us with an original framework for contemplating mathematics as art. He deepens our ultimate comprehension of art by comparing the beauty of a Rembrandt as well as a Jackson Pollock with the riches to be mined in an elegant proof. Like the great philosophers of the past, Dr. King searches for pure Truth--a quest possible today only in the realm of mathematics. With his infectious enthusiasm, he explains with utmost clarity the intellectually stimulating underpinnings of both pure and applied mathematics. He goes on to decry how our educational system has failed by perfunctorily teaching us mathematics, depriving us of the pillars of beauty upon which mathematics rests. Never before has a book spoken so eloquently to our soul in instilling an appreciation for the grandeur of mathematics. Through Dr. King, the muses of mathematics will no longer sing for others and not for us. The elegant world of mathematics awaits us all to savor.",Mathematics,312,N/A,0,en

Learning and Teaching Real World Problem Solving in School Mathematics,Murad Jurdak,Springer,2016-05-30,"The ultimate aim of this book is to identify the conceptual tools and the instructional modalities which enable students and teachers to cross the boundary between school mathematics and real world problem solving. The book identifies, examines, and integrates seven conceptual tools, of which five are constructs (activity theory, narrative, modeling, critical mathematics education, ethnomathematics) and two are contexts (STEM and the workplace). The author develops two closely linked multiple-perspective frameworks: one for learning real world problem solving in school mathematics, which sets the foundations of learning real world problem solving in school mathematics; and one for teaching real world problem solving in school mathematics, which explores the modalities of teaching real world problem solving in school mathematics. “The book is composed as, on the one hand, a high-level theoretical scholarly work on real world problem solving in school mathematics, and, on the other hand, a set of twelve narratives which, put together, constitute a thought-provoking and moving personal and professional autobiography.” - Mogens Niss “These narratives combine aspects of Murad’s personal trajectory as an individual with those points in his professional career at which he became aware of perspectives on and approaches to mathematics education that were both significant in and of themselves, and instrumental for the specific scholarly endeavor presented in the book.” - Mogens Niss",Education,210,N/A,0,en

Struik has been among the most steadfast supporters of the Boston Colloquium for the Philosophy of Science, that discussion group which we have been holding at Boston University since 1960, but his luminous collaboration has been welcome, in Boston and Cambridge, for nearly five decades among mathematicians, physicists, philosophical and political thinkers, and especially among the students. It has not mattered whether they have been his own students or not, whether at M.LT. or elsewhere, whether scholars or dropouts, nature-lovers or book worms, anarchists or Republicans, Catholics or Unitarians, Communists or communists, prim or liberated.

Igusa's $p$-Adic Local Zeta Function and the Monodromy Conjecture for Non-Degenerate Surface Singularities,"Bart Bories, Willem Veys",American Mathematical Soc.,2016-06-21,"In 2011 Lemahieu and Van Proeyen proved the Monodromy Conjecture for the local topological zeta function of a non-degenerate surface singularity. The authors start from their work and obtain the same result for Igusa's p-adic and the motivic zeta function. In the p-adic case, this is, for a polynomial f∈Z[x,y,z] satisfying f(0,0,0)=0 and non-degenerate with respect to its Newton polyhedron, we show that every pole of the local p-adic zeta function of f induces an eigenvalue of the local monodromy of f at some point of f−1(0)⊂C3 close to the origin. Essentially the entire paper is dedicated to proving that, for f as above, certain candidate poles of Igusa's p-adic zeta function of f, arising from so-called B1-facets of the Newton polyhedron of f, are actually not poles. This turns out to be much harder than in the topological setting. The combinatorial proof is preceded by a study of the integral points in three-dimensional fundamental parallelepipeds. Together with the work of Lemahieu and Van Proeyen, this main result leads to the Monodromy Conjecture for the p-adic and motivic zeta function of a non-degenerate surface singularity.",Mathematics,146,N/A,0,en
Science as Social Existence,Jeff Kochan,Open Book Publishers,2017-12-18,"In this bold and original study, Jeff Kochan constructively combines the sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK) with Martin Heidegger’s early existential conception of science. Kochan shows convincingly that these apparently quite different approaches to science are, in fact, largely compatible, even mutually reinforcing. By combining Heidegger with SSK, Kochan argues, we can explicate, elaborate, and empirically ground Heidegger’s philosophy of science in a way that makes it more accessible and useful for social scientists and historians of science. Likewise, incorporating Heideggerian phenomenology into SSK renders SKK a more robust and attractive methodology for use by scholars in the interdisciplinary field of Science and Technology Studies (STS). Kochan’s ground-breaking reinterpretation of Heidegger also enables STS scholars to sustain a principled analytical focus on scientific subjectivity, without running afoul of the orthodox subject-object distinction they often reject. Science as Social Existence is the first book of its kind, unfurling its argument through a range of topics relevant to contemporary STS research. These include the epistemology and metaphysics of scientific practice, as well as the methods of explanation appropriate to social scientific and historical studies of science. Science as Social Existence puts concentrated emphasis on the compatibility of Heidegger’s existential conception of science with the historical sociology of scientific knowledge, pursuing this combination at both macro- and micro-historical levels. Beautifully written and accessible, Science as Social Existence puts new and powerful tools into the hands of sociologists and historians of science, cultural theorists of science, Heidegger scholars, and pluralist philosophers of science.",Science,262,N/A,0,en

Taking the central importance of language in the development of mathematical understanding as its starting point, Mathematical Literacy explores students’ experiences of doing mathematics from primary school to university - what they think mathematics is, how it is presented to them, and what they feel about it. Building on a range of theory which focuses on community, knowledge, and identity, the author examines two particular issues: the relationship between language, learning, and mathematical knowledge, and the relationship between identity, equity, and processes of exclusion/inclusion. In this comprehensive and accessible book, the author extends our understanding of the process of gaining mathematical fluency, and provides tools for an exploration of mathematics learning across different groups in different social contexts. Mathematical Literacy’s analysis of how learners develop particular relationships with the subject, and what we might do to promote equity through the development of positive relationships, is of interest across all sectors of education—to researchers, teacher educators, and university educators.",Education,264,N/A,0,en
Before Tomorrow,Catherine Malabou,John Wiley & Sons,2016-09-13,"Is contemporary continental philosophy making a break with Kant? The structures of knowledge, taken for granted since Kants Critique of Pure Reason, are now being called into question: the finitude of the subject, the phenomenal given, a priori synthesis. Relinquish the transcendental: such is the imperative of postcritical thinking in the 21st century. Questions that we no longer thought it possible to ask now reemerge with renewed vigor: can Kant really maintain the difference between a priori and innate? Can he deduce, rather than impose, the categories, or justify the necessity of nature? Recent research into brain development aggravates these suspicions, which measure transcendental idealism against the thesis of a biological origin for cognitive processes. In her important new book Catherine Malabou lays out Kants response to his posterity. True to its subject, the book evolves as an epigenesis the differentiated growth of the embryo for, as those who know how to read critical philosophy affirm, this is the very life of the transcendental and contains the promise of its transformation.",Philosophy,240,N/A,0,en
Mathematical Thinking and Problem Solving,"Alan H. Schoenfeld, Alan H. Sloane",Routledge,2016-05-06,"In the early 1980s there was virtually no serious communication among the various groups that contribute to mathematics education -- mathematicians, mathematics educators, classroom teachers, and cognitive scientists. Members of these groups came from different traditions, had different perspectives, and rarely gathered in the same place to discuss issues of common interest. Part of the problem was that there was no common ground for the discussions -- given the disparate traditions and perspectives. As one way of addressing this problem, the Sloan Foundation funded two conferences in the mid-1980s, bringing together members of the different communities in a ground clearing effort, designed to establish a base for communication. In those conferences, interdisciplinary teams reviewed major topic areas and put together distillations of what was known about them.* A more recent conference -- upon which this volume is based -- offered a forum in which various people involved in education reform would present their work, and members of the broad communities gathered would comment on it. The focus was primarily on college mathematics, informed by developments in K-12 mathematics. The main issues of the conference were mathematical thinking and problem solving.",Education,303,N/A,0,en

What can come of a scientific engagement with postmodern philosophy? Some scientists have claimed that the social sciences and humanities have nothing to contribute, except perhaps peripherally, to their research. Dorothea E. Olkowski shows that mathematics itself—the historic link between science and philosophy—plays a fundamental role in the development of the worldviews that drive both fields. Focusing on language, its usage and expression of worldview, she develops a phenomenological account of human thought and action to explicate the role of philosophy in the sciences. Olkowski proposes a model of phenomenology, both scientific and philosophical, that helps make sense of reality and composes an ethics for dealing with unpredictability in our world.",Philosophy,211,N/A,0,en

Mathematics and Scientific Representation,Christopher Pincock,Oxford University Press,2012-01-13,"Mathematics plays a central role in much of contemporary science, but philosophers have struggled to understand what this role is or how significant it might be for mathematics and science. In this book Christopher Pincock tackles this perennial question in a new way by asking how mathematics contributes to the success of our best scientific representations. In the first part of the book this question is posed and sharpened using a proposal for how we can determine the content of a scientific representation. Several different sorts of contributions from mathematics are then articulated. Pincock argues that each contribution can be understood as broadly epistemic, so that what mathematics ultimately contributes to science is best connected with our scientific knowledge. In the second part of the book, Pincock critically evaluates alternative approaches to the role of mathematics in science. These include the potential benefits for scientific discovery and scientific explanation. A major focus of this part of the book is the indispensability argument for mathematical platonism. Using the results of part one, Pincock argues that this argument can at best support a weak form of realism about the truth-value of the statements of mathematics. The book concludes with a chapter on pure mathematics and the remaining options for making sense of its interpretation and epistemology. Thoroughly grounded in case studies drawn from scientific practice, this book aims to bring together current debates in both the philosophy of mathematics and the philosophy of science and to demonstrate the philosophical importance of applications of mathematics.",Philosophy,347,N/A,0,en

Connecting Humans to Equations,"Ole Ravn, Ole Skovsmose",Springer,2019-02-06,"Connecting Humans to Equations: A Reinterpretation of the Philosophy of Mathematics presents some of the most important positions in the philosophy of mathematics, while adding new dimensions to this philosophy. Mathematics is an integral part of human and social life, meaning that a philosophy of mathematics must include several dimensions. This book describes these dimensions by the following four questions that structure the content of the book: Where is mathematics? How certain is mathematics? How social is mathematics? How good is mathematics? These four questions refer to the ontological, epistemological, social, and ethical dimension of a philosophy of mathematics. While the ontological and epistemological dimensions have been explored in all classic studies in the philosophy of mathematics, the exploration of the book is unique in its social and ethical dimensions. It argues that the foundation of mathematics is deeply connected to human and social actions and that mathematics includes not just descriptive but also performative features. This human-centered and accessible interpretation of mathematics is relevant for students in mathematics, mathematics education, and any technical discipline and for anybody working with mathematics.",Education,197,N/A,0,en

The Golden Ticket provides a nontechnical introduction to P-NP, its rich history, and its algorithmic implications for everything we do with computers and beyond. Lance Fortnow traces the history and development of P-NP, giving examples from a variety of disciplines, including economics, physics, and biology. He explores problems that capture the full difficulty of the P-NP dilemma, from discovering the shortest route through all the rides at Disney World to finding large groups of friends on Facebook. The Golden Ticket explores what we truly can and cannot achieve computationally, describing the benefits and unexpected challenges of this compelling problem.",Computers,188,N/A,0,en

Toward a Global Science,Susantha Goonatilake,Indiana University Press,1998,"Asian science such as mathematics, Chinese printing, gunpowder and the compass, all contributed to the development of European science. During the last few centuries, however, scientific contributions with Asian roots have diminished and been marginalized and deligitimised. Yet the center of the world economy today is shifting to Asia with shifts in science and technology bound to follow. Toward a Global Science is driven by the proposition that pre-Renaissance acquisition of Asian knowledge did not exhaust Asian civilizationÕs potential contribution. There are many useful elements to modern science still lying hidden in Asian civilizational stores waiting to be Òmined.Ó The author gives details of recent contributions from South Asian medicine, mathematics, and psychology and explores how South Asian inputs can be useful in navigating the philosophical and ethical problems raised by two dominant technologies of the future, namely biotechnology and information technology. As an illustrative example, it describes how a fruitful marriage of one technologyÑvirtual realityÑwith South Asian philosophy can enliven both the technology as well as philosophy. It also examines how Asian positions could be used to feed some key contemporary philosophical discussions on science. Using a model of the civilizational construction of science, the book views science without Eurocentric blinders. It documents how science was built initially by transfers from non-European civilizations and why the given historiography of science has to be rethought. Throughout the book the author gives examples of Òparallels and antecedentsÓ between East and West in science and estimates the potential reservoir of Asian knowledge in each field. The book also deals with the many knotty problems in recovering science from past traditions. The author distinguishes between his secular efforts from religious and other attempts that claim the equivalence of all knowledge systems.",Science,334,N/A,0,en

McCutcheon traces the arguments offered by these philosophers of religion back to Wittgenstein's own criticisms of speculative metaphysics, arguing that in its religious usage the concept of God does not fall under Wittgenstein's anti-metaphysical gaze. In presenting a detailed account of Wittgenstein's own philosophical method, including his criticisms of metaphysics, McCutcheon shows that it is possible to accept Wittgenstein's criticisms of metaphysics whilst retaining the metaphysical content of religious language. This book offers a fresh understanding of Wittgenstein's philosophical method and a new critique of religious discourse for those studying philosophy and religious studies.",Religion,284,N/A,0,en

The Philosophy of Mathematics and Natural Laws,Noel Curran,Routledge,2019-07-23,"First published in 1997, this title is a sequel to Dr Noel Curran's first book The Logical Universe: The Real Universe (published by Ashgate under the Avebury imprint, 1994). The philosophy of mathematics in this book is based on ideas of Sir William Rowan Hamilton on the ordinal character of numbers, the real numbers, the measure numbers, scalar numbers and the extension to vectors. The final extension is to Hamilton’s quaternions. This algebra is interpreted as the mathematics of spin. This led to a a new theory of time and space which is Euclidian. The motion of spin is absolute, no frame of reference is required. If time is assumed to have a beginning it would be asymmetric with an arrow. This concept is applied to the laws of nature, which are symmetrical. This is another Copernican Revolution in three aspects: absolute time is restored, time has an arrow - is asymmetric, and thirdly the theory is based on the motion of spin which is absolute and more fundamental than the motion of translation. This opens the way to the final unification of physics.",Philosophy,219,N/A,0,en

Standards for Preparing Teachers of Mathematics,Association of Mathematics Teacher Educators (AMTE),IAP,2020-02-01,"Also available in a black + white version AMTE, in the Standards for Preparing Teachers of Mathematics (SPTM), puts forward a national vision of initial preparation for all Pre-K–12 teachers who teach mathematics. SPTM contains critical messages for all who teach mathematics, including elementary school teachers teaching all disciplines, middle and high school mathematics teachers who may teach mathematics exclusively, special education teachers, teachers of emergent multilingual students, and other teaching professionals and administrators who have responsibility for students’ mathematical learning. SPTM has broad implications for teacher preparation programs, in which stakeholders include faculty and administrators in both education and mathematics at the university level; teachers, principals, and district leaders in the schools with which preparation programs partner; and the communities in which preparation programs and their school partners are situated. SPTM is intended as a national guide that articulates a vision for mathematics teacher preparation and supports the continuous improvement of teacher preparation programs. Such continuous improvement includes changes to preparation program courses and structures, partnerships involving schools and universities and their leaders, the ongoing accreditation of such programs regionally and nationally, and the shaping of state and national mathematics teacher preparation policy. SPTM is also designed to inform assessment practices for mathematics teacher preparation programs, to influence policies related to preparation of teachers of mathematics, and to promote national dialogue around preparing teachers of mathematics. The vision articulated in SPTM is aspirational in that it describes a set of high expectations for developing a well-prepared beginning teacher of mathematics who can support meaningful student learning. The vision is research-based and establishes a set of goals for the continued development and refinement of a mathematics teacher preparation program and a research agenda for the study of the effects of such a program. SPTM contains detailed depictions of what a well-prepared beginning teacher knows and is able to do related to content, pedagogy, and disposition, and what a strong preparation program entails with respect to learning experiences, assessments, and partnerships. Stakeholders in mathematics teacher preparation will find messages related to their roles. Standards for Preparing Teachers of Mathematics includes standards and indicators for teacher candidates and for the design of teacher preparation programs. SPTM outlines assessment practices related to overall quality, program effectiveness, and candidate performance.

The authors contributing to this book pose challenging questions, from multiple perspectives, about the roles of mathematics in society and the implications for education. Traditional reasons for teaching mathematics include: preparing a new generation of mathematics researchers and a cadre of technically competent users of mathematics; training students to think logically; and because mathematics is as much part of cultural heritage as literature or music. These reasons remain valid, though open to critique, but a deeper analysis is required that recognizes the roles of mathematics in framing many aspects of contemporary society, that will connect mathematics education to the lived experiences of students, their communities, and society in general, and that acknowledges the global ethical responsibilities of mathematicians and mathematics educators.

"Doing Mathematics: Convention, Subject, Calculation, Analogy (2nd Edition)",Martin H Krieger,World Scientific,2015-01-15,"Doing Mathematics discusses some ways mathematicians and mathematical physicists do their work and the subject matters they uncover and fashion. The conventions they adopt, the subject areas they delimit, what they can prove and calculate about the physical world, and the analogies they discover and employ, all depend on the mathematics — what will work out and what won't. The cases studied include the central limit theorem of statistics, the sound of the shape of a drum, the connections between algebra and topology, and the series of rigorous proofs of the stability of matter. The many and varied solutions to the two-dimensional Ising model of ferromagnetism make sense as a whole when they are seen in an analogy developed by Richard Dedekind in the 1880s to algebraicize Riemann's function theory; by Robert Langlands' program in number theory and representation theory; and, by the analogy between one-dimensional quantum mechanics and two-dimensional classical statistical mechanics. In effect, we begin to see 'an identity in a manifold presentation of profiles,' as the phenomenologists would say.This second edition deepens the particular examples; it describe the practical role of mathematical rigor; it suggests what might be a mathematician's philosophy of mathematics; and, it shows how an 'ugly' first proof or derivation embodies essential features, only to be appreciated after many subsequent proofs. Natural scientists and mathematicians trade physical models and abstract objects, remaking them to suit their needs, discovering new roles for them as in the recent case of the Painlevé transcendents, the Tracy-Widom distribution, and Toeplitz determinants. And mathematics has provided the models and analogies, the ordinary language, for describing the everyday world, the structure of cities, or God's infinitude.",Mathematics,492,N/A,0,en

"Visualization, Explanation and Reasoning Styles in Mathematics","P. Mancosu, Klaus Frovin Jørgensen, S.A. Pedersen",Springer Science & Business Media,2006-03-30,"In the 20th century philosophy of mathematics has to a great extent been dominated by views developed during the so-called foundational crisis in the beginning of that century. These views have primarily focused on questions pertaining to the logical structure of mathematics and questions regarding the justi?cation and consistency of mathematics. Paradigmatic in this - spect is Hilbert’s program which inherits from Frege and Russell the project to formalize all areas of ordinary mathematics and then adds the requi- ment of a proof, by epistemically privileged means (?nitistic reasoning), of the consistency of such formalized theories. While interest in modi?ed v- sions of the original foundational programs is still thriving, in the second part of the twentieth century several philosophers and historians of mat- matics have questioned whether such foundational programs could exhaust the realm of important philosophical problems to be raised about the nature of mathematics. Some have done so in open confrontation (and hostility) to the logically based analysis of mathematics which characterized the cl- sical foundational programs, while others (and many of the contributors to this book belong to this tradition) have only called for an extension of the range of questions and problems that should be raised in connection with an understanding of mathematics. The focus has turned thus to a consideration of what mathematicians are actually doing when they produce mathematics.

Chapters in this section promote the use of methods coursework, narrative analysis and culturally relevant pedagogy to enhance practitioner agency and roles as scholars. Section II includes Culturally Responsive School Leadership (CRSL) as a way to recognize and address the historical examples and barriers to practitioner social justice activism. These chapters center the school setting and graduate coursework, using practitioner scholarship as a way to cultivate critical consciousness and the use of counter-narratives to combat racism, settler colonialism, and classism among school staff. Section III engages practitioner scholarship as a revolutionary approach through case study, auto-ethnography, review of literature, mental models, and phenomenological study. This section fosters the value of practitioner voice as agency to disrupt oppressive ideologies and beliefs that sustain inequitable and unequal school environments. Section IV provides curriculum, instruction, and parent involvement as examples of practitioner advocacy via personal and collective identity development, Black/Crit, Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) and engagement strategies. These final chapters provide details of policy and practice transformation methods that empower practitioner sustainability of student and parent access to equitable and inclusive school experiences.",Education,326,N/A,0,en
Magical Mathematics,"Persi Diaconis, Ron Graham",Princeton University Press,2015-10-13,"""Magical Mathematics reveals the secrets of amazing, fun-to-perform card tricks--and the profound mathematical ideas behind them--that will astound even the most accomplished magician. Persi Diaconis and Ron Graham provide easy, step-by-step instructions for each trick, explaining how to set up the effect and offering tips on what to say and do while performing it. Each card trick introduces a new mathematical idea, and varying the tricks in turn takes readers to the very threshold of today's mathematical knowledge. For example, the Gilbreath principle--a fantastic effect where the cards remain in control despite being shuffled--is found to share an intimate connection with the Mandelbrot set. Other card tricks link to the mathematical secrets of combinatorics, graph theory, number theory, topology, the Riemann hypothesis, and even Fermat's last theorem. Diaconis and Graham are mathematicians as well as skilled performers with decades of professional experience between them. In this book they share a wealth of conjuring lore, including some closely guarded secrets of legendary magicians. Magical Mathematics covers the mathematics of juggling and shows how the I Ching connects to the history of probability and magic tricks both old and new. It tells the stories--and reveals the best tricks--of the eccentric and brilliant inventors of mathematical magic. Magical Mathematics exposes old gambling secrets through the mathematics of shuffling cards, explains the classic street-gambling scam of three-card monte, traces the history of mathematical magic back to the thirteenth century and the oldest mathematical trick--and much more""-",Crafts & Hobbies,258,N/A,0,en

Mastery and Depth in Primary Mathematics,"Fay Lewis, Amanda Wilkinson, Marcus Witt",Routledge,2022-01-24,"The UK National Curriculum is clear about the importance of reasoning and problem-solving in mathematics. Mastery and Depth in Primary Mathematics aims to support trainee and established teachers to embed mathematical thinking into their lessons. The authors focus on practical and actionable ways that primary teachers can develop their children’s mathematical thinking, reasoning and problem-solving: ideas which are at the heart of the UK National Curriculum. Covering a range of areas in mathematical thinking such as reasoning, problem-solving and pattern-spotting, as well as systematic and investigative thinking, each chapter provides clear examples of how teachers can make small, manageable ‘rich tweaks’ to their existing lessons to increase the opportunities for children to develop their mathematical thinking. Teachers will be able to dip into the book and find inspiration and ideas that they can use immediately and, importantly, develop a set of principles and skills which will enable them to take any mathematical activity and tweak it to develop their pupils’ thinking skills. This practical guide will be invaluable to all trainee teachers and early-career teachers that wish to enhance their primary mathematics teaching.",Education,110,N/A,0,en
"Use of Services for Family Planning and Infertility, United States, 1982","Gerry E. Hendershot, Marjorie C. Horn, William D. Mosher",N/A,1988,"The 1982 statistics on the use of family planning and infertility services presented in this report are preliminary results from Cycle III of the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics. Data were collected through personal interviews with a multistage area probability sample of 7969 women aged 15-44. A detailed series of questions was asked to obtain relatively complete estimates of the extent and type of family planning services received. Statistics on family planning services are limited to women who were able to conceive 3 years before the interview date. Overall, 79% of currently mrried nonsterile women reported using some type of family planning service during the previous 3 years. There were no statistically significant differences between white (79%), black (75%) or Hispanic (77%) wives, or between the 2 income groups. The 1982 survey questions were more comprehensive than those of earlier cycles of the survey. The annual rate of visits for family planning services in 1982 was 1077 visits /1000 women. Teenagers had the highest annual visit rate (1581/1000) of any age group for all sources of family planning services combined. Visit rates declined sharply with age from 1447 at ages 15-24 to 479 at ages 35-44. Similar declines with age also were found in the visit rates for white and black women separately. Nevertheless, the annual visit rate for black women (1334/1000) was significantly higher than that for white women (1033). The highest overall visit rate was for black women 15-19 years of age (1867/1000). Nearly 2/3 of all family planning visits were to private medical sources. Teenagers of all races had higher family planning service visit rates to clinics than to private medical sources, as did black women age 15-24. White women age 20 and older had higher visit rates to private medical services than to clinics. Never married women had higher visit rates to clinics than currently or formerly married women. Data were also collected in 1982 on use of medical services for infertility by women who had difficulty in conceiving or carrying a pregnancy to term. About 1 million ever married women had 1 or more infertility visits in the 12 months before the interview. During the 3 years before interview, about 1.9 million women had infertility visits. For all ever married women, as well as for white and black women separately, infertility services were more likely to be secured from private medical sources than from clinics. The survey design, reliability of the estimates and the terms used are explained in the technical notes.",Birth control,982,N/A,0,en
Why Is There Philosophy of Mathematics At All?,Ian Hacking,Cambridge University Press,2014-01-30,"This truly philosophical book takes us back to fundamentals - the sheer experience of proof, and the enigmatic relation of mathematics to nature. It asks unexpected questions, such as 'what makes mathematics mathematics?', 'where did proof come from and how did it evolve?', and 'how did the distinction between pure and applied mathematics come into being?' In a wide-ranging discussion that is both immersed in the past and unusually attuned to the competing philosophical ideas of contemporary mathematicians, it shows that proof and other forms of mathematical exploration continue to be living, evolving practices - responsive to new technologies, yet embedded in permanent (and astonishing) facts about human beings. It distinguishes several distinct types of application of mathematics, and shows how each leads to a different philosophical conundrum. Here is a remarkable body of new philosophical thinking about proofs, applications, and other mathematical activities.",Science,307,N/A,0,en
Reading and Writing the World with Mathematics,Eric Gutstein,Routledge,2012-09-10,"Mathematics education in the United States can reproduce social inequalities whether schools use either ""basic-skills"" curricula to prepare mainly low-income students of color for low-skilled service jobs or ""standards-based"" curricula to ready students for knowledge-intensive positions. And working for fundamental social change and rectifying injustice are rarely included in any mathematics curriculum. Reading and Writing the World with Mathematics argues that mathematics education should prepare students to investigate and critique injustice, and to challenge, in words and actions, oppressive structures and acts.

Motivational Profiles in TIMSS Mathematics,"Michalis P. Michaelides, Gavin T. L. Brown, Hanna Eklöf, Elena C. Papanastasiou",Springer Nature,2019-09-03,"This open access book presents a person-centered exploration of student profiles, using variables related to motivation to do school mathematics derived from the IEA’s Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) data. Statistical cluster analysis is used to identify groups of students with similar motivational profiles, across grades and over time, for multiple participating countries. While motivational variables systematically relate to school outcomes, linear relationships can obscure the diverse makeup of student subgroups, each with varying combinations of motivation, emotions, and attitudes. In this book, a person-centered analysis of distinct and meaningful motivational profiles and their differences on sociodemographic variables and mathematics performance broadens understanding about the role that motivation characteristics play in learning and achievement in mathematics. Exploiting the richness of IEA’s TIMSS data from many countries, extracted clusters reveal consistent, as well as certain nuanced patterns that are systematically linked to sociodemographic and achievement measures. Student clusters with inconsistent motivational profiles were found in all countries; mathematics self-confidence then emerged as the variable more closely associated with average achievement. The findings demonstrate that teachers, researchers, and policymakers need to take into account differential student profiles, prioritizing techniques that target skill and competence in mathematics, in educational efforts to develop student motivation.",Education,149,N/A,0,en

Historiography of Mathematics in the 19th and 20th Centuries,"Volker R. Remmert, Martina R. Schneider, Henrik Kragh Sørensen",Birkhäuser,2016-12-08,"This book addresses the historiography of mathematics as it was practiced during the 19th and 20th centuries by paying special attention to the cultural contexts in which the history of mathematics was written. In the 19th century, the history of mathematics was recorded by a diverse range of people trained in various fields and driven by different motivations and aims. These backgrounds often shaped not only their writing on the history of mathematics, but, in some instances, were also influential in their subsequent reception. During the period from roughly 1880-1940, mathematics modernized in important ways, with regard to its content, its conditions for cultivation, and its identity; and the writing of the history of mathematics played into the last part in particular. Parallel to the modernization of mathematics, the history of mathematics gradually evolved into a field of research with its own journals, societies and academic positions. Reflecting both a new professional identity and changes in its primary audience, various shifts of perspective in the way the history of mathematics was and is written can still be observed to this day. Initially concentrating on major internal, universal developments in certain sub-disciplines of mathematics, the field gradually gravitated towards a focus on contexts of knowledge production involving individuals, local practices, problems, communities, and networks. The goal of this book is to link these disciplinary and methodological changes in the history of mathematics to the broader cultural contexts of its practitioners, namely the historians of mathematics during the period in question.",Mathematics,282,N/A,0,en

Children Doing Mathematics,"Terezinha Nunes, Peter Bryant",Wiley-Blackwell,1996-05-01,"Children Doing Mathematics provides a reliable and up to date review of the substantial recent work in children' mathematical understanding. The authors also present important new research on children's understanding of number, measurement, arithmetic operation and fractions both in and out of school. The central theme of Children Doing Mathematics is that there are crucial conditions for children's mathematical learning. Firstly, children have to come to grips with conventional mathematical systems. Secondly, but equally important, they have to be able to present mathematical knowledge in a way that solves problems. The book also discusses how mathematical activities and knowledge involve much more than what is currently viewed as mathematics in the school curriculum. Most recent work illustrates how children can be successful in mathematical activities outside school whereas they fail in similar activities in the classroom. Through these two underlying themes the authors bring together discussions on conventional mathematical learning and on real life mathematical success. In so doing, they also highlight new and better ways of analysing children's abilities and of advancing their learning in school.",Psychology,292,5,1,en

What Does Understanding Mathematics Mean for Teachers?,Yuichi Handa,Routledge,2013-05-13,"This book opens up alternative ways of thinking and talking about ways in which a person can ""know"" a subject (in this case, mathematics), leading to a reconsideration of what it may mean to be a teacher of that subject. In a number of European languages, a distinction is made in ways of knowing that in the English language is collapsed into the singular word know. In French, for example, to know in the savoir sense is to know things, facts, names, how and why things work, and so on, whereas to know in the connaître sense is to know a person, a place, or even a thing—namely, an other— in such a way that one is familiar with, or in relationship with this other. Primarily through phenomenological reflection with a touch of empirical input, this book fleshes out an image for what a person’s connaître knowing of mathematics might mean, turning to mathematics teachers and teacher educators to help clarify this image.",Education,162,N/A,0,en

Understanding the Mathematical Way of Thinking – The Registers of Semiotic Representations,Raymond Duval,Springer,2017-07-18,"In this book, Raymond Duval shows how his theory of registers of semiotic representation can be used as a tool to analyze the cognitive processes through which students develop mathematical thinking. To Duval, the analysis of mathematical knowledge is in its essence the analysis of the cognitive synergy between different kinds of semiotic representation registers, because the mathematical way of thinking and working is based on transformations of semiotic representations into others. Based on this assumption, he proposes the use of semiotics to identify and develop the specific cognitive processes required to the acquisition of mathematical knowledge. In this volume he presents a method to do so, addressing the following questions: • How to situate the registers of representation regarding the other semiotic “theories” • Why use a semio-cognitive analysis of the mathematical activity to teach mathematics • How to distinguish the different types of registers • How to organize learning tasks and activities which take into account the registers of representation • How to make an analysis of the students’ production in terms of registers Building upon the contributions he first presented in his classic book Sémiosis et pensée humaine, in this volume Duval focuses less on theoretical issues and more on how his theory can be used both as a tool for analysis and a working method to help mathematics teachers apply semiotics to their everyday work. He also dedicates a complete chapter to show how his theory can be applied as a new strategy to teach geometry. “Understanding the Mathematical Way of Thinking – The Registers of Semiotic Representations is an essential work for mathematics educators and mathematics teachers who look for an introduction to Raymond Duval’s cognitive theory of semiotic registers of representation, making it possible for them to see and teach mathematics with fresh eyes.” Professor Tânia M.

"Platonism, Naturalism, and Mathematical Knowledge",James Robert Brown,Routledge,2013-06-17,"This study addresses a central theme in current philosophy: Platonism vs Naturalism and provides accounts of both approaches to mathematics, crucially discussing Quine, Maddy, Kitcher, Lakoff, Colyvan, and many others. Beginning with accounts of both approaches, Brown defends Platonism by arguing that only a Platonistic approach can account for concept acquisition in a number of special cases in the sciences. He also argues for a particular view of applied mathematics, a view that supports Platonism against Naturalist alternatives. Not only does this engaging book present the Platonist-Naturalist debate over mathematics in a comprehensive fashion, but it also sheds considerable light on non-mathematical aspects of a dispute that is central to contemporary philosophy.",Philosophy,203,N/A,0,en

Dark and Bright Mathematics,Dirk Huylebrouck,Springer Nature,2023-11-20,"Was it necessary for a 17th century painter to know principles of optics to hide a skull in one of his masterpieces? Is it possible the violent deaths of Roman emperors obey a statistical law? Are there connections between market trends and geometry? How did Islamic artists draw almost perfectly regular nine-sided polygons, when these cannot be traced with the use of compasses? Dirk Huylebrouk asks these and other exciting questions in this collection of essays, originally written for the science magazine EOS, a Dutch equivalent of Scientific American, distributed in Belgium and in The Netherlands. Every chapter can be read independently, as some subjects are repeated, and not strictly interconnected. Such is the case for instance of the golden section, an often-recurring topic in general mathematics. The reader will appreciate the original point of view expressed through each chapter, which makes this book stand out against the general information one can find by browsing the general media. The subtly provocative character of some parts is meant to stimulate the reader for further exploration. The book's title itself may already generate surprise. Sure, to many, mathematics seems to come from hell, but the darkness in the title in fact refers to the lugubrious stories about math and skulls, murders or World War II. There is also a more down-to-earth part is about math and maps, money, Facebook, folding paper, shapes in ice and the most earthly yet unsolved math problems. ‘Bright mathematics’ alludes to Vedic, Islam, New Age, a meta-divine section, and is concluded by an interview with a top mathematician who also wrote about the existence of God.",Mathematics,244,N/A,0,en

Philosophers in the Technological Age,Ulrich Richter Morales,Océano,2023-04-26,"Greek philosophers built great discussions about reality, which are still current in our times and still inspire today's great thinkers. From mathematical teachings by Pythagoras, encompassing Plato's and Aristotle's ideas, these great discussions have been essential for our present intelectual development. Today, however, this role has been adopted by a new class of visionaries. Brought together by this new Platonic Academy based in Stanford University; devoted to proving and making use of the supremacy of numbers and mathematics in the digital world; intent on finding the new Holy Grail embodied in the perfect algorithm, present time's entrepreneurs of new technologies have radically transformed, for good or otherwise, the world as we know it. Ulrich Richter Morales delves deep into the legacy – sometimes clear, sometimes mystical and esoteric – of the Pythagoreans in their diverse historical incarnations. He particularly emphasizes their dominant role in these digital times, while he introduces a debate regarding the sort of machines we ought to develop. Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, among others, are declared heirs of the Mathematician from Samos and, always engrossed in polemic discussions, they are inseparable from our concept of how the world works.

Introduction to Databases,Peter Revesz,Springer Science & Business Media,2010-01-11,"Introduced forty years ago, relational databases proved unusually succe- ful and durable. However, relational database systems were not designed for modern applications and computers. As a result, specialized database systems now proliferate trying to capture various pieces of the database market. Database research is pulled into di?erent directions, and speci- ized database conferences are created. Yet the current chaos in databases is likely only temporary because every technology, including databases, becomes standardized over time. The history of databases shows periods of chaos followed by periods of dominant technologies. For example, in the early days of computing, users stored their data in text ?les in any format and organization they wanted. These early days were followed by information retrieval systems, which required some structure for text documents, such as a title, authors, and a publisher. The information retrieval systems were followed by database systems, which added even more structure to the data and made querying easier. In the late 1990s, the emergence of the Internet brought a period of relative chaos and interest in unstructured and “semistructured data” as it wasenvisionedthateverywebpagewouldbelikeapageinabook.However, with the growing maturity of the Internet, the interest in structured data was regained because the most popular websites are, in fact, based on databases. The question is not whether future data stores need structure but what structure they need.",Computers,754,N/A,0,en

Morality and Mathematics,Justin Clarke-Doane,Oxford University Press,2020-03-12,"To what extent are the subjects of our thoughts and talk real? This is the question of realism. In this book, Justin Clarke-Doane explores arguments for and against moral realism and mathematical realism, how they interact, and what they can tell us about areas of philosophical interest more generally. He argues that, contrary to widespread belief, our mathematical beliefs have no better claim to being self-evident or provable than our moral beliefs. Nor do our mathematical beliefs have better claim to being empirically justified than our moral beliefs. It is also incorrect that reflection on the genealogy of our moral beliefs establishes a lack of parity between the cases. In general, if one is a moral antirealist on the basis of epistemological considerations, then one ought to be a mathematical antirealist as well. And, yet, Clarke-Doane shows that moral realism and mathematical realism do not stand or fall together -- and for a surprising reason. Moral questions, insofar as they are practical, are objective in a sense that mathematical questions are not, and the sense in which they are objective can only be explained by assuming practical anti-realism. One upshot of the discussion is that the concepts of realism and objectivity, which are widely identified, are actually in tension. Another is that the objective questions in the neighborhood of factual areas like logic, modality, grounding, and nature are practical questions too. Practical philosophy should, therefore, take center stage.",Philosophy,219,N/A,0,en

Number Theory in the Spirit of Ramanujan,Bruce C. Berndt,American Mathematical Soc.,2006,"Ramanujan is recognized as one of the great number theorists of the twentieth century. Here now is the first book to provide an introduction to his work in number theory. Most of Ramanujan's work in number theory arose out of $q$-series and theta functions. This book provides an introduction to these two important subjects and to some of the topics in number theory that are inextricably intertwined with them, including the theory of partitions, sums of squares and triangular numbers, and the Ramanujan tau function. The majority of the results discussed here are originally due to Ramanujan or were rediscovered by him. Ramanujan did not leave us proofs of the thousands of theorems he recorded in his notebooks, and so it cannot be claimed that many of the proofs given in this book are those found by Ramanujan. However, they are all in the spirit of his mathematics. The subjects examined in this book have a rich history dating back to Euler and Jacobi, and they continue to be focal points of contemporary mathematical research. Therefore, at the end of each of the seven chapters, Berndt discusses the results established in the chapter and places them in both historical and contemporary contexts. The book is suitable for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students interested in number theory.",Mathematics,210,N/A,0,en

Modern Mathematical Statistics with Applications,"Jay L. Devore, Kenneth N. Berk, Matthew A. Carlton",Springer Nature,2021-04-29,"This 3rd edition of Modern Mathematical Statistics with Applications tries to strike a balance between mathematical foundations and statistical practice. The book provides a clear and current exposition of statistical concepts and methodology, including many examples and exercises based on real data gleaned from publicly available sources. Here is a small but representative selection of scenarios for our examples and exercises based on information in recent articles: Use of the “Big Mac index” by the publication The Economist as a humorous way to compare product costs across nations Visualizing how the concentration of lead levels in cartridges varies for each of five brands of e-cigarettes Describing the distribution of grip size among surgeons and how it impacts their ability to use a particular brand of surgical stapler Estimating the true average odometer reading of used Porsche Boxsters listed for sale on www.cars.com Comparing head acceleration after impact when wearing a football helmet with acceleration without a helmet Investigating the relationship between body mass index and foot load while running The main focus of the book is on presenting and illustrating methods of inferential statistics used by investigators in a wide variety of disciplines, from actuarial science all the way to zoology. It begins with a chapter on descriptive statistics that immediately exposes the reader to the analysis of real data. The next six chapters develop the probability material that facilitates the transition from simply describing data to drawing formal conclusions based on inferential methodology. Point estimation, the use of statistical intervals, and hypothesis testing are the topics of the first three inferential chapters. The remainder of the book explores the use of these methods in a variety of more complex settings. This edition includes many new examples and exercises as well as an introduction to the simulation of events and probability distributions. There are more than 1300 exercises in the book, ranging from very straightforward to reasonably challenging. Many sections have been rewritten with the goal of streamlining and providing a more accessible exposition. Output from the most common statistical software packages is included wherever appropriate (a feature absent from virtually all other mathematical statistics textbooks). The authors hope that their enthusiasm for the theory and applicability of statistics to real world problems will encourage students to pursue more training in the discipline.",Mathematics,981,N/A,0,en

Additive Combinatorics,"Terence Tao, Van H. Vu",Cambridge University Press,2006-09-14,"Additive combinatorics is the theory of counting additive structures in sets. This theory has seen exciting developments and dramatic changes in direction in recent years thanks to its connections with areas such as number theory, ergodic theory and graph theory. This graduate-level 2006 text will allow students and researchers easy entry into this fascinating field. Here, the authors bring together in a self-contained and systematic manner the many different tools and ideas that are used in the modern theory, presenting them in an accessible, coherent, and intuitively clear manner, and providing immediate applications to problems in additive combinatorics. The power of these tools is well demonstrated in the presentation of recent advances such as Szemerédi's theorem on arithmetic progressions, the Kakeya conjecture and Erdos distance problems, and the developing field of sum-product estimates. The text is supplemented by a large number of exercises and new results.",Mathematics,18,4,1,en

The Life and Works of John Napier,"Brian Rice, Enrique González-Velasco, Alexander Corrigan",Springer,2017-03-09,"For the first time, all five of John Napier’s works have been brought together in English in a single volume, making them more accessible than ever before. His four mathematical works were originally published in Latin: two in his lifetime (1550–1617), one shortly after he died, and one over 200 years later. The authors have prepared three introductory chapters, one covering Napier himself, one his mathematical works, and one his religious work. The former has been prepared by one of Napier’s descendants and contains many new findings about Napier’s life to provide the most complete biography of this enigmatic character, whose reputation has previously been overshadowed by rumour and speculation. The latter has been written by an academic who was awarded a PhD for his thesis on Napier at the University of Edinburgh, and it provides the most lucid and coherent coverage available of this abstruse and little understood work. The chapter on Napier’s mathematical texts has been authored by an experienced and respected academic, whose recent works have specialised in the history of mathematics and whose Journey through Mathematics was selected in March of 2012 as an Outstanding Title in Mathematics by Choice magazine, a publication of the American Library Association. All three authors have revisited the primary sources extensively and deliver new insights about Napier and his works, whilst revising the many myths and assumptions that surround his life and character.",Mathematics,1009,N/A,0,en

The Math Myth,Andrew Hacker,"New Press, The",2010-05-25,"A New York Times–bestselling author looks at mathematics education in America—when it’s worthwhile, and when it’s not. Why do we inflict a full menu of mathematics—algebra, geometry, trigonometry, even calculus—on all young Americans, regardless of their interests or aptitudes? While Andrew Hacker has been a professor of mathematics himself, and extols the glories of the subject, he also questions some widely held assumptions in this thought-provoking and practical-minded book. Does advanced math really broaden our minds? Is mastery of azimuths and asymptotes needed for success in most jobs? Should the entire Common Core syllabus be required of every student? Hacker worries that our nation’s current frenzied emphasis on STEM is diverting attention from other pursuits and even subverting the spirit of the country. Here, he shows how mandating math for everyone prevents other talents from being developed and acts as an irrational barrier to graduation and careers. He proposes alternatives, including teaching facility with figures, quantitative reasoning, and understanding statistics. Expanding upon the author’s viral New York Times op-ed, The Math Myth is sure to spark a heated and needed national conversation—not just about mathematics but about the kind of people and society we want to be. “Hacker’s accessible arguments offer plenty to think about and should serve as a clarion call to students, parents, and educators who decry the one-size-fits-all approach to schooling.” —Publishers Weekly, starred review",Education,257,N/A,0,en

Quantifying Life,Dmitry A. Kondrashov,University of Chicago Press,2016-08-04,"Since the time of Isaac Newton, physicists have used mathematics to describe the behavior of matter of all sizes, from subatomic particles to galaxies. In the past three decades, as advances in molecular biology have produced an avalanche of data, computational and mathematical techniques have also become necessary tools in the arsenal of biologists. But while quantitative approaches are now providing fundamental insights into biological systems, the college curriculum for biologists has not caught up, and most biology majors are never exposed to the computational and probabilistic mathematical approaches that dominate in biological research. With Quantifying Life, Dmitry A. Kondrashov offers an accessible introduction to the breadth of mathematical modeling used in biology today. Assuming only a foundation in high school mathematics, Quantifying Life takes an innovative computational approach to developing mathematical skills and intuition. Through lessons illustrated with copious examples, mathematical and programming exercises, literature discussion questions, and computational projects of various degrees of difficulty, students build and analyze models based on current research papers and learn to implement them in the R programming language. This interplay of mathematical ideas, systematically developed programming skills, and a broad selection of biological research topics makes Quantifying Life an invaluable guide for seasoned life scientists and the next generation of biologists alike.",Science,434,N/A,0,en

A Comprehensive Treatment of q-Calculus,Thomas Ernst,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-09-08,"To date, the theoretical development of q-calculus has rested on a non-uniform basis. Generally, the bulky Gasper-Rahman notation was used, but the published works on q-calculus looked different depending on where and by whom they were written. This confusion of tongues not only complicated the theoretical development but also contributed to q-calculus remaining a neglected mathematical field. This book overcomes these problems by introducing a new and interesting notation for q-calculus based on logarithms.For instance, q-hypergeometric functions are now visually clear and easy to trace back to their hypergeometric parents. With this new notation it is also easy to see the connection between q-hypergeometric functions and the q-gamma function, something that until now has been overlooked. The book covers many topics on q-calculus, including special functions, combinatorics, and q-difference equations. Apart from a thorough review of the historical development of q-calculus, this book also presents the domains of modern physics for which q-calculus is applicable, such as particle physics and supersymmetry, to name just a few.​",Mathematics,491,N/A,0,en

Thinking Geometrically,Thomas Q. Sibley,The Mathematical Association of America,2015-08-14,"Thinking Geometrically: A Survey of Geometries is a well written and comprehensive survey of college geometry that would serve a wide variety of courses for both mathematics majors and mathematics education majors. Great care and attention is spent on developing visual insights and geometric intuition while stressing the logical structure, historical development, and deep interconnectedness of the ideas. Students with less mathematical preparation than upper-division mathematics majors can successfully study the topics needed for the preparation of high school teachers. There is a multitude of exercises and projects in those chapters developing all aspects of geometric thinking for these students as well as for more advanced students. These chapters include Euclidean Geometry, Axiomatic Systems and Models, Analytic Geometry, Transformational Geometry, and Symmetry. Topics in the other chapters, including Non-Euclidean Geometry, Projective Geometry, Finite Geometry, Differential Geometry, and Discrete Geometry, provide a broader view of geometry. The different chapters are as independent as possible, while the text still manages to highlight the many connections between topics. The text is self-contained, including appendices with the material in Euclid’s first book and a high school axiomatic system as well as Hilbert’s axioms. Appendices give brief summaries of the parts of linear algebra and multivariable calculus needed for certain chapters. While some chapters use the language of groups, no prior experience with abstract algebra is presumed. The text will support an approach emphasizing dynamical geometry software without being tied to any particular software.",Mathematics,586,N/A,0,en

Hypergeometric Orthogonal Polynomials and Their q-Analogues,"Roelof Koekoek, Peter A. Lesky, René F. Swarttouw",Springer Science & Business Media,2010-03-18,"The present book is about the Askey scheme and the q-Askey scheme, which are graphically displayed right before chapter 9 and chapter 14, respectively. The fa- lies of orthogonal polynomials in these two schemes generalize the classical orth- onal polynomials (Jacobi, Laguerre and Hermite polynomials) and they have pr- erties similar to them. In fact, they have properties so similar that I am inclined (f- lowing Andrews & Askey [34]) to call all families in the (q-)Askey scheme classical orthogonal polynomials, and to call the Jacobi, Laguerre and Hermite polynomials very classical orthogonal polynomials. These very classical orthogonal polynomials are good friends of mine since - most the beginning of my mathematical career. When I was a fresh PhD student at the Mathematical Centre (now CWI) in Amsterdam, Dick Askey spent a sabbatical there during the academic year 1969–1970. He lectured to us in a very stimulating wayabouthypergeometricfunctionsandclassicalorthogonalpolynomials. Evenb- ter, he gave us problems to solve which might be worth a PhD. He also pointed out to us that there was more than just Jacobi, Laguerre and Hermite polynomials, for instance Hahn polynomials, and that it was one of the merits of the Higher Transc- dental Functions (Bateman project) that it included some newer stuff like the Hahn polynomials (see [198, §10. 23]).",Mathematics,584,N/A,0,en

Proofs and Ideas,B. Sethuraman,American Mathematical Society,2021-12-02,"Proofs and Ideas serves as a gentle introduction to advanced mathematics for students who previously have not had extensive exposure to proofs. It is intended to ease the student's transition from algorithmic mathematics to the world of mathematics that is built around proofs and concepts. The spirit of the book is that the basic tools of abstract mathematics are best developed in context and that creativity and imagination are at the core of mathematics. So, while the book has chapters on statements and sets and functions and induction, the bulk of the book focuses on core mathematical ideas and on developing intuition. Along with chapters on elementary combinatorics and beginning number theory, this book contains introductory chapters on real analysis, group theory, and graph theory that serve as gentle first exposures to their respective areas. The book contains hundreds of exercises, both routine and non-routine. This book has been used for a transition to advanced mathematics courses at California State University, Northridge, as well as for a general education course on mathematical reasoning at Krea University, India.",Mathematics,350,N/A,0,en

A Mathematical Mystery Tour,A. K. Dewdney,New York ; Toronto : Wiley,1999-03-12,"A.K. Dewdney takes readers on a theoretical world tour to answer the question: Did humans make up mathematics, or did mathematics make up everything, including humans? After all, mathematical formulas seem to perfectly govern the cosmos, and the ur-mathematician Pythagoras himself believed that mathematics makes up reality. Dewdney has taken it upon himself to examine this fundamental question, beginning his journey in Miletus, the ancient home of Pythagoras and other deep thinkers. There, he meets the fictional Dr. Petros Pygonopolis, the first of his guides through space and time in search of mathematical meaning in history. His journey continues with stops in the Arabian desert (for insight into ancient Islamic astronomy with Professor al-Flayli), Venice (where Maria Canzoni reveals the mysteries of atomic theory), and England (home of the ""engines of thought"" in the form of Alan Turing's mind machines, as explained by Sir John Brainard). Dewdney's style is accessible, his knowledge is thorough, and his sense of humor is refreshing, if a bit geeky. A Mathematical Mystery Tour is not a difficult read, although the ideas it attempts to clarify are quite abstract. The fictional tour guides at each port of call are helpful in humanizing the intimidating subject matter.",Mathematics,232,N/A,0,en

"Q-series with Applications to Combinatorics, Number Theory, and Physics","Bruce C. Berndt, Ken Ono",American Mathematical Soc.,2001-01-01,"The subject of $q$-series can be said to begin with Euler and his pentagonal number theorem. In fact, $q$-series are sometimes called Eulerian series. Contributions were made by Gauss, Jacobi, and Cauchy, but the first attempt at a systematic development, especially from the point of view of studying series with the products in the summands, was made by E. Heine in 1847. In the latter part of the nineteenth and in the early part of the twentieth centuries, two Englishmathematicians, L. J. Rogers and F. H. Jackson, made fundamental contributions. In 1940, G. H. Hardy described what we now call Ramanujan's famous $ 1\psi 1$ summation theorem as ''a remarkable formula with many parameters.'' This is now one of the fundamental theorems of the subject. Despite humble beginnings,the subject of $q$-series has flourished in the past three decades, particularly with its applications to combinatorics, number theory, and physics. During the year 2000, the University of Illinois embraced The Millennial Year in Number Theory. One of the events that year was the conference $q$-Series with Applications to Combinatorics, Number Theory, and Physics. This event gathered mathematicians from the world over to lecture and discuss their research. This volume presents nineteen of thepapers presented at the conference. The excellent lectures that are included chart pathways into the future and survey the numerous applications of $q$-series to combinatorics, number theory, and physics.",Mathematics,292,N/A,0,en

"$q$-Difference Operators, Orthogonal Polynomials, and Symmetric Expansions",Douglas Bowman,American Mathematical Soc.,2002,The author explores ramifications and extensions of a $q$-difference operator method first used by L.J. Rogers for deriving relationships between special functions involving certain fundamental $q$-symmetric polynomials. In special cases these symmetric polynomials reduce to well-known classes of orthogonal polynomials. A number of basic properties of these polynomials follow from this approach. This leads naturally to the evaluation of the Askey-Wilson integral and generalizations. Expansions of certain generalized basic hypergeometric functions in terms of the symmetric polynomials are also found. This provides a quick route to understanding the group structure generated by iterating the two-term transformations of these functions. Some infrastructure is also laid for more general investigations in the future,Mathematics,73,N/A,0,en

There are also chapters on other topics such as Lambert series and combinatorial proofs of basic hypergeometric identities.The book could serve as a textbook for the subject at the graduate level and as a textbook for a topic course at the undergraduate level (earlier chapters).

In Two Dozen (or so) Arguments for God, each of Plantinga's original suggestions, many of which he only briefly sketched, is developed in detail by a wide variety of accomplished scholars. The authors look to metaphysics, epistemology, semantics, ethics, aesthetics, and beyond, finding evidence for God in almost every dimension of reality.

Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom,William Lane Craig,BRILL,1991,"The ancient problem of fatalism, more particularly theological fatalism, has resurfaced with surprising vigour in the second half of the twentieth century. Two questions predominate in the debate: (1) Is divine foreknowledge compatible with human freedom and (2) How can God foreknow future free acts? Having surveyed the historical background of this debate in ""The Problem of Divine Foreknowledge"" and ""Future Contingents from Aristotle to Suarez"" (Brill: 1988), William Lane Craig now attempts to address these issues critically. His wide-ranging discussion brings together a thought- provoking array of related topics such as logical fatalism, multivalent logic, backward causation, precognition, time travel, counterfactual logic, temporal necessity, Newcomb's Problem, middle knowledge, and relativity theory. The present work serves both as a useful survey of the extensive literature on theological fatalism and related fields and as a stimulating assessment of the possibility of divine foreknowledge of future free acts.",Religion,390,N/A,0,en

Diffeology,Patrick Iglesias-Zemmour,American Mathematical Soc.,2013-04-09,"Diffeology is an extension of differential geometry. With a minimal set of axioms, diffeology allows us to deal simply but rigorously with objects which do not fall within the usual field of differential geometry: quotients of manifolds (even non-Hausdorff), spaces of functions, groups of diffeomorphisms, etc. The category of diffeology objects is stable under standard set-theoretic operations, such as quotients, products, co-products, subsets, limits, and co-limits. With its right balance between rigor and simplicity, diffeology can be a good framework for many problems that appear in various areas of physics. Actually, the book lays the foundations of the main fields of differential geometry used in theoretical physics: differentiability, Cartan differential calculus, homology and cohomology, diffeological groups, fiber bundles, and connections. The book ends with an open program on symplectic diffeology, a rich field of application of the theory. Many exercises with solutions make this book appropriate for learning the subject.",Mathematics,467,N/A,0,en

"Informal Introduction To Stochastic Calculus With Applications, An (Second Edition)",Ovidiu Calin,World Scientific,2021-11-15,"Most branches of science involving random fluctuations can be approached by Stochastic Calculus. These include, but are not limited to, signal processing, noise filtering, stochastic control, optimal stopping, electrical circuits, financial markets, molecular chemistry, population dynamics, etc. All these applications assume a strong mathematical background, which in general takes a long time to develop. Stochastic Calculus is not an easy to grasp theory, and in general, requires acquaintance with the probability, analysis and measure theory.The goal of this book is to present Stochastic Calculus at an introductory level and not at its maximum mathematical detail. The author's goal was to capture as much as possible the spirit of elementary deterministic Calculus, at which students have been already exposed. This assumes a presentation that mimics similar properties of deterministic Calculus, which facilitates understanding of more complicated topics of Stochastic Calculus.The second edition contains several new features that improved the first edition both qualitatively and quantitatively. First, two more chapters have been added, Chapter 12 and Chapter 13, dealing with applications of stochastic processes in Electrochemistry and global optimization methods.This edition contains also a final chapter material containing fully solved review problems and provides solutions, or at least valuable hints, to all proposed problems.

A second feature consists of an emphasis on homological algebra: basic notions on complexes are presented as soon as modules have been introduced, and an extensive last chapter on homological algebra can form the basis for a follow-up introductory course on the subject. Approximately 1,000 exercises both provide adequate practice to consolidate the understanding of the main body of the text and offer the opportunity to explore many other topics, including applications to number theory and algebraic geometry.

Linear Algebra and Its Applications with R,Ruriko Yoshida,CRC Press,2021-06-27,"This book developed from the need to teach a linear algebra course to students focused on data science and bioinformatics programs. These students tend not to realize the importance of linear algebra in applied sciences, since traditional linear algebra courses tend to cover mathematical contexts but not the computational aspect of linear algebra or its applications to data science and bioinformatics. The author presents the topics in a traditional course, yet offers lectures as well as lab exercises on simulated and empirical data sets. This textbook provides students a theoretical basis which can then be applied to the practical R and Python problems, providing the tools needed for real-world applications. Each section starts with working examples to demonstrate how tools from linear algebra can help solve problems in applied sciences. These exercises start from easy computations, such as computing determinants of matrices, to practical applications on simulated and empirical data sets with R so that students learn how to get started with R, along with computational examples in each section, and then students learn how to apply what they've learned to problems in applied sciences. This book is designed from first principles to demonstrate the importance of linear algebra through working computational examples with R and Python, including tutorials on how to install R in the Appendix. If a student has never seen R, they can get started without any additional help. Since Python is one of the most popular languages in data science, optimization, and computer science, code supplements are available for students who feel more comfortable with Python. R is used primarily for computational examples to develop students’ practical computational skills. About the Author: Dr. Ruriko Yoshida is an Associate Professor of Operations Research at the Naval Postgraduate School. She received her PhD in Mathematics from the University of California, Davis.

Theorems and Counterexamples in Mathematics,"Bernard R. Gelbaum, John M.H. Olmsted",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The gratifying response to Counterexamples in analysis (CEA) was followed, when the book went out of print, by expressions of dismay from those who were unable to acquire it. The connection of the present volume with CEA is clear, although the sights here are set higher. In the quarter-century since the appearance of CEA, mathematical education has taken some large steps reflected in both the undergraduate and graduate curricula. What was once taken as very new, remote, or arcane is now a well-established part of mathematical study and discourse. Consequently the approach here is designed to match the observed progress. The contents are intended to provide graduate and ad vanced undergraduate students as well as the general mathematical public with a modern treatment of some theorems and examples that constitute a rounding out and elaboration of the standard parts of algebra, analysis, geometry, logic, probability, set theory, and topology. The items included are presented in the spirit of a conversation among mathematicians who know the language but are interested in some of the ramifications of the subjects with which they routinely deal. Although such an approach might be construed as demanding, there is an extensive GLOSSARY jlNDEX where all but the most familiar notions are clearly defined and explained.

The Mathematics of Sonya Kovalevskaya,R. Cooke,Springer Science & Business Media,1984-11-12,"This book is the result of a decision taken in 1980 to begin studying the history of mathematics in the nineteenth century. I hoped by doing it to learn some thing of value about Kovalevskaya herself and about the mathematical world she inhabited. Having been trained as a mathematician, I also hoped to learn something about the proper approach to the history of the subject. The decision to begin the study with Kovalevskaya, apart from the intrinsic interest of Kovalevskaya herself, was primarily based upon the fact that the writing on her in English had been done by people who were interested in sociological and psychological aspects of her life. None of these writings discussed her mathematical work in much detail. This omission seemed to me a serious one in biographical studies of a woman whose primary significance was her mathematical work. In regard to both the content of nineteenth century mathematics and the nature of the history of mathematics I learned a great deal from writing this book. The attempt to put Kovalevskaya's work in historical context involved reading dozens of significant papers by great mathematicians. In many cases, I fear, the purport of these papers is better known to many of my readers than to me. If I persevered despite misgivings, my excuse is that this book is, after all, primarily about Kovalevskaya. If specialists in Euler, Cauchy, etc.",Language Arts & Disciplines,264,N/A,0,en

Here the focus is on the development of measure and integration theory, differentiation and integration, Hilbert spaces, and Hausdorff measure and fractals. This book reflects the objective of the series as a whole: to make plain the organic unity that exists between the various parts of the subject, and to illustrate the wide applicability of ideas of analysis to other fields of mathematics and science. After setting forth the basic facts of measure theory, Lebesgue integration, and differentiation on Euclidian spaces, the authors move to the elements of Hilbert space, via the L2 theory. They next present basic illustrations of these concepts from Fourier analysis, partial differential equations, and complex analysis. The final part of the book introduces the reader to the fascinating subject of fractional-dimensional sets, including Hausdorff measure, self-replicating sets, space-filling curves, and Besicovitch sets. Each chapter has a series of exercises, from the relatively easy to the more complex, that are tied directly to the text.

Classical Mathematics from Al-Khwarizmi to Descartes,Roshdi Rashed,Routledge,2014-08-21,"This book follows the development of classical mathematics and the relation between work done in the Arab and Islamic worlds and that undertaken by the likes of Descartes and Fermat. ‘Early modern,’ mathematics is a term widely used to refer to the mathematics which developed in the West during the sixteenth and seventeenth century. For many historians and philosophers this is the watershed which marks a radical departure from ‘classical mathematics,’ to more modern mathematics; heralding the arrival of algebra, geometrical algebra, and the mathematics of the continuous. In this book, Roshdi Rashed demonstrates that ‘early modern,’ mathematics is actually far more composite than previously assumed, with each branch having different traceable origins which span the millennium. Going back to the beginning of these parts, the aim of this book is to identify the concepts and practices of key figures in their development, thereby presenting a fuller reality of these mathematics. This book will be of interest to students and scholars specialising in Islamic science and mathematics, as well as to those with an interest in the more general history of science and mathematics and the transmission of ideas and culture.",History,768,N/A,0,en

Introduction to Numerical Analysis,"J. Stoer, R. Bulirsch",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-03-09,"On the occasion of this new edition, the text was enlarged by several new sections. Two sections on B-splines and their computation were added to the chapter on spline functions: Due to their special properties, their flexibility, and the availability of well-tested programs for their computation, B-splines play an important role in many applications. Also, the authors followed suggestions by many readers to supplement the chapter on elimination methods with a section dealing with the solution of large sparse systems of linear equations. Even though such systems are usually solved by iterative methods, the realm of elimination methods has been widely extended due to powerful techniques for handling sparse matrices. We will explain some of these techniques in connection with the Cholesky algorithm for solving positive definite linear systems. The chapter on eigenvalue problems was enlarged by a section on the Lanczos algorithm; the sections on the LR and QR algorithm were rewritten and now contain a description of implicit shift techniques.

Vertex Operator Algebras in Mathematics and Physics,Stephen Berman,American Mathematical Soc.,2003,"Vertex operator algebras are a class of algebras underlying a number of recent constructions, results, and themes in mathematics. These algebras can be understood as ''string-theoretic analogues'' of Lie algebras and of commutative associative algebras. They play fundamental roles in some of the most active research areas in mathematics and physics. Much recent progress in both physics and mathematics has benefited from cross-pollination between the physical and mathematical points of view. This book presents the proceedings from the workshop, ''Vertex Operator Algebras in Mathematics and Physics'', held at The Fields Institute. It consists of papers based on many of the talks given at the conference by leading experts in the algebraic, geometric, and physical aspects of vertex operator algebra theory. The book is suitable for graduate students and research mathematicians interested in the major themes and important developments on the frontier of research in vertex operator algebra theory and its applications in mathematics and physics.",Mathematics,265,N/A,0,en

Abelian Groups,László Fuchs,Springer,2015-12-12,"Written by one of the subject’s foremost experts, this book focuses on the central developments and modern methods of the advanced theory of abelian groups, while remaining accessible, as an introduction and reference, to the non-specialist. It provides a coherent source for results scattered throughout the research literature with lots of new proofs. The presentation highlights major trends that have radically changed the modern character of the subject, in particular, the use of homological methods in the structure theory of various classes of abelian groups, and the use of advanced set-theoretical methods in the study of un decidability problems. The treatment of the latter trend includes Shelah’s seminal work on the un decidability in ZFC of Whitehead’s Problem; while the treatment of the former trend includes an extensive (but non-exhaustive) study of p-groups, torsion-free groups, mixed groups and important classes of groups arising from ring theory. To prepare the reader to tackle these topics, the book reviews the fundamentals of abelian group theory and provides some background material from category theory, set theory, topology and homological algebra. An abundance of exercises are included to test the reader’s comprehension, and to explore noteworthy extensions and related sidelines of the main topics. A list of open problems and questions, in each chapter, invite the reader to take an active part in the subject’s further development.",Mathematics,762,N/A,0,en

Non-cognitive Skills and Factors in Educational Attainment,"Myint Swe Khine, Shaljan Areepattamannil",Springer,2016-07-28,"This volume addresses questions that lie at the core of research into education. It examines the way in which the institutional embeddedness and the social and ethnic composition of students affect educational performance, skill formation, and behavioral outcomes. It discusses the manner in which educational institutions accomplish social integration. It poses the question of whether they can reduce social inequality, – or whether they even facilitate the transformation of heterogeneity into social inequality. Divided into five parts, the volume offers new insights into the many factors, processes and policies that affect performance levels and social inequality in educational institutions. It presents current empirical work on social processes in educational institutions and their outcomes. While its main focus is on the primary and secondary level of education and on occupational training, the book also presents analyses of institutional effects on transitions from vocational training into tertiary educational institutions in an interdisciplinary and internationally comparative approach.",Education,437,N/A,0,en

Effectiveness of Time Investments in Education,Jaap Scheerens,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-08-15,"This book analyzes the productivity and effectiveness of a variety of time investments in education. It explores the methods used in education to optimize the time that students are exposed to learning content. Such methods include expanding official school time, optimizing “time on task”, providing homework assignments, and creating learning opportunities beyond lesson hours. The book presents a review of earlier reviews and meta-analyses, secondary analyses of international data sets, and new meta-analyses concerning the effects of instruction time, homework and extended learning, beyond official school time. It explores the concept of time as a condition to enhance student achievement and discusses methodological issues in separating “genuine” time effects from related facets of educational quality. The book shows that the dependence of time effects on the quality of content choice and delivery raises critical questions for both researchers and policy planners. It further shows that sophisticated research designs are required to properly assess time effects, and that policy makers should be concerned about the bluntness of time as an instrument to enhance educational productivity.",Education,160,N/A,0,en

Undergraduate Mathematics for the Life Sciences,"Glenn Ledder, Jenna P. Carpenter, Timothy D. Comar",MAA,2013,"There is a gap between the extensive mathematics background that is beneficial to biologists and the minimal mathematics background biology students acquire in their courses. The result is an undergraduate education in biology with very little quantitative content. New mathematics courses must be devised with the needs of biology students in mind. In this volume, authors from a variety of institutions address some of the problems involved in reforming mathematics curricula for biology students. The problems are sorted into three themes: Models, Processes, and Directions. It is difficult for mathematicians to generate curriculum ideas for the training of biologists so a number of the curriculum models that have been introduced at various institutions comprise the Models section. Processes deals with taking that great course and making sure it is institutionalized in both the biology department (as a requirement) and in the mathematics department (as a course that will live on even if the creator of the course is no longer on the faculty).

Advances in Experimental Philosophy of Logic and Mathematics,"Andrew Aberdein, Matthew Inglis",Bloomsbury Publishing,2019-05-02,"This book explores the results of applying empirical methods to the philosophy of logic and mathematics. Much of the work that has earned experimental philosophy a prominent place in twenty-first century philosophy is concerned with ethics or epistemology. But, as this book shows, empirical methods are just as much at home in logic and the philosophy of mathematics. Chapters demonstrate and discuss the applicability of a wide range of empirical methods including experiments, surveys, interviews, and data-mining. Distinct themes emerge that reflect recent developments in the field, such as issues concerning the logic of conditionals and the role played by visual elements in some mathematical proofs. Featuring leading figures from experimental philosophy and the fields of philosophy of logic and mathematics, this collection reveals that empirical work in these disciplines has been quietly thriving for some time and stresses the importance of collaboration between philosophers and researchers in mathematics education and mathematical cognition.",Philosophy,293,N/A,0,en

About the Strong Sylow p-Theorem in Simple Locally Finite Groups - Part 2 of a Trilogy,Dipl.-Math. Felix F. Flemisch,BoD – Books on Demand,2023-11-22,"Part 2 of the Trilogy ""Characterising Locally Finite Groups Satisfying the Strong Sylow Theorem for the Prime p"" & ""About the Strong Sylow Theorem for the Prime p in Simple Locally Finite Groups"" & ""The Strong Sylow Theorem for the Prime p in Projective Special Linear Locally Finite Groups"" is based on the author's research paper ""About the Strong Sylow Theorem for the Prime p in Simple Locally Finite Groups"". This very beautiful and pioneering manuscript had been submitted for peer reviewing to the open access journals Advances in Group Theory and Applications (AGTA) (see https://www.advgrouptheory.com/ journal/) and Science Research Association (SCIREA) Journal of Mathematics (see https://www.scirea.org/ journal/Mathematics) but was very regrettably rejected by both of them (with ridiculous arguments). We first give a profound overview of the structure of simple groups and in particular of the simple locally finite groups and reduce their Sylow theory for the prime p to a famous conjecture of Prof. Otto H. Kegel (see [16], Theorem 2.4: ""Let the p-subgroup P be a p-uniqueness subgroup in the finite simple group S which belongs to one of the seven rank-unbounded families. Then the rank of S is bounded in terms of P."") about the rank-unbounded ones of the 19 known families of finite simple groups. Part 2 introduces a new scheme to describe the 19 families, the family T of types, defines the rank of each type, and emphasises the rôle of Kegel covers. This part presents a unified picture of known results all proofs of which are by reference and it is the actual reason why our title starts with ""About"". We then apply beautiful new ideas to prove the conjecture for the alternating groups (see Page ii). Thereupon we are remembering Kegel covers and *-sequences. Finally we suggest a plan how to prove and even how to optimise the conjecture step-by-step or peu à peu which leads to further quite tough conjectures thereby unifying Sylow theory in locally finite simple groups with Sylow theory in locally finite and p-soluble groups. For any unexplained terminology we refer to [6].",Mathematics,26,N/A,0,en

This is a very hands-on approach and requires only basic knowledge of linear algebra. The main tool for describing the representation theory of a finite-dimensional algebra is its Auslander-Reiten quiver, and the text introduces these quivers as early as possible. Part II then uses the language of algebras and modules to build on the material developed before. The equivalence of the two approaches is proved in the text.

Executive Function and Education," Mariëtte Huizinga, Dieter Baeyens, Jacob A. Burack",Frontiers Media SA,2018-09-21,"Executive function is an umbrella term for various cognitive processes that are central to goal-directed behavior, thoughts, and emotions. These processes are especially important in novel or demanding situations, which require a rapid and flexible adjustment of behavior to the changing demands of the environment. The development of executive function relies on the maturation of associated brain regions as well as on stimulation in the child’s social contexts, especially the home and school. Over the past decade, the term executive function has become a buzzword in the field of education as both researchers and educators underscore the importance of skills like goal setting, planning, and organizing in academic success. Accordingly, in initiating this Research Topic and eBook our goal was to provide a forum for state-of-the-art theoretical and empirical work on this that both facilitates communication among researchers from diverse fields and provides a theoretically sound source of information for educators. The contributors to this volume, who hail from several different countries in Europe and North America, have certainly accomplished this goal in their nuanced and cutting-edge depictions of the complex links among various executive function components and educational success.",,184,N/A,0,en

Experimental Psychology: Quantitative experiments: pt. 1. Students' manual. pt. 2. Instructor's manual,Edward Bradford Titchener,N/A,1905,"The general purpose with which this book has been written is sufficiently indicated by its title. I have selected a number of the 'classical' experiments of Experimental Psychology, and have tried to present them in such a way that their performance shall have a real disciplinary value for the undergraduate student. Within this general purpose, my aim has been two-fold. I have sought to show, in the first place, that psychology is above the laboratory: that we employ our instruments of precision not for their own sake, but solely because they help us to a refined and more accurate introspection. And secondly, just as in my Outline of Psychology and Primer of Psychology I gave the results of experimentation a prominent place in the psychological system, so here I have treated the selected experiments not as separate exercises, but as points of departure for systematic discussion.

Unknown Quantity,John Derbyshire,National Academies Press,2006-06-02,"Prime Obsession taught us not to be afraid to put the math in a math book. Unknown Quantity heeds the lesson well. So grab your graphing calculators, slip out the slide rules, and buckle up! John Derbyshire is introducing us to algebra through the ages-and it promises to be just what his die-hard fans have been waiting for. ""Here is the story of algebra."" With this deceptively simple introduction, we begin our journey. Flanked by formulae, shadowed by roots and radicals, escorted by an expert who navigates unerringly on our behalf, we are guaranteed safe passage through even the most treacherous mathematical terrain. Our first encounter with algebraic arithmetic takes us back 38 centuries to the time of Abraham and Isaac, Jacob and Joseph, Ur and Haran, Sodom and Gomorrah. Moving deftly from Abel's proof to the higher levels of abstraction developed by Galois, we are eventually introduced to what algebraists have been focusing on during the last century. As we travel through the ages, it becomes apparent that the invention of algebra was more than the start of a specific discipline of mathematics-it was also the birth of a new way of thinking that clarified both basic numeric concepts as well as our perception of the world around us. Algebraists broke new ground when they discarded the simple search for solutions to equations and concentrated instead on abstract groups. This dramatic shift in thinking revolutionized mathematics. Written for those among us who are unencumbered by a fear of formulae, Unknown Quantity delivers on its promise to present a history of algebra. Astonishing in its bold presentation of the math and graced with narrative authority, our journey through the world of algebra is at once intellectually satisfying and pleasantly challenging.",Science,391,3,1,en
Prospective Mathematics Teachers’ Knowledge of Algebra,Rongjin Huang,Springer Science & Business Media,2014-03-20,"Rongjin Huang examines teachers’ knowledge of algebra for teaching, with a particular focus on teaching the concept of function and quadratic relations in China and the United States. 376 Chinese and 115 U.S.A. prospective middle and high school mathematics teachers participated in this survey. Based on an extensive quantitative and qualitative data analysis the author comes to the following conclusions: The Chinese participants demonstrate a stronger knowledge of algebra for teaching and the Chinese participants’ structure of knowledge of algebra for teaching is much more interconnected. Chinese participants show flexibility in choosing appropriate perspectives of the function concept and in selecting multiple representations. Finally, the number of college mathematics and mathematics education courses taken impacts the teachers’ knowledge of algebra for teaching.",Education,196,N/A,0,en

Complex Analysis,"Elias M. Stein, Rami Shakarchi",Princeton University Press,2010-04-22,"With this second volume, we enter the intriguing world of complex analysis. From the first theorems on, the elegance and sweep of the results is evident. The starting point is the simple idea of extending a function initially given for real values of the argument to one that is defined when the argument is complex. From there, one proceeds to the main properties of holomorphic functions, whose proofs are generally short and quite illuminating: the Cauchy theorems, residues, analytic continuation, the argument principle. With this background, the reader is ready to learn a wealth of additional material connecting the subject with other areas of mathematics: the Fourier transform treated by contour integration, the zeta function and the prime number theorem, and an introduction to elliptic functions culminating in their application to combinatorics and number theory. Thoroughly developing a subject with many ramifications, while striking a careful balance between conceptual insights and the technical underpinnings of rigorous analysis, Complex Analysis will be welcomed by students of mathematics, physics, engineering and other sciences. The Princeton Lectures in Analysis represents a sustained effort to introduce the core areas of mathematical analysis while also illustrating the organic unity between them. Numerous examples and applications throughout its four planned volumes, of which Complex Analysis is the second, highlight the far-reaching consequences of certain ideas in analysis to other fields of mathematics and a variety of sciences. Stein and Shakarchi move from an introduction addressing Fourier series and integrals to in-depth considerations of complex analysis; measure and integration theory, and Hilbert spaces; and, finally, further topics such as functional analysis, distributions and elements of probability theory.",Mathematics,398,5,1,en

Advances in Nature of Science Research,Myint Swe Khine,Springer Science & Business Media,2011-09-18,"This book consolidates contemporary thinking and research efforts in teaching and learning about the nature of science in science education. The term ‘Nature of Science’ (NoS) has appeared in the science education literature for many decades. While there is still a controversy among science educators about what constitutes NoS, educators are unanimous in acknowledging the importance of this topic as well as the need to make it explicit in teaching science. The general consensus is that the nature of science is an intricate and multifaceted theme that requires continued scholarship. Recent analysis of research trends in science education indicates that investigation of the nature of science continues to be one of the most prevalent topics in academic publications. Advances in Nature of Science Research explores teaching and assessing the nature of science as a means of addressing and solving problems in conceptual change, developing positive attitudes toward science, promoting thinking habits, advancing inquiry skills and preparing citizens literate in science and technology. The book brings together prominent scholars in the field to share their cutting-edge knowledge about the place of the nature of science in science teaching and learning contexts.

Family-School Links,"Alan Booth, Judith F. Dunn",Routledge,2013-10-31,"Based on the presentations and discussions from a national symposium on family-school links held at the Pennsylvania State University, this volume brings together psychologists, sociologists, educators, and policymakers studying the bidirectional effects between schools and families. This topic -- the links between families and schools, and how these affect children's educational achievement -- encompasses a host of questions, each of key social and educational significance. * How far does parental involvement in schools affect children's experiences and achievement at school? * What explains the great differences between schools, families, and communities in the extent of such involvement? * Are these differences a matter of school practices, or do they reflect much broader social and cultural divisions? * What is the nature of the impact schools have on children and their families? * How can family-school-partnerships be fostered in a way that helps children? The chapter authors consider these questions and related issues, present different perspectives, highlight various aspects of the issues, and suggest widely differing answers. This volume's goal is to provide the reader with current information on what is known about family-school-community links, and to provoke new ways of thinking about these links and their implications for children's education and well-being.",Psychology,315,N/A,0,en
R Programming and Its Applications in Financial Mathematics,"Shuichi Ohsaki, Jori Ruppert-Felsot, Daisuke Yoshikawa",CRC Press,2018-01-31,"This book provides an introduction to R programming and a summary of financial mathematics. It is not always easy for graduate students to grasp an overview of the theory of finance in an abstract form. For newcomers to the finance industry, it is not always obvious how to apply the abstract theory to the real financial data they encounter. Introducing finance theory alongside numerical applications makes it easier to grasp the subject. Popular programming languages like C++, which are used in many financial applications are meant for general-purpose requirements. They are good for implementing large-scale distributed systems for simultaneously valuing many financial contracts, but they are not as suitable for small-scale ad-hoc analysis or exploration of financial data. The R programming language overcomes this problem. R can be used for numerical applications including statistical analysis, time series analysis, numerical methods for pricing financial contracts, etc. This book provides an overview of financial mathematics with numerous examples numerically illustrated using the R programming language.",Business & Economics,259,N/A,0,en

Morse Theory,John Willard Milnor,Princeton University Press,1963,"One of the most cited books in mathematics, John Milnor's exposition of Morse theory has been the most important book on the subject for more than forty years. Morse theory was developed in the 1920s by mathematician Marston Morse. (Morse was on the faculty of the Institute for Advanced Study, and Princeton published his Topological Methods in the Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable in the Annals of Mathematics Studies series in 1947.) One classical application of Morse theory includes the attempt to understand, with only limited information, the large-scale structure of an object. This kind of problem occurs in mathematical physics, dynamic systems, and mechanical engineering. Morse theory has received much attention in the last two decades as a result of a famous paper in which theoretical physicist Edward Witten relates Morse theory to quantum field theory. Milnor was awarded the Fields Medal (the mathematical equivalent of a Nobel Prize) in 1962 for his work in differential topology. He has since received the National Medal of Science (1967) and the Steele Prize from the American Mathematical Society twice (1982 and 2004) in recognition of his explanations of mathematical concepts across a wide range of scienti.c disciplines. The citation reads, ""The phrase sublime elegance is rarely associated with mathematical exposition, but it applies to all of Milnor's writings.

Large Networks and Graph Limits,László Lovász,American Mathematical Soc.,2012,"Recently, it became apparent that a large number of the most interesting structures and phenomena of the world can be described by networks. To develop a mathematical theory of very large networks is an important challenge. This book describes one recent approach to this theory, the limit theory of graphs, which has emerged over the last decade. The theory has rich connections with other approaches to the study of large networks, such as ``property testing'' in computer science and regularity partition in graph theory. It has several applications in extremal graph theory, including the exact formulations and partial answers to very general questions, such as which problems in extremal graph theory are decidable. It also has less obvious connections with other parts of mathematics (classical and non-classical, like probability theory, measure theory, tensor algebras, and semidefinite optimization). This book explains many of these connections, first at an informal level to emphasize the need to apply more advanced mathematical methods, and then gives an exact development of the theory of the algebraic theory of graph homomorphisms and of the analytic theory of graph limits. This is an amazing book: readable, deep, and lively. It sets out this emerging area, makes connections between old classical graph theory and graph limits, and charts the course of the future. --Persi Diaconis, Stanford University This book is a comprehensive study of the active topic of graph limits and an updated account of its present status.

How Mathematics Happened,Peter S. Rudman,Prometheus Books,2009-12-30,"In this fascinating discussion of ancient mathematics, author Peter Rudman does not just chronicle the archeological record of what mathematics was done; he digs deeper into the more important question of why it was done in a particular way. Why did the Egyptians use a bizarre method of expressing fractions? Why did the Babylonians use an awkward number system based on multiples of 60? Rudman answers such intriguing questions, arguing that some mathematical thinking is universal and timeless. The similarity of the Babylonian and Mayan number systems, two cultures widely separated in time and space, illustrates the argument. He then traces the evolution of number systems from finger counting in hunter-gatherer cultures to pebble counting in herder-farmer cultures of the Nile and Tigris-Euphrates valleys, which defined the number systems that continued to be used even after the invention of writing. With separate chapters devoted to the remarkable Egyptian and Babylonian mathematics of the era from about 3500 to 2000 BCE, when all of the basic arithmetic operations and even quadratic algebra became doable, Rudman concludes his interpretation of the archeological record. Since some of the mathematics formerly credited to the Greeks is now known to be a prior Babylonian invention, Rudman adds a chapter that discusses the math used by Pythagoras, Eratosthenes, and Hippasus, which has Babylonian roots, illustrating the watershed difference in abstraction and rigor that the Greeks introduced. He also suggests that we might improve present-day teaching by taking note of how the Greeks taught math.

Middleton, Amanda Jansen, Gerald A Goldin",Springer,2016-06-14,"This book records the state of the art in research on mathematics-related affect. It discusses the concepts and theories of mathematics-related affect along the lines of three dimensions. The first dimension identifies three broad categories of affect: motivation, emotions, and beliefs. The book contains one chapter on motivation, including discussions on how emotions and beliefs relate to motivation. There are two chapters that focus on beliefs and a chapter on attitude which cross-cuts through all these categories. The second dimension covers a rapidly fluctuating state to a more stable trait. All chapters in the book focus on trait-type affect and the chapter on motivation discusses both these dimensions. The third dimension regards the three main levels of theorizing: physiological (embodied), psychological (individual) and social. All chapters reflect that mathematics-related affect has mainly been studied using psychological theories.",Education,42,N/A,0,en

Mathematics++,"Ida Kantor,  Jiří Matoušek, Robert Šámal",American Mathematical Soc.,2015-08-27,"Mathematics++ is a concise introduction to six selected areas of 20th century mathematics providing numerous modern mathematical tools used in contemporary research in computer science, engineering, and other fields. The areas are: measure theory, high-dimensional geometry, Fourier analysis, representations of groups, multivariate polynomials, and topology. For each of the areas, the authors introduce basic notions, examples, and results. The presentation is clear and accessible, stressing intuitive understanding, and it includes carefully selected exercises as an integral part. Theory is complemented by applications--some quite surprising--in theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics. The chapters are independent of one another and can be studied in any order. It is assumed that the reader has gone through the basic mathematics courses. Although the book was conceived while the authors were teaching Ph.D. students in theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics, it will be useful for a much wider audience, such as mathematicians specializing in other areas, mathematics students deciding what specialization to pursue, or experts in engineering or other fields.",Mathematics,359,N/A,0,en

The Mathematics of Everyday Life,"Alfred S. Posamentier, Christian Spreitzer",Prometheus Books,2018-08-21,"Two experienced math educators help the average reader discover not only the everyday usefulness of math but the fun that comes from mastering the basics of arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and more. If you think of mathematics as a series of pointless classroom exercises without much relevance to real life, this book will change your mind. As the authors show, math is deeply embedded in almost every aspect of daily life--from managing your personal finances, making consumer purchases, and sharpening your computational skills, to learning to apply mathematical concepts that will give you a better grasp of both ordinary and extraordinary events and help you better appreciate the world we live in. With some basic geometry under your belt, you'll discover that there is an optimal point on a soccer field from which to shoot a goal. And you'll be more clever with the gears of a bike. If you like to play cards or go to the casino, knowing something about probability will give you an edge. You'll also have an enhanced understanding of the ""whispering effect"" inside the Capitol rotunda, why a car's headlights are so bright, and even why sewer covers are round. After reading this entertaining and instructive book, you'll come away with a whole new awareness of how elegantly mathematics explains everyday experiences and observations--from present day items to classical art and architecture.",Mathematics,309,N/A,0,en

Introduction to the Mathematics of Finance,Ruth J. Williams,American Mathematical Soc.,2006,"The modern subject of mathematical finance has undergone considerable development, both in theory and practice, since the seminal work of Black and Scholes appeared a third of a century ago. This book is intended as an introduction to some elements of the theory that will enable students and researchers to go on to read more advanced texts and research papers. The book begins with the development of the basic ideas of hedging and pricing of European and American derivatives in thediscrete (i.e., discrete time and discrete state) setting of binomial tree models. Then a general discrete finite market model is introduced, and the fundamental theorems of asset pricing are proved in this setting. Tools from probability such as conditional expectation, filtration, (super)martingale,equivalent martingale measure, and martingale representation are all used first in this simple discrete framework. This provides a bridge to the continuous (time and state) setting, which requires the additional concepts of Brownian motion and stochastic calculus. The simplest model in the continuous setting is the famous Black-Scholes model, for which pricing and hedging of European and American derivatives are developed. The book concludes with a description of the fundamental theorems for acontinuous market model that generalizes the simple Black-Scholes model in several direct",Business & Economics,162,N/A,0,en

Transforming Mathematics Instruction,"Yeping Li, Edward A. Silver, Shiqi Li",Springer,2014-07-05,"This book surveys and examines different approaches and practices that contribute to the changes in mathematics instruction, including (1) innovative approaches that bring direct changes in classroom instructional practices, (2) curriculum reforms that introduce changes in content and requirements in classroom instruction, and (3) approaches in mathematics teacher education that aim to improve teachers’ expertise and practices. It also surveys relevant theory and methodology development in studying and assessing mathematics instruction. Classroom instruction is commonly seen as one of the key factors contributing to students’ learning of mathematics, but much remains to be understood about teachers’ instructional practices that lead to the development and enactment of effective classroom instruction, and approaches and practices developed and used to transform classroom instruction in different education systems. Transforming Mathematics Instruction is organized to help readers learn not only from reading individual chapters, but also from reading across chapters and sections to explore broader themes, including: - Identifying what is important in mathematics for teaching and learning emphasized in different approaches; - Exploring how students’ learning is considered and facilitated through different approaches and practices; - Understanding the nature of various approaches that are valued in different systems and cultural contexts; - Probing culturally valued approaches in identifying and evaluating effective instructional practices. The book brings new research and insights into multiple approaches and practices for transforming mathematics instruction to the international community of mathematics education, with 25 chapters and four section prefaces contributed by 56 scholars from 10 different education systems. This rich collection is indispensable reading for mathematics educators, researchers, teacher educators, curriculum developers, and graduate students interested in learning about different instructional practices, approaches for instructional transformation, and research in different education systems. It will help readers to reflect on approaches and practices that are useful for instructional changes in their own education systems, and also inspire them to identify and further explore new areas of research and program development in improving mathematics teaching and learning.",Education,581,N/A,0,en

The position paper states it is critical that mathematics teacher educators: “Model equity?based pedagogy that emphasizes rich and rigorous mathematics; elicit and build on children’s and young adults’ mathematical thinking; connect to P?12 students’ cultural/linguistic knowledge and backgrounds as well as individual interests; facilitate mathematical discourse; minimize status issues by expanding broader participation and engagement where varied mathematical strengths are valued; and promote positive mathematical identity and agency (p. 2)”. Cases for Mathematics Teacher Educators: Facilitating Conversations about Inequities in Mathematics Classrooms provides an excellent resource to start conversations describing the enactment of these actions. The book is organized into three main sections: (1) Conversations About Inequities in Mathematics Methods Courses, (2) Conversations About Inequities in Mathematics Content Courses, and (3) Conversations about Inequities in Graduate and Professional Development Contexts. Across these sections there are 19 cases and 57 corresponding commentaries focused on dilemmas that arise when mathematics teacher educators foreground equity in their work. This book of cases provides a needed resource for MTEs to engage prospective teachers, practicing teachers, and future teacher educators in discussions about inequities, privilege, and oppression in society, in schools, and in the mathematics classroom.

"Visualization in Mathematics, Reading and Science Education","Linda M. Phillips, Stephen P. Norris, John S. Macnab",Springer Science & Business Media,2010-09-02,"Science education at school level worldwide faces three perennial problems that have become more pressing of late. These are to a considerable extent interwoven with concerns about the entire school curriculum and its reception by students. The rst problem is the increasing intellectual isolation of science from the other subjects in the school curriculum. Science is too often still taught didactically as a collection of pre-determined truths about which there can be no dispute. As a con- quence, many students do not feel any “ownership” of these ideas. Most other school subjects do somewhat better in these regards. For example, in language classes, s- dents suggest different interpretations of a text and then debate the relative merits of the cases being put forward. Moreover, ideas that are of use in science are presented to students elsewhere and then re-taught, often using different terminology, in s- ence. For example, algebra is taught in terms of “x, y, z” in mathematics classes, but students are later unable to see the relevance of that to the meaning of the universal gas laws in physics, where “p, v, t” are used. The result is that students are c- fused and too often alienated, leading to their failure to achieve that “extraction of an education from a scheme of instruction” which Jerome Bruner thought so highly desirable.",Science,112,N/A,0,en

Mathematics in Society and History,Sal P. Restivo,Springer Science & Business Media,1992-11-30,"This is the first book by a sociologist devoted exclusively to a general sociology of mathematics. The author provides examples of different ways of thinking about mathematics sociologically. The survey of mathematical traditions covers ancient China, the Arabic-Islamic world, India, and Europe. Following the leads of classical social theorists such as Emile Durkheim, Restivo develops the idea that mathematical concepts and ideas are collective representations, and that it is mathematical communities that create mathematics, not individual mathematicians. The implications of the sociology of mathematics, and especially of pure mathematics, for a sociology of mind are also explored. In general, the author's objective is to explore, conjecture, suggest, and stimulate in order to introduce the sociological perspective on mathematics, and to broaden and deepen the still narrow, shallow path that today carries the sociology of mathematics.

Introductory Mathematics: Applications and Methods,Gordon S. Marshall,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This book is aimed at undergraduate students embarking on the first year of a modular mathematics degree course. It is a self-contained textbook making it ideally suited to distance learning and a useful reference source for courses with the traditional lecture/tutorial structure. The theoretical content is firmly based but the principal focus is on techniques and applications. The important aims and objectives are presented clearly and then reinforced using complete worked solutions within the text. There is a natural increase in difficulty and understanding as each chapter progresses, always building upon the basic elements. It is assumed that the reader has studied elementary calculus at Advanced level and is at least familiar with the concept of function and has been exposed to basic differentiation and integration techniques. Although these are covered in the book they are presented as a refresher course to jog the student's memory rather than to introduce the topic for the first time. The early chapters cover the topics of matrix algebra, vector algebra and com plex numbers in sufficient depth for the student to feel comfortable -when they reappear later in the book. Subsequent chapters then build upon the student's 'A' level knowledge in the area of real variable calculus, including partial differentiation and mUltiple inte grals. The concluding chapter on differential equations motivates the student's learning by consideration of applications taken from both physical and eco nomic contexts.",Mathematics,233,N/A,0,en

The Joy of Mathematics,"Alfred S. Posamentier, Robert Geretschlager",Rowman & Littlefield,2017-08-22,"Wouldn't it be great if all school teachers (from kindergarten through high school) would share the joy of mathematics with their students, rather than focus only on the prescribed curriculum that will subsequently be tested? This book reveals some of the wonders of mathematics that are often missing from classrooms. Here's your chance to catch up with the math gems you may have missed. Using jargon-free language and many illustrations, the authors—all veteran math educators—explore five areas—arithmetic, algebra, geometry, probability, and the ways in which mathematics can reinforce common sense. Among other things, you'll learn ""the rule of 72,"" which enables you to quickly determine how long it will take your bank account to double its value at a specific interest rate. Other handy techniques include an automatic algorithm for multiplying numbers mentally and a clever application that will allow you to convert from miles to kilometers (or the reverse) mentally. A delightful presentation of geometric novelties reveals relationships that could have made your study of geometry more fun and enlightening. In the area of probability there is a host of interesting examples: from the famous Monty-Hall problem to the counterintuitive probability of two people having the same birthday in a crowded room. Finally, the authors demonstrate how math will make you a better thinker by improving your organizing abilities and providing useful and surprising solutions to common mathematics problems. You'll come away with an appreciation for math you never thought possible and a true appreciation for this ""queen of the sciences.""",Mathematics,252,N/A,0,en

Theory of Deductive Systems and Its Applications,Sergeĭ I︠U︡rʹevich Maslov,MIT Press (MA),1987,"In a fluent, clear, and lively style this translation by two of Maslov's junior colleagues brings the work of the late Soviet scientist S. Yu. Maslov to a wider audience. Maslov was considered by his peers to be a man of genius who was making fundamental contributions in the fields of automatic theorem proving and computational logic. He published little, and those few papers were regarded as notoriously difficult. This book, however, was written for a broad audience of readers and describes elegant examples of applications in such fields as computer science, artificial intelligence, operations research, economic modeling, and biological modeling, among others. The book also brings to light the work by the American mathematician E. L. Post, which inspired Maslov's own work in the development of a general theory and which has been long neglected by mathematicial logicians and systems theorists in the United States. The book's first chapter introduces the Rules of the Game. Part I, Mathematics of Calculi, covers E. L. Post's canonical systems, deductive systems and algorithms, and probabilistic calculi and deductive information. Part II, Horizonal Modeling, takes up a ""toy"" economy, the calculi of technological possibilities, and the development of rules. Part III, Vertical Modeling, deals with the topics of ""to fight and to search"" and the consequences of the asymmetry of cognitive mechanisms.

Exemplary Practices for Secondary Math Teachers,"Alfred S. Posamentier, Daniel Jaye",ASCD,2007-03-15,"Every year new secondary mathematics teachers take up positions in middle and high schools. The luckiest novices receive assistance from a coach or mentor: a master mathematics teacher who makes constructive comments, models effective approaches, and illuminates other practical aspects of teaching secondary math. But many new teachers don't have this advantage and must further their development on their own. If you are one of these teachers, this is the book you need. In these pages, veteran mathematics educators Alfred S. Posamentier, Daniel Jaye, and Stephen Krulik present a treasure chest of ideas to guide new secondary math teachers through the challenging first few months and also provide more experienced teachers with interesting alternatives to familiar methods. The topics covered include * The most effective instructional practices * The best uses of the textbook * Designing successful lessons * Creating homework that promotes learning * Incorporating challenge * Teaching reasoning and problem solving * Strategies for assessment and grading * Specific innovative ideas for teaching key concepts * Options for extracurricular activities * Long-term professional enrichment and growth.

Mathematics Education at Highly Effective Schools That Serve the Poor,"Richard S. Kitchen, Julie DePree, Sylvia Celed¢n-Pattichis, Jonathan Brinkerhoff",Routledge,2017-09-25,"This book presents research findings about school-level and district-level practices and successful strategies employed in mathematics education by highly effective schools that serve high-poverty communities. It includes both the theory and practice of creating highly effective schools in these communities. In 2002 nine schools were selected in a national competition to participate in the Hewlett-Packard High Achieving Grant Initiative. As part of this Initiative, these schools participated in the research study this book reports. The study employed both qualitative and quantitative methodologies to examine school- and classroom-level factors that contributed to high achievement, particularly in mathematics. The goals of the study were twofold: 1) to investigate the salient characteristics of the highly effective schools in which the research was conducted, and 2) to explore participating teachers’ conceptions and practices about mathematics curriculum, instruction, and assessment. The schools described have much to teach about creating powerful learning environments that empower all students to learn challenging mathematics. Given the pressures of the accountability measures of the No Child Left Behind legislation, this book is extremely timely for those seeking school models that serve high-poverty communities and have demonstrated high performance on high-stakes examinations and other assessments.

Topics In Contemporary Mathematical Physics (Second Edition),Kai S Lam,World Scientific Publishing Company,2015-09-17,"This new (second) edition contains a general treatment of quantum field theory (QFT) in a simple scalar field setting in addition to the modern material on the applications of differential geometry and topology, group theory, and the theory of linear operators to physics found in the first edition. All these are introduced without assuming more background on the part of the reader than a good foundation in undergraduate (junior) level mathematical physics. The new material entirely focuses on an introduction to quantum field theory, emphasizing the Feynman path (functional integral) approach to QFT and the renormalization group. With respect to the latter, the focus is on an introduction of its application to critical phenomena in statistical physics, following the outgrowth of the Callan-Symanzik equation originally developed in the context of high energy physics, and the seminal contributions of Kenneth Wilson. One of the overriding aims of the new material is also to draw students' attention to the deep connections between high energy physics and statistical mechanics. The unavoidable technical aspects are explained with a minimum of prerequisite material and jargon, and conceptual understanding is always given prominence before mastery of technical details, but the importance of the latter is never underestimated.

TIMSS is the most extensive and far-reaching cross-national comparative study of mathematics and science education ever attempted. It includes comparing official curricula, textbooks, teacher practices, and student achievements for many countries (from 20 to 50 countries, depending on the particular comparison). Thousands of official documents and textbooks were analyzed. Thousands of teachers, principals, and other experts responded to survey questionnaires. A sample of mathematics teachers in three countries had their lessons videotaped. Hundreds of thousands of children in almost 50 countries were tested in mathematics and science. This report presents a closer look at US mathematics and science education through careful examination of TIMSS data. The authors believe this investigation shows how deceptive many often unquestioned assumptions about American education can be. Drawing upon many new analyses not previously reported and integrating these with previous analyses of TIMSS data, the authors develop and illustrate the argument that what happens to American students is the consequence of American beliefs that shape educational practice and the accretion of a myriad educational choices made in mathematics and science education.",Education,236,N/A,0,en
Mathematical Methods in Science and Engineering,Selcuk S. Bayin,John Wiley & Sons,2018-03-27,"A Practical, Interdisciplinary Guide to Advanced Mathematical Methods for Scientists and Engineers Mathematical Methods in Science and Engineering, Second Edition, provides students and scientists with a detailed mathematical reference for advanced analysis and computational methodologies. Making complex tools accessible, this invaluable resource is designed for both the classroom and the practitioners; the modular format allows flexibility of coverage, while the text itself is formatted to provide essential information without detailed study. Highly practical discussion focuses on the “how-to” aspect of each topic presented, yet provides enough theory to reinforce central processes and mechanisms. Recent growing interest in interdisciplinary studies has brought scientists together from physics, chemistry, biology, economy, and finance to expand advanced mathematical methods beyond theoretical physics. This book is written with this multi-disciplinary group in mind, emphasizing practical solutions for diverse applications and the development of a new interdisciplinary science. Revised and expanded for increased utility, this new Second Edition: Includes over 60 new sections and subsections more useful to a multidisciplinary audience Contains new examples, new figures, new problems, and more fluid arguments Presents a detailed discussion on the most frequently encountered special functions in science and engineering Provides a systematic treatment of special functions in terms of the Sturm-Liouville theory Approaches second-order differential equations of physics and engineering from the factorization perspective Includes extensive discussion of coordinate transformations and tensors, complex analysis, fractional calculus, integral transforms, Green's functions, path integrals, and more Extensively reworked to provide increased utility to a broader audience, this book provides a self-contained three-semester course for curriculum, self-study, or reference. As more scientific disciplines begin to lean more heavily on advanced mathematical analysis, this resource will prove to be an invaluable addition to any bookshelf.",Education,866,N/A,0,en

Mathematics for the Physical Sciences,Herbert S. Wilf,Courier Dover Publications,1962,"This book offers advanced undergraduates and graduate students in physics, engineering, and other natural sciences a solid foundation in several fields of mathematics. Clear and well-written, it assumes a previous knowledge of the theory of functions of real and complex variables, and is ideal for classroom use, self-study, or as a supplementary text. Starting with vector spaces and matrices, the text proceeds to orthogonal functions; the roots of polynomial equations; asymptotic expansions; ordinary differential equations; conformal mapping; and extremum problems. Each chapter goes straight to the heart of the matter, developing subjects just far enough so that students can easily make the appropriate applications. Exercises at the end of each chapter, along with solutions at the back of the book, afford further opportunities for reinforcement. Discussions of numerical methods are oriented toward computer use, and they bridge the gap between the ""there exists"" perspective of pure mathematicians and the ""find it to three decimal places"" mentality of engineers. Each chapter features a separate bibliography.",Mathematics,304,N/A,0,en

A Structural Account of Mathematics,Charles S. Chihara,Clarendon Press,2003-11-20,"Charles Chihara's new book develops and defends a structural view of the nature of mathematics, and uses it to explain a number of striking features of mathematics that have puzzled philosophers for centuries. The view is used to show that, in order to understand how mathematical systems are applied in science and everyday life, it is not necessary to assume that its theorems either presuppose mathematical objects or are even true. Chihara builds upon his previous work, in which he presented a new system of mathematics, the constructibility theory, which did not make reference to, or presuppose, mathematical objects. Now he develops the project further by analysing mathematical systems currently used by scientists to show how such systems are compatible with this nominalistic outlook. He advances several new ways of undermining the heavily discussed indispensability argument for the existence of mathematical objects made famous by Willard Quine and Hilary Putnam. And Chihara presents a rationale for the nominalistic outlook that is quite different from those generally put forward, which he maintains have led to serious misunderstandings. A Structural Account of Mathematics will be required reading for anyone working in this field.",Philosophy,395,N/A,0,en
The Nature of Mathematics and the Mathematics of Nature,"S. Andersson, M. Jacob",Elsevier,1998-10-09,"Chemistry, physics and biology are by their nature genuinely difficult. Mathematics, however, is man-made, and therefore not as complicated. Two ideas form the basis for this book: 1) to use ordinary mathematics to describe the simplicity in the structure of mathematics and 2) to develop new branches of mathematics to describe natural sciences.Mathematics can be described as the addition, subtraction or multiplication of planes. Using the exponential scale the authors show that the addition of planes gives the polyhedra, or any solid. The substraction of planes gives saddles. The multiplication of planes gives the general saddle equations and the multispirals. The equation of symmetry is derived, which contains the exponential scale with its functions for solids, the complex exponentials with the nodal surfaces, and the GD (Gauss Distribution) mathematics with finite periodicity.Piece by piece, the authors have found mathematical functions for the geometrical descriptions of chemical structures and the structure building operations. Using the mathematics for dilatation; twins, trillings, fourlings and sixlings are made, and using GD mathematics these are made periodic. This description of a structure is the nature of mathematics itself. Crystal structures and 3D mathematics are synonyms. Mathematics are used to describe rod packings, Olympic rings and defects in solids. Giant molecules such as cubosomes, the DNA double helix, and certain building blocks in protein structures are also described mathematically.",Mathematics,355,N/A,0,en

Math You Can't Use,Ben Klemens,N/A,2006,"""The field of software is awash in disputes. Market participants and analysts routinely disagree on how computer programs should be produced, marketed, regulated, and sold. On one subject, however, just about everyone can agree: the current intellectual property protection regime for software is a mess. At present, all of the traditional means of delimiting intellectual property - patents, copyrights, and trade secrets - are applied to software in one manner or another. Congress has even invented a new type of law for cases in which these may be insufficient, with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act."" ""The result is widespread confusion, along with the proliferation of nuisance suits. To date, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has granted more than 170,000 software patents, some on applications as commonplace as the pop-up window. Each of these patents gives the holder the right to sue others where no such right existed before, and so gaming of the system abounds. Software providers are forced to funnel millions of dollars annually into defending themselves against lawsuits rather than developing better software. The wave of litigation may end up stifling innovation and hobbling the open source movement, one of the most promising developments of recent years."" ""How did this situation arise? And where should we go from here? In Math You Can't Use, Ben Klemens draws on his experience as both a programmer and an economist to tackle these critical issues. The answer to the first question, he explains, is simple: while patent laws are intended to apply to physical machines, software is something quite different. Software is not just another machines and it is not Hamlet with numbers. It is a functional hybrid that can be duplicated at no cost it is legible by computers in some forms and by humans in others, and it has a unique mathematical structure. All of these facts have to be taken into consideration in designing an appropriate intellectual property regime."" ""Designing such a system is a more difficult task. Klemens considers several alternatives, from modifying the existing rules to eliminating software patents in favor of a copyright-centered regime. Ultimately, he concludes, it is up to Congress to determine how software should be protected.""--BOOK JACKET.",Business & Economics,200,N/A,0,en

The Nitty-Gritty in the Life of a University,William J. Adams,Xlibris Corporation,2007,"An esteemed professor and one-time chairman of the mathematics department at New York's Pace University, Adams, interested in all facets of university administration, has produced an almost Jeffersonian volume of correspondence from his tenure. His views on textbook selection, collective bargaining and the proper role of the university have all flowed from his notebook, and no problem was too minute to evade his scope The frivolity of some of these papers is balanced by Adams's opinions on weightier issues, including sexual harassment and compensation in higher education. His approach and forward manner on these situations, despite how genuine, sometimes engendered resentment from his fellow faculty. But for those interested in the particulars of an academic career, this book offers a glimpse of what life may really be like inside the ivory tower. - Kirkus Discoveries-",Education,445,N/A,0,en

Children's Reading and Mathematics Achievement in Kindergarten and First Grade,"Kristin Denton, Kristin Denton Flanagan, Jerry West",DIANE Publishing,2002,"This report is the third in a series based on findings about young children's early experiences with school from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K). Sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, the ECLS-K study selected a nationally representative sample of kindergartners in the fall of 1998 and is following these children through the spring of their fifth-grade year. The study collects information directly from the children, their families, teachers, and schools. This report looks at children's school performance during first grade in terms of their reading and mathematical knowledge and skills by relating them to child, family, and school characteristics. The report finds that some of the differences in children's reading and mathematics knowledge and skills by child, family, and school characteristics that are present as they enter kindergarten persist into the spring of their kindergarten and spring of their first-grade year. For example, poor children consistently score below the national average in both reading and mathematics across the kindergarten year and into the spring of first grade. These findings also suggest differences that are beginning to emerge by children's sex. By spring of first grade, females are more likely to be reading (understanding words in context), whereas, males are more likely be proficient at advanced mathematics (multiplication and division). However, some differences do seem to wane. For example, in both reading and mathematics, Hispanic children's scores tend to move upward toward the national mean over these two school years. The longitudinal nature of the ECLS-K will enable researchers to track these differences in terms of children's third- and fifth-grade reading and mathematics performance. The report also notes that children who bring certain knowledge and skills with them to kindergarten are likely to be at an advantage in classroom learning compared to peers who do not possess such resources. The descriptive analyses of the report show that children who have specific cognitive knowledge and skills, are read to frequently, possess positive approaches to learning, and enjoy very good or excellent general health, perform better in reading and mathematics than those without these resources. (Includes data and standard error tables. Appended is a table of regression coefficients for the relationship between children's resources and skills to their spring kindergarten and spring first-grade reading performance.

Cultural Perspectives on the Mathematics Classroom,Steve Lerman,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-04-17,"Mathematics teaching and learning have been dominated by a concern for the intellectual readiness of the child, debates over rote learning versus understanding and, recently, mathematical processes and thinking. The gaze into today's mathematics classroom is firmly focused on the individual learner. Recently, however, studies of mathematics in social practices, including the market place and the home, have initiated a shift of focus. Culture has become identified as a key to understanding the basis on which the learner appropriates meaning. The chapters in this timely book attempt to engage with this shift of focus and offer original contributions to the debate about mathematics teaching and learning. They adopt theoretical perspectives while drawing on the classroom as both the source of investigation and the site of potential change and development. The book will be of fundamental interest to lecturers and researchers and to teachers concerned with the classroom as a cultural phenomenon.",Education,212,N/A,0,en

Transforming Themes,Paul J Leslie,Phoenix Publishing House,2021-07-08,"Transforming Themes challenges the dominant view of psychotherapy as a structured, reductionist process. Instead, it views psychotherapy as an alive, unrehearsed interaction that embraces healing when it is focused on the role of 'therapeutic themes'. These themes are the entrenched frames of references or contexts from which clients perceive their lives. In any interaction, each participant has a unique worldview. When clients come to therapy, they bring their problems in the form of a theme: 'the woman who can't forgive' or 'the child who is a terror'. Any potential statement or action performed within this theme merely strengthens the problem. Only when the theme of the therapy session has shifted can clients gain access to inner resources to shift perspectives and begin inner transformation. Effective therapy results from moving clients into more flexible, empowering themes. These changes occur as a result of the dynamic interaction between therapist and client, which embraces improvisation, creativity, and novelty, rather than adherence to specific theories or techniques. Using historical and modern research and colourful case studies, this work will help professionals understand how to easily adapt and apply creative and resourceful therapy interventions, no matter what therapeutic orientation they endorse. This book will enable therapists, counsellors, psychologists, and social workers to gain access to creative, effective methods which help their clients heal while increasing effectiveness and enjoyment in clinical work.",Psychology,133,N/A,0,en

He begins with a discussion of what people want from their school systems, tracing their views of the kinds of knowledge, skills, and values education should impart, and their concerns about discipline, drugs, and violence in schools. Using this survey of goals and attitudes as a guide, Coulson sets out to compare the school systems of civilizations both ancient and modern, seeking to determine which systems achieved the aims of parents and the public at large and which did not.

What makes an assumption reasonable? What makes a proof reliable? G ̈ odel, Church and Turing, in di?erent ways, achieve a deep und- standing of the notion of e?ective calculability involved in the nature of proof. Turing’s work in particular provides a “precise and unquestionably adequate” de?nition of the general notion of a formal system in terms of a machine with a ?nite number of parts.

Heterogeneous Contributions to Numerical Cognition,"Wim Fias, Avishai Henik",Academic Press,2021-05-28,"Arithmetic disability stems from deficits in neurodevelopment, with great individual differences in development or function of an individual at neuroanatomical, neuropsychological, behavioral, and interactional levels. Heterogeneous Contributions to Numerical Cognition: Learning and Education in Mathematical Cognition examines research in mathematical education methods and their neurodevelopmental basis, focusing on the underlying neurodevelopmental features that must be taken into account when teaching and learning mathematics. Cognitive domains and functions such as executive functions, memory, attention, and language contribute to numerical cognition and are essential for its proper development. These lines of research and thinking in neuroscience are discussed in this book to further the understanding of the neurodevelopmental and cognitive basis of more complex forms of mathematics – and how to best teach them. By unravelling the basic building blocks of numerical thinking and the developmental basis of human capacity for arithmetic, this book and the discussions within are important for the achievement of a comprehensive understanding of numerical cognition, its brain basis, development, breakdown in brain-injured individuals, and failures to master mathematical skills. - A novel innovative reference on the emerging field of numerical cognition and neurodevelopment underlying mathematical education - Includes an overview of the multiple disciplines that comprise numerical cognition written by world-leading researchers in the numerical cognition and neurodevelopment fields - Features an innovative organization with each section providing a general overview, developmental research, neurocognitive mechanisms, and discussion about relevant studies",Medical,424,N/A,0,en

Introductory Statistics,"William B. Ware, John M. Ferron, Barbara M. Miller",Taylor & Francis,2013-02-15,"This comprehensive and uniquely organized text is aimed at undergraduate and graduate level statistics courses in education, psychology, and other social sciences. A conceptual approach, built around common issues and problems rather than statistical techniques, allows students to understand the conceptual nature of statistical procedures and to focus more on cases and examples of analysis. Wherever possible, presentations contain explanations of the underlying reasons behind a technique. Importantly, this is one of the first statistics texts in the social sciences using R as the principal statistical package. Key features include the following. Conceptual Focus – The focus throughout is more on conceptual understanding and attainment of statistical literacy and thinking than on learning a set of tools and procedures. Problems and Cases – Chapters and sections open with examples of situations related to the forthcoming issues, and major sections ends with a case study. For example, after the section on describing relationships between variables, there is a worked case that demonstrates the analyses, presents computer output, and leads the student through an interpretation of that output. Continuity of Examples – A master data set containing nearly all of the data used in the book’s examples is introduced at the beginning of the text. This ensures continuity in the examples used across the text. Companion Website – A companion website contains instructions on how to use R, SAS, and SPSS to solve the end-of-chapter exercises and offers additional exercises. Field Tested – The manuscript has been field tested for three years at two leading institutions.",Education,520,N/A,0,en

Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension,Matt Parker,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux",2014-12-02,"A book from the stand-up mathematician that makes math fun again! Math is boring, says the mathematician and comedian Matt Parker. Part of the problem may be the way the subject is taught, but it's also true that we all, to a greater or lesser extent, find math difficult and counterintuitive. This counterintuitiveness is actually part of the point, argues Parker: the extraordinary thing about math is that it allows us to access logic and ideas beyond what our brains can instinctively do—through its logical tools we are able to reach beyond our innate abilities and grasp more and more abstract concepts. In the absorbing and exhilarating Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension, Parker sets out to convince his readers to revisit the very math that put them off the subject as fourteen-year-olds. Starting with the foundations of math familiar from school (numbers, geometry, and algebra), he reveals how it is possible to climb all the way up to the topology and to four-dimensional shapes, and from there to infinity—and slightly beyond. Both playful and sophisticated, Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension is filled with captivating games and puzzles, a buffet of optional hands-on activities that entices us to take pleasure in math that is normally only available to those studying at a university level. Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension invites us to re-learn much of what we missed in school and, this time, to be utterly enthralled by it.",Games & Activities,465,5,2,en
Math for Life,Jeffrey Bennett,N/A,2013-11,"How can we solve the national debt crisis? Should you or your child take on a student loan? Is it safe to talk on a cell phone while driving? Are there viable energy alternatives to fossil fuels? What could you do with a billion dollars? Could simple policy changes reduce political polarization? These questions may all seem very different, but they share two things in common. First, they are all questions with important implications for either personal success or our success as a nation. Second, they all concern topics that we can fully understand only with the aid of clear quantitative or mathematical thinking. In other words, they are topics for which we need math for life--a kind of math that looks quite different from most of the math that we learn in school, but that is just as (and often more) important. In Math for Life, award-winning author Jeffrey Bennett simply and clearly explains the key ideas of quantitative reasoning and applies them to all the above questions and many more. He also uses these questions to analyze our current education system, identifying both shortfalls in the teaching of mathematics and solutions for our educational future. No matter what your own level of mathematical ability, and no matter whether you approach the book as an educator, student, or interested adult, you are sure to find something new and thought-provoking in Math for Life.",Mathematics,0,N/A,0,en

"Efficiency, Accountability, and Equity","Margaret C. Wang, Kenneth K. Wong",IAP,2002-06-01,"How efficient is Title I, the largest federal educational program in elementary and secondary schools? What is the quality of the Title I services? Has Title I promoted equity in schools among our nation’s low-income areas? To address these important issues, this volume draws on the proceedings of two national invitational conferences, sponsored by the mid-Atlantic regional educational laboratory, the Laboratory for Student Success (LSS) at Temple University Center for Research in Human Development and Education in 1999 and 2000. These conferences aim to provide research-based information on how Title I schoolwide programs affect teaching, learning, and student outcomes and to strengthen cost-benefits in Title I program implementation to assist students in high-poverty schools. The focus of the conferences is particularly timely in view of the upcoming Title I reauthorization and the recently enacted federal Comprehensive School Reform Demonstration (CSRD) initiative. Discussion at the conferences focused on enhancing our understanding of accountability, efficiency, and equity issues in Title I. More specifically, researchers at the two conferences: (a) highlighted findings from the National Study of Effective Title I Schoolwide Programs; (b) examined the effects of research-based comprehensive reform models in high-poverty schools; and (c) addressed cross-cutting issues such as the productivity of Title I programs, the use of technologies in the classroom, the role of the state in strengthening Title I programs, cost effectiveness of whole school reform, professional development, reading instruction, and parental involvement, which are important parts of the national educational reform agenda. Leading researchers, policymakers, and practitioners were commissioned to develop preconference papers to serve as a springboard for discussion at the conferences. These papers included an overview of the research base and patterns of governance and conditions that lead to effective implementation of Title I schoolwide programs. The papers were reviewed by conference participants before the conferences and were used to develop next-step recommendations for advancing the implementation of the Title I schoolwide provision.",Education,334,N/A,0,en

The first part introduces basic objects such as schemes, morphisms, base change, local properties (normality, regularity, Zariski's Main Theorem). This is followed by the more global aspect: coherent sheaves and a finiteness theorem for their cohomology groups. Then follows a chapter on sheaves of differentials, dualizing sheaves, and Grothendieck's duality theory. The first part ends with the theorem of Riemann-Roch and its application to the study of smooth projective curves over a field. Singular curves are treated through a detailed study of the Picard group. The second part starts with blowing-ups and desingularisation (embedded or not) of fibered surfaces over a Dedekind ring that leads on to intersection theory on arithmetic surfaces. Castelnuovo's criterion is proved and also the existence of the minimal regular model. This leads to the study of reduction of algebraic curves. The case of elliptic curves is studied in detail. The book concludes with the funadmental theorem of stable reduction of Deligne-Mumford. The book is essentially self-contained, including the necessary material on commutative algebra. The prerequisites are therefore few, and the book should suit a graduate student. It contains many examples and nearly 600 exercises.",Mathematics,593,N/A,0,en

Thinking Better,Marcus Du Sautoy,Hachette UK,2021-10-19,"One of the world's great mathematicians shows why math is the ultimate timesaver—and how everyone can make their lives easier with a few simple shortcuts. We are often told that hard work is the key to success. But success isn’t about hard work – it’s about shortcuts. Shortcuts allow us to solve one problem quickly so that we can tackle an even bigger one. They make us capable of doing great things. And according to Marcus du Sautoy, math is the very art of the shortcut. Thinking Better is a celebration of how math lets us do more with less. Du Sautoy explores how diagramming revolutionized therapy, why calculus is the greatest shortcut ever invented, whether you must really practice for ten thousand hours to become a concert violinist, and why shortcuts give us an advantage over even the most powerful AI. Throughout, we meet artists, scientists, and entrepreneurs who use mathematical shortcuts to change the world. Delightful, illuminating, and above all practical, Thinking Better is for anyone who has wondered why you should waste time climbing the mountain when you could go around it much faster.",Mathematics,330,N/A,0,en

Shape,Jordan Ellenberg,Penguin,2021-05-25,"An instant New York Times Bestseller! “Unreasonably entertaining . . . reveals how geometric thinking can allow for everything from fairer American elections to better pandemic planning.” —The New York Times From the New York Times-bestselling author of How Not to Be Wrong—himself a world-class geometer—a far-ranging exploration of the power of geometry, which turns out to help us think better about practically everything. How should a democracy choose its representatives? How can you stop a pandemic from sweeping the world? How do computers learn to play Go, and why is learning Go so much easier for them than learning to read a sentence? Can ancient Greek proportions predict the stock market? (Sorry, no.) What should your kids learn in school if they really want to learn to think? All these are questions about geometry. For real. If you're like most people, geometry is a sterile and dimly remembered exercise you gladly left behind in the dust of ninth grade, along with your braces and active romantic interest in pop singers. If you recall any of it, it's plodding through a series of miniscule steps only to prove some fact about triangles that was obvious to you in the first place. That's not geometry. Okay, it is geometry, but only a tiny part, which has as much to do with geometry in all its flush modern richness as conjugating a verb has to do with a great novel. Shape reveals the geometry underneath some of the most important scientific, political, and philosophical problems we face. Geometry asks: Where are things? Which things are near each other? How can you get from one thing to another thing? Those are important questions. The word ""geometry""comes from the Greek for ""measuring the world."" If anything, that's an undersell. Geometry doesn't just measure the world—it explains it. Shape shows us how.",Mathematics,481,N/A,0,en
Count Like an Egyptian,David Reimer,Princeton University Press,2014-04-27,"A lively collection of fun and challenging problems in ancient Egyptian math The mathematics of ancient Egypt was fundamentally different from our math today. Contrary to what people might think, it wasn't a primitive forerunner of modern mathematics. In fact, it can’t be understood using our current computational methods. Count Like an Egyptian provides a fun, hands-on introduction to the intuitive and often-surprising art of ancient Egyptian math. David Reimer guides you step-by-step through addition, subtraction, multiplication, and more. He even shows you how fractions and decimals may have been calculated—they technically didn’t exist in the land of the pharaohs. You’ll be counting like an Egyptian in no time, and along the way you’ll learn firsthand how mathematics is an expression of the culture that uses it, and why there’s more to math than rote memorization and bewildering abstraction. Reimer takes you on a lively and entertaining tour of the ancient Egyptian world, providing rich historical details and amusing anecdotes as he presents a host of mathematical problems drawn from different eras of the Egyptian past. Each of these problems is like a tantalizing puzzle, often with a beautiful and elegant solution. As you solve them, you’ll be immersed in many facets of Egyptian life, from hieroglyphs and pyramid building to agriculture, religion, and even bread baking and beer brewing. Fully illustrated in color throughout, Count Like an Egyptian also teaches you some Babylonian computation—the precursor to our modern system—and compares ancient Egyptian mathematics to today’s math, letting you decide for yourself which is better.",Mathematics,250,N/A,0,en

The Disc Embedding Theorem,"Stefan Behrens, Boldizsar Kalmar, Min Hoon Kim, Mark Powell, Arunima Ray",Oxford University Press,2021,"Based on Fields medal winning work of Michael Freedman, this book explores the disc embedding theorem for 4-dimensional manifolds. This theorem underpins virtually all our understanding of topological 4-manifolds. Most famously, this includes the 4-dimensional Poincaré conjecture in the topological category. The Disc Embedding Theorem contains the first thorough and approachable exposition of Freedman's proof of the disc embedding theorem, with many new details. A self-contained account of decomposition space theory, a beautiful but outmoded branch of topology that produces non-differentiable homeomorphisms between manifolds, is provided, as well as a stand-alone interlude that explains the disc embedding theorem's key role in all known homeomorphism classifications of 4-manifolds via surgery theory and the s-cobordism theorem. Additionally, the ramifications of the disc embedding theorem within the study of topological 4-manifolds, for example Frank Quinn's development of fundamental tools like transversality are broadly described.The book is written for mathematicians, within the subfield of topology, specifically interested in the study of 4-dimensional spaces, and includes numerous professionally rendered figures.",Mathematics,492,N/A,0,en

First-rate.” —John Allen Paulos, author of Innumeracy A science and technology journalist and essayist whose work has appeared in multiple anthologies, Brian Hayes now presents a selection of his most memorable pieces—including the National Magazine Award–winning “Clock of Ages”—in this enjoyable volume. In addition, Hayes embellishes the collection with an overall scene-setting preface, reconfigured illustrations, and a refreshingly self-critical “Afterthoughts” section appended to each essay. “You don’t have to be a geek to appreciate Hayes’s lively, self-effacing style . . . The first essay explains how clockmakers developed the gears and linkages that enabled fabled medieval clocks to reach remarkable accuracy, as well as predict the day Easter would fall on. Other essays celebrate the notion of random numbers and why they are so hard to achieve. Numerical analysis also plays a role in economic models based on the kinetic theory of gases or simplified markets involving iterations of buying and selling. Hayes goes on to explain how statistics have been applied to compute which quarrels—from interpersonal to world wars—are the deadliest (surprising results here) . . . Challenging but rewarding for anyone intrigued by numbers.” —Kirkus Reviews “As much as any book I can name, Group Theory in the Bedroom conveys to a general audience the playfulness involved in doing mathematics: how questions arise as a form of play, how our first attempts at answering questions usually seem naive in hindsight but are crucial for finding eventual solutions, and how a good solution just feels right.” —David Austin, Notices of the AMS",Mathematics,284,4,3,en

A Primer on Mapping Class Groups,"Benson Farb, Dan Margalit",Princeton University Press,2012,"The study of the mapping class group Mod(S) is a classical topic that is experiencing a renaissance. It lies at the juncture of geometry, topology, and group theory. This book explains as many important theorems, examples, and techniques as possible, quickly and directly, while at the same time giving full details and keeping the text nearly self-contained. The book is suitable for graduate students. A Primer on Mapping Class Groups begins by explaining the main group-theoretical properties of Mod(S), from finite generation by Dehn twists and low-dimensional homology to the Dehn-Nielsen-Baer theorem. Along the way, central objects and tools are introduced, such as the Birman exact sequence, the complex of curves, the braid group, the symplectic representation, and the Torelli group. The book then introduces Teichmüller space and its geometry, and uses the action of Mod(S) on it to prove the Nielsen-Thurston classification of surface homeomorphisms. Topics include the topology of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, the connection with surface bundles, pseudo-Anosov theory, and Thurston's approach to the classification.",Mathematics,490,N/A,0,en

The Forgotten Schools,Soli Shahvar,I.B. Tauris,2009-09-30,"By the end of the nineteenth century it became evident to Iran's ruling Qajar elite that the state's contribution to the promotion of modern education in the country was unable to meet the growing expectations set by Iranian society. Muzaffar al-Din Shah sought to remedy this situation by permitting the entry of the private sector into the field of modern education and in 1899 the first Baha'i school was established in Tehran. By the 1930s there were dozens of Baha'i schools. Their high standards of education drew many non-Baha'i students, from all sections of society.Here Soli Shahvar assesses these 'forgotten schools' and investigates why they proved so popular not only with Baha'is, but Zoroastrians, Jews and especially Muslims. Shahvar explains why they were closed by the reformist Reza Shah in the late 1930s and the subsequent fragility of the Baha'is position in Iran.",Education,312,N/A,0,en
Indra's Pearls,"David Mumford, Caroline Series, David James Wright, David Wright",Cambridge University Press,2002-04-25,"Felix Klein, one of the great nineteenth-century geometers, rediscovered in mathematics an idea from Eastern philosophy: the heaven of Indra contained a net of pearls, each of which was reflected in its neighbour, so that the whole Universe was mirrored in each pearl. Klein studied infinitely repeated reflections and was led to forms with multiple co-existing symmetries. For a century these ideas barely existed outside the imagination of mathematicians. However in the 1980s the authors embarked on the first computer exploration of Klein's vision, and in doing so found many further extraordinary images. Join the authors on the path from basic mathematical ideas to the simple algorithms that create the delicate fractal filigrees, most of which have never appeared in print before.

Thus, from our point of view, the interleaving of theory and applications and their creative symbi otic evolution is axiomatic. Harmonic analysis is a wellspring of ideas and applicability that has flour ished, developed, and deepened over time within many disciplines and by means of creative cross-fertilization with diverse areas. The intricate and fundamental relationship between harmonic analysis and fields such as sig nal processing, partial differential equations (PDEs), and image processing is reflected in our state of the art ANHA series.

"Dynamo and Dynamics, a Mathematical Challenge","Pascal Chossat, Dieter Armbruster, Iuliana Oprea",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This book contains the lectures given at the workshop ""Dynamo and dynamics, a mathematical challenge"" held in Cargese from August 21 to 26, 2000. The workshop differed from most previous conferences on the dynamo effect in two important respects. First, it was at this international conference that the experimental observation of homogeneous fluid dynamos was first reported. Second, the conference gathered scientists from very different fields, thus showing that thepynamo problem has become an interdisciplinary subject involving not only astrophysicists and geophysicists, but also scientists working in dynamical systems theory, hydrodynamics, and numerical simulation, as well as several groups in experimental physics. This book thus reports important results on various dynamo studies in these different contexts: - Decades after the discovery of the first analytic examples of laminar fluid dynamos, the self-generation of a magnetic field by a flow ofliquid sodium has been reported by the Karlsruhe and Riga groups. Although there were no doubts concerning the self generation by the laminar Roberts-type or Ponomarenko-type flows that were used, these experiments have raised interesting questions about the influence of the turbulent fluctuations on the dynamo threshold and on the saturation level of the magnetic field.",Science,399,N/A,0,en

Boccara",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"In the many physical phenomena ruled by partial differential equations, two extreme fields are currently overcrowded due to recent considerable developments: 1) the field of completely integrable equations, whose recent advances are the inverse spectral transform, the recursion operator, underlying Hamiltonian structures, Lax pairs, etc 2) the field of dynamical systems, often built as models of observed physical phenomena: turbulence, intermittency, Poincare sections, transition to chaos, etc. In between there is a very large region where systems are neither integrable nor nonintegrable, but partially integrable, and people working in the latter domain often know methods from either 1) or 2). Due to the growing interest in partially integrable systems, we decided to organize a meeting for physicists active or about to undertake research in this field, and we thought that an appropriate form would be a school. Indeed, some of the above mentioned methods are often adaptable outside their original domain and therefore worth to be taught in an interdisciplinary school. One of the main concerns was to keep a correct balance between physics and mathematics, and this is reflected in the list of courses.",Technology & Engineering,609,N/A,0,en

Computability Theory and Its Applications,Peter Cholak,American Mathematical Soc.,2000,"This collection of articles presents a snapshot of the status of computability theory at the end of the millennium and a list of fruitful directions for future research. The papers represent the works of experts in the field who were invited speakers at the AMS-IMS-SIAM 1999 Summer Conference on Computability Theory and Applications, which focused on open problems in computability theory and on some related areas in which the ideas, methods, and/or results of computability theory play a role. Some presentations are narrowly focused; others cover a wider area. Topics included from ""pure"" computability theory are the computably enumerable degrees (M. Lerman), the computably enumerable sets (P. Cholak, R. Soare), definability issues in the c.e. and Turing degrees (A. Nies, R. Shore) and other degree structures (M. Arslanov, S. Badaev and S. Goncharov, P. Odifreddi, A. Sorbi). The topics involving relations between computability and other areas of logic and mathematics are reverse mathematics and proof theory (D. Cenzer and C. Jockusch, C. Chong and Y. Yang, H. Friedman and S. Simpson), set theory (R. Dougherty and A. Kechris, M. Groszek, T. Slaman) and computable mathematics and model theory (K. Ambos-Spies and A.

World Directory of Crystallographers,"Allan L. Bednowitz, Armin P. Segmüller",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-04-17,"A brief historical account of the background leading to the publication of the first four editions of the World Directory of Crystallographers was presented by G. Boom in his preface to the Fourth Edition, published late in 1971. That edition was produced by traditional typesetting methods from compilations of biographical data prepared by national Sub-Editors. The major effort required to produce a directory by manual methods provided the impetus to use computer techniques for the Fifth Edition. The account of the production of the first computer assisted Directory was described by S.C. Abrahams in the preface of the Fifth Edition. Computer composition, which required a machine readable data base, offered several major advantages. The choice of typeface and range of characters was flexible. Corrections and additions to the data base were rapid and, once established, it was hoped updating for future editions would be simple and inexpensive. The data base was put to other Union uses, such as preparation of mailing labels and formulation of lists of crystallographers with specified common fields of interest. The Fifth Edition of the World Directory of Crystallographers was published in June of 1977, the Sixth in May of 1981. The Subject Indexes for the Fifth and Sixth Editions were printed in 1978 and 1981 respectively, both having a limited distribution.",Science,275,N/A,0,en

Abelian Groups and Modules,"Alberto Facchini, Claudia Menini",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"On the 26th of November 1992 the organizing committee gathered together, at Luigi Salce's invitation, for the first time. The tradition of abelian groups and modules Italian conferences (Rome 77, Udine 85, Bressanone 90) needed to be kept up by one more meeting. Since that first time it was clear to us that our goal was not so easy. In fact the main intended topics of abelian groups, modules over commutative rings and non commutative rings have become so specialized in the last years that it looked really ambitious to fit them into only one meeting. Anyway, since everyone of us shared the same mathematical roots, we did want to emphasize a common link. So we elaborated the long symposium schedule: three days of abelian groups and three days of modules over non commutative rings with a two days' bridge of commutative algebra in between. Many of the most famous names in these fields took part to the meeting. Over 140 participants, both attending and contributing the 18 Main Lectures and 64 Communications (see list on page xv) provided a really wide audience for an Algebra meeting. Now that the meeting is over, we can say that our initial feeling was right.",Mathematics,521,N/A,0,en

Mathematical Modelling for Polymer Processing,Vincenzo Capasso,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Polymers are substances made of macromolecules formed by thousands of atoms organized in one (homopolymers) or more (copolymers) groups that repeat themselves to form linear or branched chains, or lattice structures. The concept of polymer traces back to the years 1920's and is one of the most significant ideas of last century. It has given great impulse to indus try but also to fundamental research, including life sciences. Macromolecules are made of sm all molecules known as monomers. The process that brings monomers into polymers is known as polymerization. A fundamental contri bution to the industrial production of polymers, particularly polypropylene and polyethylene, is due to the Nobel prize winners Giulio Natta and Karl Ziegler. The ideas of Ziegler and Natta date back to 1954, and the process has been improved continuously over the years, particularly concerning the design and shaping of the catalysts. Chapter 1 (due to A. Fasano ) is devoted to a review of some results concerning the modelling of the Ziegler- Natta polymerization. The specific ex am pie is the production of polypropilene.

Power-Up reveals the hidden mathematics in many of today's most popular video games and explains why mathematical learning doesn't just happen in the classroom or from books--you're doing it without even realizing it when you play games on your cell phone. In this lively and entertaining book, Matthew Lane discusses how gamers are engaging with the traveling salesman problem when they play Assassin's Creed, why it is mathematically impossible for Mario to jump through the Mushroom Kingdom in Super Mario Bros., and how The Sims teaches us the mathematical costs of maintaining relationships. He looks at mathematical pursuit problems in classic games like Missile Command and Ms. Pac-Man, and how each time you play Tetris, you're grappling with one of the most famous unsolved problems in all of mathematics and computer science. Along the way, Lane discusses why Family Feud and Pictionary make for ho-hum video games, how realism in video games (or the lack of it) influences learning, what video games can teach us about the mathematics of voting, the mathematics of designing video games, and much more. Power-Up shows how the world of video games is an unexpectedly rich medium for learning about the beautiful mathematical ideas that touch all aspects of our lives--including our virtual ones.""--Dust jacket.",Computers,290,N/A,0,en

Count Me In,"Della Dumbaugh, Deanna Haunsperger",American Mathematical Society,2022-02-24,"This groundbreaking work explores the powerful role of communities in mathematics. It introduces readers to twenty-six different mathematical communities and addresses important questions about how they form, how they thrive, and how they advance individuals and the group as a whole. The chapters celebrate how diversity and sameness bind colleagues together, showing how geography, gender, or graph theory can create spaces for colleagues to establish connections in the discipline. They celebrate outcomes measured by mathematical results and by increased interest in studying mathematics. They highlight the value of relationships with peers and colleagues at various stages of their careers. Together, these stories offer a guide—rather than a template—for building and sustaining a mathematical community. They call attention to critical strategies of rotating leadership and regular assessment and evaluation of goals and programs, and promote an ongoing awareness of the responsibilities of life that impinge on mathematical creativity and contributions. Whether you are giving thought to starting a group, joining one already in existence, or encouraging a colleague to participate in the broader mathematical community, this book will meet you where you are—and move you beyond.

Elliptic Partial Differential Equations and Quasiconformal Mappings in the Plane (PMS-48),"Kari Astala, Tadeusz Iwaniec, Gaven Martin",Princeton University Press,2009-01-18,"This book explores the most recent developments in the theory of planar quasiconformal mappings with a particular focus on the interactions with partial differential equations and nonlinear analysis. It gives a thorough and modern approach to the classical theory and presents important and compelling applications across a spectrum of mathematics: dynamical systems, singular integral operators, inverse problems, the geometry of mappings, and the calculus of variations. It also gives an account of recent advances in harmonic analysis and their applications in the geometric theory of mappings. The book explains that the existence, regularity, and singular set structures for second-order divergence-type equations--the most important class of PDEs in applications--are determined by the mathematics underpinning the geometry, structure, and dimension of fractal sets; moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces; and conformal dynamical systems. These topics are inextricably linked by the theory of quasiconformal mappings. Further, the interplay between them allows the authors to extend classical results to more general settings for wider applicability, providing new and often optimal answers to questions of existence, regularity, and geometric properties of solutions to nonlinear systems in both elliptic and degenerate elliptic settings.",Mathematics,708,N/A,0,en

Experiments in Topology,Stephen Barr,Courier Corporation,1989-01-01,"""A mathematician named Klein Thought the Moebius band was divine. Said he: 'If you glue The edges of two, You'll get a weird bottle like mine.' "" — Stephen Barr In this lively book, the classic in its field, a master of recreational topology invites readers to venture into such tantalizing topological realms as continuity and connectedness via the Klein bottle and the Moebius strip. Beginning with a definition of topology and a discussion of Euler's theorem, Mr. Barr brings wit and clarity to these topics: New Surfaces (Orientability, Dimension, The Klein Bottle, etc.) The Shortest Moebius Strip The Conical Moebius Strip The Klein Bottle The Projective Plane (Symmetry) Map Coloring Networks (Koenigsberg Bridges, Betti Numbers, Knots) The Trial of the Punctured Torus Continuity and Discreteness (""Next Number,"" Continuity, Neighborhoods, Limit Points) Sets (Valid or Merely True? Venn Diagrams, Open and Closed Sets, Transformations, Mapping, Homotopy) With this book and a square sheet of paper, the reader can make paper Klein bottles, step by step; then, by intersecting or cutting the bottle, make Moebius strips. Conical Moebius strips, projective planes, the principle of map coloring, the classic problem of the Koenigsberg bridges, and many more aspects of topology are carefully and concisely illuminated by the author's informal and entertaining approach. Now in this inexpensive paperback edition, Experiments in Topology belongs in the library of any math enthusiast with a taste for brainteasing adventures",Mathematics,242,N/A,0,en

Cohen-Macaulay Representations,"Graham J. Leuschke, Roger Wiegand",American Mathematical Soc.,2012-05-02,"This book is a comprehensive treatment of the representation theory of maximal Cohen-Macaulay (MCM) modules over local rings. This topic is at the intersection of commutative algebra, singularity theory, and representations of groups and algebras. Two introductory chapters treat the Krull-Remak-Schmidt Theorem on uniqueness of direct-sum decompositions and its failure for modules over local rings. Chapters 3-10 study the central problem of classifying the rings with only finitely many indecomposable MCM modules up to isomorphism, i.e., rings of finite CM type. The fundamental material--ADE/simple singularities, the double branched cover, Auslander-Reiten theory, and the Brauer-Thrall conjectures--is covered clearly and completely. Much of the content has never before appeared in book form. Examples include the representation theory of Artinian pairs and Burban-Drozd's related construction in dimension two, an introduction to the McKay correspondence from the point of view of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules, Auslander-Buchweitz's MCM approximation theory, and a careful treatment of nonzero characteristic. The remaining seven chapters present results on bounded and countable CM type and on the representation theory of totally reflexive modules.",Mathematics,390,N/A,0,en

Calculus in Context,Alexander Hahn,JHU Press,2017-04-15,"A new approach to teaching calculus that uses historical examples and draws on applications from science and engineering. Breaking the mold of existing calculus textbooks, Calculus in Context draws students into the subject in two new ways. Part I develops the mathematical preliminaries (including geometry, trigonometry, algebra, and coordinate geometry) within the historical frame of the ancient Greeks and the heliocentric revolution in astronomy. Part II starts with comprehensive and modern treatments of the fundamentals of both differential and integral calculus, then turns to a wide-ranging discussion of applications. Students will learn that core ideas of calculus are central to concepts such as acceleration, force, momentum, torque, inertia, and the properties of lenses. Classroom-tested at Notre Dame University, this textbook is suitable for students of wide-ranging backgrounds because it engages its subject at several levels and offers ample and flexible problem set options for instructors. Parts I and II are both supplemented by expansive Problems and Projects segments. Topics covered in the book include: • the basics of geometry, trigonometry, algebra, and coordinate geometry and the historical, scientific agenda that drove their development • a brief, introductory calculus from the works of Newton and Leibniz • a modern development of the essentials of differential and integral calculus • the analysis of specific, relatable applications, such as the arc of the George Washington Bridge; the dome of the Pantheon; the optics of a telescope; the dynamics of a bullet; the geometry of the pseudosphere; the motion of a planet in orbit; and the momentum of an object in free fall.

Applied Discrete Structures,"Ken Levasseur, Al Doerr",Lulu.com,2012-02-25,"''In writing this book, care was taken to use language and examples that gradually wean students from a simpleminded mechanical approach and move them toward mathematical maturity. We also recognize that many students who hesitate to ask for help from an instructor need a readable text, and we have tried to anticipate the questions that go unasked. The wide range of examples in the text are meant to augment the ""favorite examples"" that most instructors have for teaching the topcs in discrete mathematics. To provide diagnostic help and encouragement, we have included solutions and/or hints to the odd-numbered exercises. These solutions include detailed answers whenever warranted and complete proofs, not just terse outlines of proofs. Our use of standard terminology and notation makes Applied Discrete Structures a valuable reference book for future courses. Although many advanced books have a short review of elementary topics, they cannot be complete. The text is divided into lecture-length sections, facilitating the organization of an instructor's presentation.Topics are presented in such a way that students' understanding can be monitored through thought-provoking exercises. The exercises require an understanding of the topics and how they are interrelated, not just a familiarity with the key words. An Instructor's Guide is available to any instructor who uses the text. It includes: Chapter-by-chapter comments on subtopics that emphasize the pitfalls to avoid; Suggested coverage times; Detailed solutions to most even-numbered exercises; Sample quizzes, exams, and final exams. This textbook has been used in classes at Casper College (WY), Grinnell College (IA), Luzurne Community College (PA), University of the Puget Sound (WA).''--",Computers,574,5,1,en

In this eye-opening and extraordinary book, Kit Yates explores the true stories of life-changing events in which the application - or misapplication - of mathematics has played a critical role: patients crippled by faulty genes and entrepreneurs bankrupted by faulty algorithms; innocent victims of miscarriages of justice and the unwitting victims of software glitches.

Kolmogorov Complexity and Algorithmic Randomness,"A. Shen, V. A. Uspensky, N.

Why? The answer is provided by algorithmic information theory: because the sequence is compressible, that is, it has small complexity or, equivalently, can be produced by a short program. This idea, going back to Solomonoff, Kolmogorov, Chaitin, Levin, and others, is now the starting point of algorithmic information theory. The first part of this book is a textbook-style exposition of the basic notions of complexity and randomness; the second part covers some recent work done by participants of the “Kolmogorov seminar” in Moscow (started by Kolmogorov himself in the 1980s) and their colleagues.

Set Theoretical Aspects of Real Analysis,Alexander B.

Accessible to graduate students, and researchers the beginning of the book presents introductory topics on real analysis and Lebesgue measure theory. These topics highlight the boundary between fundamental concepts of measurability and nonmeasurability for point sets and functions. The remainder of the book deals with more specialized material on set theoretical real analysis. The book focuses on certain logical and set theoretical aspects of real analysis. It is expected that the first eleven chapters can be used in a course on Lebesque measure theory that highlights the fundamental concepts of measurability and non-measurability for point sets and functions. Provided in the book are problems of varying difficulty that range from simple observations to advanced results. Relatively difficult exercises are marked by asterisks and hints are included with additional explanation. Five appendices are included to supply additional background information that can be read alongside, before, or after the chapters.

Formal and Natural Computing,"Wilfried Brauer, Hartmut Ehrig, Juhani Karhumäki, Arto K. Salomaa",Springer Science & Business Media,2002-02-06,"This book presents state of the art research in theoretical computer science and related ?elds. In particular, the following areas are discussed: automata theory, formal languages and combinatorics of words, graph transformations, Petri nets, concurrency, as well as natural and molecular computing. The articles are written by leading researchers in these areas. The writers were originally invited to contribute to this book but then the normal refereeing procedure was applied as well. All of the articles deal with some issue that has been under vigorous study during recent years. Still, the topics range from very classical ones to issues raised only two or three years ago. Both survey articles and papers attacking speci?c research problems are included. The book highlights some key issues of theoretical computer science, as they seem to us now at the beginning of the new millennium. Being a comprehensive overview of some of the most active current research in theoretical computer science, it should be of de?nite interest for all researchers in the areas covered. The topics range from basic decidability and the notion of information to graph grammars and graph transformations, and from trees and traces to aqueous algorithms, DNA encoding and self-assembly. Special e?ort has been given to lucid presentation. Therefore, the book should be of interest also for advanced students.",Computers,453,N/A,0,en

Categories for the Working Mathematician,Saunders Mac Lane,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-04-17,"An array of general ideas useful in a wide variety of fields. Starting from the foundations, this book illuminates the concepts of category, functor, natural transformation, and duality. It then turns to adjoint functors, which provide a description of universal constructions, an analysis of the representations of functors by sets of morphisms, and a means of manipulating direct and inverse limits. These categorical concepts are extensively illustrated in the remaining chapters, which include many applications of the basic existence theorem for adjoint functors. The categories of algebraic systems are constructed from certain adjoint-like data and characterised by Beck's theorem. After considering a variety of applications, the book continues with the construction and exploitation of Kan extensions. This second edition includes a number of revisions and additions, including new chapters on topics of active interest: symmetric monoidal categories and braided monoidal categories, and the coherence theorems for them, as well as 2-categories and the higher dimensional categories which have recently come into prominence.",Mathematics,320,N/A,0,en

Writing Mathematics Well,Leonard Gillman,American Mathematical Society,2022-06-23,"Good writing conveys more than the author originally had in mind, while poor writing conveys less. Well written papers are more quickly accepted and put into print and more widely read and appreciated than poorly written ones—and for notes, monographs, and books the quality of writing is of more importance that it is for papers. In Writing Mathematics Well, Leonard Gillman tells his readers how to develop a clear and effective style. All aspects of mathematical writing are covered, from general organization and choice of title, to the presentation of results, to fine points on using words and symbols, to revision, and, finally, to the mechanics of putting your manuscript into print. No book can by itself make you a better writer, but this one will alert you to the opportunities for better and more forceful writing. It does this both by precept and by example. This is no bland collection of rules, but a lively guide in the style of Strunk and White or Fowler—a book to be read for its sharpness and wit as well as for enlightenment. Writing Mathematics Well should be on the shelf of anyone who writes or intends to write mathematics. It will amuse and delight the already careful writer and it will help reform and refine the sensibilities of those who may be somewhat careless about their writing.",Mathematics,61,N/A,0,en

Problem Solving in Mathematics Instruction and Teacher Professional Development,"Patricio Felmer, Peter Liljedahl, Boris Koichu",Springer Nature,2019-11-22,"Recent research in problem solving has shifted its focus to actual classroom implementation and what is really going on during problem solving when it is used regularly in classroom. This book seeks to stay on top of that trend by approaching diverse aspects of current problem solving research, covering three broad themes. Firstly, it explores the role of teachers in problem-solving classrooms and their professional development, moving onto—secondly—the role of students when solving problems, with particular consideration of factors like group work, discussion, role of students in discussions and the effect of students’ engagement on their self-perception and their view of mathematics. Finally, the book considers the question of problem solving in mathematics instruction as it overlaps with problem design, problem-solving situations, and actual classroom implementation. The volume brings together diverse contributors from a variety of countries and with wide and varied experiences, combining the voices of leading and developing researchers. The book will be of interest to any reader keeping on the frontiers of research in problem solving, more specifically researchers and graduate students in mathematics education, researchers in problem solving, as well as teachers and practitioners.",Education,418,N/A,0,en

Elementary Mathematics from a Higher Standpoint,Felix Klein,Springer,2016-06-29,"These three volumes constitute the first complete English translation of Felix Klein’s seminal series “Elementarmathematik vom höheren Standpunkte aus”. “Complete” has a twofold meaning here: First, there now exists a translation of volume III into English, while until today the only translation had been into Chinese. Second, the English versions of volume I and II had omitted several, even extended parts of the original, while we now present a complete revised translation into modern English. The volumes, first published between 1902 and 1908, are lecture notes of courses that Klein offered to future mathematics teachers, realizing a new form of teacher training that remained valid and effective until today: Klein leads the students to gain a more comprehensive and methodological point of view on school mathematics. The volumes enable us to understand Klein’s far-reaching conception of elementarisation, of the “elementary from a higher standpoint”, in its implementation for school mathematics./div This volume II presents a paradigmatic realisation of Klein’s approach of elementarisation for teacher education. It is shown how the various geometries, elaborated particularly since the beginning of the 19th century, are revealed as becoming unified in a new restructured geometry. As Klein liked to stress: “Projective geometry is all geometry”. Non-Euclidean geometry proves to constitute a part of this unifying process. The teaching of geometry is discussed in a separate chapter, which provides moreover important information on the history of geometry teaching and an international comparison.",Education,318,N/A,0,en

Grit,Angela Duckworth,Simon and Schuster,2016-05-03,"In this instant New York Times bestseller, Angela Duckworth shows anyone striving to succeed that the secret to outstanding achievement is not talent, but a special blend of passion and persistence she calls “grit.” “Inspiration for non-geniuses everywhere” (People). The daughter of a scientist who frequently noted her lack of “genius,” Angela Duckworth is now a celebrated researcher and professor. It was her early eye-opening stints in teaching, business consulting, and neuroscience that led to her hypothesis about what really drives success: not genius, but a unique combination of passion and long-term perseverance. In Grit, she takes us into the field to visit cadets struggling through their first days at West Point, teachers working in some of the toughest schools, and young finalists in the National Spelling Bee. She also mines fascinating insights from history and shows what can be gleaned from modern experiments in peak performance. Finally, she shares what she’s learned from interviewing dozens of high achievers—from JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon to New Yorker cartoon editor Bob Mankoff to Seattle Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll. “Duckworth’s ideas about the cultivation of tenacity have clearly changed some lives for the better” (The New York Times Book Review). Among Grit’s most valuable insights: any effort you make ultimately counts twice toward your goal; grit can be learned, regardless of IQ or circumstances; when it comes to child-rearing, neither a warm embrace nor high standards will work by themselves; how to trigger lifelong interest; the magic of the Hard Thing Rule; and so much more. Winningly personal, insightful, and even life-changing, Grit is a book about what goes through your head when you fall down, and how that—not talent or luck—makes all the difference. This is “a fascinating tour of the psychological research on success” (The Wall Street Journal).",Self-Help,350,3.5,2,en

Math Girls 5,Hiroshi Yuki,Math Girls,2021-11-15,"This fifth entry in the highly acclaimed Math Girls series focuses on the mathematics of Évariste Galois, the nineteenth-century wunderkind who revolutionized mathematics with work he performed while still a teenager. Mathematicians before him had discovered solutions to general second-, third-, and fourth-degree equations, but a similar ""quintic formula"" that would allow knowing the solutions to any fifth-degree equation had eluded mathematicians for centuries. Through his ingenious approach of bridging the worlds of groups and fields, young Galois not only showed that such a formula was impossible, he newly developed group theory and the branch of mathematics that today bears his name. Join Miruka and friends to see how Galois developed his theory, along with related topics such as geometric constructions and the angle trisection problem, derivation of the cubic formula, reducible and irreducible polynomials, group theory and field theory, symmetric polynomials, roots of unity, sets and cosets, cyclotomic polynomials, vector spaces, extension fields, and symmetric groups. The book concludes with a tour through Galois's first paper, in which he describes for the first time the necessary and sufficient conditions for a polynomial to be algebraically solved using radicals.

Topics in Optimal Transportation,Cédric Villani,American Mathematical Soc.,2021-08-25,"This is the first comprehensive introduction to the theory of mass transportation with its many—and sometimes unexpected—applications. In a novel approach to the subject, the book both surveys the topic and includes a chapter of problems, making it a particularly useful graduate textbook. In 1781, Gaspard Monge defined the problem of “optimal transportation” (or the transferring of mass with the least possible amount of work), with applications to engineering in mind. In 1942, Leonid Kantorovich applied the newborn machinery of linear programming to Monge's problem, with applications to economics in mind. In 1987, Yann Brenier used optimal transportation to prove a new projection theorem on the set of measure preserving maps, with applications to fluid mechanics in mind. Each of these contributions marked the beginning of a whole mathematical theory, with many unexpected ramifications. Nowadays, the Monge-Kantorovich problem is used and studied by researchers from extremely diverse horizons, including probability theory, functional analysis, isoperimetry, partial differential equations, and even meteorology. Originating from a graduate course, the present volume is intended for graduate students and researchers, covering both theory and applications. Readers are only assumed to be familiar with the basics of measure theory and functional analysis.",Education,402,N/A,0,en

Mindset Mathematics,"Jo Boaler, Jen Munson, Cathy Williams",John Wiley & Sons,2018-04-03,"Engage students in mathematics using growth mindset techniques The most challenging parts of teaching mathematics are engaging students and helping them understand the connections between mathematics concepts. In this volume, you'll find a collection of low floor, high ceiling tasks that will help you do just that, by looking at the big ideas at the fifth-grade level through visualization, play, and investigation. During their work with tens of thousands of teachers, authors Jo Boaler, Jen Munson, and Cathy Williams heard the same message—that they want to incorporate more brain science into their math instruction, but they need guidance in the techniques that work best to get across the concepts they needed to teach. So the authors designed Mindset Mathematics around the principle of active student engagement, with tasks that reflect the latest brain science on learning. Open, creative, and visual mathematics tasks have been shown to improve student test scores, and more importantly change their relationship with mathematics and start believing in their own potential. The tasks in Mindset Mathematics reflect the lessons from brain science that: There is no such thing as a math person - anyone can learn mathematics to high levels. Mistakes, struggle and challenge are the most important times for brain growth. Speed is unimportant in mathematics. Mathematics is a visual and beautiful subject, and our brains want to think visually about mathematics. With engaging questions, open-ended tasks, and four-color visuals that will help kids get excited about mathematics, Mindset Mathematics is organized around nine big ideas which emphasize the connections within the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and can be used with any current curriculum.",Education,308,N/A,0,en

Investigations,Stuart A. Kauffman,Oxford University Press,2000-10-26,"""It may be that I have stumbled upon an adequate description of life itself."" These modest yet profound words trumpet an imminent paradigm shift in scientific, economic, and technological thinking. In the tradition of Schrödinger's classic What Is Life?, Kauffman's Investigations is a tour-de-force exploration of the very essence of life itself, with conclusions that radically undermine the scientific approaches on which modern science rests--the approaches of Newton, Boltzman, Bohr, and Einstein. Building on his pivotal ideas about order and evolution in complex life systems, Kauffman finds that classical science does not take into account that physical systems--such as people in a biosphere--effect their dynamic environments in addition to being affected by them. These systems act on their own behalf as autonomous agents, but what defines them as such? In other words, what is life? Kauffman supplies a novel answer that goes beyond traditional scientific thinking by defining and explaining autonomous agents and work in the contexts of thermodynamics and of information theory. Much of Investigations unpacks the progressively surprising implications of his definition. Significantly, he sets the stages for a technological revolution in the coming decades. Scientists and engineers may soon seek to create autonomous agents--both organic and mechanical--that can not only construct things and work, but also reproduce themselves! Kauffman also lays out a foundation for a new concept of organization, and explores the requirements for the emergence of a general biology that will transcend terrestrial biology to seek laws governing biospheres anywhere in the cosmos. Moreover, he presents four candidate laws to explain how autonomous agents co-create their biosphere and the startling idea of a ""co-creating"" cosmos. A showcase of Kauffman's most fundamental and significant ideas, Investigations presents a new way of thinking about the fundamentals of general biology that will change the way we understand life itself--on this planet and anywhere else in the cosmos.",Science,302,4,1,en

Applying Karnatic Rhythmical Techniques to Western Music,Rafael Reina,Routledge,2016-03-03,"Most classical musicians, whether in orchestral or ensemble situations, will have to face a piece by composers such as Ligeti, Messiaen, Varèse or Xenakis, while improvisers face music influenced by Dave Holland, Steve Coleman, Aka Moon, Weather Report, Irakere or elements from the Balkans, India, Africa or Cuba. Rafael Reina argues that today’s music demands a new approach to rhythmical training, a training that will provide musicians with the necessary tools to face, with accuracy, more varied and complex rhythmical concepts, while keeping the emotional content. Reina uses the architecture of the South Indian Karnatic rhythmical system to enhance and radically change the teaching of rhythmical solfege at a higher education level and demonstrates how this learning can influence the creation and interpretation of complex contemporary classical and jazz music. The book is designed for classical and jazz performers as well as creators, be they composers or improvisers, and is a clear and complete guide that will enable future solfege teachers and students to use these techniques and their methodology to greatly improve their rhythmical skills. An accompanying website of audio examples helps to explain each technique.

Inelasticity of Materials,"Arun Ramaswamy Srinivasa, Srinivasan M. Sivakumar",World Scientific Publishing Company,2009,"With the advent of a host of new materials ranging from shape memory alloys to biomaterials to multiphase alloys, acquiring the capacity to model inelastic behavior and to choose the right model in a commercial analysis software has become a pressing need for practicing engineers. Even with the traditional materials, there is a continued emphasis on optimizing and extending their full range of capability in the applications. This textbook builds upon the existing knowledge of elasticity and thermodynamics, and allows the reader to gain confidence in extending one's skills in understanding and analyzing problems in inelasticity. By reading this textbook and working through the assigned exercises, the reader will gain a level of comfort and competence in developing and using inelasticity models. Thus, the book serves as a valuable book for practicing engineers and senior-level undergraduate/graduate-level students in the mechanical, civil, aeronautical, metallurgical and other disciplines. The book is written in three parts. Part 1 is primarily focused on lumped parameter models and simple structural elements such as trusses and beams. This is suitable for an advanced undergraduate class with just a strength of materials background. Part II is focused on small deformation multi-dimensional inelasticity and is suitable for a beginning graduate class. Sufficient material is included on how to numerically implement an inelastic model and solve either using a simple stress function type of approach or using commercial software. Case studies are included as examples. There is also an extensive discussion of thermodynamics in the context of small deformations. Part III focuses on more advanced situations such as finite deformation inelasticity, thermodynamical ideas and crystal plasticity. More advanced case studies are included in this part. bull; This textbook takes a new, task- or scenario-based approach to teaching and learning inelasticity. The book is written in an active learning style that appeals to engineers and students who wish to design or analyze structures and components that are subject to inelasticity. bull; The book incorporates thermodynamical considerations into the modeling right from an early stage. Extensive discussions are provided throughout the book on the thermodynamical underpinnings of the models. bull; This textbook is the first to make extensive use of MATLAB to implement many inelasticity models. It includes the use of concepts such as Airy stress functions to solve plane problems for inelastic materials. The MATLAB codes are listed in the appendix for one to modify with their own models and requirements. bull; Step-by-step procedures for formulations and calculations are provided for the reader to readily adapt to the inelastic problems that he or she attempts to solve. bull; A large number of problems, exercises and projects for one to teach or learn from are included. These can be assigned as homework, in-class exercises or projects. bull; The book is written in a modular fashion, which provides adequate flexibility for adaptation in classes that cater to different audiences such as senior-level students, graduate students, research scholars, and practicing engineers.",Science,580,N/A,0,en

Models of the Mind,Grace Lindsay,Bloomsbury Publishing,2021-03-04,"The human brain is made up of 85 billion neurons, which are connected by over 100 trillion synapses. For more than a century, a diverse array of researchers searched for a language that could be used to capture the essence of what these neurons do and how they communicate – and how those communications create thoughts, perceptions and actions. The language they were looking for was mathematics, and we would not be able to understand the brain as we do today without it. In Models of the Mind, author and computational neuroscientist Grace Lindsay explains how mathematical models have allowed scientists to understand and describe many of the brain's processes, including decision-making, sensory processing, quantifying memory, and more. She introduces readers to the most important concepts in modern neuroscience, and highlights the tensions that arise when the abstract world of mathematical modelling collides with the messy details of biology. Each chapter of Models of the Mind focuses on mathematical tools that have been applied in a particular area of neuroscience, progressing from the simplest building block of the brain – the individual neuron – through to circuits of interacting neurons, whole brain areas and even the behaviours that brains command. In addition, Grace examines the history of the field, starting with experiments done on frog legs in the late eighteenth century and building to the large models of artificial neural networks that form the basis of modern artificial intelligence. Throughout, she reveals the value of using the elegant language of mathematics to describe the machinery of neuroscience.",Science,401,4,1,en

The Legacy of Kurt Schütte,"Reinhard Kahle, Michael Rathjen",Springer Nature,2020-08-10,"This book on proof theory centers around the legacy of Kurt Schütte and its current impact on the subject. Schütte was the last doctoral student of David Hilbert who was the first to see that proofs can be viewed as structured mathematical objects amenable to investigation by mathematical methods (metamathematics). Schütte inaugurated the important paradigm shift from finite proofs to infinite proofs and developed the mathematical tools for their analysis. Infinitary proof theory flourished in his hands in the 1960s, culminating in the famous bound Γ0 for the limit of predicative mathematics (a fame shared with Feferman). Later his interests shifted to developing infinite proof calculi for impredicative theories. Schütte had a keen interest in advancing ordinal analysis to ever stronger theories and was still working on some of the strongest systems in his eighties. The articles in this volume from leading experts close to his research, show the enduring influence of his work in modern proof theory. They range from eye witness accounts of his scientific life to developments at the current research frontier, including papers by Schütte himself that have never been published before.",Mathematics,497,N/A,0,en

The first volume provides insight into what research suggests about the nature of mathematics learning in technological environments. Included in this volume are syntheses of research on technology in the learning of rational number, algebra, elementary and secondary geometry, mathematical modeling, and calculus. Additional chapters synthesize research on technology in the practice of teaching and on equity issues in the use of technology in mathematics instruction. Instead of simply reporting achievement scores of students who use technology in their learning, authors provide thoughtful analyses of bodies of research with the goal of understanding the ways in which technology affects what and how students learn.

This theory considers every notion or idea <A> together with its opposite or negation <antiA> and with their spectrum of neutralities <neutA> in between them (i.e. notions or ideas supporting neither <A> nor <antiA>). The <neutA> and <antiA> ideas together are referred to as <nonA>. Neutrosophy is a generalization of Hegel's dialectics (the last one is based on <A> and <antiA> only). According to this theory every idea <A> tends to be neutralized and balanced by <antiA> and <nonA> ideas - as a state of equilibrium. In a classical way <A>, <neutA>, <antiA> are disjoint two by two. But, since in many cases the borders between notions are vague, imprecise, Sorites, it is possible that <A>, <neutA>, <antiA> (and <nonA> of course) have common parts two by two, or even all three of them as well. Neutrosophic Set and Neutrosophic Logic are generalizations of the fuzzy set and respectively fuzzy logic (especially of intuitionistic fuzzy set and respectively intuitionistic fuzzy logic).",Mathematics,970,N/A,0,en

Separation Axioms on Bipolar Hypersoft Topological Spaces,"Sagvan Y. Musa, Baravan A. Asaad",Infinite Study,2023-01-01,"According to its definition, a topological space could be a highly unexpected object. There are spaces (indiscrete space) which have only two open sets: the empty set and the entire space. In a discrete space, on the other hand, each set is open. These two artificial extremes are very rarely seen in actual practice. Most spaces in geometry and analysis fall somewhere between these two types of spaces. Accordingly, the separation axioms allow us to say with confidence whether a topological space contains a sufficient number of open sets to meet our needs. To this end, we use bipolar hypersoft (BHS) sets (one of the efficient tools to deal with ambiguity and vagueness) to define a new kind of separation axioms called BHS e Ti-space (i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4).",Mathematics,16,N/A,0,en

Emerging Curriculum,Andrew J.C. Begg,BRILL,2008-01-01,"An important contribution that ‘Emerging curriculum’ makes is a reconceptualizing of the curriculum development process. This moves development thinking from the traditional research-development-dissemination model to one that acknowledges: the interrelatedness of many influences on curriculum, the multi-layered nature of curriculum, and the complexity of the educational system in which curriculum exists. Indeed the educational system is envisaged as a ‘complex living system’ The study is autobiographical, it is based on a lifetime spent in education during which the author had a particular interest in curriculum and the associated development processes, and how one’s ideas about these change over time. ‘Emerging curriculum has been successfully submitted as a PhD thesis but was written as a book for a wider audience than the traditional thesis one. It shows by example how reflection on one’s work throughout one’s career can be considered as research and can contribute to knowledge in a similar way to that of more traditional doctoral research projects. It is hoped that teachers reading this will relate to the author’s experiences in schools, and will see themselves significant contributors to curriculum; that curriculum developers will be provoked into considering alternative ways of working; and that academics might move curriculum theorising closer to the reality of schools.",Education,248,N/A,0,en

However, a list of publications with two- and three-dimensional applications of the DIS method is brief. The book offers a comprehensive and rigorous treatment of the DIS method in two and three dimensions using the PDE approach to the Helmholtz decomposition that provides the most general background for mathematical modelling of harmonic waves in fluid dynamics, electrodynamics, heat transfer, and other numerous areas of science and engineering, which are dealing with propagation and interaction of N internal waves.",Science,460,N/A,0,en
"Boundary Value Problems on Time Scales, Volume I","Svetlin Georgiev, Khaled Zennir",CRC Press,2021-10-14,"Boundary Value Problems on Time Scales, Volume I is devoted to the qualitative theory of boundary value problems on time scales. Summarizing the most recent contributions in this area, it addresses a wide audience of specialists such as mathematicians, physicists, engineers and biologists. It can be used as a textbook at the graduate level and as a reference book for several disciplines. The text contains two volumes, both published by Chapman & Hall/CRC Press. Volume I presents boundary value problems for first- and second-order dynamic equations on time scales. Volume II investigates boundary value problems for three, four, and higher-order dynamic equations on time scales. Many results to differential equations carry over easily to corresponding results for difference equations, while other results seem to be totally different in nature. Because of these reasons, the theory of dynamic equations is an active area of research. The time-scale calculus can be applied to any field in which dynamic processes are described by discrete or continuous time models. The calculus of time scales has various applications involving noncontinuous domains such as certain bug populations, phytoremediation of metals, wound healing, maximization problems in economics, and traffic problems. Boundary value problems on time scales have been extensively investigated in simulating processes and the phenomena subject to short-time perturbations during their evolution. The material in this book is presented in highly readable, mathematically solid format. Many practical problems are illustrated displaying a wide variety of solution techniques. AUTHORS Svetlin G. Georgiev is a mathematician who has worked in various areas of the study. He currently focuses on harmonic analysis, functional analysis, partial differential equations, ordinary differential equations, Clifford and quaternion analysis, integral equations, and dynamic calculus on time scales.

An Introduction to the Mathematics of Biology: with Computer Algebra Models,"Edward K. Yeargers, James V. Herod, Ronald W. Shonkweiler",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-12-01,"Biology is a source of fascination for most scientists, whether their training is in the life sciences or not. In particular, there is a special satisfaction in discovering an understanding of biology in the context of another science like mathematics. Fortunately there are plenty of interesting (and fun) problems in biology, and virtually all scientific disciplines have become the richer for it. For example, two major journals, Mathematical Biosciences and Journal of Mathematical Biology, have tripled in size since their inceptions 20-25 years ago. The various sciences have a great deal to give to one another, but there are still too many fences separating them. In writing this book we have adopted the philosophy that mathematical biology is not merely the intrusion of one science into another, but has a unity of its own, in which both the biology and the math ematics should be equal and complete, and should flow smoothly into and out of one another. We have taught mathematical biology with this philosophy in mind and have seen profound changes in the outlooks of our science and engineering students: The attitude of ""Oh no, another pendulum on a spring problem!,"" or ""Yet one more LCD circuit!"" completely disappeared in the face of applications of mathematics in biology.

These essays—from leading names and fresh new voices—delve into the history, philosophy, teaching, and everyday aspects of math, offering surprising insights into its nature, meaning, and practice, and taking readers behind the scenes of today’s hottest mathematical debates. Here, Viktor Blåsjö gives a brief history of “lockdown mathematics”; Yelda Nasifoglu decodes the politics of a seventeenth-century play in which the characters are geometric shapes; and Andrew Lewis-Pye explains the basic algorithmic rules and computational procedures behind cryptocurrencies. In other essays, Terence Tao candidly recalls the adventures and misadventures of growing up to become a leading mathematician; Natalie Wolchover shows how old math gives new clues about whether time really flows; and David Hand discusses the problem of “dark data”—information that is missing or ignored.

Mathematics For Computation (M4c),"Marco Benini, Olaf Beyersdorff, Michael Rathjen, Peter Michael Schuster",World Scientific,2023-03-21,"The overall topic of the volume, Mathematics for Computation (M4C), is mathematics taking crucially into account the aspect of computation, investigating the interaction of mathematics with computation, bridging the gap between mathematics and computation wherever desirable and possible, and otherwise explaining why not.Recently, abstract mathematics has proved to have more computational content than ever expected. Indeed, the axiomatic method, originally intended to do away with concrete computations, seems to suit surprisingly well the programs-from-proofs paradigm, with abstraction helping not only clarity but also efficiency.Unlike computational mathematics, which rather focusses on objects of computational nature such as algorithms, the scope of M4C generally encompasses all the mathematics, including abstract concepts such as functions. The purpose of M4C actually is a strongly theory-based and therefore, is a more reliable and sustainable approach to actual computation, up to the systematic development of verified software.While M4C is situated within mathematical logic and the related area of theoretical computer science, in principle it involves all branches of mathematics, especially those which prompt computational considerations. In traditional terms, the topics of M4C include proof theory, constructive mathematics, complexity theory, reverse mathematics, type theory, category theory and domain theory.The aim of this volume is to provide a point of reference by presenting up-to-date contributions by some of the most active scholars in each field. A variety of approaches and techniques are represented to give as wide a view as possible and promote cross-fertilization between different styles and traditions.",Mathematics,477,N/A,0,en

Statistics for Management,R.S. Balasenthil,Shanlax Publications,N/A,"This book is written for MBA students and statistics teachers of Anna University affiliated institutions. It is a natural outcome of the author, after teaching statistics several times for MBA students. It is shaped and reshaped several times to heal the heart and soul of non-mathematical community. This book covers all models in all chapters, completely. Problem identification is the most difficult task in statistics for the students. Hence a new approach with short cuts is used throughout the book to simplify this task. This book differs from other books in approaching the sampling distribution. Sampling distribution chapter is usually classified based on standard error, confidence interval estimation and hypothesis testing; or based on the number of sample sets – one sample, two sample; or based on the sample size – large sample, small sample; or based on the statistical tables – such as z test, t test, chi square test and F test. But this book classifies the sampling distribution chapter based on the parameters – Mean, Proportion, Standard deviation cum Variance. Because the very first thing to be decided by any researcher or a practitioner or a decision maker before applying any statistical tool is the parameter to be used and none other! The syllabus is reorganized as per the convenience of the students. 2nd and 3rd unit of the syllabus is reorganized based on the parameters – Mean, Proportion and Standard deviation instead of standard error, interval estimation and hypothesis testing. Similarly the discrete distributions – binomial & Poisson distributions and Probability rules of 1st unit are dealt at the end. Probability rules are grouped based on two models – associated events and successive events. Each Chapter contains illustrations, examples, formula, short answers and exercise.",Business & Economics,253,N/A,0,en

The many advancements and branches of mathematics were developed through the centuries as people encountered problems and relied upon math to solve them. For instance: What timely invention was tampered with by the Caesars and almost perfected by a pope? Why did ten days vanish in September of 1752? How did Queen Victoria shorten the Sunday sermons at chapel? What important invention caused the world to be divided into time zones? What simple math problem caused the Mars Climate Orbiter to burn up in the Martian atmosphere? What common unit of measurement was originally based on the distance from the equator to the North Pole? Does water always boil at 212? Fahrenheit? What do Da Vinci's Last Supper and the Parthenon have in common? Why is a computer glitch called a ""bug""? It's amazing how ten simple digits can be used in an endless number of ways to benefit man. The development of these ten digits and their many uses is the fascinating story you hold in your hands: Exploring the World of Mathematics.",Religion,159,N/A,0,en

Without it, there would be no computers, no microwave ovens, no GPS, and no space travel. But before it gave modern man almost infinite powers, calculus was behind centuries of controversy, competition, and even death. Taking us on a thrilling journey through three millennia, professor Steven Strogatz charts the development of this seminal achievement from the days of Aristotle to today's million-dollar reward that awaits whoever cracks Reimann's hypothesis. Filled with idiosyncratic characters from Pythagoras to Euler, Infinite Powers is a compelling human drama that reveals the legacy of calculus on nearly every aspect of modern civilization, including science, politics, ethics, philosophy, and much besides.",Biography & Autobiography,389,N/A,0,en

X and the City,John Adam,Princeton University Press,2013-12,"What mathematical modeling uncovers about life in the city X and the City, a book of diverse and accessible math-based topics, uses basic modeling to explore a wide range of entertaining questions about urban life. How do you estimate the number of dental or doctor's offices, gas stations, restaurants, or movie theaters in a city of a given size? How can mathematics be used to maximize traffic flow through tunnels? Can you predict whether a traffic light will stay green long enough for you to cross the intersection? And what is the likelihood that your city will be hit by an asteroid? Every math problem and equation in this book tells a story and examples are explained throughout in an informal and witty style. The level of mathematics ranges from precalculus through calculus to some differential equations, and any reader with knowledge of elementary calculus will be able to follow the materials with ease.

The Calculus of Friendship,Steven Strogatz,Princeton University Press,2011-03-07,"The Calculus of Friendship is the story of an extraordinary connection between a teacher and a student, as chronicled through more than thirty years of letters between them. What makes their relationship unique is that it is based almost entirely on a shared love of calculus. For them, calculus is more than a branch of mathematics; it is a game they love playing together, a constant when all else is in flux. The teacher goes from the prime of his career to retirement, competes in whitewater kayaking at the international level, and loses a son. The student matures from high school math whiz to Ivy League professor, suffers the sudden death of a parent, and blunders into a marriage destined to fail. Yet through it all they take refuge in the haven of calculus--until a day comes when calculus is no longer enough. Like calculus itself, The Calculus of Friendship is an exploration of change. It's about the transformation that takes place in a student's heart, as he and his teacher reverse roles, as they age, as they are buffeted by life itself. Written by a renowned teacher and communicator of mathematics, The Calculus of Friendship is warm, intimate, and deeply moving. The most inspiring ideas of calculus, differential equations, and chaos theory are explained through metaphors, images, and anecdotes in a way that all readers will find beautiful, and even poignant. Math enthusiasts, from high school students to professionals, will delight in the offbeat problems and lucid explanations in the letters. For anyone whose life has been changed by a mentor, The Calculus of Friendship will be an unforgettable journey.",Mathematics,181,N/A,0,en

X Marks the Spot,"Richard Garfinkle, David Garfinkle",CRC Press,2021-02-04,"X Marks the Spot is written from the point of view of the users of mathematics. Since the beginning, mathematical concepts and techniques (such as arithmetic and geometry) were created as tools with a particular purpose like counting sheep and measuring land areas. Understanding those purposes leads to a greater understanding of why mathematics developed as it did. Later mathematical concepts came from a process of abstracting and generalizing earlier mathematics. This process of abstraction is very powerful, but often comes at the price of intuition and understanding. This book strives to give a guided tour of the development of various branches of mathematics (and what they’re used for) that will give the reader this intuitive understanding. Features Treats mathematical techniques as tools, and areas of mathematics as the result of abstracting and generalizing earlier mathematical tools Written in a relaxed conversational and occasionally humorous style making it easy to follow even when discussing esoterica. Unravels how mathematicians think, demystifying math and connecting it to the ways non-mathematicians think and connecting math to people’s lives Discusses how math education can be improved in order to prevent future generations from being turned off by math.",Mathematics,483,N/A,0,en
The Number Line through Guided Inquiry,"David M.

By presenting just that part of the subject that underlies the high school curriculum, this book offers an alternative to a standard real analysis sequence for advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate students. It will give any student a much deeper understanding of the mathematics that they were taught in high school. Written in a guided-inquiry format, this book consists of a carefully scaffolded sequence of definitions, problems, and theorems that guides students through each topic. Readers solve the problems and prove the theorems on their own and present their results to their peers with the instructor as a mentor and a guide. Students will learn not only the mathematics, but also how to help others learn mathematics. They will learn to think creatively and to make compelling arguments to justify their conclusions. They will learn to listen critically to others and give constructive feedback. Ultimately, they will learn to work as a team to answer the bigger questions and build a common understanding of the broader subject.",Mathematics,148,N/A,0,en

How Not to Be Wrong,Jordan Ellenberg,Penguin,2015-05-26,"“Witty, compelling, and just plain fun to read . . ."" —Evelyn Lamb, Scientific American The Freakonomics of math—a math-world superstar unveils the hidden beauty and logic of the world and puts its power in our hands The math we learn in school can seem like a dull set of rules, laid down by the ancients and not to be questioned. In How Not to Be Wrong, Jordan Ellenberg shows us how terribly limiting this view is: Math isn’t confined to abstract incidents that never occur in real life, but rather touches everything we do—the whole world is shot through with it. Math allows us to see the hidden structures underneath the messy and chaotic surface of our world. It’s a science of not being wrong, hammered out by centuries of hard work and argument. Armed with the tools of mathematics, we can see through to the true meaning of information we take for granted: How early should you get to the airport? What does “public opinion” really represent? Why do tall parents have shorter children? Who really won Florida in 2000? And how likely are you, really, to develop cancer? How Not to Be Wrong presents the surprising revelations behind all of these questions and many more, using the mathematician’s method of analyzing life and exposing the hard-won insights of the academic community to the layman—minus the jargon. Ellenberg chases mathematical threads through a vast range of time and space, from the everyday to the cosmic, encountering, among other things, baseball, Reaganomics, daring lottery schemes, Voltaire, the replicability crisis in psychology, Italian Renaissance painting, artificial languages, the development of non-Euclidean geometry, the coming obesity apocalypse, Antonin Scalia’s views on crime and punishment, the psychology of slime molds, what Facebook can and can’t figure out about you, and the existence of God. Ellenberg pulls from history as well as from the latest theoretical developments to provide those not trained in math with the knowledge they need. Math, as Ellenberg says, is “an atomic-powered prosthesis that you attach to your common sense, vastly multiplying its reach and strength.” With the tools of mathematics in hand, you can understand the world in a deeper, more meaningful way. How Not to Be Wrong will show you how.",Mathematics,482,3,1,en

Zero has pitted East against West and faith against reason, and its intransigence persists in the dark core of a black hole and the brilliant flash of the Big Bang. Today, zero lies at the heart of one of the biggest scientific controversies of all time: the quest for a theory of everything. Within the concept of zero lies a philosophical and scientific history of humanity. Charles Seife's elegant and witty account takes us from Aristotle to superstring theory by way of Egyptian geometry, Kabbalism, Einstein, the Chandrasekhar limit and Stephen Hawking.

The Nature and Role of Algebra in the K-14 Curriculum,"Center for Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Education, National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and Mathematical Sciences Education Board, National Research Council",National Academies Press,1998-10-07,"With the 1989 release of Everybody Counts by the Mathematical Sciences Education Board (MSEB) of the National Research Council and the Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), the ""standards movement"" in K-12 education was launched. Since that time, the MSEB and the NCTM have remained committed to deepening the public debate, discourse, and understanding of the principles and implications of standards-based reform. One of the main tenets in the NCTM Standards is commitment to providing high-quality mathematical experiences to all students. Another feature of the Standards is emphasis on development of specific mathematical topics across the grades. In particular, the Standards emphasize the importance of algebraic thinking as an essential strand in the elementary school curriculum. Issues related to school algebra are pivotal in many ways. Traditionally, algebra in high school or earlier has been considered a gatekeeper, critical to participation in postsecondary education, especially for minority students. Yet, as traditionally taught, first-year algebra courses have been characterized as an unmitigated disaster for most students. There have been many shifts in the algebra curriculum in schools within recent years. Some of these have been successful first steps in increasing enrollment in algebra and in broadening the scope of the algebra curriculum. Others have compounded existing problems. Algebra is not yet conceived of as a K-14 subject. Issues of opportunity and equity persist. Because there is no one answer to the dilemma of how to deal with algebra, making progress requires sustained dialogue, experimentation, reflection, and communication of ideas and practices at both the local and national levels. As an initial step in moving from national-level dialogue and speculations to concerted local and state level work on the role of algebra in the curriculum, the MSEB and the NCTM co-sponsored a national symposium, ""The Nature and Role of Algebra in the K-14 Curriculum,"" on May 27 and 28, 1997, at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C.",Education,206,N/A,0,en

Fugitive Pedagogy,Jarvis R.

Altschuler, Florida Courier “A long-overdue labor of love and analysis...that would make Woodson, the ever-rigorous teacher, proud.” —Randal Maurice Jelks, Los Angeles Review of Books “Fascinating, and groundbreaking. Givens restores Carter G. Woodson, one of the most important educators and intellectuals of the twentieth century, to his rightful place alongside figures like W. E. B. Du Bois and Ida B. Wells.” —Imani Perry, author of May We Forever Stand: A History of the Black National Anthem Black education was subversive from its inception. African Americans pursued education through clandestine means, often in defiance of law and custom, even under threat of violence. They developed what Jarvis Givens calls a tradition of “fugitive pedagogy”—a theory and practice of Black education epitomized by Carter G. Woodson—groundbreaking historian, founder of Black History Month, and legendary educator under Jim Crow. Givens shows that Woodson succeeded because of the world of Black teachers to which he belonged. Fugitive Pedagogy chronicles his ambitious efforts to fight what he called the “mis-education of the Negro” by helping teachers and students to see themselves and their mission as set apart from an anti-Black world. Teachers, students, families, and communities worked together, using Woodson’s materials and methods as they fought for power in schools.

An Imaginary Tale,Paul Nahin,Princeton University Press,2010-02-22,"Today complex numbers have such widespread practical use--from electrical engineering to aeronautics--that few people would expect the story behind their derivation to be filled with adventure and enigma. In An Imaginary Tale, Paul Nahin tells the 2000-year-old history of one of mathematics' most elusive numbers, the square root of minus one, also known as i. He recreates the baffling mathematical problems that conjured it up, and the colorful characters who tried to solve them. In 1878, when two brothers stole a mathematical papyrus from the ancient Egyptian burial site in the Valley of Kings, they led scholars to the earliest known occurrence of the square root of a negative number. The papyrus offered a specific numerical example of how to calculate the volume of a truncated square pyramid, which implied the need for i. In the first century, the mathematician-engineer Heron of Alexandria encountered I in a separate project, but fudged the arithmetic; medieval mathematicians stumbled upon the concept while grappling with the meaning of negative numbers, but dismissed their square roots as nonsense. By the time of Descartes, a theoretical use for these elusive square roots--now called ""imaginary numbers""--was suspected, but efforts to solve them led to intense, bitter debates. The notorious i finally won acceptance and was put to use in complex analysis and theoretical physics in Napoleonic times. Addressing readers with both a general and scholarly interest in mathematics, Nahin weaves into this narrative entertaining historical facts and mathematical discussions, including the application of complex numbers and functions to important problems, such as Kepler's laws of planetary motion and ac electrical circuits. This book can be read as an engaging history, almost a biography, of one of the most evasive and pervasive ""numbers"" in all of mathematics.

This is a very old science and its gems have lost their charm for us through everyday use. We have tried in this book to refresh them for you. The main part of the book is made up of problems. The best way to deal with them is: Solve the problem by yourself - compare your solution with the solution in the book (if it exists) - go to the next problem. However, if you have difficulties solving a problem (and some of them are quite difficult), you may read the hint or start to read the solution. If there is no solution in the book for some problem, you may skip it (it is not heavily used in the sequel) and return to it later. The book is divided into sections devoted to different topics. Some of them are very short, others are rather long. Of course, you know arithmetic pretty well.

One of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people in the world and the bestselling author of Warped Passages, Lisa Randall is an expert in both particle physics (the study of the smallest objects we know of) and cosmology (the study of the largest). In this book, Randall takes us on an amazing tour through the latest developments in physics—including a new preface explaining the thrilling discovery of the Higgs boson—and the theoretical concepts underlying this work. Knocking on Heaven’s Door also explores the role of risk, creativity, uncertainty, beauty, and truth in scientific thinking. Through provocative conversations with leading figures in other fields, including chef David Chang, forecaster Nate Silver, and screenwriter Scott Derrickson, and through reflections on her own work, Randall makes an impassioned argument in defense of science. Praise for Knocking on Heaven’s Door “Randall is . . . one of the more original theorists at work in the profession today. . . .

Mathematical Thinking and Problem Solving,"Alan H. Schoenfeld, Alan H. Sloane",Routledge,2016-05-06,"In the early 1980s there was virtually no serious communication among the various groups that contribute to mathematics education -- mathematicians, mathematics educators, classroom teachers, and cognitive scientists. Members of these groups came from different traditions, had different perspectives, and rarely gathered in the same place to discuss issues of common interest. Part of the problem was that there was no common ground for the discussions -- given the disparate traditions and perspectives. As one way of addressing this problem, the Sloan Foundation funded two conferences in the mid-1980s, bringing together members of the different communities in a ground clearing effort, designed to establish a base for communication. In those conferences, interdisciplinary teams reviewed major topic areas and put together distillations of what was known about them.* A more recent conference -- upon which this volume is based -- offered a forum in which various people involved in education reform would present their work, and members of the broad communities gathered would comment on it. The focus was primarily on college mathematics, informed by developments in K-12 mathematics. The main issues of the conference were mathematical thinking and problem solving.",Education,360,N/A,0,en

Proficiency and Beliefs in Learning and Teaching Mathematics,"Yeping Li, Judit N. Moschkovich",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-09-04,"Efforts to improve mathematics education have led educators and researchers to not only study the nature of proficiency, beliefs, and practices in mathematics learn¬ing and teaching, but also identify and assess possible influences on students’ and teachers’ proficiencies, beliefs, and practices in learning and teaching mathematics. The complexity of these topics has fascinated researchers from various back¬grounds, including psychologists, cognitive or learning scientists, mathematicians, and mathematics educators. Among those researchers, two scholars with a similar background – Alan Schoenfeld in the United States and Günter Törner in Germany, are internationally recognized for their contributions to these topics. To celebrate their 65th birthdays in 2012, this book brought together many scholars to reflect on how their own work has built upon and continued Alan and Günter’s work in mathematics education. The book contains 17 chapters by 33 scholars from six different education systems.

Fostering Children's Mathematical Power,"Arthur J. Baroody, Ronald T. Coslick",Routledge,1998-09-01,"Teachers have the responsibility of helping all of their students construct the disposition and knowledge needed to live successfully in a complex and rapidly changing world. To meet the challenges of the 21st century, students will especially need mathematical power: a positive disposition toward mathematics (curiosity and self confidence), facility with the processes of mathematical inquiry (problem solving, reasoning and communicating), and well connected mathematical knowledge (an understanding of mathematical concepts, procedures and formulas). This guide seeks to help teachers achieve the capability to foster children's mathematical power - the ability to excite them about mathematics, help them see that it makes sense, and enable them to harness its might for solving everyday and extraordinary problems. The investigative approach attempts to foster mathematical power by making mathematics instruction process-based, understandable or relevant to the everyday life of students. Past efforts to reform mathematics instruction have focused on only one or two of these aims, whereas the investigative approach accomplishes all three. By teaching content in a purposeful context, an inquiry-based fashion, and a meaningful manner, this approach promotes chilren's mathematical learning in an interesting, thought-provoking and comprehensible way. This teaching guide is designed to help teachers appreciate the need for the investigative approach and to provide practical advice on how to make this approach happen in the classroom. It not only dispenses information, but also serves as a catalyst for exploring, conjecturing about, discussing and contemplating the teaching and learning of mathematics.",Education,1096,N/A,0,en

Rigorous Mathematical Thinking,"James T. Kinard, Alex Kozulin",Cambridge University Press,2008-06-02,This book demonstrates how rigorous mathematical thinking can be fostered through the development of students' cognitive tools and operations. This approach seems to be particularly effective with socially disadvantaged and culturally different students. The authors argue that children's cognitive functions cannot be viewed as following a natural maturational path: they should be actively constructed during the educational process. The Rigorous Mathematical Thinking (RMT) model is based on two major theoretical approaches – Vygotsky's theory of psychological tools and Feuerstein's concept of mediated learning experience. The book starts with general cognitive tools that are essential for all types of problem solving and then moves to mathematically specific cognitive tools and methods for utilizing these tools for mathematical conceptual formation. The application of the RMT model in various urban classrooms demonstrates how mathematics education standards can be reached even by the students with a history of educational failure who were considered hopeless underachievers.,Psychology,210,N/A,0,en

Imagine failing 11th grade math – twice! – and going on to be known affectionately as The Lady Gaga of Math. That is the story of author Vanessa ""The Math Guru"" Vakharia. Thanks to an inspiring teacher who helped Vanessa heal her own relationship with math, Vanessa was then able to see math in a way that literally changed the trajectory of her life. Most people have experienced math trauma at least once, but by early-mid elementary school, many students have gotten the message that either they are a math person or they are not. In Math TherapyTM, Vanessa shows that with the right tools and strategies, teachers can foster a culture in which every student is capable of building a better relationship with math – and with themselves. Through the five M’s of Math TherapyTM—Mythbust, Moderate, Motivate, Makeover, and Measure—teachers can help their students overcome math trauma, cultivate a positive math identity, and develop a mathematical mindset.

Enlightening Symbols,Joseph Mazur,Princeton University Press,2014-03-23,"An entertaining look at the origins of mathematical symbols While all of us regularly use basic math symbols such as those for plus, minus, and equals, few of us know that many of these symbols weren't available before the sixteenth century. What did mathematicians rely on for their work before then? And how did mathematical notations evolve into what we know today? In Enlightening Symbols, popular math writer Joseph Mazur explains the fascinating history behind the development of our mathematical notation system. He shows how symbols were used initially, how one symbol replaced another over time, and how written math was conveyed before and after symbols became widely adopted. Traversing mathematical history and the foundations of numerals in different cultures, Mazur looks at how historians have disagreed over the origins of the numerical system for the past two centuries. He follows the transfigurations of algebra from a rhetorical style to a symbolic one, demonstrating that most algebra before the sixteenth century was written in prose or in verse employing the written names of numerals. Mazur also investigates the subconscious and psychological effects that mathematical symbols have had on mathematical thought, moods, meaning, communication, and comprehension. He considers how these symbols influence us (through similarity, association, identity, resemblance, and repeated imagery), how they lead to new ideas by subconscious associations, how they make connections between experience and the unknown, and how they contribute to the communication of basic mathematics. From words to abbreviations to symbols, this book shows how math evolved to the familiar forms we use today.",Mathematics,311,N/A,0,en

During this conference, a special session was held on th the occasion of the 50 birthday of the well known mathematician and math ematical economist Professor Charalambos Aliprantis, who, by his numerous friends, is usually called Roko. The story behind this nickname is not quite clear yet; it will be investigated further and will be made public prior to his th 60 birthday. (At this moment we have already found out that it has nothing to do with the famous movie Rocco and his Brothers even though Roko does have two brothers. ) Roko was born on the Greek island of Cephalonia on May 12,1946, and his elementary and secondary school education took place there. At 18 he entered the Mathematics Department at the University of Athens. Upon graduation from the University of Athens he proceeded with his graduate studies at Cal tech, where in 1973 he completed his Ph. D. degree in Mathematics under the supervision of Professor W. A. J. Luxemburg. His research career can be divided into two periods. The first one, till 1981, was devoted entirely to pure mathematics. The other one, after 1981, has been subdivided between pure mathematics and mathematical economics.

In what follows, there are some discussion and literature reviews about them. \\ First article is titled ``properties of SuperHyperGraph and neutrosophic SuperHyperGraph'' in \textbf{Ref.} \cite{HG1} by Henry Garrett (2022). It's first step toward the research on neutrosophic SuperHyperGraphs. This research article is published on the journal ``Neutrosophic Sets and Systems'' in issue 49 and the pages 531-561. In this research article, different types of notions like dominating, resolving, coloring, Eulerian(Hamiltonian) neutrosophic path, n-Eulerian(Hamiltonian) neutrosophic path, zero forcing number, zero forcing neutrosophic- number, independent number, independent neutrosophic-number, clique number, clique neutrosophic-number, matching number, matching neutrosophic-number, girth, neutrosophic girth, 1-zero-forcing number, 1-zero- forcing neutrosophic-number, failed 1-zero-forcing number, failed 1-zero-forcing neutrosophic-number, global- offensive alliance, t-offensive alliance, t-defensive alliance, t-powerful alliance, and global-powerful alliance are defined in SuperHyperGraph and neutrosophic SuperHyperGraph. Some Classes of SuperHyperGraph and Neutrosophic SuperHyperGraph are cases of research. Some results are applied in family of SuperHyperGraph and neutrosophic SuperHyperGraph. Thus this research article has concentrated on the vast notions and introducing the majority of notions. \\ The seminal paper and groundbreaking article is titled ``neutrosophic co-degree and neutrosophic degree alongside chromatic numbers in the setting of some classes related to neutrosophic hypergraphs'' in \textbf{Ref.} \cite{HG2} by Henry Garrett (2022). In this research article, a novel approach is implemented on SuperHyperGraph and neutrosophic SuperHyperGraph based on general forms without using neutrosophic classes of neutrosophic SuperHyperGraph. It's published in prestigious and fancy journal is entitled “Journal of Current Trends in Computer Science Research (JCTCSR)” with abbreviation ``J Curr Trends Comp Sci Res'' in volume 1 and issue 1 with pages 06-14. The research article studies deeply with choosing neutrosophic hypergraphs instead of neutrosophic SuperHyperGraph. It's the breakthrough toward independent results based on initial background. \\ The seminal paper and groundbreaking article is titled ``Super Hyper Dominating and Super Hyper Resolving on Neutrosophic Super Hyper Graphs and Their Directions in Game Theory and Neutrosophic Super Hyper Classes'' in \textbf{Ref.} \cite{HG3} by Henry Garrett (2022). In this research article, a novel approach is implemented on SuperHyperGraph and neutrosophic SuperHyperGraph based on fundamental SuperHyperNumber and using neutrosophic SuperHyperClasses of neutrosophic SuperHyperGraph. It's published in prestigious and fancy journal is entitled “Journal of Mathematical Techniques and Computational Mathematics(JMTCM)” with abbreviation ``J Math Techniques Comput Math'' in volume 1 and issue 3 with pages 242-263. The research article studies deeply with choosing directly neutrosophic SuperHyperGraph and SuperHyperGraph. It's the breakthrough toward independent results based on initial background and fundamental SuperHyperNumbers. \\ In some articles are titled ``0039 | Closing Numbers and Super-Closing Numbers as

An Introduction to Multilevel Modeling Techniques,"Ronald H. Heck, Scott L. Thomas",Routledge,2015-03-05,"Univariate and multivariate multilevel models are used to understand how to design studies and analyze data in this comprehensive text distinguished by its variety of applications from the educational, behavioral, and social sciences. Basic and advanced models are developed from the multilevel regression (MLM) and latent variable (SEM) traditions within one unified analytic framework for investigating hierarchical data. The authors provide examples using each modeling approach and also explore situations where alternative approaches may be more appropriate, given the research goals. Numerous examples and exercises allow readers to test their understanding of the techniques presented. Changes to the new edition include: -The use of Mplus 7.2 for running the analyses including the input and data files at www.routledge.com/9781848725522. -Expanded discussion of MLM and SEM model-building that outlines the steps taken in the process, the relevant Mplus syntax, and tips on how to evaluate the models. -Expanded pedagogical program now with chapter objectives, boldfaced key terms, a glossary, and more tables and graphs to help students better understand key concepts and techniques. -Numerous, varied examples developed throughout which make this book appropriate for use in education, psychology, business, sociology, and the health sciences. -Expanded coverage of missing data problems in MLM using ML estimation and multiple imputation to provide currently-accepted solutions (Ch. 10). -New chapter on three-level univariate and multilevel multivariate MLM models provides greater options for investigating more complex theoretical relationships(Ch.4). -New chapter on MLM and SEM models with categorical outcomes facilitates the specification of multilevel models with observed and latent outcomes (Ch.8). -New chapter on multilevel and longitudinal mixture models provides readers with options for identifying emergent groups in hierarchical data (Ch.9). -New chapter on the utilization of sample weights, power analysis, and missing data provides guidance on technical issues of increasing concern for research publication (Ch.10). Ideal as a text for graduate courses on multilevel, longitudinal, latent variable modeling, multivariate statistics, or advanced quantitative techniques taught in psychology, business, education, health, and sociology, this book’s practical approach also appeals to researchers. Recommended prerequisites are introductory univariate and multivariate statistics.",Psychology,461,N/A,0,en

Readers are guided through the selection of a sample by working on a set of concrete tasks presented in the text, using data files in an accompanying CD. One section of Volume 3 is devoted to typical tasks involved in preparing, validating and managing data. Users are expected to develop competence in data preparation skills by carrying out the practical exercises in the CD. They are also shown how to complete important pre-analysis steps such as compute survey weights, calculate means and their sampling errors, and how to deal with non-responses and oversize and undersize schools.

Throughout the text, programs that use graphical images are emphasized to clearly demonstrate all the important programming principles. The authors use a spiral approach to programming concepts; introducing concepts simply early on, then in a more sophisticated way later, (e.g., objects are integrated throughout five chapters). Java for Students emphasizes the use of applets but also shows how to program free-standing applications.

The Art of Logic in an Illogical World,Eugenia Cheng,Basic Books,2018-09-11,"How both logical and emotional reasoning can help us live better in our post-truth world In a world where fake news stories change election outcomes, has rationality become futile? In The Art of Logic in an Illogical World, Eugenia Cheng throws a lifeline to readers drowning in the illogic of contemporary life. Cheng is a mathematician, so she knows how to make an airtight argument. But even for her, logic sometimes falls prey to emotion, which is why she still fears flying and eats more cookies than she should. If a mathematician can't be logical, what are we to do? In this book, Cheng reveals the inner workings and limitations of logic, and explains why alogic -- for example, emotion -- is vital to how we think and communicate. Cheng shows us how to use logic and alogic together to navigate a world awash in bigotry, mansplaining, and manipulative memes. Insightful, useful, and funny, this essential book is for anyone who wants to think more clearly.",Mathematics,296,5,1,en

Discovering Mathematics,A. Gardiner,Courier Corporation,2006-01-26,"The term ""mathematics"" usually suggests an array of familiar problems with solutions derived from well-known techniques. Discovering Mathematics: The Art of Investigation takes a different approach, exploring how new ideas and chance observations can be pursued, and focusing on how the process invariably leads to interesting questions that would never have otherwise arisen. With puzzles involving coins, postage stamps, and other commonplace items, students are challenged to account for the simple explanations behind perplexing mathematical phenomena. Elementary methods and solutions allow readers to concentrate on the way in which the material is explored, as well as on strategies for answers that aren't immediately obvious. The problems don't require the kind of sophistication that would put them out of reach of ordinary students, but they're sufficiently complex to capture the essential features of mathematical discovery.

In this volume, Javier Leach, a mathematician and Jesuit priest, leads a fascinating study of the historical development of mathematical language and its influence on the evolution of metaphysical and theological languages. Leach traces three historical moments of change in this evolution: the introduction of the deductive method in Greece, the use of mathematics as a language of science in modern times, and the formalization of mathematical languages in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. As he unfolds this fascinating history, Leach notes the striking differences and interrelations between the two languages of science and religion. Until now there has been little reflection on these similarities and differences, or about how both languages can complement and enrich each other.",Religion,0,N/A,0,en

Teaching Mathematics Through Problem-Solving,Akihiko Takahashi,Routledge,2021-03-31,"This engaging book offers an in-depth introduction to teaching mathematics through problem-solving, providing lessons and techniques that can be used in classrooms for both primary and lower secondary grades. Based on the innovative and successful Japanese approaches of Teaching Through Problem-solving (TTP) and Collaborative Lesson Research (CLR), renowned mathematics education scholar Akihiko Takahashi demonstrates how these teaching methods can be successfully adapted in schools outside of Japan. TTP encourages students to try and solve a problem independently, rather than relying on the format of lectures and walkthroughs provided in classrooms across the world. Teaching Mathematics Through Problem-Solving gives educators the tools to restructure their lesson and curriculum design to make creative and adaptive problem-solving the main way students learn new procedures. Takahashi showcases TTP lessons for elementary and secondary classrooms, showing how teachers can create their own TTP lessons and units using techniques adapted from Japanese educators through CLR. Examples are discussed in relation to the Common Core State Standards, though the methods and lessons offered can be used in any country. Teaching Mathematics Through Problem-Solving offers an innovative new approach to teaching mathematics written by a leading expert in Japanese mathematics education, suitable for pre-service and in-service primary and secondary math educators.",Education,159,N/A,0,en

Using one very entertaining cow, math teacher Taryn Souders has devised a very clever (and fun) way of explaining fractions to beginning learners. One whole cow, calmly eating hay, decided to act differently on this particular day. One whole cow - what should we do? I know! Let's paint one half blue! Prompted by a poem and a visual clue, students are asked to answer what fraction is illustrated in the cow's antics, starting with halves and progressing into thirds, fourths, eighths, and tenths. What fraction of the cow is blue? Answer: ½ What fraction of the cow is white? Answer: ½ With the math problem featured as part of the artwork, students get an immediate sense of how to apply and understand the concept of fractions. How moo-velous! Taryn J.

Elements of Mathematics,John Stillwell,Princeton University Press,2016-05-31,"An exciting look at the world of elementary mathematics Elements of Mathematics takes readers on a fascinating tour that begins in elementary mathematics—but, as John Stillwell shows, this subject is not as elementary or straightforward as one might think. Not all topics that are part of today's elementary mathematics were always considered as such, and great mathematical advances and discoveries had to occur in order for certain subjects to become ""elementary."" Stillwell examines elementary mathematics from a distinctive twenty-first-century viewpoint and describes not only the beauty and scope of the discipline, but also its limits. From Gaussian integers to propositional logic, Stillwell delves into arithmetic, computation, algebra, geometry, calculus, combinatorics, probability, and logic. He discusses how each area ties into more advanced topics to build mathematics as a whole. Through a rich collection of basic principles, vivid examples, and interesting problems, Stillwell demonstrates that elementary mathematics becomes advanced with the intervention of infinity. Infinity has been observed throughout mathematical history, but the recent development of ""reverse mathematics"" confirms that infinity is essential for proving well-known theorems, and helps to determine the nature, contours, and borders of elementary mathematics. Elements of Mathematics gives readers, from high school students to professional mathematicians, the highlights of elementary mathematics and glimpses of the parts of math beyond its boundaries.",Mathematics,439,N/A,0,en

A Course in Mathematical Logic for Mathematicians,Yu. I. Manin,Springer Science & Business Media,2009-10-13,"1. The ?rst edition of this book was published in 1977. The text has been well received and is still used, although it has been out of print for some time. In the intervening three decades, a lot of interesting things have happened to mathematical logic: (i) Model theory has shown that insights acquired in the study of formal languages could be used fruitfully in solving old problems of conventional mathematics. (ii) Mathematics has been and is moving with growing acceleration from the set-theoretic language of structures to the language and intuition of (higher) categories, leaving behind old concerns about in?nities: a new view of foundations is now emerging. (iii) Computer science, a no-nonsense child of the abstract computability theory, has been creatively dealing with old challenges and providing new ones, such as the P/NP problem. Planning additional chapters for this second edition, I have decided to focus onmodeltheory,the conspicuousabsenceofwhichinthe ?rsteditionwasnoted in several reviews, and the theory of computation, including its categorical and quantum aspects. The whole Part IV: Model Theory, is new. I am very grateful to Boris I. Zilber, who kindly agreed to write it. It may be read directly after Chapter II.

The book provides an insight into a large domain of research with emphasis to the discussion of several theories, methods and problems in approximation theory, analytic inequalities, functional analysis, computational algebra and applications. The notion of stability of functional equations has its origins with S. M. Ulam, who posed the fundamental problem for approximate homomorphisms in 1940 and with D. H. Hyers, Th. M. Rassias, who provided the first significant solutions for additive and linear mappings in 1941 and 1978, respectively. During the last decade the notion of stability of functional equations has evolved into a very active domain of mathematical research with several applications of interdisciplinary nature. The chapters of this handbook focus mainly on both old and recent developments on the equation of homomorphism for square symmetric groupoids, the linear and polynomial functional equations in a single variable, the Drygas functional equation on amenable semigroups, monomial functional equation, the Cauchy–Jensen type mappings, differential equations and differential operators, operational equations and inclusions, generalized module left higher derivations, selections of set-valued mappings, D’Alembert’s functional equation, characterizations of information measures, functional equations in restricted domains, as well as generalized functional stability and fixed point theory.",Mathematics,394,N/A,0,en
Geometry of Hypersurfaces,"Thomas E. Cecil, Patrick J. Ryan",Springer,2015-10-30,"This exposition provides the state-of-the art on the differential geometry of hypersurfaces in real, complex, and quaternionic space forms. Special emphasis is placed on isoparametric and Dupin hypersurfaces in real space forms as well as Hopf hypersurfaces in complex space forms. The book is accessible to a reader who has completed a one-year graduate course in differential geometry. The text, including open problems and an extensive list of references, is an excellent resource for researchers in this area. Geometry of Hypersurfaces begins with the basic theory of submanifolds in real space forms. Topics include shape operators, principal curvatures and foliations, tubes and parallel hypersurfaces, curvature spheres and focal submanifolds. The focus then turns to the theory of isoparametric hypersurfaces in spheres. Important examples and classification results are given, including the construction of isoparametric hypersurfaces based on representations of Clifford algebras. An in-depth treatment of Dupin hypersurfaces follows with results that are proved in the context of Lie sphere geometry as well as those that are obtained using standard methods of submanifold theory. Next comes a thorough treatment of the theory of real hypersurfaces in complex space forms. A central focus is a complete proof of the classification of Hopf hypersurfaces with constant principal curvatures due to Kimura and Berndt. The book concludes with the basic theory of real hypersurfaces in quaternionic space forms, including statements of the major classification results and directions for further research.",Mathematics,601,N/A,0,en

Counterexamples in Operator Theory,Mohammed Hichem Mortad,Springer Nature,2022-05-03,"This text is the first of its kind exclusively devoted to counterexamples in operator theory and includes over 500 problems on bounded and unbounded linear operators in Hilbert spaces. This volume is geared towards graduate students studying operator theory, and the author has designated the difficulty level for each counterexample, indicating which ones are also suitable for advanced undergraduate students. The first half of the book focuses on bounded linear operators, including counterexamples in the areas of operator topologies, matrices of bounded operators, square roots, the spectrum, operator exponentials, and non-normal operators. The second part of the book is devoted to unbounded linear operators in areas such as closedness and closability, self-adjointness, normality, commutativity, and the spectrum, concluding with a chapter that features some open problems. Chapters begin with a brief “Basics” section for the readers’ reference, and many of the counterexamples included are the author’s original work. Counterexamples in Operator Theory can be used by students in graduate courses on operator theory and advanced matrix theory. Previous coursework in advanced linear algebra, operator theory, and functional analysis is assumed. Researchers, quantum physicists, and undergraduate students studying functional analysis and operator theory will also find this book to be a useful reference.",Mathematics,613,N/A,0,en

The Elementary Theory of Groups,"Benjamin Fine, Anthony Gaglione, Alexei Myasnikov, Gerhard Rosenberger, Dennis Spellman",Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG,2014-10-29,After being an open question for sixty years the Tarski conjecture was answered in the affirmative by Olga Kharlampovich and Alexei Myasnikov and independently by Zlil Sela. Both proofs involve long and complicated applications of algebraic geometry over free groups as well as an extension of methods to solve equations in free groups originally developed by Razborov. This book is an examination of the material on the general elementary theory of groups that is necessary to begin to understand the proofs. This material includes a complete exposition of the theory of fully residually free groups or limit groups as well a complete description of the algebraic geometry of free groups. Also included are introductory material on combinatorial and geometric group theory and first-order logic. There is then a short outline of the proof of the Tarski conjectures in the manner of Kharlampovich and Myasnikov.,Mathematics,322,N/A,0,en

The Classification of the Virtually Cyclic Subgroups of the Sphere Braid Groups,"Daciberg Lima Goncalves, John Guaschi",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-09-08,"This manuscript is devoted to classifying the isomorphism classes of the virtually cyclic subgroups of the braid groups of the 2-sphere. As well as enabling us to understand better the global structure of these groups, it marks an important step in the computation of the K-theory of their group rings. The classification itself is somewhat intricate, due to the rich structure of the finite subgroups of these braid groups, and is achieved by an in-depth analysis of their group-theoretical and topological properties, such as their centralisers, normalisers and cohomological periodicity. Another important aspect of our work is the close relationship of the braid groups with mapping class groups. This manuscript will serve as a reference for the study of braid groups of low-genus surfaces, and isaddressed to graduate students and researchers in low-dimensional, geometric and algebraic topology and in algebra. ​",Mathematics,111,N/A,0,en

Stable Stems,Daniel C. Isaksen,American Mathematical Soc.,2020-02-13,"The author presents a detailed analysis of 2-complete stable homotopy groups, both in the classical context and in the motivic context over C. He uses the motivic May spectral sequence to compute the cohomology of the motivic Steenrod algebra over C through the 70-stem. He then uses the motivic Adams spectral sequence to obtain motivic stable homotopy groups through the 59-stem. He also describes the complete calculation to the 65-stem, but defers the proofs in this range to forthcoming publications. In addition to finding all Adams differentials, the author also resolves all hidden extensions by 2, η, and ν through the 59-stem, except for a few carefully enumerated exceptions that remain unknown. The analogous classical stable homotopy groups are easy consequences. The author also computes the motivic stable homotopy groups of the cofiber of the motivic element τ. This computation is essential for resolving hidden extensions in the Adams spectral sequence. He shows that the homotopy groups of the cofiber of τ are the same as the E2-page of the classical Adams-Novikov spectral sequence. This allows him to compute the classical Adams-Novikov spectral sequence, including differentials and hidden extensions, in a larger range than was previously known.",Education,174,N/A,0,en

Globally Generated Vector Bundles with Small $c_1$ on Projective Spaces,"Cristian Anghel, Iustin Coandă, Nicolae Manolache",American Mathematical Soc.,2018-05-29,"The authors provide a complete classification of globally generated vector bundles with first Chern class $c_1 \leq 5$ one the projective plane and with $c_1 \leq 4$ on the projective $n$-space for $n \geq 3$. This reproves and extends, in a systematic manner, previous results obtained for $c_1 \leq 2$ by Sierra and Ugaglia [J. Pure Appl. Algebra 213 (2009), 2141-2146], and for $c_1 = 3$ by Anghel and Manolache [Math. Nachr. 286 (2013), 1407-1423] and, independently, by Sierra and Ugaglia [J. Pure Appl. Algebra 218 (2014), 174-180]. It turns out that the case $c_1 = 4$ is much more involved than the previous cases, especially on the projective 3-space. Among the bundles appearing in our classification one can find the Sasakura rank 3 vector bundle on the projective 4-space (conveniently twisted). The authors also propose a conjecture concerning the classification of globally generated vector bundles with $c_1 \leq n - 1$ on the projective $n$-space. They verify the conjecture for $n \leq 5$.",Mathematics,120,N/A,0,en

Homogeneous Finsler Spaces,Shaoqiang Deng,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-08-01,"Homogeneous Finsler Spaces is the first book to emphasize the relationship between Lie groups and Finsler geometry, and the first to show the validity in using Lie theory for the study of Finsler geometry problems. This book contains a series of new results obtained by the author and collaborators during the last decade. The topic of Finsler geometry has developed rapidly in recent years. One of the main reasons for its surge in development is its use in many scientific fields, such as general relativity, mathematical biology, and phycology (study of algae). This monograph introduces the most recent developments in the study of Lie groups and homogeneous Finsler spaces, leading the reader to directions for further development. The book contains many interesting results such as a Finslerian version of the Myers-Steenrod Theorem, the existence theorem for invariant non-Riemannian Finsler metrics on coset spaces, the Berwaldian characterization of globally symmetric Finsler spaces, the construction of examples of reversible non-Berwaldian Finsler spaces with vanishing S-curvature, and a classification of homogeneous Randers spaces with isotropic S-curvature and positive flag curvature.

The Confluent Hypergeometric Function,Herbert Buchholz,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-11-22,"The subject of this book is the higher transcendental function known as the confluent hypergeometric function. In the last two decades this function has taken on an ever increasing significance because of its use in the application of mathematics to physical and technical problems. There is no doubt that this trend will continue until the general theory of confluent hypergeometric functions becomes familiar to the majority of physicists in much the same way as the cylinder functions, which were previously less well known, are now used in many engineering and physical problems. This book is intended to further this development. The important practical significance of the functions which are treated hardly demands an involved discussion since they include, as special cases, a number of simpler special functions which have long been the everyday tool of the physicist. It is sufficient to mention that these include, among others, the logarithmic integral, the integral sine and cosine, the error integral, the Fresnel integral, the cylinder functions and the cylinder function in parabolic cylindrical coordinates. For anyone who puts forth the effort to study the confluent hypergeometric function in more detail there is the inestimable advantage of being able to understand the properties of other functions derivable from it. This gen eral point of view is particularly useful in connection with series ex pansions valid for values of the argument near zero or infinity and in connection with the various integral representations.",Science,255,N/A,0,en

In attempting to determine the simple groups, the first step was to settle the conjecture of Burnside that groups of odd order are soluble. The proof that this conjecture was correct is much too long and complicated for presentation in this text, but a number of ideas in the early stages of it led to a local theory of finite groups, so me aspects of which are discussed in Chapter X. Much of this discussion is a con tinuation of the theory of the transfer (see Chapter IV), but we also introduce the generalized Fitting subgroup, which played a basic role in characterization theorems, that is, in descriptions of specific groups in terms of group-theoretical properties alone. One of the earliest and most important such characterizations was given for Zassenhaus groups; this is presented in Chapter XI. Characterizations in terms of the centralizer of an involution are of particular importance in view of the theorem of Brauer and Fowler. In Chapter XII, one such theorem is given, in which the Mathieu group 9J'l1l and PSL(3, 3) are characterized",Mathematics,464,N/A,0,en

Finite Groups II,"B. Huppert, N. Blackburn",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"17):~t? L It CIFDr- ! wei! unsre Weisheit Einfalt ist, From ""Lohengrin"", Richard Wagner At the time of the appearance of the first volume of this work in 1967, the tempestuous development of finite group theory had already made it virtually impossible to give a complete presentation of the subject in one treatise. The present volume and its successor have therefore the more modest aim of giving descriptions of the recent development of certain important parts of the subject, and even in these parts no attempt at completeness has been made. Chapter VII deals with the representation theory of finite groups in arbitrary fields with particular attention to those of non-zero charac teristic. That part of modular representation theory which is essentially the block theory of complex characters has not been included, as there are already monographs on this subject and others will shortly appear. Instead, we have restricted ourselves to such results as can be obtained by purely module-theoretical means.",Mathematics,545,N/A,0,en
Partial Differential Equations of Elliptic Type,C. Miranda,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"In the theory of partial differential equations, the study of elliptic equations occupies a preeminent position, both because of the importance which it assumes for various questions in mathematical physics, and because of the completeness of the results obtained up to the present time. In spite of this, even in the more classical treatises on analysis the theory of elliptic equations has been considered and illustrated only from particular points of view, while the only expositions of the whole theory, the extremely valuable ones by LICHTENSTEIN and AscoLI, have the charac ter of encyclopedia articles and date back to many years ago. Consequently it seemed to me that it would be of some interest to try to give an up-to-date picture of the present state of research in this area in a monograph which, without attaining the dimensions of a treatise, would nevertheless be sufficiently extensive to allow the expo sition, in some cases in summary form, of the various techniques used in the study of these equations.",Mathematics,384,N/A,0,en
Regularity of Minimal Surfaces,"Ulrich Dierkes, Stefan Hildebrandt, Anthony Tromba",Springer Science & Business Media,2010-08-16,"Regularity of Minimal Surfaces begins with a survey of minimal surfaces with free boundaries. Following this, the basic results concerning the boundary behaviour of minimal surfaces and H-surfaces with fixed or free boundaries are studied. In particular, the asymptotic expansions at interior and boundary branch points are derived, leading to general Gauss-Bonnet formulas. Furthermore, gradient estimates and asymptotic expansions for minimal surfaces with only piecewise smooth boundaries are obtained. One of the main features of free boundary value problems for minimal surfaces is that, for principal reasons, it is impossible to derive a priori estimates. Therefore regularity proofs for non-minimizers have to be based on indirect reasoning using monotonicity formulas. This is followed by a long chapter discussing geometric properties of minimal and H-surfaces such as enclosure theorems and isoperimetric inequalities, leading to the discussion of obstacle problems and of Plateau ́s problem for H-surfaces in a Riemannian manifold. A natural generalization of the isoperimetric problem is the so-called thread problem, dealing with minimal surfaces whose boundary consists of a fixed arc of given length. Existence and regularity of solutions are discussed. The final chapter on branch points presents a new approach to the theorem that area minimizing solutions of Plateau ́s problem have no interior branch points.",Mathematics,634,N/A,0,en
Finiteness Conditions and Generalized Soluble Groups,Derek J.S. Robinson,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-06-29,"This book is a study of group theoretical properties of two disparate kinds, firstly finiteness conditions or generalizations of finiteness and secondly generalizations of solubility or nilpotence. It will be particularly interesting to discuss groups which possess properties of both types. The origins of the subject may be traced back to the nineteen twenties and thirties and are associated with the names of R. Baer, S.N. Cernikov, K.A. Hirsch, A.G. Kuros, 0.]. Schmidt and H. Wielandt. Since this early period, the body of theory has expanded at an increasingly rapid rate through the efforts of many group theorists, particularly in Germany, Great Britain and the Soviet Union. Some of the highest points attained can, perhaps, be found in the work of P. Hall and A.I. Mal'cev on infinite soluble groups. Kuras's well-known book ""The theory of groups"" has exercised a strong influence on the development of the theory of infinite groups: this is particularly true of the second edition in its English translation of 1955. To cope with the enormous increase in knowledge since that date, a third volume, containing a survey of the contents of a very large number of papers but without proofs, was added to the book in 1967",Mathematics,269,N/A,0,en
Topological Vector Spaces I,Gottfried Köthe,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"It is the author's aim to give a systematic account of the most im portant ideas, methods and results of the theory of topological vector spaces. After a rapid development during the last 15 years, this theory has now achieved a form which makes such an account seem both possible and desirable. This present first volume begins with the fundamental ideas of general topology. These are of crucial importance for the theory that follows, and so it seems necessary to give a concise account, giving complete proofs. This also has the advantage that the only preliminary knowledge required for reading this book is of classical analysis and set theory. In the second chapter, infinite dimensional linear algebra is considered in comparative detail. As a result, the concept of dual pair and linear topologies on vector spaces over arbitrary fields are intro duced in a natural way. It appears to the author to be of interest to follow the theory of these linearly topologised spaces quite far, since this theory can be developed in a way which closely resembles the theory of locally convex spaces. It should however be stressed that this part of chapter two is not needed for the comprehension of the later chapters. Chapter three is concerned with real and complex topological vector spaces. The classical results of Banach's theory are given here, as are fundamental results about convex sets in infinite dimensional spaces.",Mathematics,470,N/A,0,en

Quadratic and Hermitian Forms,W. Scharlau,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"For a long time - at least from Fermat to Minkowski - the theory of quadratic forms was a part of number theory. Much of the best work of the great number theorists of the eighteenth and nineteenth century was concerned with problems about quadratic forms. On the basis of their work, Minkowski, Siegel, Hasse, Eichler and many others crea ted the impressive ""arithmetic"" theory of quadratic forms, which has been the object of the well-known books by Bachmann (1898/1923), Eichler (1952), and O'Meara (1963). Parallel to this development the ideas of abstract algebra and abstract linear algebra introduced by Dedekind, Frobenius, E. Noether and Artin led to today's structural mathematics with its emphasis on classification problems and general structure theorems. On the basis of both - the number theory of quadratic forms and the ideas of modern algebra - Witt opened, in 1937, a new chapter in the theory of quadratic forms. His most fruitful idea was to consider not single ""individual"" quadratic forms but rather the entity of all forms over a fixed ground field and to construct from this an algebra ic object. This object - the Witt ring - then became the principal object of the entire theory. Thirty years later Pfister demonstrated the significance of this approach by his celebrated structure theorems.",Mathematics,431,N/A,0,en
Global Analysis of Minimal Surfaces,"Ulrich Dierkes, Stefan Hildebrandt, Anthony Tromba",Springer Science & Business Media,2010-08-16,"Many properties of minimal surfaces are of a global nature, and this is already true for the results treated in the first two volumes of the treatise. Part I of the present book can be viewed as an extension of these results. For instance, the first two chapters deal with existence, regularity and uniqueness theorems for minimal surfaces with partially free boundaries. Here one of the main features is the possibility of ""edge-crawling"" along free parts of the boundary. The third chapter deals with a priori estimates for minimal surfaces in higher dimensions and for minimizers of singular integrals related to the area functional. In particular, far reaching Bernstein theorems are derived. The second part of the book contains what one might justly call a ""global theory of minimal surfaces"" as envisioned by Smale. First, the Douglas problem is treated anew by using Teichmüller theory. Secondly, various index theorems for minimal theorems are derived, and their consequences for the space of solutions to Plateau ́s problem are discussed. Finally, a topological approach to minimal surfaces via Fredholm vector fields in the spirit of Smale is presented.",Mathematics,547,N/A,0,en

Rings of Quotients,B. Stenström,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"The theory of rings of quotients has its origin in the work of (j). Ore and K. Asano on the construction of the total ring of fractions, in the 1930's and 40's. But the subject did not really develop until the end of the 1950's, when a number of important papers appeared (by R. E. Johnson, Y. Utumi, A. W. Goldie, P. Gabriel, J. Lambek, and others). Since then the progress has been rapid, and the subject has by now attained a stage of maturity, where it is possible to make a systematic account of it (which is the purpose of this book). The most immediate example of a ring of quotients is the field of fractions Q of a commutative integral domain A. It may be characterized by the two properties: (i) For every qEQ there exists a non-zero SEA such that qSEA. (ii) Q is the maximal over-ring of A satisfying condition (i). The well-known construction of Q can be immediately extended to the case when A is an arbitrary commutative ring and S is a multiplicatively closed set of non-zero-divisors of A. In that case one defines the ring of fractions Q = A [S-l] as consisting of pairs (a, s) with aEA and SES, with the declaration that (a, s)=(b, t) if there exists UES such that uta = usb. The resulting ring Q satisfies (i), with the extra requirement that SES, and (ii).",Mathematics,319,N/A,0,en

Mathematical Modelling of Zombies,Robert Smith?,University of Ottawa Press,2014-10-14,"You’re outnumbered, in fear for your life, surrounded by flesheating zombies. What can save you now? Mathematics, of course. Mathematical Modelling of Zombies engages the imagination to illustrate the power of mathematical modelling. Using zombies as a “hook,” you’ll learn how mathematics can predict the unpredictable. In order to be prepared for the apocalypse, you’ll need mathematical models, differential equations, statistical estimations, discretetime models, and adaptive strategies for zombie attacks—as well as baseball bats and Dire Straits records (latter two items not included). In Mathematical Modelling of Zombies, Robert Smith? brings together a highly skilled team of contributors to fend off a zombie uprising. You’ll also learn how modelling can advise government policy, how theoretical results can be communicated to a nonmathematical audience and how models can be formulated with only limited information. A forward by Andrew Cartmel—former script editor of Doctor Who, author, zombie fan and all-round famous person in science-fiction circles—even provides a genealogy of the undead. By understanding how to combat zombies, readers will be introduced to a wide variety of modelling techniques that are applicable to other real-world issues (biology, epidemiology, medicine, public health, etc.).

An Invitation to Arithmetic Geometry,Dino Lorenzini,American Mathematical Society,2021-12-23,"Extremely carefully written, masterfully thought out, and skillfully arranged introduction … to the arithmetic of algebraic curves, on the one hand, and to the algebro-geometric aspects of number theory, on the other hand. … an excellent guide for beginners in arithmetic geometry, just as an interesting reference and methodical inspiration for teachers of the subject … a highly welcome addition to the existing literature. —Zentralblatt MATH The interaction between number theory and algebraic geometry has been especially fruitful. In this volume, the author gives a unified presentation of some of the basic tools and concepts in number theory, commutative algebra, and algebraic geometry, and for the first time in a book at this level, brings out the deep analogies between them. The geometric viewpoint is stressed throughout the book. Extensive examples are given to illustrate each new concept, and many interesting exercises are given at the end of each chapter. Most of the important results in the one-dimensional case are proved, including Bombieri's proof of the Riemann Hypothesis for curves over a finite field. While the book is not intended to be an introduction to schemes, the author indicates how many of the geometric notions introduced in the book relate to schemes, which will aid the reader who goes to the next level of this rich subject.",Mathematics,415,N/A,0,en
Z-Transform,M. D. PETALE,MANGESH DEVIDASRAO PETALE,N/A,"Purpose of this Book The purpose of this book is to supply lots of examples with details solution that helps the students to understand each example step wise easily and get rid of the college assignments phobia. It is sincerely hoped that this book will help and better equipped the higher secondary students to prepare and face the examinations with better confidence. I have endeavored to present the book in a lucid manner which will be easier to understand by all the engineering students. About the Book According to many streams in engineering course there are different chapters in Engineering Mathematics of the same year according to the streams. Hence students faced problem about to buy Engineering Mathematics special book that covered all chapters in a single book. That’s reason student needs to buy many books to cover all chapters according to the prescribed syllabus. Hence need to spend more money for a single subject to cover complete syllabus. So here good news for you, your problem solved. I made here special books according to chapter wise, which helps to buy books according to chapters and no need to pay extra money for unneeded chapters that not mentioned in your syllabus. PREFACE It gives me great pleasure to present to you this book on A Textbook on “Z-Transform” of Engineering Mathematics presented specially for you. Many books have been written on Engineering Mathematics by different authors and teachers, but majority of the students find it difficult to fully understand the examples in these books. Also, the Teachers have faced many problems due to paucity of time and classroom workload. Sometimes the college teacher is not able to help their own student in solving many difficult questions in the class even though they wish to do so. Keeping in mind the need of the students, the author was inspired to write a suitable text book providing solutions to various examples of “Z-Transform” of Engineering Mathematics. It is hoped that this book will meet more than an adequately the needs of the students they are meant for. I have tried our level best to make this book error free.",,71,N/A,0,en

As a mathematician he is also interested in the treasure trove of beautiful mathematics used to model the different activities in a juggler's repertoire. In this book he provides an intellectually stimulating collection of mostly self-contained mathematical essays that introduce the reader to many elegant results and techniques from a wide range of mathematical disciplines such as combinatorics, graph theory, knot theory, mechanics, differential equations, control theory, and robotics. ""The Mathematics of Juggling"" is the first comprehensive account summarizing and expanding the results in the literature on juggling tricks and skills, as well as the mathematics behind these tricks and skills.

Topological Quantum Computation,Zhenghan Wang,American Mathematical Soc.,2010,"Topological quantum computation is a computational paradigm based on topological phases of matter, which are governed by topological quantum field theories. In this approach, information is stored in the lowest energy states of many-anyon systems and processed by braiding non-abelian anyons. The computational answer is accessed by bringing anyons together and observing the result. Besides its theoretical esthetic appeal, the practical merit of the topological approach lies in its error-minimizing hypothetical hardware: topological phases of matter are fault-avoiding or deaf to most local noises, and unitary gates are implemented with exponential accuracy. Experimental realizations are pursued in systems such as fractional quantum Hall liquids and topological insulators. This book expands on the author's CBMS lectures on knots and topological quantum computing and is intended as a primer for mathematically inclined graduate students. With an emphasis on introducing basic notions and current research, this book gives the first coherent account of the field, covering a wide range of topics: Temperley-Lieb-Jones theory, the quantum circuit model, ribbon fusion category theory, topological quantum field theory, anyon theory, additive approximation of the Jones polynomial, anyonic quantum computing models, and mathematical models of topological phases of matter.",Computers,134,N/A,0,en

Probability and Bayesian Statistics,R. Viertl,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This book contains selected and refereed contributions to the ""Inter national Symposium on Probability and Bayesian Statistics"" which was orga nized to celebrate the 80th birthday of Professor Bruno de Finetti at his birthplace Innsbruck in Austria. Since Professor de Finetti died in 1985 the symposium was dedicated to the memory of Bruno de Finetti and took place at Igls near Innsbruck from 23 to 26 September 1986. Some of the pa pers are published especially by the relationship to Bruno de Finetti's scientific work. The evolution of stochastics shows growing importance of probability as coherent assessment of numerical values as degrees of believe in certain events. This is the basis for Bayesian inference in the sense of modern statistics. The contributions in this volume cover a broad spectrum ranging from foundations of probability across psychological aspects of formulating sub jective probability statements, abstract measure theoretical considerations, contributions to theoretical statistics and stochastic processes, to real applications in economics, reliability and hydrology. Also the question is raised if it is necessary to develop new techniques to model and analyze fuzzy observations in samples.

A Conversational Introduction to Algebraic Number Theory,Paul Pollack,American Mathematical Soc.,2017-08-01,"Gauss famously referred to mathematics as the “queen of the sciences” and to number theory as the “queen of mathematics”. This book is an introduction to algebraic number theory, meaning the study of arithmetic in finite extensions of the rational number field Q . Originating in the work of Gauss, the foundations of modern algebraic number theory are due to Dirichlet, Dedekind, Kronecker, Kummer, and others. This book lays out basic results, including the three “fundamental theorems”: unique factorization of ideals, finiteness of the class number, and Dirichlet's unit theorem. While these theorems are by now quite classical, both the text and the exercises allude frequently to more recent developments. In addition to traversing the main highways, the book reveals some remarkable vistas by exploring scenic side roads. Several topics appear that are not present in the usual introductory texts. One example is the inclusion of an extensive discussion of the theory of elasticity, which provides a precise way of measuring the failure of unique factorization. The book is based on the author's notes from a course delivered at the University of Georgia; pains have been taken to preserve the conversational style of the original lectures.",Mathematics,329,N/A,0,en

Statistics from A to Z,Andrew A. Jawlik,John Wiley & Sons,2016-10-24,"Statistics is confusing, even for smart, technically competent people. And many students and professionals find that existing books and web resources don’t give them an intuitive understanding of confusing statistical concepts. That is why this book is needed. Some of the unique qualities of this book are: • Easy to Understand: Uses unique “graphics that teach” such as concept flow diagrams, compare-and-contrast tables, and even cartoons to enhance “rememberability.” • Easy to Use: Alphabetically arranged, like a mini-encyclopedia, for easy lookup on the job, while studying, or during an open-book exam. • Wider Scope: Covers Statistics I and Statistics II and Six Sigma Black Belt, adding such topics as control charts and statistical process control, process capability analysis, and design of experiments. As a result, this book will be useful for business professionals and industrial engineers in addition to students and professionals in the social and physical sciences. In addition, each of the 60+ concepts is covered in one or more articles. The 75 articles in the book are usually 5–7 pages long, ensuring that things are presented in “bite-sized chunks.” The first page of each article typically lists five “Keys to Understanding” which tell the reader everything they need to know on one page. This book also contains an article on “Which Statistical Tool to Use to Solve Some Common Problems”, additional “Which to Use When” articles on Control Charts, Distributions, and Charts/Graphs/Plots, as well as articles explaining how different concepts work together (e.g., how Alpha, p, Critical Value, and Test Statistic interrelate).

The Analytic Art,"François Viète, T. Richard Witmer",Courier Corporation,2006-01-01,"This historic work consists of several treatises that developed the first consistent, coherent, and systematic conception of algebraic equations. Originally published in 1591, it pioneered the notion of using symbols of one kind (vowels) for unknowns and of another kind (consonants) for known quantities, thus streamlining the solution of equations. Francois Viète (1540-1603), a lawyer at the court of King Henry II in Tours and Paris, wrote several treatises that are known collectively as The Analytic Art. His novel approach to the study of algebra developed the earliest articulated theory of equations, allowing not only flexibility and generality in solving linear and quadratic equations, but also something completely new—a clear analysis of the relationship between the forms of the solutions and the values of the coefficients of the original equation. Viète regarded his contribution as developing a ""systematic way of thinking"" leading to general solutions, rather than just a ""bag of tricks"" to solve specific problems. These essays demonstrate his method of applying his own ideas to existing usage in ways that led to clear formulation and solution of equations.",Mathematics,466,N/A,0,en

The Riemann Hypothesis,Peter B. Borwein,Springer Science & Business Media,2008,"The Riemann Hypothesis has become the Holy Grail of mathematics in the century and a half since 1859 when Bernhard Riemann, one of the extraordinary mathematical talents of the 19th century, originally posed the problem. While the problem is notoriously difficult, and complicated even to state carefully, it can be loosely formulated as ""the number of integers with an even number of prime factors is the same as the number of integers with an odd number of prime factors."" The Hypothesis makes a very precise connection between two seemingly unrelated mathematical objects, namely prime numbers and the zeros of analytic functions. If solved, it would give us profound insight into number theory and, in particular, the nature of prime numbers. This book is an introduction to the theory surrounding the Riemann Hypothesis. Part I serves as a compendium of known results and as a primer for the material presented in the 20 original papers contained in Part II. The original papers place the material into historical context and illustrate the motivations for research on and around the Riemann Hypothesis. Several of these papers focus on computation of the zeta function, while others give proofs of the Prime Number Theorem, since the Prime Number Theorem is so closely connected to the Riemann Hypothesis.

Steps into Analytic Number Theory,"Paul Pollack, Akash Singha Roy",Springer Nature,2021-02-08,"This problem book gathers together 15 problem sets on analytic number theory that can be profitably approached by anyone from advanced high school students to those pursuing graduate studies. It emerged from a 5-week course taught by the first author as part of the 2019 Ross/Asia Mathematics Program held from July 7 to August 9 in Zhenjiang, China. While it is recommended that the reader has a solid background in mathematical problem solving (as from training for mathematical contests), no possession of advanced subject-matter knowledge is assumed. Most of the solutions require nothing more than elementary number theory and a good grasp of calculus. Problems touch at key topics like the value-distribution of arithmetic functions, the distribution of prime numbers, the distribution of squares and nonsquares modulo a prime number, Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions, and more.

"Computers, Rigidity, and Moduli",Shmuel Weinberger,Princeton University Press,2005,"This book is the first to present a new area of mathematical research that combines topology, geometry, and logic. Shmuel Weinberger seeks to explain and illustrate the implications of the general principle, first emphasized by Alex Nabutovsky, that logical complexity engenders geometric complexity. He provides applications to the problem of closed geodesics, the theory of submanifolds, and the structure of the moduli space of isometry classes of Riemannian metrics with curvature bounds on a given manifold. Ultimately, geometric complexity of a moduli space forces functions defined on that space to have many critical points, and new results about the existence of extrema or equilibria follow. The main sort of algorithmic problem that arises is recognition: is the presented object equivalent to some standard one? If it is difficult to determine whether the problem is solvable, then the original object has doppelgängers--that is, other objects that are extremely difficult to distinguish from it. Many new questions emerge about the algorithmic nature of known geometric theorems, about ""dichotomy problems,"" and about the metric entropy of moduli space. Weinberger studies them using tools from group theory, computability, differential geometry, and topology, all of which he explains before use. Since several examples are worked out, the overarching principles are set in a clear relief that goes beyond the details of any one problem.",Computers,204,N/A,0,en

Grid Homology for Knots and Links,"Peter S. Ozsváth, András I. Stipsicz, Zoltán Szabó",American Mathematical Soc.,2015-12-04,"Knot theory is a classical area of low-dimensional topology, directly connected with the theory of three-manifolds and smooth four-manifold topology. In recent years, the subject has undergone transformative changes thanks to its connections with a number of other mathematical disciplines, including gauge theory; representation theory and categorification; contact geometry; and the theory of pseudo-holomorphic curves. Starting from the combinatorial point of view on knots using their grid diagrams, this book serves as an introduction to knot theory, specifically as it relates to some of the above developments. After a brief overview of the background material in the subject, the book gives a self-contained treatment of knot Floer homology from the point of view of grid diagrams. Applications include computations of the unknotting number and slice genus of torus knots (asked first in the 1960s and settled in the 1990s), and tools to study variants of knot theory in the presence of a contact structure. Additional topics are presented to prepare readers for further study in holomorphic methods in low-dimensional topology, especially Heegaard Floer homology.

Applied Laplace Transforms and z-Transforms for Scientists and Engineers,Urs Graf,Birkhäuser,2012-12-06,"The theory of Laplace transformation is an important part of the mathematical background required for engineers, physicists and mathematicians. Laplace transformation methods provide easy and effective techniques for solving many problems arising in various fields of science and engineering, especially for solving differential equations. What the Laplace transformation does in the field of differential equations, the z-transformation achieves for difference equations. The two theories are parallel and have many analogies. Laplace and z transformations are also referred to as operational calculus, but this notion is also used in a more restricted sense to denote the operational calculus of Mikusinski. This book does not use the operational calculus of Mikusinski, whose approach is based on abstract algebra and is not readily accessible to engineers and scientists. The symbolic computation capability of Mathematica can now be used in favor of the Laplace and z-transformations. The first version of the Mathematica Package LaplaceAndzTransforrns developed by the author appeared ten years ago. The Package computes not only Laplace and z-transforms but also includes many routines from various domains of applications. Upon loading the Package, about one hundred and fifty new commands are added to the built-in commands of Mathematica. The code is placed in front of the already built-in code of Laplace and z-transformations of Mathematica so that built-in functions not covered by the Package remain available.

This imbalance is harmful to both mathematics and its users; to redress this imbalance is an educational task which must start at the beginning of the college curriculum. No course is more suited for this than the calculus; there students can learn at first hand that mathe matics is the language in which scientific ideas can be precisely formulated, that science is a source of mathematical ideas which profoundly shape the development of mathematics, and last but not least that mathematics can furnish brilliant answers to important scientific problems. Our purpose in writing this text has been to emphasize this relation of calculus to science. We hope to accomplish this by devoting whole connected chapters to single-or several related-scientific topics, letting the reader observe how the notions of calculus are used to formulate the basic laws of science and how the methods of calculus are used to deduce consequences of those basic laws.

Applied Finite Mathematics,"Howard Anton, Bernard Kolman",Elsevier,2014-05-10,"Applied Finite Mathematics, Second Edition presents the fundamentals of finite mathematics in a style tailored for beginners, but at the same time covers the subject matter in sufficient depth so that the student can see a rich variety of realistic and relevant applications. Some applications of probability, game theory, and Markov chains are given. Comprised of 10 chapters, this book begins with an introduction to set theory, followed by a discussion on Cartesian coordinate systems and graphs. Subsequent chapters focus on linear programming from a geometric and algebraic point of view; matrices, the solution of linear systems, and applications; the simplex method for solving linear programming problems; and probability and probability models for finite sample spaces as well as permutations, combinations, and counting methods. Basic concepts in statistics are also considered, along with the mathematics of finance. The final chapter is devoted to computers and programming languages such as BASIC. This monograph is intended for students and instructors of applied mathematics.",Mathematics,577,N/A,0,en

Quantification in Natural Languages,Emmon W. Bach,Springer Science & Business Media,1995-02-28,"This extended collection of papers is the result of putting recent ideas on quantification to work on a wide variety of languages. A central perspective of many of the papers follows the recognition of two broad types of quantificational strategies, one associated with nominal structures and determiners, the other with adverbial and other non-nominal expression (`D-quantifiers' and `A-quantifiers'). The papers demonstrate both the unity and the variety of natural language quantificational forms and meanings. Many of the papers also shed new light on questions of language typology and syntactic and morphological variation. The languages discussed include English, Dutch, Italian, American Sign Language, Hindi, and a number of languages of Australia, Greenland, and the Americas. These comparative studies provide initial data for a typology of quantificational structures in natural languages, with important implications for the study of universal grammar. The book consists of research papers aimed at linguists, philosophers, and psychologists interested in semantics and linguistic form. An introduction presents a sketch of the background of this research and some of the central issues discussed, with pointers toward the included papers.",Computers,774,N/A,0,en

Cohomology Operations and Applications in Homotopy Theory,"Robert E. Mosher, Martin C. Tangora",Courier Corporation,2008-01-01,"Cohomology operations are at the center of a major area of activity in algebraic topology. This treatment explores the single most important variety of operations, the Steenrod squares. It constructs these operations, proves their major properties, and provides numerous applications, including several different techniques of homotopy theory useful for computation. 1968 edition.",Mathematics,226,N/A,0,en
