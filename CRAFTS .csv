The Repurposed Library,Lisa Occhipinti,Abrams,2019-11-26,"“How-to instructions on crafting with books . . . will inspire you to think about creative ways to make new treasures out of old things” (The Virginian-Pilot). We all love to read and learn from books, but The Repurposed Library takes our passion even further, presenting us with thirty-three projects to make—quite literally—out of books. For these projects, Lisa Occhipinti rescues and repurposes orphaned and outdated books from flea markets and library sales and turns them into new art objects and practical items for the home. Her creations range from artfully constructed mobiles, wreaths, and vases, to functional items like shelves, storage boxes, and even a Kindle “keeper” for those who want to replicate the sensation of holding a “real” book while reading from an e-reader. Projects utilize every imaginable part of a book—from hardback cover to individual pages—and are a DIY celebration of a new way to view a book’s potential. “Occhipinti’s ‘repurposed’ books are truly beautiful art objects, and whether or not you’re crafty enough to give them a try yourself, her book is thoroughly enjoyable.” —Fine Books and Collections “She shows readers how to transform books into mobiles, lamp shades, even clocks.” —National Post",Crafts & Hobbies,233,N/A,0,en

The Magic Half,Annie Barrows,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2010-08-10,"From New York Times bestselling author of the Ivy and Bean series and blockbuster The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society comes a sweet and charming time travel story. Miri is the non-twin child in a family with two sets of them-older brothers and younger sisters. The family has just moved to an old farmhouse in a new town, where the only good thing seems to be Miri's ten-sided attic bedroom. But when Miri gets sent to her room after accidentally bashing her big brother on the head with a shovel, she finds herself in the same room . . . only not quite. Without meaning to, she has found a way to travel back in time to 1935 where she discovers Molly, a girl her own age very much in need of a loving family. A highly satisfying classic-in-the-making full of spine-tingling moments, both books in the delightful time-travelling Molly and Miri series is perfect for the whole family.

The Palladino Family in America,Peter August Hoetjes,Virtualbookworm Publishing,2004,"The family surname is derived from the Italian first name Paladino. The first recorded Paladino was a medieval knight and the nephew to the Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne, 742-814 AD. Many romantic fables are told of Charlemagne and his paladins. The most famous of the paladins was Roland, the favorite nephew of Charlemagne. It is Roland, the Italian, bestowed by Charlemagne with the name Paladin, who may be our famous ancestral noble Cavaliere that all Palladino's and modern-day Pauldine's are descended from. genealogy and objective interpretation of these topics can spell the difference between real family history and fanciful family folklore. It is in a whimsical and fanciful vein that I portend that the Palladino and modern-day Pauldine clan is in some way related to the famous Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne and his equally famous nephew, Roland the Paladin. But, who knows! Perhaps a future Palladino explorer with the inclination and, more importantly, possessing very deep pockets, might one day embark on the eternal quest for the truth and in the process even perchance recover Roland's magical sword, Durandal.",Fiction,300,5,1,en

Proceedings of the 1st UPY International Conference on Education and Social Science (UPINCESS 2022),Ari Kusuma Wardana,Springer Nature,2023-02-10,"This is an open access book. It has been two years since the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the world. This has more or less left a mark of memories and trauma for more or fewer people. This pandemic reminds people around the world that there are things that can happen without people knowing it. People start to worry and pessimistically see the uncertainty that lies in the future. To deal with this, a strategy is needed through educational innovation and social science to answer and face the challenges of uncertainty in the future. Breakthroughs in education and social science are the most strategic ways to build and enhance human capacity to solve problems, environmental and social problems. The spirit of innovation, rising from an economic downturn, the use of technology is obtained through the role of educational institutions. This can be interpreted that innovation in education and social science produces superior humans, who have good behavior, and wise humans. So that in the face of uncertainty in the post-pandemic period, humans have strategies and become more prepared. To find out more about strategies for dealing with and responding to future uncertainties after the pandemic through educational innovations and social science, it is necessary to conduct research or studies that discuss these matters and be published widely. To support this, Universitas PGRI Yogyakarta held an international conference and Call for Papers The 1st UPY International Conference on Education and Social Science (UPINCESS) “Strategies to Deal with Uncertainty through Education and Social Science Innovation” on June 15, 2022.",Education,443,N/A,0,en

Organic Synthesis,"Stuart Warren, Paul Wyatt",John Wiley & Sons,2011-08-24,"One approach to organic synthesis is retrosynthetic analysis. With this approach a chemist will start with the structure of their target molecule and progressively cut bonds to create simpler molecules. Reversing this process gives a synthetic route to the target molecule from simpler starting materials. This “disconnection” approach to synthesis is now a fundamental part of every organic synthesis course. Organic Synthesis: The Disconnection Approach, 2nd Edition introduces this important technique, to help students to design their own organic syntheses. There are forty chapters: those on the synthesis of given types of molecules alternate with strategy chapters in which the methods just learnt are placed in a wider context. The synthesis chapters cover many ways of making each type of molecule starting with simple aromatic and aliphatic compounds with one functional group and progressing to molecules with many functional groups. The strategy chapters cover questions of selectivity, protection, stereochemistry, and develop more advanced thinking via reagents specifically designed for difficult problems. Examples are drawn from pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, natural products, pheromones, perfumery and flavouring compounds, dyestuffs, monomers, and intermediates used in more advanced synthetic work. Reasons for wishing to synthesise each compound are given. This second edition has been fully revised and updated with a modern look. Recent examples and techniques are included and illustrated additional material has been added to take the student to the level required by the sequel, “Organic Synthesis: Strategy and Control”. Several chapters contain extensive new material based on courses that the authors give to chemists in the pharmaceutical industry. Organic Synthesis: The Disconnection Approach, 2nd edition provides a full course in retrosynthetic analysis for chemistry and biochemistry students and a refresher for organic chemists working in industry and academia.",Science,354,N/A,0,en

United States Code: Title 23: Highways to Title 25: Indians,,N/A,2013,"Preface 2012 edition: The United States Code is the official codification of the general and permanent laws of the United States. The Code was first published in 1926, and a new edition of the code has been published every six years since 1934. The 2012 edition of the Code incorporates laws enacted through the One Hundred Twelfth Congress, Second session, the last of which was signed by the President on January 15, 2013. It does not include laws of the One Hundred Thirteenth Congress, First session, enacted between January 3, 2013, the date it convened, and January 15, 2013. By statutory authority this edition may be cited ""U.S.C. 2012 ed."" As adopted in 1926, the Code established prima facie the general and permanent laws of the United States. The underlying statutes reprinted in the Code remained in effect and controlled over the Code in case of any discrepancy. In 1947, Congress began enacting individual titles of the Code into positive law. When a title is enacted into positive law, the underlying statutes are repealed and the title then becomes legal evidence of the law. Currently, 26 of the 51 titles in the Code have been so enacted. These are identified in the table of titles near the beginning of each volume. The Law Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives continues to prepare legislation pursuant to 2 USC 285b to enact the remainder of the Code, on a title-by-title basis, into positive law. The 2012 edition of the Code was prepared and published under the supervision of Ralph V. Seep, Law Revision Counsel. Grateful acknowledgment is made of the contributions by all who helped in this work, particularly the staffs of the Office of the Law Revision Counsel and the Government Printing Office. -- John. A.

Selling Tradition,Jane S. Becker,Univ of North Carolina Press,2000-11-09,"The first half of the twentieth century witnessed a growing interest in America's folk heritage, as Americans began to enthusiastically collect, present, market, and consume the nation's folk traditions. Examining one of this century's most prominent ""folk revivals--the reemergence of Southern Appalachian handicraft traditions in the 1930s--Jane Becker unravels the cultural politics that bound together a complex network of producers, reformers, government officials, industries, museums, urban markets, and consumers, all of whom helped to redefine Appalachian craft production in the context of a national cultural identity. Becker uses this craft revival as a way of exploring the construction of the cultural categories ""folk"" and ""tradition."" She also addresses the consequences such labels have had on the people to whom they have been assigned. Though the revival of domestic arts in the Southern Appalachians reflected an attempt to aid the people of an impoverished region, she says, as well as a desire to recapture an important part of the nation's folk heritage, in reality the new craft production owed less to tradition than to middle-class tastes and consumer culture--forces that obscured the techniques used by mountain laborers and the conditions in which they worked.",History,356,N/A,0,en

"History of Chicago, Illinois",John Moses,N/A,1895,"""For the student of geology have been succinctly set forth the operation of the pre-historic influences which were at work upon the site of Chicago ages before man trod upon the earth. Following this is a complete and connected, though condensed, narrative history of the 'Garden City,' through its various stages of village, town and municipality, showing the formative causes and describing the central events of each decade in Chicago's civic, financial and political relations. In connection with this narrative history, but following it, many subjects of special interest or importance have been treated topically. Among the most prominent of these may be enumerated : trade and commerce, the railroad interests centering in Chicago, the enormous manufacturing industries, the financial institutions of the city, public works, the parks, the drainage canal, bridges, tunnels, intramural transit, the bench and bar (to which is appended a special chapter relating to notable trials), the growth of religion as shown by church history, the professions of medicine and dentistry, the steadily growing influence of the press, libraries, authors, art, amusements, clubs, homes, and the labor disturbances of 1894"" --",Chicago (Ill.),1242,N/A,0,en

Arts & Crafts Design,William H. Varnum,Gibbs Smith,1995-08,"Originally published in 1916 when the Arts & Crafts movement was in its heyday, this is a virtual textbook of materials, color, techniques, and designs. Arts & Crafts Design is a practical guide to the creation of high-quality, high-style furnishings through the industrial arts. ""In this relativistic age in which de gustilrie non disputandum est (it is undisputed that each person has their own sense of taste), it is refreshing to look back to the early twentieth century when at least a few people were certain that there are universal rules for good art and also that they had themselves mastered these precepts and could pass them on to a society that loved commonly held values. William H. Varnum was one of those people. He offers here a textbook that will, if followed, allow students to 'directly apply well-recognized principles of design to specific materials and problems.' No situation esthetics here. In fact, he followed these principles in designing the logos representing his tools and ratio system on the cover of his book. ""The publisher of this new edition has added a useful foreword and substitued the title Arts and Crafts Design for the original (1916) Industrial Arts Design, an appropriate modification since the term ""industrial"" suggests factory production whereas Varnum referred to objects that today we call ""Craftsman""--Rookwood pottery, Stickley furniture, Jarvie candlesticks, etc. A delightful touch is that Varnum included pictures of these objects alongside the principles by which he believed they were designed. Varnum's book offers an enlightening, if somewhat technical, insight into thinking about design before World War I. There is no doubt that the Arts and Crafts period during which the principles of simple beauty married so neatly with function can be better understood and appreciated today through Varnum's perceptions.""

Advanced Organic Chemistry,"Francis A. Carey, Richard J. Sundberg",Springer Science & Business Media,2006-05-02,"Since its original appearance in 1977, Advanced Organic Chemistry has found wide use as a text providing broad coverage of the structure, reactivity and synthesis of organic compounds. The Fourth Edition provides updated material but continues the essential elements of the previous edition. The material in Part A is organized on the basis of fundamental structural topics such as structure, stereochemistry, conformation and aromaticity and basic mechanistic types, including nucleophilic substitution, addition reactions, carbonyl chemistry, aromatic substitution and free radical reactions. The material in Part B is organized on the basis of reaction type with emphasis on reactions of importance in laboratory synthesis. As in the earlier editions, the text contains extensive references to both the primary and review literature and provides examples of data and reactions that illustrate and document the generalizations. While the text assumes completion of an introductory course in organic chemistry, it reviews the fundamental concepts for each topic that is discussed. The Fourth Edition updates certain topics that have advanced rapidly in the decade since the Third Edition was published, including computational chemistry, structural manifestations of aromaticity, enantioselective reactions and lanthanide catalysis. The two parts stand alone, although there is considerable cross-referencing. Part A emphasizes quantitative and qualitative description of structural effects on reactivity and mechanism. Part B emphasizes the most general and useful synthetic reactions. The focus is on the core of organic chemistry, but the information provided forms the foundation for future study and research in medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry, biological chemistry and physical properties of organic compounds.

Clarence H. White and His World,Anne McCauley,Yale University Press,2017-01-01,"Restoring a gifted art photographer to his place in the American canon and, in the process, reshaping and expanding our understanding of early 20th-century American photography Clarence H. White (1871–1925) was one of the most influential art photographers and teachers of the early 20th century and a founding member of the Photo-Secession. This beautiful publication offers a new appraisal of White’s contributions, including his groundbreaking aesthetic experiments, his commitment to the ideals of American socialism, and his embrace of the expanding fields of photographic book and fashion illustration, celebrity portraiture, and advertising. Based on extensive archival research, the book challenges the idea of an abrupt rupture between prewar, soft-focus idealizing photography and postwar “modernism” to paint a more nuanced picture of American culture in the Progressive era. Clarence H. White and His World begins with the artist’s early work in Ohio, which shares with the nascent Arts and Crafts movement the advocacy of hand production, closeness to nature, and the simple life. White’s involvement with the Photo-Secession and his move to New York in 1906 mark a shift in his production, as it grew to encompass commercial portraiture and an increasing commitment to teaching, which ultimately led him to establish the first institutions in America to combine instruction in both technical and aesthetic aspects of photography. The book also incorporates new formal and scientific analysis of White’s work and techniques, a complete exhibition record, and many unpublished illustrations of the moody outdoor scenes and quiet images of domestic life for which he was revered.",Photography,409,N/A,0,en

A Theory of Craft,Howard Risatti,ReadHowYouWant.com,2009-12,"What is craft? How is it different from fine art or design? In A Theory of Craft, Howard Risatti examines these issues by comparing handmade ceramics, glass, metalwork, weaving, and furniture to painting, sculpture, photography, and machine-made design from Bauhaus to the Memphis Group. He describes craft's unique qualities as functionality combined with an ability to express human values that transcend temporal, spatial, and social boundaries. Modern design today has taken over from craft the making of functional objects of daily use by employing machines to do work once done by hand. Understanding the aesthetic and social implications of this transformation forces us to see craft as well as design and fine art in a new perspective, Risatti argues. Without a way of understanding and valuing craft on its own terms, the field languishes aesthetically, being judged by fine art criteria that automatically deny art status to craft objects. Craft must articulate a role for itself in contemporary society, says Risatti; otherwise it will be absorbed by fine art or design and its singular approach to understanding the world will be lost. A Theory of Craft is a signal contribution to establishing a craft theory that recognizes, defines, and celebrates the unique blend of function and human aesthetic values embodied in the craft object.",Art,586,N/A,0,en

Architecture and the Arts and Crafts Movement in Boston,Maureen Meister,UPNE,2003,"H. Langford Warren (1857-1917) was an important link in the chain of individuals who contributed to the architectural practice, theories of design, and the teaching of architectural history in the United States at the turn of the twentieth century. Best known in the Boston area, Warren first worked under the renowned architect Henry Hobson Richardson before establishing his own practice. Friends and colleagues during this period included Charles Eliot Norton, the noted art historian, and Harvard's Charles Herbert Moore, a leading Ruskinian painter. Hired by Harvard University in 1893, Warren developed its architectural curriculum. In 1897 he helped found Boston's Society of Arts and Crafts. At the time of his death in 1917, Warren was Dean of the School of Architecture at Harvard and President of the Society of Arts and Crafts. At the turn of the century, Warren's philosophical vision offered a conservative and ethnocentric perspective attractive to many Bostonians and to a significant segment of Americans nationwide. According to this view, English culture was the basis of American culture. Through his work at Harvard and in the Arts and Crafts movement, he articulated and promoted an aesthetic guided by an attachment to the past, and he encouraged his students at Harvard to revive and reinterpret English and Anglo-American models. Another characteristic of Warren's aesthetic was ""restraint,"" a quality generally attributed to the region's Puritan settlers. ""Restraint"" also meant a rejection of both the lavish ornamentation of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris and the more original styles such as Art Nouveau that were emerging at the turn of the century. Following the ideals of John Ruskin, William Morris, and later leaders of the English Arts and Crafts movement, Warren and his architect-colleagues promoted a close collaboration with the craftsmen who enhanced their buildings. The resulting building designs represent a significant contribution to the development of American Arts and Crafts architecture, complementing the proto-modern work of designers such as Frank Lloyd Wright. In fact, Arts and Crafts architecture in North America was extremely diverse. Meister examines the greater complexity of this architecture by exploring the eclectic historicism of Warren, a key figure in the movement that was centered in Boston.",Architecture,232,N/A,0,en

[ ] With Design: Reinventing Design Modes,"Gerhard Bruyns, Huaxin Wei",Springer Nature,2022-11-05,"This collection stems from the International Association of Societies of Design Research (IASDR) congress in 2021, promoting the research of design in its many fields of application. Today's design finds itself at a critical moment where the conventional ‘modes’ of doing, thinking and application are increasingly challenged by the troubled ideology of globalisation, climate change, migration patterns and the rapid restructuring of locally driven manufacturing sectors. The volume presents a selection of papers on state-of-the-art design research work. As rapid technological development has been pushing and breaking new ground in society, the broad field of design is facing many unprecedented changes. In combination with the environmental, cultural, technological, and, crucially, pandemic transitions, design at large is called to fundamentally alter its modes of practice. Beyond the conventional models of conducting research, or developing solutions to ‘wicked’ problems, the recoupling of design with different modes should be seen as an expression to embrace other capacities of thinking, criticisms and productions. This selection of proceedings papers delivers the latest insights into design from a multitude of perspectives, as reflected in the eight thematic modes of the congress ; i.e., [social] , [making] , [business] , [critical], [historical/projective], [impact], [pandemic], and [alternative] with design modes. The book benefits design researchers from both academia and industry who are interested in the latest design research results, as well as in innovative design research methods. In presenting an interesting corpus of design case studies as well as studies of design impact, this comprehensive collection is of relevance to design theorists and students, as well as scholars in related fields seeking to understand how design plays a critical role in their respective domains.",Architecture,3580,N/A,0,en

Crafting Creativity & Creating Craft,Courtney Lee Weida,Springer,2014-11-04,"This nine chapter volume explores creativity in art teaching through contemporary craft. A variety of artists, educators and historians share with readers their wealth of practical resources and frameworks for utilizing craft media (fiber, ceramics, baskets, needlepoint, knitting, etc.) and craft approaches (grassroots projects, digital communities, craftivism, etc.) within contemporary K-12 art education, museum and community programming, and teaching artist residencies. Authors representing a variety of specialties in craft, art, and education examine the resurgence of the handmade and homemade in contemporary youth culture, digital implications of how we define and teach craft creatively, and the overlap of design, function, and beauty in artists’ work. The anthology also describes the challenges and potentialities of working with craft in education settings, including the overarching craft of teaching practices. Each chapter provides a range of creative frameworks and practical models that educators can use comprehensively: from dynamic digital resources, to community groups, and lesson plans and activities in craft with art classes and special needs classes. The book serves to propose a working definition and rationale of the functions of craft in daily life, popular and youth culture, and larger social issues (including craft, D.I.Y., and activism/“craftivism”).",Education,84,N/A,0,en

Crafting Interpreters,Robert Nystrom,Genever Benning,2021-07-27,"Despite using them every day, most software engineers know little about how programming languages are designed and implemented. For many, their only experience with that corner of computer science was a terrifying ""compilers"" class that they suffered through in undergrad and tried to blot from their memory as soon as they had scribbled their last NFA to DFA conversion on the final exam. That fearsome reputation belies a field that is rich with useful techniques and not so difficult as some of its practitioners might have you believe. A better understanding of how programming languages are built will make you a stronger software engineer and teach you concepts and data structures you'll use the rest of your coding days. You might even have fun. This book teaches you everything you need to know to implement a full-featured, efficient scripting language. You'll learn both high-level concepts around parsing and semantics and gritty details like bytecode representation and garbage collection. Your brain will light up with new ideas, and your hands will get dirty and calloused. Starting from main(), you will build a language that features rich syntax, dynamic typing, garbage collection, lexical scope, first-class functions, closures, classes, and inheritance. All packed into a few thousand lines of clean, fast code that you thoroughly understand because you wrote each one yourself.",Computers,1068,N/A,0,en

Language and Popular Culture in Japan,Brian Moeran,Routledge,2010-10-18,"When this book was originally published it was the first work of its kind to examine the way in which language is used to express the ‘myth’ of advertising slogans and other popular cultural forms. By making use of general theories from the disciplines of anthropology, linguistics, media studies and semiotics, the book attempts to demystify Japanese culture as it has been hitherto presented in the West, and shows how such cultural forms as ‘noodle westerns’ and high-school baseball uphold the well-known ideologies of ‘selflessness’, ‘diligence’, ‘compliance’ and ‘co-operation’ typically associated with the Japanese. Ultimately, the book poses the question: are those whom we call the Japanese ‘real’ people in their own right, or merely a nation acting out a part written for them by Western civilisation?",Reference,225,N/A,0,en

This book centres craft as a creative industry, illuminating the experiences of those working in and around craft, particularly people from marginalised groups. Shining a light on inequalities around craft work, the author examines the lived experiences of women makers of colour in the professional craft sector. Experiences of racism and microaggressions at all stages of their craft career are analysed. The author draws on innovative empirical research carried out in the UK and Australia, two countries where the resurgence in craft is apparent, yet professional craft practice is dominated by the white and relatively privileged. In interrogating hierarchies of expertise and cultural value in craft, the author employs case studies from community crafts and social enterprises. The result is a book of interest to scholars at the intersections of the creative and cultural industries, the creative economy and inequalities at work.",Business & Economics,94,N/A,0,en

The Wor(l)ds of Neapolitan Arts and Crafts,"Raffaella Antinucci, Carolina Diglio, Maria Giovanna Petrillo",Cambridge Scholars Publishing,2019-07-19,"This collection of essays investigates the terminology of traditional Neapolitan arts and crafts analyzed from a novel linguistic and cultural perspective. With some exceptions, the trades examined in the contributions—including pizza and pastry making, the art of presepio (crib), lute-making and coral dealing, among others—still exist in Naples and in the Campania region. They represent an important component of the cultural heritage of the area that this volume brings to light by furthering current research in the fields of terminology, history and cultural anthropology. The book is divided into two sections, corresponding to the two languages in which the articles are written (English and French), although the terminological analyses also focus on Italian, Neapolitan and Spanish. This choice is expressly demanded by the political legacy of Naples, which for six centuries was alternately dominated by French, Spanish and Austrian rulers whose lasting influence on the city’s traditions and language the essays explore.",History,198,N/A,0,en

A Cultural Economic Analysis of Craft,"Anna Mignosa, Priyatej Kotipalli",Springer,2019-06-11,"Are we aware of the values of craft? In this edited volume, cultural economists, researchers and professionals provide an interdisciplinary discussion of the relevance and contribution of the craft sector to the economy, as well as to society at large. Mignosa and Kotipalli bring together contributors to compare the craft sector across countries, analysing the role of institutions, educational bodies, organisations and market structure in its evolution and perception. The Western approach to craft and its subordinate position to the arts is contrasted with the prestige of craftmanship in Eastern countries, while the differing ways that craft has attracted the attention of policy agencies, museums, designers and private institutions across regions is also analysed. This volume is vital reading to those interested in the economic features of craft and craftsmanship around the world, as well as for those interested in the importance of policy in bringing about effective sustainable development.",Business & Economics,318,N/A,0,en

Kingly Crafts,Yung-ti Li,Columbia University Press,2022-12-20,"The site of Anyang, the last capital of the Shang dynasty, dated to around 1200 to 1000 BCE, is one of the most important sources of knowledge about craft production in Bronze Age China. Excavations and research of the settlement over the past ninety years demonstrate both the advanced level of Shang craft workers and the scale and capacity of the craft industries of the time. However, materials unearthed in Anyang by different expeditions have since been stored separately in China and Taiwan, making a thorough study of this important aspect of life in Shang China challenging. Despite efforts to integrate the data based on published material, the physical evidence rarely has been considered as a single group. Through a systematic analysis of the archaeological materials available in both China and Taiwan, Yung-ti Li provides a detailed picture of craft production in Anyang and paves the way for a new understanding of how the Shang capital functioned as a metropolis. Focusing on craft-producing activities, including bronze casting, bone working, shell and marble inlay working, lithic working, and pottery production, Kingly Crafts examines the material remains, the technology, and the production organization of the craft industries. Although the level of Shang craftsmanship can be seen in the finished products, Li demonstrates that it is necessary to study workshop remains and their archaeological context to reconstruct the social and political contexts of craft production. Offering a comprehensive investigation of these remains, Kingly Crafts sheds new light on the relationships between craft industries and political authority in the late Shang period.",History,310,N/A,0,en

Malaika’s Surprise,Nadia L. Hohn,Groundwood Books Ltd,2021-03-01,"When Malaika finds out she is going to have a new baby brother or sister, she worries that her mother will forget about her. But a surprise arrives on Malaika’s birthday that gives her more reason to celebrate her family’s love. It’s summertime, and Malaika and Adèle are enjoying playing carnival in their bright costumes, dancing and laughing in the sunshine. But when Mummy announces that they will soon have a new baby brother or sister, Malaika is unsure how to feel about another change in her family. Will Mummy forget about me? Back at school, Malaika is excited to see her teacher and classmates, and makes friends with a new girl who has recently arrived from a faraway country, just like Malaika. Then on her birthday, a surprise arrives to remind Malaika of the importance of family, and the story ends with a celebration of her family’s love. Malaika’s Surprise is filled with the same warmth and charm as the first two books in the series, with Nadia L. Hohn’s enchanting prose, written in a blend of standard English and Caribbean patois, and Irene Luxbacher’s colorful collage illustrations.

Cutting for All!,Kevin L. Seligman,SIU Press,1996,"Containing 2,729 entries, Kevin L. Seligman’s bibliography concentrates on books, manuals, journals, and catalogs covering a wide range of sartorial approaches over nearly five hundred years. After a historical overview, Seligman approaches his subject chronologically, listing items by century through 1799, then by decade. In this section, he deals with works on flat patterning, draping, grading, and tailoring techniques as well as on such related topics as accessories, armor, civil costumes, clerical costumes, dressmakers’ systems, fur, gloves, leather, military uniforms, and undergarments. Seligman then devotes a section to those American and English journals published for the professional tailor and dressmaker. Here, too, he includes the related areas of fur and undergarments. A section devoted to journal articles features selected articles from costume- and noncostumerelated professional journals and periodicals. The author breaks these articles down into three categories: American, English, and other. Seligman then devotes separate sections to other related areas, providing alphabetical listings of books and professional journals for costume and dance, dolls, folk and national dress, footwear, millinery, and wigmaking and hair. A section devoted to commercial pattern companies, periodicals, and catalogs is followed by an appendix covering pattern companies, publishers, and publications. In addition to full bibliographic notation, Seligman provides a library call number and library location if that information is available. The majority of the listings are annotated. Each listing is coded for identification and cross-referencing. An author index, a title index, a subject index, and a chronological index will guide readers to the material they want. Seligman’s historical review of the development of publications on the sartorial arts, professional journals, and the commercial paper pattern industry puts the bibliographical material into context. An appendix provides a cross-reference guide for research on American and English pattern companies, publishers, and publications. Given the size and scope of the bibliography, there is no other reference work even remotely like it.",Crafts & Hobbies,380,N/A,0,en
This Little Prayer of Mine,Anthony DeStefano,Harvest House Publishers,2014-07-01,"I know you're up in heaven, God, and can hear my voice from there. I'm just a little child. Will you answer my short prayer? Bestselling author Anthony DeStefano believes that prayer is the greatest gift you can give a child. Using simple language and rhyme—written as a heartfelt prayer—this story expresses a child’s understanding of our loving, faithful God. It encourages little ones to go beyond asking God for things to trusting Him for courage when feeling afraid, joy when sad or lonely, and guidance when confused or unsure. Mark Elliott’s beautiful, photo-realistic illustrations of children in everyday situations keep young readers turning the pages to see what comes next. When the last page has been turned and the amen has been said, little ones will understand that prayer is a simple conversation with God—easy, natural, and everlasting.",Juvenile Nonfiction,39,N/A,0,en

The Organization of Craft Work,"Emma Bell, Gianluigi Mangia, Scott Taylor, Maria Laura Toraldo",Routledge,2018-08-06,"This edited book focuses on the organization and meaning of craft work in contemporary society. It considers the relationship between craft and place and how this enables the construction of a meaningful relationship with objects of production and consumption. The book explores the significance of raw materials, the relationship between the body, the crafted object and the mind, and the importance of skill, knowledge and learning in the making process. Through this, it raises important questions about the role of craft in facing future challenges by challenging the logic of globalized production and consumption. The Organization of Craft Work encompasses international analyses from the United States, France, Italy, Australia, Canada, the UK and Japan involving a diverse range of sectors, including brewing, food and wine production, clothing and shoe making, and perfumery. The book will be of interest to students and academic researchers in organization studies, marketing and consumer behaviour, business ethics, entrepreneurship, sociology of work, human resource management, cultural studies, geography, and fashion and design. In addition, the book will be of interest to practitioners and organizations with an interest in the development and promotion of craft work.

In Project Kid: Crafts That Go!, that excitement is translated into more than 60 inventive craft projects for parents to make with and for their children. The book is organized into seven chapters: City, Rails, Sky, Space, Water, Country, and Dirt. There are police cars and ice cream trucks; circus trains and submarines; helicopters, rocket ships, cement mixers, and school buses. And because the car-obsessed kid doesn’t just want a new vehicle to play with—he wants a racetrack, his very own driver’s license, maybe even a child-sized gas station—each chapter includes not only toys but also thematic clothing, decor, accessories, and more.

Rita Buonanno remembers the words exactly: ""If anything happens to me don't think it was an accident."" Helle Crafts was last seen on November 18, 1986. In the style of a brilliant detective novel, Arthur Herzog skillfully re-creates the hour-by-hour circumstantial details that inform this grisly true-crime narrative. We observe dispassionate Richard Crafts as he buys a truck with a pintle hook for towing heavy equipment, promised for delivery before November 18.

Masters of Craft,Richard E. Ocejo,Princeton University Press,2018-11-13,"In today’s new economy—in which “good” jobs are typically knowledge or technology based—many well-educated and culturally savvy young people are instead choosing to pursue traditionally low-status manual labor occupations as careers. Masters of Craft looks at the renaissance of four such trades: bartending, distilling, barbering, and butchering. In this engaging book, Richard Ocejo takes you into the lives and workplaces of these people to examine how they are transforming once-undesirable jobs into “cool” and highly specialized upscale occupations. He shows how they find meaning in these jobs by enacting a set of “cultural repertoires,” resulting in a new form of elite taste-making. Focusing on cocktail bartenders, craft distillers, upscale men’s barbers, and whole-animal butcher shop workers in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and upstate New York, Masters of Craft provides new insights into the stratification of taste, the spread of gentrification, and the evolving labor market in today’s postindustrial city.",Social Science,368,N/A,0,en

Leather Crafts,"Valerie Schafer Franklin, Geoffrey Franklin",Penguin,2016-06-14,"A big part of the artisanal/DIY movement is about authenticity and quality, with a return to simplicity, real values, genuine materials, and careful craftsmanship. Leather is one of those authentic materials, and while it has always been used for handbags and gloves, it’s also enjoying a resurgence in the field of crafts. Simple objects elegantly made of leather are featured everywhere on maker blogs, photo-sharing sites, tutorials, and craft marketplaces. Leather is in the real world, too, in heavily curated hipster boutiques and well-edited coffee shops that sell sundries. Idiot’s Guides®: Leather Crafts offers 20 projects (illustrated with copious step-by-step photos), ranging from beginner to advanced, each one building on the skills that have been taught in prior projects. Unlike most existing books on leathercraft, which come with a heavy whiff of the ‘70s, this one has a sleek, modern aesthetic.

Grace Like Scarlett,Adriel Booker,Baker Books,2018-05-01,"Though one in four pregnancies ends in loss, miscarriage is shrouded in such secrecy and stigma that the woman who experiences it often feels deeply isolated, unsure how to process her grief. Her body seems to have betrayed her. Her confidence in the goodness of God is rattled. Her loved ones don't know what to say. Her heart is broken. She may feel guilty, ashamed, angry, depressed, confused, or alone. With vulnerability and tenderness, Adriel Booker shares her own experience of three consecutive miscarriages, as well as the stories of others. She tackles complex questions about faith and suffering with sensitivity and clarity, inviting women to a place of grace, honesty, and hope in the redemptive purposes of God without offering religious clichés and pat answers. She also shares specific, practical resources, such as ways to help guide children through grief, suggestions for memorializing your baby, and advice on pregnancy after loss, as well as a special section for dads and loved ones.",Religion,214,5,1,en

The first in the Kopps Sisters Novel Series, Girl Waits with Gun is an enthralling novel based on the forgotten true story of one of the nation’s first female deputy sheriffs. Constance Kopp doesn’t quite fit the mold. She towers over most men, has no interest in marriage or domestic affairs, and has been isolated from the world since a family secret sent her and her sisters into hiding fifteen years ago. One day a belligerent and powerful silk factory owner runs down their buggy, and a dispute over damages turns into a war of bricks, bullets, and threats as he unleashes his gang on their family farm. When the sheriff enlists her help in convicting the men, Constance is forced to confront her past and defend her family — and she does it in a way that few women of 1914 would have dared.

However, as in many parts of the world, there are signs that capture fisheries are fully exploited or overfished. Management of fisheries in the region is often hampered by lack of information on the status of fisheries in terms of biological, social, economic, policy and governance aspects. This regional project documents an alarming decline on coastal fishery resources, based on historic research surveys in South and Southeast Asia. Socio-economic analyses and policy reviews highlight the importance of the fisheries sector but also the challenges facing it.

Holistic Sustainability Through Craft-Design Collaboration,Rebecca Reubens,Routledge,2019-05-07,"This book explores the intersection of craft, design and sustainability in the developing world. It argues that most sustainable design approaches and efforts fall short of implementing holistic sustainability, and in order to reach this goal, design must be underpinned by alternatives to the mainstream, technology-intensive, industrial design paradigm. Renewable materials such as bamboo, cork and hemp – which are abundantly available in the developing world – have the potential to be a viable resource base for sustainable development. Current sustainable design initiatives and approaches already recontextualize these materials using industrial techniques and technologies. However, these efforts fall short of impacting holistic sustainability and tend to focus on the ecological aspect. This book offers the development of one alternative to design for holistic sustainability, called the Rhizome Approach, which draws on existing sustainability praxis and craft. Holistic Sustainability Through Craft-Design Collaboration includes customizable tools which aim to empower designers to guide and evaluate their own designs. Through these tools, and the Rhizome Approach in general, the book aims to enable designers, and students of design, to move beyond green and sustainable design, to holistic sustainability design.",Business & Economics,277,N/A,0,en

Easy Crafts for the Insane,Kelly Williams Brown,Penguin,2021-07-06,"From the New York Times bestselling author of Adulting comes a story about how to make something when you’re capable of nothing. Kelly Williams Brown had 700 Bad Days. Her marriage collapsed, she broke three limbs in separate and unrelated incidents, her father was diagnosed with cancer, and she fell into a deep depression that ended in what could delicately be referred to as a “rest cure” at an inpatient facility. Before that, she had several very good years: she wrote a bestselling book, spoke at NASA, had a beautiful wedding, and inspired hundreds of thousands of readers to live as grown-ups in an often-screwed-up world, though these accomplishments mostly just made her feel fraudulent. One of the few things that kept her moving forward was, improbably, crafting. Not Martha Stewart–perfect crafting, either—what could be called “simple,” “accessible” or, perhaps, “rustic” creations were the joy and accomplishments she found in her worst days. To craft is to set things right in the littlest of ways; no matter how disconnected you feel, you can still fold a tiny paper star, and that’s not nothing. In Easy Crafts for the Insane, crafting tutorials serve as the backdrop of a life dissolved, then glued back together. Surprising, humane, and utterly unforgettable, this is a poignant and hysterical look at the unexpected, messy coping mechanisms we use to find ourselves again.",Biography & Autobiography,289,N/A,0,en

You will cook your own edible crafts, from a Crafty Candle Salad to Sugar Skulls, with many more recipes and craft ideas that will inspire you to create your very own hastily constructed obscure d'arts.

Conceived by seasoned researchers and educators Wayne C. Booth, Gregory G. Colomb, and Joseph M. Williams, this fundamental work explains how to find and evaluate sources, anticipate and respond to reader reservations, and integrate these pieces into an argument that stands up to reader critique. The fourth edition has been thoroughly but respectfully revised by Joseph Bizup and William T. FitzGerald. It retains the original five-part structure, as well as the sound advice of earlier editions, but reflects the way research and writing are taught and practiced today. Its chapters on finding and engaging sources now incorporate recent developments in library and Internet research, emphasizing new techniques made possible by online databases and search engines. Bizup and FitzGerald provide fresh examples and standardized terminology to clarify concepts like argument, warrant, and problem. Following the same guiding principle as earlier editions—that the skills of doing and reporting research are not just for elite students but for everyone—this new edition retains the accessible voice and direct approach that have made The Craft of Research a leader in the field of research reference.

English Arts & Crafts Furniture,Nancy R. Hiller,National Geographic Books,2018-06-26,"""Arts & Crafts"" has come to be a name for a style of decorative arts, but just try to pin it down. It's a huge challenge, because it encompasses such a broad variety of work. Early pieces, such as some of those by William Morris, draw from more ornate Victorian artifacts. Contrast these with the simpler, medieval-inspired work of Morris, the austere elegance of chairs and built-in cabinetry by Voysey, or furniture produced by the Barnsleys--never mind the clear Art Nouveau influences in much of Mackintosh's work. It quickly becomes clear just how broad this period in design history really is. English Arts & Crafts Furniture explores the Arts & Crafts movement with a unique perspective on furniture designs inspired by English Arts & Crafts designers. Through examination of details and techniques as well as projects, you'll learn what sets English Arts & Crafts apart and gain a deeper understanding of the overall Arts & Crafts movement and its influences. In this book you'll find: • Insight into the history and culture surrounding the Arts & Crafts movement • An examination of influences that set English Arts & Crafts designers including William Morris, Charles Francis Annesley Voysey, Ernest Gimson, Ernest and Sidney Barnsley, and Charles Robert Ashbee apart from their American counterparts • 3 complete furniture projects that illustrate traits representative of English Arts & Crafts: a Voysey chair, a hayrake table designed by Ernest Gimson and a sideboard design from the Harris Lebus company, England’s largest furniture maker at the time Equal parts design survey and project book, English Arts & Crafts Furniture is a must-read for any serious fan of Arts & Crafts furniture.",Design,0,N/A,0,en

Signifying Place,Sheila Gaffey,Routledge,2017-11-28,"Through a socio-semiotic analysis of promotional materials used by both producers of quality products and their support organizations, this book investigates the use of imagery, especially images of place, in three contrasting regions of Ireland. It highlights the role of place (particularly rural) imagery in the promotion of handcrafts and rural tourism services, and suggests some of the meanings which may be contacted through the use of such imagery. Much of the research to date in this field has concentrated on the use of imagery to promote particular places, rather than products and, in an Irish context, on the promotion of Ireland as a tourism destination. This book focuses on the regional and local level to examine the creation and use of more micro-place specific images - both real and mythical - by small and medium sized businesses and explores the extent to which the two industries borrow from, and feed into, firstly each other, and secondly, macro place myths and iconographies.",Science,172,N/A,0,en

In locating the artist's contribution to postwar art and her important place in the global conversations around modernity, Mónica Amor explores her intermedial practice as a model of cultural complexity at the ""edge of modernity."" In situating Gego's work alongside other local archives and against her European education and global reception, Amor offers a monographic model that complicates traditional approaches to history. She investigates the full range of Gego's work, including her furniture workshop, her teaching at schools of architecture and design, her seminal reticuláreas, and her lesser-known prints. Through rigorous archival research, formal analysis, theoretical relevance, and deep exploration of historical context, this essential book unpacks Gego's radical recasting of the modern sculptural project through her engagement with architecture, craft, and design pedagogy.",Art,288,N/A,0,en

Growth,Vaclav Smil,MIT Press,2020-12-08,"A systematic investigation of growth in nature and society, from tiny organisms to the trajectories of empires and civilizations. Growth has been both an unspoken and an explicit aim of our individual and collective striving. It governs the lives of microorganisms and galaxies; it shapes the capabilities of our extraordinarily large brains and the fortunes of our economies. Growth is manifested in annual increments of continental crust, a rising gross domestic product, a child's growth chart, the spread of cancerous cells. In this magisterial book, Vaclav Smil offers systematic investigation of growth in nature and society, from tiny organisms to the trajectories of empires and civilizations. Smil takes readers from bacterial invasions through animal metabolisms to megacities and the global economy. He begins with organisms whose mature sizes range from microscopic to enormous, looking at disease-causing microbes, the cultivation of staple crops, and human growth from infancy to adulthood. He examines the growth of energy conversions and man-made objects that enable economic activities—developments that have been essential to civilization. Finally, he looks at growth in complex systems, beginning with the growth of human populations and proceeding to the growth of cities. He considers the challenges of tracing the growth of empires and civilizations, explaining that we can chart the growth of organisms across individual and evolutionary time, but that the progress of societies and economies, not so linear, encompasses both decline and renewal. The trajectory of modern civilization, driven by competing imperatives of material growth and biospheric limits, Smil tells us, remains uncertain.",Nature,665,N/A,0,en
Russian Provincial Society,Juri Plusnin,Springer Nature,2022-06-21,"This book presents a unique analysis of modern Russian provincial society. Based on detailed empirical evidence, it develops a theoretical model of Russian provincial society in the late 20th century and the early 21st century. The book explains how under the conditions of catastrophic changes, Russian provincial societies have undergone a structural transformation. It further sheds light on the transformation of the economic behavior of the population and households with regard to economic practices, crafts, and revived archaic forms of labor behavior. Summarizing the extensive empirical evidence, the book puts forward the concept of complementarity of two social structures at the local level: a ground ""soft communal"" structure and a ""tightening with an iron hoop"" estate state structure. Next, it discusses the stability and resistance of the local social structure to external political disturbances. Based on the presented analysis, the book introduces several independent criteria on the basis of which it establishes the typology of all empirically observed forms of societies. Subsequently, the book identifies six main types of Russian provincial societies. It explains how depending on the type, the different societies either adapt to political and economic changes in different ways, stay unchanged or transform their structure. The book will appeal to students, scholars, and researchers of economics, political science, sociology, and anthropology, interested in a better understanding of transformation studies, population and household economics, provincial societies, as well as Russian societal structures.",Social Science,374,N/A,0,en

UK Business and Financial Cycles Since 1660,"Nicholas Dimsdale, Ryland Thomas",Springer Nature,2019-11-02,"This book is the first of two volumes that aim to provide an up-to-date overview of the key data and techniques necessary for analysing the historical behaviour of business and financial cycles in the United Kingdom. Drawing on an extensive secondary literature and the considerable body of historical macroeconomic and financial time series data that exist for the United Kingdom, the two volumes will review the key features of historical recessions and recoveries over the course of three and a half centuries. Volume 1 provides an overview of UK business cycles since 1660. The first part of the book considers old and new theories of the business cycle, looking at the impulses that generate business cycles and the propagation mechanisms that determine their duration and amplitude. The second part of the book uses the latest historical estimates of GDP to look at different ways of measuring and estimating business cycle fluctuations within a simple univariate framework. Finally, the book provides a narrative of UK economic fluctuations since 1660 using a whole range of economic data to shed light on the main drivers of cyclical behaviour.

Firstly, the text illustrates the broad and diverse range of issues associated with European integration, and lastly, the key approaches and findings are summarised. Since institutional integration in Europe is an ongoing process, with possibly frequent and sometimes rapid changes, the chapters are intended to focus on the key features of the economic analyses of these topics. A wide and diverse set of economic issues is of direct relevance for European integration. These topics cover various fields, ranging from the history of the European Economic and Monetary Union, EU Trade Policy and the stability of international trade, single market issues over fiscal, monetary and other policies, the crisis that faces the Euro area, and institutions such as EU Council of Ministers. Not surprisingly, many of these issues have also been analysed from a European perspective.

Competence Development and Assessment in TVET (COMET),"Felix Rauner, Lars Heinemann, Andrea Maurer, Bernd Haasler",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-07-26,"The transferability of vocational education and training qualifications across international borders is a live issue in this heterogeneous field. Key to this goal is defining a common methodology for measuring vocational competences. This publication sets out a proposal for just that, based on the results of a pilot project known as ‘COMET’ on competence diagnostics in the field of electrical engineering. The study deploys longitudinal analysis to explore issues of competence development, the development of vocational identity, and occupational commitment. It focuses on two discrete occupational profiles in electrical engineering in an ambitious test of a model currently applied to other professions as well. The model’s success in its first phase is detailed in the second part of the volume, where the authors show that the transfer of the competence framework into an empirical model was successful. They also demonstrate that the methodology can be applied to designing and evaluating vocational education and training processes, making the material relevant to VET teachers and trainers as well as academics. With its first section comprising a full description of the theoretical framework, this book is a significant step forward in an urgent task facing administrations, labor forces and employers around the world. The achievement is in proportion to the notorious complexities of a field whose diversity makes tough demands on large-scale methods of assessment.",Education,183,N/A,0,en

Unified Growth Theory,Oded Galor,Princeton University Press,2011-04-11,"For most of the vast span of human history, economic growth was all but nonexistent. Then, about two centuries ago, some nations began to emerge from this epoch of economic stagnation, experiencing sustained economic growth that led to significant increases in standards of living and profoundly altered the level and distribution of wealth, population, education, and health across the globe. The question ever since has been--why? This is the first book to put forward a unified theory of economic growth that accounts for the entire growth process, from the dawn of civilization to today. Oded Galor, who founded the field of unified growth theory, identifies the historical and prehistorical forces behind the differential transition timing from stagnation to growth and the emergence of income disparity around the world. Galor shows how the interaction between technological progress and population ultimately raised the importance of education in coping with the rapidly changing technological environment, brought about significant reduction in fertility rates, and enabled some economies to devote greater resources toward a steady increase in per capita income, paving the way for sustained economic growth. Presents a unified theory of economic growth from the dawn of civilization to today Explains the worldwide disparities in living standards and population we see today Provides a comprehensive overview of the three phases of the development process Analyzes the Malthusian theory and its empirical support Examines theories of demographic transition and their empirical significance Explores the interaction between economic development and human evolution",Business & Economics,344,N/A,0,en

Many Possible Worlds,Cameron Gordon,Springer Nature,2023-05-08,"This book provides a crosscutting interdisciplinary account of how the disintegrated, global subsistence economy circa 1800 has transformed into a global complex delivering unprecedented levels of material production and consumption. Applying major findings from economics, history/historiography, and sociology (as well as from anthropology, psychology, politics, and environmental studies), the analysis tracks the ways in which changes in ‘society’ (including social structures, values, and forces) have changed ‘individuals’ (including conceptions of race, gender, and identity) and vice versa. These changes have simultaneously homogenised and diversified societies and individuals in distinct but sometimes contradictory ways, opening up many possible worlds from an individual and group perspective. Yet, the scale and pace of change has also led to increasing existential challenges. The narrative consists of 30 chapters organized into 10 subsets of 3: one chapter on a relevant core idea; one chapter focused on historical narrative and titled after a representative year; and one chapter on a relevant associated crosscutting theme. Major regional and topical discussions are provided, with special attention paid to business and organisational change and developing world scholarship. Small discussion ‘boxes’ focusing on illustrative cases and details are presented throughout the book. The last chapter contains over-arching conclusions.",Business & Economics,1061,N/A,0,en

Minnesota 1900,Michael Conforti,University of Delaware Press,1994,"""This book examines advances in architecture, design, and painting in a region widely recognized for its contribution to the Arts and Crafts and Prairie School movements. It features the work of many well-known American artists, including the architects Cass Gilbert, Harvey Ellis, Frank Lloyd Wright, Purcell and Elmslie, ceramicist and Arts and Crafts philosopher Ernest Batchelder, and the painters Homer Dodge Martin and Alexander Fournier. The six essays also focus on the ceramic and metalwork production of the Handicraft Guild of Minneapolis, the Craftshouse of John Bradstreet, and American Indian art and artifacts created both for native and white use at the time."" ""Alan Lathrop discusses Minnesota architecture by combining his knowledge of architectural practitioners of the time with an awareness of international stylistic trends, particularly the tradition of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, in this first overview of the state's architecture of the period ever published. Michael Conforti and Jennifer Komar link the development of retailing in the late nineteenth century to the interior design practice and Arts and Crafts production of John Bradstreet. Thomas O'Sullivan provides a study of Robert Koehler, one of the region's most respected painters, while he reviews the work of over two dozen of the state's other painters working at the time."" ""The special communal nature of Minnesota's artistic life is emphasized in Marcia Anderson's contribution.

Mark Hammons provides the first monograph ever published on the architectural partnership of Purcell and Elmslie, the most commissioned architects of the Prairie School after Frank Lloyd Wright. Hammons analyzes the team-centered working process of the firm and relates their creative process and formal vocabulary to the contemporary metaphysical discourse that was the foundation of their architectural philosophy. Louise Lincoln and Paulette Molin study the nature of relationships between whites and the Chippewa and Dakota Indians in their discussion of native material culture.

Holistic Sustainability Through Craft-Design Collaboration,Rebecca Reubens,Routledge,2019-05-07,"This book explores the intersection of craft, design and sustainability in the developing world. It argues that most sustainable design approaches and efforts fall short of implementing holistic sustainability, and in order to reach this goal, design must be underpinned by alternatives to the mainstream, technology-intensive, industrial design paradigm. Renewable materials such as bamboo, cork and hemp – which are abundantly available in the developing world – have the potential to be a viable resource base for sustainable development. Current sustainable design initiatives and approaches already recontextualize these materials using industrial techniques and technologies. However, these efforts fall short of impacting holistic sustainability and tend to focus on the ecological aspect. This book offers the development of one alternative to design for holistic sustainability, called the Rhizome Approach, which draws on existing sustainability praxis and craft. Holistic Sustainability Through Craft-Design Collaboration includes customizable tools which aim to empower designers to guide and evaluate their own designs. Through these tools, and the Rhizome Approach in general, the book aims to enable designers, and students of design, to move beyond green and sustainable design, to holistic sustainability design.",Business & Economics,264,N/A,0,en

Far from demonstrating indifference, ignorance or mute acceptance in the face of repeated onslaughts of epidemic disease, the rulers and residents of English towns devised sophisticated and coherent strategies for the creation of a more salubrious environment; among the plethora of initiatives whose origins often predated the Black Death can also be found measures for the improvement of the water supply, for better food standards and for the care of the sick, both rich and poor.""--Provided by publisher.",History,450,N/A,0,en

European Integration Since the 1920s,Mark Hewitson,Oxford University Press,2024-10-14,"Brexit, populism, and Euroscepticism seem to have challenged old assumptions about European integration and raised the prospect of disintegration. This book re-examines why the European Union and its forerunners were created and investigates how and why they have changed. It links contemporary events to historical explanation, arguing that there were long-term sets of conditions, dating back to the 1920s, which pushed European governments to cooperate economically and to try to resolve their diplomatic differences. The failure of the French and German governments to create what Aristide Briand had called a 'European federal union' demonstrated both the precariousness of the enterprise and its connection to the domestic politics of European states. After 1945, the unexpected advent of a 'Cold War' and the military, diplomatic and economic presence of the United States in Europe facilitated the gradual development of habits of cooperation and institutional 'integration', but they also placed limits on European governments' activities, as did disagreements between political parties and the expectations of citizens. As a consequence, supranational bodies such as the European Commission have been accompanied - and often overshadowed - by intergovernmental institutions such as the European Council, with the EU as a whole functioning in important respects as a type of confederation. The volume addresses a series of large-scale historical questions which are integral to an understanding of the European Union. It asks how and why citizens of member states have identified with the EU; how matters of 'security' affected the development of the European Community during and after the Cold War; whether economic and social convergence have taken place, and with what consequences; and why European institutions have come to function as they have. The study is thematic, focusing on the most important aspects of European integration and explaining why member states have decided to carry out - or have consented to - the unique experiment of the European Union.",History,538,N/A,0,en

"Productivity, Technology and Economic Growth","Bart van Ark, Simon K. Kuipers, Gerard H. Kuper",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-03-09,"Productivity, Technology and Economic Growth presents a selection of recent research advances on long term economic growth. While the contributions stem from both economic history, macro- and microeconomics and the economics of innovation, all papers depart from a common viewpoint: the key factor behind long term growth is productivity, and the latter is primarily driven by technological change. Most contributions show implicitly or explicitly that technological change is at least partly dependent on growth itself. Furthermore, technology appears to interact strongly with investment in physical and human capital as well as with changes in historical, political and institutional settings. Together these papers are an up-to-date account of the remarkable convergence in theoretical and empirical work on productivity and growth over the past decades. The first part deals with the characteristics of growth regimes over longer periods, ranging from 20 years to two centuries. The next four chapters study the determinants of productivity growth and, in some cases, productivity slowdown during the last quarter of the twentieth century. The final five chapters focus on the role of technology and innovation as the key determinants of growth. Productivity, Technology and Economic Growth is, therefore, a welcome collection for academic scholars and graduate students in economics, history and related social sciences as well as for policy makers.",Business & Economics,408,N/A,0,en

"""Craft, Community and the Material Culture of Place and Politics, 19th-20th Century """,Janice Helland,Routledge,2017-07-05,"Craft practice has a rich history and remains vibrant, sustaining communities while negotiating cultures within local or international contexts. More than two centuries of industrialization have not extinguished handmade goods; rather, the broader force of industrialization has redefined and continues to define the context of creation, deployment and use of craft objects. With object study at the core, this book brings together a collection of essays that address the past and present of craft production, its use and meaning within a range of community settings from the Huron Wendat of colonial Quebec to the Girls? Friendly Society of twentieth-century England. The making of handcrafted objects has and continues to flourish despite the powerful juggernaut of global industrialization, whether inspired by a calculated refutation of industrial sameness, an essential means to sustain a cultural community under threat, or a rejection of the imposed definitions by a dominant culture. The broader effects of urbanizing, imperial and globalizing projects shape the multiple contexts of interaction and resistance that can define craft ventures through place and time. By attending to the political histories of craft objects and their makers, over the last few centuries, these essays reveal the creative persistence of various hand mediums and the material debates they represented.",Art,270,N/A,0,en

Leisure Identities and Interactions,John R. Kelly,Routledge,2019-04-25,"First published in 1983. Leisure has too often been approached as a set of activities that people do when everything important has been completed. This text provides a different analysis demonstrating the centrality of leisure to human development and to important relationships. In Leisure Identities and Interactions the author analyses leisure in the context of role changes through the life course, but also as a social context in which we work out the identities that express who we really want to be. His focus is on the kinds of leisure that are both most common and most significant face-to-face encounters, family interaction, and episodes found in the midst of our roles and routines. Varieties of leisure styles are found to be developed out of available opportunities and in relation to cultural values, but also are chosen to express and negotiate our self-definitions. Leisure is both social and existential and can best be understood in the dialectic of role expectations and decision. Kelly utilizes symbolic interaction, interpretive, and dramaturgical metaphors to develop a different sociology of leisure one that brings together the concepts of role and identity.

Psychosocial Conceptual Practice Models in Occupational Therapy,"Moses N. Ikiugu, Elizabeth A. Ciaravino",Elsevier Health Sciences,2007-01-01,"This book examines the occupational therapy paradigm (its focal viewpoint, core constructs, and values) as well as the role of complexity/chaos theory as a scientific framework for occupational therapy research and practice. Unlike other current OT texts, this book uses clinical case examples to illustrate application of proposed changes to make procedures consistent with the latest Occupational Therapy Practice Framework. The reader walks away with a clear grasp of the theoretical principles guiding his or her treatment interventions, the explanations behind those principles, and the applicable intervention for said techniques and procedures. An emphasis on clinical-reasoning skills, including information on different types of reasoning skills as well as the MAPP model of teaching helps the student and clinician translate theoretical principles into practice.The section on specific interventions addresses each of the conceptual practice models according to a consistent chapter template, which enables the reader to apply conceptual practice models in real-world contexts. Preview questions at the beginning of each chapter alert the reader to important concepts in the upcoming text.Critical analysis of the theoretical core provides suggested modifications to increase consistency with the new occupational therapy paradigm.",Medical,512,N/A,0,en

Amateur Craft,Stephen Knott,Bloomsbury Publishing,2015-08-27,"Amateur Craft provides an illuminating and historically-grounded account of amateur craft in the modern era, from 19th century Sunday painters and amateur carpenters to present day railway modellers and yarnbombers. Stephen Knott's fascinating study explores the curious and unexpected attributes of things made outside standardised models of mass production, arguing that amateur craft practice is 'differential' – a temporary moment of control over work that both departs from and informs our productive engagement with the world. Knott's discussion of the theoretical aspects of amateur craft practice is substantiated by historical case studies that cluster around the period 1850–1950. Looking back to the emergence of the modern amateur, he makes reference to contemporary art and design practice that harnesses or exploits amateur conditions of making. From Andy Warhol to Simon Starling, such artistic interest elucidates the mercurial qualities of amateur craft. Invaluable for students and researchers in art and design, contemporary craft, material culture and social history, Amateur Craft counters both the marginalisation and the glorification of amateur craft practice. It is richly illustrated with 41 images, 14 in colour, including 19th century ephemera and works of contemporary art.",Design,193,N/A,0,en
"Timothy Cook, Dancing with the Moon",Seva Frangos,Government Printing Office,2015,"Timothy Cook has been lauded as a leading contemporary Australian artist: critically acclaimed, honored with the prestigious 2012 29th Telstra National Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander Art Award, included in major exhibitions throughout Australia, and well represented in significant public and corporate collections. He has lived and worked for his entire life in a small settlement in the Tiwi Islands, in remote Indigenous Australia, deeply attached to his place. Cook is also a maverick artist: non-conformist, individualistic, original and inventive, straddling the modern and ancient with confidence. In this stunning monograph, author Seva Frangos attests to Timothy Cook's achievements, inhabiting a place and space where innovation might seem impossible against the background of tradition and ritual; where he realigns artistic and cultural boundaries and re-explores being Tiwi. These pages capture the remarkable levels of energy and emotional charge in his painting, and provide a brilliant introduction to Cook's vast body of work created over two decades in a range of media.

The raison d'etre of towns throughout the British Isles was as market places and centres of trade in an increasingly commercialised society. The comparative approach adopted here illuminates the diverging experiences of towns in the four different countries of the British Isles, but sets them within the overall context of a shared value system, where social cohesion was provided by the church. It offers a guide to students and general readers first venturing into the study of medieval urban history and provides comparative material for more experienced students of both history and the related disciplines of archaeology and historical geography.",History,168,N/A,0,en

Our Search with Socrates for Moral Truth,Gary Michael Atkinson,CUA Press,2015-09-23,"Atkinson's method is to uncover the traits necessary for a person's being qualified to examine moral issues in a capable and competent manner. In the process he also discovers features which hinder a person being a competent thinker about moral questions. The reader is guided through this search by engaging Socrates as he appears in Plato's dialogues, not merely as a historical figure, but as an interlocutor. This path proceeds without begging any questions; its argument begins with no assumptions about which moral beliefs might be true, which false, or even if moral truth exists. On the contrary, the book begins only with the supposition that there might be moral truth. And yet, by following Socrates on the attempt to ascertain its existence, the reader is brought into the realm of moral knowledge and becomes acquainted with the ideal of a genuine seeker of moral truth, an ideal which can be embraced as a guidepost to becoming a better and more fulfilled human being. --Publisher description.",Philosophy,246,N/A,0,en

Moral Reconstruction,Gaines M. Foster,Univ of North Carolina Press,2003-04-03,"Between 1865 and 1920, Congress passed laws to regulate obscenity, sexuality, divorce, gambling, and prizefighting. It forced Mormons to abandon polygamy, attacked interstate prostitution, made narcotics contraband, and stopped the manufacture and sale of alcohol. Gaines Foster explores the force behind this unprecedented federal regulation of personal morality--a combined Christian lobby. Foster analyzes the fears of appetite and avarice that led organizations such as the Women's Christian Temperance Union and the National Reform Association to call for moral legislation and examines the efforts and interconnections of the men and women who lobbied for it. His account underscores the crucial role white southerners played in the rise of moral reform after 1890. With emancipation, white southerners no longer needed to protect slavery from federal intervention, and they seized on moral legislation as a tool for controlling African Americans. Enriching our understanding of the aftermath of the Civil War and the expansion of national power, Moral Reconstruction also offers valuable insight into the link between historical and contemporary efforts to legislate morality.",History,340,N/A,0,en

In March 1999, Jean Johnson, who runs Toronto's Craft Studio at Harbourfront Centre, organized a wildly successful symposium on the state of craft in Canada. Curators, writers, critics, academics and craftspeople spoke about all aspects of craft: history, practice, theory, criticism. Taken together, these papers create a clear picture of the vibrant crafts scene in Canada. The symposium was a groundbreaking event, a first in Canada, offering to the crafts community a new depth of consideration. The book, too, is a Canadian first, and it will allow a dialogue about the academic side of the craft movement to continue.

Uniform Numbers of the NFL,John Maxymuk,McFarland,2015-02-16,"Football is a game of numbers--fourth and inches, the three-man rush, a two point conversion, first down. Even with the obvious numbers in the statistics, rules and game situations, the players' uniform numbers themselves have become part of professional football and its lore. NFL players, like modern-day gladiators, are fitted head-to-toe in protective gear, obscuring even their faces from their most loyal fans. They have become largely identifiable through their uniform numbers. You cannot conjure up Larry Csonka without seeing the number 39 crashing through the line of scrimmage, or recall Lawrence Taylor without imagining the fear his 56 inspired in opposing quarterbacks. This comprehensive reference work lists all 32 current franchises of the NFL and includes brief team histories, statistics and interesting facts. Each chapter ends with an all-time numerical roster listing the numbers 1 through 99 (in some cases beginning with 00) and everyone, from Hall-of-Famer to replacement player, who has ever worn the corresponding number for that club. Four appendices are included.",Sports & Recreation,441,N/A,0,en

A School for Unusual Girls,Kathleen Baldwin,Tor Teen,2015-05-19,"A School for Unusual Girls is the first captivating installment in the Stranje House series for young adults by award-winning author Kathleen Baldwin. #1 New York Times bestselling author Meg Cabot calls this romantic Regency adventure ""completely original and totally engrossing."" It's 1814. Napoleon is exiled on Elba. Europe is in shambles. Britain is at war on four fronts. And Stranje House, a School for Unusual Girls, has become one of Regency England's dark little secrets. The daughters of the beau monde who don't fit high society's constrictive mold are banished to Stranje House to be reformed into marriageable young ladies. Or so their parents think. In truth, Headmistress Emma Stranje, the original unusual girl, has plans for the young ladies—plans that entangle the girls in the dangerous world of spies, diplomacy, and war. After accidentally setting her father's stables on fire while performing a scientific experiment, Miss Georgiana Fitzwilliam is sent to Stranje House. But Georgie has no intention of being turned into a simpering, pudding-headed, marriageable miss. She plans to escape as soon as possible—until she meets Lord Sebastian Wyatt. Thrust together in a desperate mission to invent a new invisible ink for the English war effort, Georgie and Sebastian must find a way to work together without losing their heads—or their hearts....

Founded by John Ruskin, then put into practice by William Morris, the Arts & Crafts movement promoted revolutionary ideas in Victorian England. In the middle of the “soulless” Industrial Era, when objects were standardised, the Arts & Crafts movement proposed a return to the aesthetic at the core of production. The work of artisans and meticulous design thus became the heart of this new ideology, which influenced styles throughout the world, translating the essential ideas of Arts & Crafts into design, architecture and painting.",Art,200,N/A,0,en

Burmese Crafts,Sylvia Fraser-Lu,"Oxford University Press, USA",1994,"Craftsmen have always held an honoured place in Burmese society and have taken great pride in their creative abilities. In pre-colonial Burma, all sections of the population - from royalty to the monkhood to the common folk - used finely crafted objects in their everyday lives. Prehistoricand Historic evidence indicates that the inhabitants of Burma have been fashioning objects of beauty and utility for over 2,000 years.Buddhism over the centuries has been the prime inspiration for much of Burma's artistic endeavour. This, in combination with a thriving body of pre-Buddhist animistic beliefs, a rich oral and vernacular literature, and a love of detailed surface embellishment, have culminated in the production ofdistinctive works of art.In this work, the author introduces the reader to the scope and beauty of Burmese crafts by exploring the historical background, the foundations of Burma's artistic traditions, and the temple and pagoda arts of brick, stucco, sculpture, and painting, before embarking on a systematic survey of thedevelopment and evolution of Burma's major crafts, such as bronze and ironwork, wooden architecture, wood-carving, gold, silver, and jewellery, ceramics, lacquer, textiles and costume, books, paper, baskets, mats, and umbrellas.The author has lived and worked in Asia as a writer and educator for over twenty-five years and has written numerous articles and books about Asian arts and crafts.",Art,428,N/A,0,en

An Archaeology of Skill,Maikel H.G. Kuijpers,Routledge,2017-08-03,"Material is the mother of innovation and it is through skill that innovations are brought about. This core thesis that is developed in this book identifies skill as the linchpin of – and missing link between – studies on craft, creativity, innovation, and material culture. Through a detailed study of early bronze age axes the question is tackled of what it involves to be skilled, providing an evidence based argument about levels of skill. The unique contribution of this work is that it lays out a theoretical framework and methodology through which an empirical analysis of skill is achievable. A specific chaîne opératoire for metal axes is used that compares not only what techniques were used, but also how they were applied. A large corpus of axes is compared in terms of what skills and attention were given at the different stages of their production. The ideas developed in this book are of interest to the emerging trend of ‘material thinking’ in the human and social sciences. At the same time, it looks towards and augments the development in craft-studies, recognising the many different aspects of craft in contemporary and past societies, and the particular relationship that craftspeople have with their material. Drawing together these two distinct fields of research will stimulate (re)thinking of how to integrate production with discussions of other aspects of object biographies, and how we link arguments about value to social models.",Social Science,438,N/A,0,en

Crafts and Social Networks in Viking Towns,"Stephen P. Ashby, Søren Sindbaek",Oxbow Books,2020-02-19,"Crafting Communities explores the interface between craft, communication networks, and urbanization in Viking-age Northern Europe. Viking-period towns were the hubs of cross-cultural communication of their age, and innovations in specialized crafts provide archaeologists with some of the best evidence for studying this communication. The integrated results presented in these papers have been made possible through the sustained collaboration of a group of experts with complementary insights into individual crafts. Results emerge from recent scholarly advances in the study of artifacts and production: first, the application of new analytical techniques in artifact studies (e.g. metallographic, isotopic, and biomolecular techniques) and second, the shifted in interpretative focus of medieval artifact studies from a concern with object function to considerations of processes of production, and of the social agency of technology. Furthermore, the introduction of social network theory and actor-network theory has redirected attention toward the process of communication, and highlighted the significance of material culture in the learning and transmission of cultural knowledge, including technology. The volume brings together leading UK and Scandinavian archaeological specialists to explore crafted products and workshop-assemblages from these towns, in order to clarify how such long-range communication worked in pre-modern Northern Europe. Contributors assess the implications for our understanding of early towns and the long-term societal change catalysed by them, including the initial steps towards commercial economies. Results are analyzed in relation to social network theory, social and economic history, and models of communication, setting an agenda for further research. Crafting Communities provides a landmark statement on our knowledge of Viking-Age craft and communication",Social Science,289,N/A,0,en

Arts and Crafts Book Covers,"Malcolm Haslam, Blackwell House (Windermere, England)",Richard Dennie Publication,2012,"Before the age of the paper book jacket, publishers issued their books in cloth-covered boards, which were stamped with designs in golf leaf and color. From around 1860, artists of the Arts and Crafts movement supplied many of the best designs. Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Morris and Walter Crane led the way, and they were followed in the 1890s by Laurence Housman, Charles Ricketts and Selwyn Image, among others. Prominent Arts and Crafts architects, such as Philip Webb and C.F.A. Voysey, also designed book covers. Malcolm Haslam explores this uncharted territory, investigating not only the designs and designers, but the publishers and binders as well. He introduces some artists, little known today, whose designs filled the bookshops and bookshelves of late Victorian and Edwardian Britain, and he shows how designers in Europe and America were influenced by British book covers decorated in the Arts and Crafts style. Ninety-nine of the best covers are illustrated and described, and details are given of over fifty Arts and Crafts designers who worked in commercial book production, and their marks and monograms are shown.",Art,0,N/A,0,en

The X-Files and Philosophy,Robert Arp,Open Court Publishing,2017-04-07,"In The X-Files and Philosophy, thirty-six fearless philosophers seek for the truth which is out there, in here, at least somewhere, or (as the postmodernists claim) nowhere. One big issue is whether the weird and unexplained happenings, including the existence of entities unknown to traditional science, might really exist. And if they did, what would be the proper way to behave towards them? Some of these entities seem to flout conventional laws of nature—but perhaps we need to allow for different, as yet undiscovered, laws. If such fabulous entities really exist, what do we owe them? And if they don’t exist, why do we imagine they do? In The X-Files, regular science is represented by Scully and usually turns out to be wrong, while open-minded credulity or pseudoscience is represented by Mulder and usually turns out to be right, or at least somehow on the right track. Scully demands objective, repeatable evidence, and she usually gets it, with Mulder’s help, in astounding and unwelcome ways. What lessons should we take from the finding of The X-Files that respectable science is nearly always wrong and outrageous speculative imagination nearly always right?",Philosophy,293,N/A,0,en
"Activities, Crafts and Ideas for Boys Clubs",Robert P. Adams,Trafford Publishing,2002,"Finally there is a book that has crafts and projects that are for boys! If you are tired of cutting and gluing 'cutesy' projects, this is the book for you. Designed by a man for men and boys. No fluffy little projects, but real wood working, metal cutting, hammering-type projects. The author has worked with boys for over 25 years in settings ranging from very rural (1000 people in Gruver, TX) to inter-city boys (Waco, TX) to international boys (Honolulu, HI) These years of experiences have been distilled into the top 50 crafts and special events (ex. Pinewood Derby, Chili Cook-off, Tractor Pull, etc.) to be used for family events. Special attention is focused on getting boys to help others by the use of several projects at Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter. All of the crafts and special events have been field tested with boys and refined to be easy to use. The book is divided into eight sections: Introduction - general ideas about working with boys, getting complex projects cut odwn to the level of younger or older boys. The focus of the book is on boys in 1st - 6th grades (but most projects are great for boys in the 7th - 9th grades, because they can learn to use shop power tools). Also discussed are wood finishing, building self esteem and ministering to elderly in your community. Awards and Patches - A philosophical basis for the value of awards is presented. The names and addresses of several good places to purchase awards and patches are listed in this section. Special Events - Special Events are the heart of a great Boys club. These events involve the families. Eleven great events are detailed with suggestions for running to event, awards and were to get supplies. The events presented are: Air Combat, Bike Rodeo, Campcraft Competition, Catarmaran Competition, Catapults, Chili Cook-off, Dragsters, Pinewood Derby, Toolman Competition and Tractor Pull. Special Events Patches - Eight of the events have custom made patches that are illustrated and made available from the author. The Bike Rodeo and Pinewood Derby use patches from commercial firms (addresses listed). Crafts and Projects - The top 50 crafts and projects for boys are presented in detail. Each craft is illustrated by a photo(s) showing the completed craft. Complex crafts have full-sized plans that are present for photocopying. Each craft has an Introduction, Materials needed, Before the Meeting (cutting out the parts), and Assembly at the Meeting features. For crafts/projects that can be used for Special Events, there is a discussion on how to have an event competition. All the crafts have been 'boy tested'. You will enjoy the detailed presentation for each craft. Helping the boys to listen - This is a special section that presents the idea of using 'Story Recall Games' to keep the boys listening during the meeting. This innovative approach has resulted in boys being much more attentive while listening (or reading) a story. When they expect to play a 'story recall game' they really listen. Top 10 ways to Memorize - Many boys clubs learn Bible verses, pledge and/or mottoes during their meetings. Ten fun ways are presented to help boys learn to memorize. Try these and you will be surprised how fast boys can learn (and have fun doing it). Where To Get It - No good book on 'how to do it', would be complete without telling you 'Where to get it'. This section lists sources for all kinds of materials, crafts supplies, awards and much more. Finally the book is concluded with a cross-indexed list of the crafts by uses: Christmas Projects, Easter Gifts, Father's Day projects, Games for group competition, Games for personal use, Mother's Day projects, Projects to take home, Puzzles, Science Games and Thanksgiving Projects. So this makes it easy to find a project for your needs.",Crafts & Hobbies,122,N/A,0,en

Chamber Divers,Rachel Lance,Bedford Square Publishers,2024-06-06,"'Fascinating...a great historical military account and essential reading' John Volanthen, author of Thirteen Lives. The untold story of the D-Day scientists who changed special operations forever. On the beaches of Normandy, two summers before D-Day, the Allies attempted an all but forgotten landing. Of the nearly seven thousand Allied troops sent ashore, only a few hundred survived the terrible massacre, and the reason for the debacle was a lack of reconnaissance. The shore turned out to be impassable to tanks. The Nazis had hidden obstacles in unexpected places. The fortifications were more numerous – and deadly – than imagined. The Allies knew they needed to take the fight to Hitler on the European mainland to end the war, but they could not afford to be unprepared again. A small group of eccentric researchers, experimenting on themselves from inside pressure tanks in the middle of the London air raids, explored the deadly science needed to enable the critical reconnaissance vessels and underwater breathing apparatuses that would enable the Allies' dramatic, history-making success during the next major beach landing: D-Day.",History,384,N/A,0,en
