Integrative Body-Mind-Spirit Social Work,Mo Yee Lee,Oxford University Press,2009-03-25,"In recent years, interest in non-Western curative techniques among Americans has grown by leaps and bounds. Integrative Body-Mind-Spirit Social Work is the first book to strongly connect Western therapeutic techniques with Eastern philosophy and practices, while also providing a comprehensive and pragmatic agenda for social work, and mental health professionals. This breakthrough text, written by a cast of highly regarded researchers from both Asia and America, presents a holistic, therapeutic approach that ties Eastern philosophy and practical techniques to Western forms of therapy in order to help bring about positive, transformative changes in individuals and families.Integrative therapy focuses on the mind-body-spirit relationship, recognizes spirituality as a fundamental domain of human existence, acknowledges and utilizes the mind's power as well as the body's, and reaches beyond self-actualization or symptom reduction to broaden a perception of self that connects individuals to a larger sense of themselves and to their communities. Here, the authors provide a pragmatic, step-by-step description of assessment and treatment techniques that employ an integrative, holistic perspective. They begin by establishing the conceptual framework of integrative body-mind-spirit social work, then expertly describe, step-by-step, assessment and treatment techniques that utilize integrative and holistic perspectives. Several case studies demonstrate the approach in action, such as one with breast cancer patients who participated in body-mind-spirit and social support groups and another in which trauma survivors used meditation to get onto a path of healing. These examples provide solid empirical evidence that integrative body-mind-spirit social work is indeed a practical therapeutic approach in bringing about tangible changes in clients. The authors also discuss ethical issues and give tips for learning integrative body-mind-spirit social work.Professionals in social work, psychology, counseling, and nursing, as well as graduate students in courses on integral, alternative, or complementary clinical practice will find this a much-needed resource that complements the growing interest in alternatives to traditional Western psychotherapy.",Political Science,417,N/A,0,en

The Other Side,Dan Ginzburg,N/A,2021-09,"This is not a spiritual personal development book, it is a guide to a balanced life, where you effortlessly flow to your dreams and desires while exploring infinite happiness. When you're balanced and flowing, happiness, money, health, wealth, youth, relationships, love and success all become attainable to you with ease. It's not about doing more, but rather less. Right now, right at this moment we are being exposed to more information than ever before. It is truly a phenomenon. We live in the age of knowing anything and knowing nothing; we may feel connected to everybody and be disconnected from everyone; we may feel like we know ourselves but have no idea who we are. While all of this doesn't help us deal with life, this book does. Here is what you can expect from this book: since 2009 I have been collecting lessons taught by the most influential people of the 21st century: spiritual leaders that shaped history and the most successful individuals of the world. This content is extracted from over fifty books in spiritual and personal development, numerous courses, and over hundreds of videos from leading self-advancement influencers. I compiled everything into a tightly packed piece of work treated by my own realizations and tested by my clients who I've mentored and consulted over the years. I also included insights that helped me get through tough times in my own human experience in the hopes that you can relate. The next 180 pages incorporate practical spirituality, quantum physics, psychology, philosophy and science to deliver a different category of personal development. The structure of this book is simple. There are three parts: spirit, mind and body. Everything in those parts is written to help you accomplish two things: to let go of everything preventing you from ascending and to have a clear understanding of HOW to be eternally happy, independently of anything or anyone. The good news is you don't have to undergo intense training, do lots of work, change yourself, your place of living, your friend circle, job, hobbies, or anything else except for one thing-your perspective. All I do is invite you to see the other side. I wrote this book not because I wanted to positively influence the world; I am too small and insignificant for that. I wrote this book to positively influence just YOUR world, my friend. You picked up this book for a reason and it is probably because you want to self-improve. If you have a desire for that, you are already doing great! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. But why not do better? Why not be limitless?",Self-Help,192,N/A,0,en

He awakens readers to their role as a creator of pain and shows them how to have a pain-free identity by living fully in the present. The journey is thrilling, and along the way, the author shows how to connect to the indestructible essence of our Being, “the eternal, ever-present One Life beyond the myriad forms of life that are subject to birth and death.” Featuring a new preface by the author, this paperback shows that only after regaining awareness of Being, liberated from Mind and intensely in the Now, is there Enlightenment.","Body, Mind & Spirit",258,4,97,en

First the Spirit,Tommy Hays,Independently Published,2021-05,"From a Biblical perspective of our human nature, we are ""spirit and soul and body"" (1 Thessalonians 5:23). Understanding each dimension of our being and how each is to relate to the others, according to God's created order, is a strategic key of the Kingdom of God. Come take hold of this key that will revolutionize and revitalize your spiritual journey! Our human spirit should abide in deep communion with God's Holy Spirit. Then our human spirit-infused and led by the Holy Spirit-should direct the mind, will, and emotions of our human soul, which should manifest in the health and well-being of our human bodies.All is well with my soul when all is well with my spirit. All is well with my body when all is well with my soul. But for all to be well, we must learn to allow the Holy Spirit to correctly align our spirit and soul and body: First the spirit. Then the soul. Then the body. As we'll discover, looking more deeply into these three dimensions of our being, when we're correctly aligned with the human spirit first, we will live out our daily journey with more spiritual health and growing maturity, fulfilled with more peace and joy, walking in the wisdom of God instead of the ways of the world.In right alignment, my human spirit which is receiving my sense of guidance and discernment by abiding in communion with God's Holy Spirit, directs my soul. My soul is my mind, will, and emotions. So my spirit should direct my mind and how I think, my will and the choices I make, my emotions and how I sense and feel and experience the world around me. Then then my soul should direct my body.In right alignment, my body manifests what's going on in my soul and my soul manifests what's going on in my spirit, and my spirit manifests my abiding relationship with God's Holy Spirit. First the spirit. Then then the soul. Then the body. This is what I call ""Spiritual Alignment"" or walking out my spiritual journey as a ""Spiritual Christian."" But the trouble is that much of the time we tend to live out our daily lives in a different order than God's created order. Instead of living in right alignment, we're living out of alignment. First the soul, instead of first the spirit. First the soul. Then the spirit. Then the body. This is what I call ""Soulish Alignment"" or walking out my spiritual journey as a ""Soulish Christian."" In that wrong order, when I'm out of proper alignment, I am more ""soulish"" than ""spiritual"" and all will not be well with my soul. In the ""soulish"" alignment, I'll be driven more by my own desires in the mind, will, and emotions of my soul rather than humbling myself to be led by God's Holy Spirit directing my human spirit. When I'm in a ""soulish"" alignment, my mind will insist on my own thoughts instead of yielding to God's thoughts. My human freewill will insist on my own will instead of yielding to God's will. And my emotions will insist on driving my actions by reacting from my soul instead of responding by the leading of my spirit being led by God's Holy Spirit."" Whether my spirit is ""on top"" and in charge, directing my soul, or whether my soul is ""on top"" and in charge, suppressing my spirit, makes all the difference. And as we'll see, alignment is everything.The good news is that by the grace of God we can recognize it when we're being more ""soulish"" than ""spiritual"" and make a choice to humble our souls to come back into right alignment of spirit, soul, and body. By far, this has become one of the most revolutionary insights of my spiritual journey.And as I've shared these principles of this book through the years, I've heard so many testimonies of these simple insights becoming life-changing for men and women at all stages of their spiritual journey to Christ-like maturity. That's why I'm thrilled to share them with you!",,106,N/A,0,en
Mind/Body Integration,"S. Ancoli, Erik Peper, M. Quinn",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Biofeedback training is a research methodology and training procedure through which people can learn voluntary control over their internal physiological systems. It is a merger of mUltiple disciplines with interest deriving from many sources-from basic understanding of psychophysiology to a desire for enhanced self-awareness. The goals of biofeedback are to develop an increased awareness of relevant internal physiological functions, to establish control over these functions, to generalize control from an experimental or clinical setting to everyday life, and to focus attention on mind/body integration. Biofeedback is explored in many different settings. In the university, biofeed back equipment and applications can be found in the departments of experi mental and clinical psychology, counseling, physiology, biology, education, and the theater arts, as well as in the health service (student infirmary). Outside the university, biofeedback may be found in different departments of hospitals (such as physical medicine), private clinics, education and self-awareness groups, psychotherapy practices, and elsewhere. Its growth is still expanding, and excite ment is still rising as a result of biofeedback's demonstration that autonomic functions can be brought under voluntary control and that the long-standing arti ficial separation between mind, body, and consciousness can be disproven.",Psychology,578,N/A,0,en
Revival,Martyn Lloyd-Jones,Crossway,1987-02-01,"In every era the church needs revival—certainly today as much as ever. And in the heart of every committed Christian there is the longing for personal revival—to know the quality and depths of spiritual reality, and the presence of God in one's personal life. This was the deepest desire of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones, one of the great 20th-century Bible expositors. It was also the purpose behind this series of messages which were first given on the 100th anniversary of the Great Revival which started in Wales, and swept across England and throughout the United States and to the far corners of the world. As Dr. Lloyd-Jones recognized, it is a rare time in the history of the church when there is a great outpouring of the Holy Spirit— and a time of special interest of every Christian who longs for revival today. As Dr. J. I. Packer writes in his foreword, Dr. Lloyd-Jones believed in ""the necessity of revival—that is, a quickening divine visitation—as the only vent that can avert ultimate spiritual disaster. The thrustful urgency of the sermons in this book testifies to the depth of his conviction that without revival in the church there is really no hope for the Western world at all."" Dr. Lloyd-Jones deftly draws principles from the lives of Old and New Testament characters as well as expounding some of the great prayers of the Bible. Clearly and forcefully, he presents a masterful exposition of the circumstances accompanying revival in the past, why each generation needs it, and how it will come about today. We must come to the sovereign God, forsake our sin, and wait upon Him for this special, essential outpouring. God, bring us revival!",Religion,322,N/A,0,en

This unique, illustrated guide will help you move past negative thoughts and feelings and discover what truly matters to you. If you struggle with negative thoughts and emotions, you should know that your pain is real. No one should try to diminish it. Sometimes stuff really does suck and we have to acknowledge it.

Field Guide to the Spirit World,Susan B. Martinez,Simon and Schuster,2019-03-26,"A comprehensive examination of the many ways the spirit world affects our minds and the material plane • Provides a detailed guide to the Afterlife and its inhabitants • Reveals the spirit influence behind many mental disorders as well as psi abilities and creative genius • Includes checklists of symptoms of spirit “overshadowing,” methods from the world’s top exorcists, and instructions on how to free unwanted spirits from the material plane We are spirits housed in a body, and just as houses can be haunted, so can people. When the living succumb to dissociative states of consciousness, they become a magnet for lost but clinging spirits. Known as jinn, dybbuk, daemon, wuqabi, or simply the undead, they hover unseen on the earth plane, ready to inhabit the most suitable body available. Documenting the life of wandering spirits and their impact on vulnerable human targets, Susan Martinez offers a radical departure from the standard psychological explanations for a host of pathological behaviors--including multiple personality, autism, epilepsy, migraines, obsessive compulsive disorder, depression, schizophrenia, anxiety, PTSD, self-destructive urges, and strange outbursts--and reveals that hallucinations are often true impressions of spirit input. Martinez explains how mental health comes down to the delicate balance between self-control and spirit-control. When trauma triggers an escape response, the soul takes flight, leaving the mind susceptible to possession by discarnate entities. However, the spirit world can also bestow gifts upon those whose psyches are open, such as in the case of mediums, shamans, people who communicate with angels, and many of the world’s creative geniuses. Martinez presents “overshadowing” by spirits as a universal, cross-cultural phenomenon, documenting modern and traditional accounts as well as corroborating indigenous beliefs. She examines soul decay, soul travel both before and after death, as well as how knowledge of the spirit world can offer positive treatments for disorders like schizophrenia and autism. Providing a detailed guide to the spirit world and its inhabitants, the author offers checklists of symptoms of “overshadowing,” methods from the world’s top exorcists, and instructions on how to free spirits so they can continue their journey into the beyond--all the tools necessary to forearm us against soul snatchers and other enemies of the Light.","Body, Mind & Spirit",400,N/A,0,en

Intended Evolution,"Dongxun Zhang, Bob Zhang",Greenleaf Book Group,2015-05-05,"Discover a new outlook on the process of life—and improve your health as a result In Intended Evolution, authors Dongxun and Bob Zhang introduce a different perspective on the theory of evolution: Life is not only selected by nature but intentionally interacts with it, learning how to better its future. They explain that applying this idea to generally accepted principles of biology can have startling results in your ability to affect your own health—and even your evolution. According to the theory of intended evolution, organisms gather information through sensory experience and use that knowledge to effect change in themselves and their environments.

Endorsements ""A Handbook for Yogasana Teachers provides a lucid blending of Eastern and Western science that helps us understand the human body from both perspectives! It is a major contribution to both medicine and yoga."" Rajvi Mehta, editor, Yoga Rahasya, Mumbai ""This book is quite obviously the result of extensive thought and effort on the part of the author. It contains a wide range of information, blending present-day anatomy and physiology with knowledge of yoga from ancient texts."" Dr. Shirley Telles, Swami Vivekananda Yoga Research Foundation, Bangalore ""There is a paucity of books such as this handbook ... I liked the colorful descriptions and stories interspersed throughout."" Lois Steinberg, teacher and therapist, Iyengar Yoga Institute of Champaign-Urbana ""The book is unique in its mixture of scientific explanation and practical application ... As a practicing Iyengar teacher with no medical background, I have had little choice but to accept the words of B. K. S. and Geeta Iyengar in their description of the effects and benefits of poses ... I have had no reason to doubt them, but when teaching students with a Western mind, it helps to present them with a 'scientific reason' why."" Renata Cardinal, certified Iyengar yoga teacher, Watchung Yoga Arts Center, New Jersey ""Mel Robin's labor of love has combined his knowledge of modern anatomy and physiology and traditional yoga beliefs (mostly in the Iyengar tradition) together with personal opinion and analysis based on years of teaching and practice within this tradition. By painstakingly collecting this material together, he has done a great service to the yoga community, especially those with an interest in yoga therapy and the intersection between yoga and Western medicine."" Dr. Ruth Gilmore, faculty, Yoga Therapy Centre, London ""A Handbook for Yogasana Teachers is useful for yoga teachers and serious yoga students who wish to bridge their understanding of Western and Eastern concepts. It may help practitioners of other Eastern methods of healing find ways to explain what they are doing to Western students or clients. Western doctors who want to understand Eastern healing methods will find the book extremely beneficial.""

Book of Ki,Kōichi Tōhei,Kodansha,1976,"From the Back Cover: Everyone should realize the natural abilities we all have that enable us to pass successfully through this life. Unfortunately there are too many people who continue aimlessly along, overshadowed psychologically and physically because they are not aware of their own abilities. Such people are a great minus from their own viewpoint and from the viewpoint of society as well. The principles of ki lie in bringing to light man's natural strength and his hidden natural abilities. The author's earlier works, in which he introduced the principles of ki and aikido with mind and body coordinated, met with great response in many countries and created a demand for a still more detailed explanation of what ki really means. The present work is an answer to that demand. In the first section, while delving deeply into the principles of ki, the author gives a number of practical examples which anyone can easily follow. These examples are straight to that point, concrete and avoid abstractions such as how much power is there in spirit and the nature of feeling. The author's point is to have the reader learn the proper method of mastering the spirit and to have the spirit pervade the reader's body so that he will be able to grasp the basic meaning of ki. In part two of the book, the author gives detailed and concrete examples of how to apply the principles of ki to our daily lives. The author wishes that not only those who are in positions of leadership but also those who have physical or spiritual problems, or who do not fully realize their own abilities and strength, will learn the full meaning of ki. He also wishes that those who have learned the principles of ki will instill them in their hearts and help those around them walk a brighter and happier path.","Body, Mind & Spirit",110,N/A,0,en

One Spirit Medicine,Alberto Villoldo,Hay House,2016-09-27,"Today our minds, our emotions, our relationships, and our bodies are out of kilter. We know it, but we tend to ignore it until something brings us up short--a worrying diagnosis, a broken relationship, or simply an inability to function harmoniously in everyday life. When things are a little off, we read a self-help book. When they're really bad, we bring in oncologists to address cancer, neurologists to repair the brain, psychologists to help us understand our family of origin. But this fragmented approach to health is merely a stopgap. To truly heal, we need to return to the original recipe for wellness discovered by shamans millennia ago: One Spirit Medicine. Through One Spirit Medicine, the shamans found that they could grow a new body that allowed them to live in extraordinary health. They learned how to switch off the ""death clock"" inside every cell, and turn on the ""immortality"" genes that reside in password-protected regions of our DNA. Cancer, dementia, and heart disease were rare. The shamans of old were truly masters of prevention. Drawing on more than 25 years of experience as a medical anthropologist--as well as his own journey back from the edge of death--acclaimed shamanic teacher Alberto Villoldo shows you how to detoxify the brain and gut with superfoods, use techniques for working with our luminous energy fields to heal your body, and follow the ancient path of the medicine wheel to shed disempowering stories from the past and pave the way for rebirth. Using the principles and practices in this book, you can feel better in a few days, begin to clear your mind and heal your brain in a week, and in six weeks be on your way to a new body--one that heals rapidly, retains its youthful vitality, and keeps you connected to Spirit, to the earth, and to a renewed sense of purpose in your life.",Health & Fitness,241,N/A,0,en

A Death on Diamond Mountain,Scott Carney,Penguin,2015-03-17,"An investigative reporter explores an infamous case where an obsessive and unorthodox search for enlightenment went terribly wrong. When thirty-eight-year-old Ian Thorson died from dehydration and dysentery on a remote Arizona mountaintop in 2012, The New York Times reported the story under the headline: ""Mysterious Buddhist Retreat in the Desert Ends in a Grisly Death."" Scott Carney, a journalist and anthropologist who lived in India for six years, was struck by how Thorson’s death echoed other incidents that reflected the little-talked-about connection between intensive meditation and mental instability. Using these tragedies as a springboard, Carney explores how those who go to extremes to achieve divine revelations—and undertake it in illusory ways—can tangle with madness. He also delves into the unorthodox interpretation of Tibetan Buddhism that attracted Thorson and the bizarre teachings of its chief evangelists: Thorson’s wife, Lama Christie McNally, and her previous husband, Geshe Michael Roach, the supreme spiritual leader of Diamond Mountain University, where Thorson died. Carney unravels how the cultlike practices of McNally and Roach and the questionable circumstances surrounding Thorson’s death illuminate a uniquely American tendency to mix and match eastern religious traditions like LEGO pieces in a quest to reach an enlightened, perfected state, no matter the cost. Aided by Thorson’s private papers, along with cutting-edge neurological research that reveals the profound impact of intensive meditation on the brain and stories of miracles and black magic, sexualized rituals, and tantric rites from former Diamond Mountain acolytes, A Death on Diamond Mountain is a gripping work of investigative journalism that reveals how the path to enlightenment can be riddled with danger.",Religion,307,N/A,0,en

The Holistic Home is based on an original lifestyle concept focused on creating a dynamic, healthy, and thoughtful space within yourself and your home by combining three planes of action—mind, body, and spirit—that result in profound change. The condition of the mind affects the psychology of how you dwell: subconscious influences, decorating with intention, and allowing your emotional issues and challenges to manifest in your space. The physical aspects of your design space, such as furniture positioning, design elements, sustainability, wellness, and organization, are representative of your relationship with your body. And finally, the spirit refers to all the invisible energies within you and your home—feng shui, atmosphere, and the soul of your home.

She took this as a much-needed sign to devote the next decade of her life to research and hundreds of transformative holistic design consultations.

The Inner World of Trauma,Donald Kalsched,Routledge,2014-02-25,"Donald Kalsched explores the interior world of dream and fantasy images encountered in therapy with people who have suffered unbearable life experiences. He shows how, in an ironical twist of psychical life, the very images which are generated to defend the self can become malevolent and destructive, resulting in further trauma for the person. Why and how this happens are the questions the book sets out to answer. Drawing on detailed clinical material, the author gives special attention to the problems of addiction and psychosomatic disorder, as well as the broad topic of dissociation and its treatment. By focusing on the archaic and primitive defenses of the self he connects Jungian theory and practice with contemporary object relations theory and dissociation theory. At the same time, he shows how a Jungian understanding of the universal images of myth and folklore can illuminate treatment of the traumatised patient. Trauma is about the rupture of those developmental transitions that make life worth living. Donald Kalsched sees this as a spiritual problem as well as a psychological one and in The Inner World of Trauma he provides a compelling insight into how an inner self-care system tries to save the personal spirit.",Psychology,241,N/A,0,en
The Rebirth of the Clinic,Daniel P. Sulmasy,Georgetown University Press,2006-05-19,"The Rebirth of the Clinic begins with a bold assertion: the doctor-patient relationship is sick. Fortunately, as this engrossing book demonstrates, the damage is not irreparable. Today, patients voice their desires to be seen not just as bodies, but as whole people. Though not willing to give up scientific progress and all it has to offer, they sense the need for more. Patients want a form of medicine that can heal them in body and soul. This movement is reflected in medical school curricula, in which courses in spirituality and health care are taught alongside anatomy and physiology. But how can health care workers translate these concepts into practice? How can they strike an appropriate balance, integrating and affirming spirituality without abandoning centuries of science or unwittingly adopting pseudoscience? Physician and philosopher Daniel Sulmasy is uniquely qualified to guide readers through this terrain. At the outset of this accessible, engaging volume, he explores the nature of illness and healing, focusing on health care's rich history as a spiritual practice and on the human dignity of the patient. Combining sound theological reflection with doses of healthy skepticism, he goes on to describe empirical research on the effects of spirituality on health, including scientific studies of the healing power of prayer, emphasizing that there are reasons beyond even promising research data to attend to the souls of patients. Finally, Sulmasy devotes special attention and compassion to the care of people at the end of life, incorporating the stories of several of his patients. Throughout, the author never strays from the theme that, for physicians, attending to the spiritual needs of patients should not be a moral option, but a moral obligation. This book is an essential resource for scholars and students of medicine and medical ethics and especially medical students and health care professionals.",Medical,268,N/A,0,en

Radical Spirits,Ann Braude,Indiana University Press,2020-05-25,"“Braude has discovered a crucial link between the early feminists and the spiritualists who so captured the American imagination.” —Los Angeles Times In Radical Spirits, Ann Braude contends that the early women’s rights movement and Spiritualism went hand in hand. Her book makes a convincing argument for the importance of religion in the study of American women’s history. In this new edition, Braude discusses the impact of the book on the scholarship of the last decade and assesses the place of religion in interpretations of women’s history in general and the women’s rights movement in particular. A review of current scholarship and suggestions for further reading make it even more useful for contemporary teachers and students. “It would be hard to imagine a book that more insightfully combined gender, social, and religious history together more perfectly than Radical Spirits. Braude still speaks powerfully to unique issues of women’s creativity—spiritual as well as political—in a superb account of the controversial nineteenth-century Spiritualist movement.” —Jon Butler, Howard R.

From Science to God,Peter Russell,New World Library,2010-02-08,"From Science to God offers a crash course in the nature of reality. It is the story of Peter Russell's lifelong exploration into the nature of consciousness — how he went from being a strict atheist, studying mathematics and physics at Cambridge University, to realizing a profound personal synthesis of the mystical and scientific. Using his own tale of curiosity and exploration as the book’s backbone, Russell blends physics, psychology, and philosophy to reach a new worldview in which consciousness is a fundamental quality of creation. He shows how all the ingredients for this worldview are in place; nothing new needs to be discovered. We have only to put the pieces together and explore the new picture of reality that emerges. From Science to God is as much a personal story of an open-minded skeptic as it is a tour de force of scientific and religious paradigm shifts. Russell takes us from Galileo’s den to the lecture halls of Cambridge where he studied with Stephen Hawking. “If you had asked me then if there was a God,” says the best-selling author of his scientific beginnings, “I would have pointed to mathematics.” But no matter what empirical truths science offered Russell, one thorny question remained: How can something as immaterial as consciousness, ever arise from something as unconscious as matter?",Religion,146,4,1,en

Entertainment Values,Stephen Harrington,Springer,2017-08-14,"This collection brings together the work of a range of scholars from around the world with different perspectives on one simple question: How can we assess the value of various entertainment products and forms? Entertainment is everywhere. The industries that produce it earn billions of dollars each year and employ hundreds of thousands of people. Its pervasiveness means almost everyone has something to say about entertainment, too, whether it be our opinion on the latest Hollywood blockbuster, a new celebrity couple, or our concerns over its place in the world of politics. And yet, in spite of its significance, entertainment has too-often been dismissed with surprising ease within the academy as a ‘mindless’, ‘lowbrow’ – even ‘dangerous’ – form of culture, and therefore unworthy of serious appraisal (let alone praise).

"Language, Land and Belonging: Poetic Inquiries","Natalie Honein, Margaret McKeon",Vernon Press,2023-04-25,"This volume takes up themes emergent from the 7th International Symposium on Poetic Inquiry (ISPI) which invited participants to reflect on the United Nations Declaration of 2019 as the International Year of Indigenous Languages. In this refereed collection, Indigenous and non-Indigenous authors use poetic inquiry to explore the importance of their ancestral languages and lands, and consider the Indigenous languages and peoples of the lands where they live. Situated in diverse global contexts, poet-researchers examine the intersectionality of their languages, their lands, and their sense of belonging. They offer relational understandings of, and articulate obligations for, their environment and communities. Through stories of shared generational pain and renewal, each author brings the reader into their world of learning and growth. They do this through discourses of belonging and relational responsibilities that tie them to a place, a genealogy. As a method of study that incorporates poetry into academic research, poetic inquiry is concerned with particularity, complexity, and transformations. Making research more visceral and evocative, it invites researchers to examine and engage with the knowledge they seek through a continual process of questioning, welcoming, and awareness. In this volume, poetic inquiry helps to honor languages and histories taken for granted; it allows looking back in order to reexamine, redefine, and make sense of the present and its shortcomings while reimagining a different future. This work seeks to reclaim, through poetic inquiry, wisdom of language, land, and belonging.",Literary Criticism,224,N/A,0,en
Off the Hook,Earl Wayne Heflinger,Balboa Press,2018-03-15,"The author uses his own personal storyof being born into a Christian fundamentalist family with extreme beliefsto paint a vivid picture of what life is like in toxic ideologies such as fundamentalist religion. The book has three parts. The first describes the spiritual abuse of his childhood due to stifling rules and restrictions inflicted by his parents, caught up in their churchs teachings, on his thought processes and behavior. The remarkably poignant stories show in painful detail how his self-esteem was crushed, how he was never intended to think for himself, and how he was made to feel different and totally out of place in the worldall by loving but misguided parents. During his school days, his social life was severely stunted because he felt like an outsider everywhere but in church. The second part discusses his lifelong struggle with spiritual healing and his transition from a spoon-fed belief system to a personally chosen worldview. He thoughtfully muses about all the significant elements of religious/spiritual belief systemsGod, Jesus, the Bible, sin, morality, science, life after death, marriage, divorce, and othersand contrasts his evolving beliefs with those of organized religion. This is presented to give the reader a comprehensive illustration of how one particular seeker has constructed a personalized belief system through continual rethinking and updated understanding. The third part calls on the authors advanced education and professional experience in business and government in analyzing and developing systems and procedures. It describeswith a wealth of tips and checkliststhe process by which he escaped a toxic ideology and came to feel intellectually free and off the hook. It ends with heartfelt encouragement for anyone similarly affected by repression to accept all available helpful resources and muster the determination to claim their personal power.",Self-Help,295,N/A,0,en

Many years ago, Agnes Sanford was cured of acute depression by a minister who believed in the healing power of prayer. Subsequently, she herself became very active and successful in healing others of mental and physical ailments by drawing upon the same resources for inner well-being. In The Healing Gifts of the Spirit, she shares the simple, practicable ways of self-help she discovered, and gives step-by-step advice on how to help others. She discusses not only her own cure but also the gift of healing in general and its growing recognition in the contemporary church. She devotes a chapter to the gift of miracles, and another -- especially interesting -- to the gift of tongues. Her exploration of these topics is richly inspiring, offering readers one of the most detailed, informative discussions of the nature, dynamics, and potential rewards of these unique manifestations of God's presence. At the same time, she demonstrates how anyone can draw upon this healing power for good in the world. As evidence of how these gifts can -- and do -- reveal themselves, the author cites many examples from observation and personal encounters with the healing power of the Spirit.",Religion,228,N/A,0,en

Topics addressed include methodological processes, questions of narrative uprootedness, relational inquiry, Indigenous ethico-onto-epistemologies, storytelling, and transformative writing forms and practices.

An Indian Tantric Tradition and Its Modern Global Revival,D.E. Osto,Routledge,2020-03-06,"This book analyzes the contemporary global revival of Nondual Śaivism, a thousand-year-old medieval Hindu religious philosophy. Providing a historical overview of the seminal people and groups responsible for the revival, the book compares the tradition’s medieval Indian origins to modern forms, which are situated within distinctively contemporary religious, economic and technological contexts. The author bridges the current gap in the literature between ""insider"" (emic) and ""outsider” (etic) perspectives by examining modern Nondual Śaivism from multiple standpoints as both a critical scholar of religion and an empathetic participant-observer. The book explores modern Nondual Śaivism in relation to recent scholarly debates concerning the legitimacy of New Age consumptive spirituality, the global spiritual marketplace and the contemporary culture of narcissism. It also analyzes the dark side of the revived tradition, and investigates contemporary teachers accused of sexual abuse and illegal financial activities in relation to unique features of Nondual Śaivism’s theosophy and modern scholarship on new religious movements (NRMs) and cults. This book shows that, although Kashmir Śaivism has been adopted by certain teachers and groups to market their own brand of ""High Tantra,"" some contemporary practitioners have remained true to the system’s fundamental tenets and teach authentic (albeit modern) forms of Nondual Śaivism. This book will be of interest to academics in the fields of religion and Asian philosophies, especially South Asian, tantric, neo-tantric and yoga philosophies, alternative and New Age spiritualities, religion and consumerism, and NRMs and cults.

Chapters then debate the complexity of the ‘soul’ as a term drawing on the work of Christian mystics and philosophers, such as Teresa of Avila, Edith Stein, Merleau-Ponty, and Bakhtin, to show how their theoretical ideas can be incorporated in counseling practice and spiritual direction. The book concludes by discussing how the language of the soul can be integrated and applied in postmodern practice.

Changing Cultures of Ageing and Spirituality,"Elizabeth MacKinlay, Ann Harrington",Taylor & Francis,2023-09-12,"This book addresses important issues of ageing and spirituality and reflects on the impact of culture on both constructs. The papers are contemporary in that they include excerpts of cultural impact on spirituality from New Zealand, Singapore, India, United Kingdom, Australia and the United States. This book marks almost 20 years of international conferences on ageing and spirituality that commenced in January 2000. It opens the conversation to all who were part of this journey of ageing, including older people, practitioners in ageing and aged care, researchers, and those who reflect on the process of growing older. Chapters feature diverse perspectives, highlighting the need for inclusivity in conversations that surround ageing and recognize how development of cultures is influenced by the society where they emerge, and by minority groups within larger society. Chapters also note the occurrence of subcultures of ageing and aged care. The conference was held shortly before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the chapters being written often during times of lockdown. Their content reflects the importance of spirituality in times of isolation and can show ways of reaching out to vulnerable older people, of various faiths and cultures, whatever their situations.

People Who Don't Know They're Dead,Gary Leon Hill,Weiser Books,2005-05-24,"In People Who Don't Know They're Dead, Gary Leon Hill tells a family story of how his Uncle Wally and Aunt Ruth, Wally's sister, came to counsel dead spirits who took up residence in bodies that didn?t belong to them. And in the telling, Hill elucidates much of what we know, or think we know, about life, death, consciousness, and the meaning of the universe. When people die by accident, in violence, or maybe they're drunk, stoned, or angry, they get freeze-framed. Even if they die naturally but have no clue what to expect, they might not notice they're dead. It's frustrating to see and not be seen. It's frustrating not to know what you're supposed to do next. It's especially frustrating to be in someone else's body and think it's your own. That's if you're dead. If you're alive and that spirit has attached itself to you, well that's a whole other set of frustrations. Wally Johnston, a behavioral psychologist, first started working with a medium in the 70s to help spirits move on to the next stage. Some years after that, Ruth Johnston, an academic psychiatric nurse, who'd become interested in new consciousness and alternative healing, began working with Wally to clear spirits who weren't moving on. These hitchhikers had attached themselves to the auras of living relatives or strangers in an attempt to hold on to a physical existence they no longer need. Through her pendulum, Ruth obtains permission from the higher self of both hitchhiker and host to work with them. Then Wally speaks with them, gently but firmly, to make sure they know they are no longer welcome to inhabit the bodies and wreak havoc on the lives of the living. Hill has woven this fascinating story with the history and theory of what happens at death, with particular emphasis on the last 40 years and the work of such groundbreaking thinkers as Elmer Green, Raymond Moody, William James, Aldous Huxley, Edith Fiore, Martha Rogers, Mark Macy, Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, Bruce Lipton, and a host of others, whose work helps inform our idea of what it is to live and to die. As it turns out, our best defense against hitchhikers is to live consciously. And our best chance of doing that is by paying attention and staying open to possibilities.","Body, Mind & Spirit",193,N/A,0,en

The Answer Is . . .,Alex Trebek,Simon & Schuster,2020-07-21,"A RECOMMENDED SUMMER READ BY THE NEW YORK TIMES, USA TODAY, TIME, AND NEWSWEEK Longtime Jeopardy! host and television icon Alex Trebek reflects on his life and career. Since debuting as the host of Jeopardy! in 1984, Alex Trebek has been something like a family member to millions of television viewers, bringing entertainment and education into their homes five nights a week. Last year, he made the stunning announcement that he had been diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer. What followed was an incredible outpouring of love and kindness. Social media was flooded with messages of support, and the Jeopardy! studio received boxes of cards and letters offering guidance, encouragement, and prayers. For over three decades, Trebek had resisted countless appeals to write a book about his life. Yet he was moved so much by all the goodwill, he felt compelled to finally share his story. “I want people to know a little more about the person they have been cheering on for the past year,” he writes in The Answer Is…: Reflections on My Life. The book combines illuminating personal anecdotes with Trebek’s thoughts on a range of topics, including marriage, parenthood, education, success, spirituality, and philanthropy. Trebek also addresses the questions he gets asked most often by Jeopardy! fans, such as what prompted him to shave his signature mustache, his insights on legendary players like Ken Jennings and James Holzhauer, and his opinion of Will Ferrell’s Saturday Night Live impersonation. The book uses a novel structure inspired by Jeopardy!, with each chapter title in the form of a question, and features dozens of never-before-seen photos that candidly capture Trebek over the years. This wise, charming, and inspiring book is further evidence why Trebek has long been considered one of the most beloved and respected figures in entertainment.",Biography & Autobiography,304,N/A,0,en

Seeing Myself,Susan Blackmore,Robinson,2019-06-11,"Essential reading for anyone seeking to understand their own mind and to find a spiritual path that is compatible with science As an impressionable young student, Susan Blackmore had an intense, dramatic and life-changing experience, seeming to leave her body and travel the world. With no rational explanation for her out-of-body experience (OBE) she turned to astral projection and the paranormal, but soon despaired of finding answers. Decades later, a Swiss neurosurgeon accidentally discovered the spot in the brain that can induce OBEs and everything changed; this crucial spot is part of the brain's self-system and when disturbed so is our experience of self. Blackmore leaped back into OBE research and at last began to unravel what had happened to her. Seeing Myself describes her long quest for answers through spirituality, religion, drugs, meditation, philosophy and neuroscience. Anyone can have an OBE, indeed 15 per cent of us have. Even more have experienced sleep paralysis, lucid dreaming and the creepy sense of an invisible presence. At last, with the advent of brain stimulation, fMRI scanning and virtual reality, all these phenomena are beginning to make sense. Long relegated to the very fringes of research, the new science of out-of-body experiences is now contributing to our understanding of consciousness and our very selves.","Body, Mind & Spirit",0,N/A,0,en
